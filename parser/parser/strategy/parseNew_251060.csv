												800+ hours in Wargame Red Dragonhundreds of hours on previous wargames.This is one of the best, if not the best real time strategy ever made.Wargame has many realistic features such as: ammo, gasoline, morale, veterancy, supplies, recon, with countless possibilities and methods of securing victory, which fit nicely making this a realistic game, while not too complicated.The game has a steep learning curve, but if you want to play the best RTS out there, you have to get this game!PS: The devs care about the community and suggested changes are sometimes implemented, especially if it benefits the gameplay, or balance, while staying as close to realism as possible.

												Wargame: Red Dragon, despite its bare-bones naval combat, is the greatest Wargame to date. It is difficult to write a review in a traditional manner with this game as it has depth akin to a black hole, so I'm just going to list down in-depth pro-cons of this fantastic, fun game.~PROS:1. -  This game is  far  more accessible than most folks give it credit to.  The controls are not convoluted, nor do things have unnecessary functionalities or five thousand menus to grind through to complete simple tasks. This game is complex in the best possible way for a game of its caliber; the depth of its combat.This strength makes the game an extremely enjoyable experience as none of it is bogged down by simulation-esque frivolities. Mechanically it is somewhat similar to games like StarCraft (this isn't  Harpoon  or  Jane's Fleet Command ), although the scale is increased one-hundred fold. The game is complicated only in that it requires not only knowledge of units and their roles, but also quick-thinking and problem solving. The learning curve is steep but I'll be damned if I didn't say I had a blast getting to the point where I could consistently win matches.2. -  This is any political/military nut's dream.  There is a reason why much of its consistent playerbase is made up of people from /pol/ (don't let that intimidate you, the community is leagues better than most skill-based RTSs). You can simulate any ""What If"" scenario using countries like the People's Republic of China and North Korea all the way down to nations such as Norway and Sweden. And the game's compelling campaign missions simulate this also; what if the U.K. had not peacefully given back Hong Kong, and had to defend against waves of PLA tanks? You can do everything from sending Navy SEALs behind enemy lines to destroy Soviet command structures to launching massive armored offensives using the latest modern equipment. And it is all (mostly) pinpoint accurate.3. -  The game is well-built, diverse and reliable.  They aren't kidding when they say  ""1,450 units that have been meticulously reproduced from their source!""  There are maps ranging from suburban sprawls to massive tracts of forest prime for special forces operations, using anything from Polish commandos to Czechoslovakian airborne. If you find the game enjoyable it is difficult to get away from, as there is so much content to explore and master. Every unit has an easy reference-sheet that you can view at any time, and all of them (save for PACT/NATO copies of Soviet/American equipment) have unique stats. Some countries have more options than others, but that is only to maintain realistic integrity. You cannot expect Norway to have a better military than the United States, but that doesn't mean they wont have superior niche units such as special forces. Countries like Poland and Czechoslovakia recently were balanced in a patch, making them up to snuff with everyone, so you can likely expect more free DLC patches to the other nations as well. Not only that, but this game is incredibly resistant to technical issues. I have not crashed once in all my hours of playing (this always varies with different machines, though, but I've but this game through hell and its always been fine). Your experience will rarely be interrupted.4. -  Deckbuilding is EXTREMELY enjoyable.  I've spent half of the time in this game making decks. It may just be personal preference, but because of the thousand+ units, you can find yourself sinking a lot of time into this; not out of necessity, but simply to create fun and personalized armies.Those are my major PROs. Now I believe I should address the hindrances to the gameplay here.~CONS:1. -  Naval combat is easily the weakest part of the game.  It is painful saying that, honestly, but that is the truth. It is horribly imbalanced, inaccurate and barebones compared to every other part of the game, and this is especially true in NATO's case, but I'll get to that later.Combat revolves around three principles which usually do not interact with eachother whatsoever; you either mass missile-heavy ships and launch them all at the same time at another blob of ships hoping to get through its CIWS guns, mass low-cost ships and rush them at lower numbers of expensive ships to stun them with cannonfire, or mass aircraft and do the same thing mentioned with the first option. It makes for a very uninspired and boring experience, and although it  somewhat  resembles small-unit naval combat well, beyond that it is entirely inaccurate. There are no submarines, nor aircraft carriers, no exciting fringe ships such as Soviet battleships. You get a very thin selection of classes which makes large engagements very stale.The worst part of this feature is that it is terribly imbalanced in favor of PACT. Most of NATO's ships are comprised of Japanese ships, with occasional exceptions. The flagship of NATO is some ship I've never heard of called a ""Kongo."" No Ticonderoga or Arleigh Burke's here, folks. Just awful surface ships with inaccurately-modeled weapons (harpoons can't hit anything!). This is in vast contrast to Soviet ships which outclass them in nearly every category; superior accuracy, firepower, durability, range, etc. Their flagships are the popular Udaloy/Sovremenny class destroyers, which are infinitely more famous than the Kongo.Riverboats can be fun (the napalm Minotaur can torch vast swatches of riverland in fire, the SHMEL can launch hundreds of missiles) but are ultimately uninspired as they, too, revolve around massing and throwing at the enemy.2. -  Frustration comes easy at times.  Games drag on, especially if you're losing. Comebacks happen often but many times the case comes down to you being dominated for half an hour, and it makes this game a huge time sinkhole. You learn slowly and losses can be draining once you feel you've gotten better at the game than before; it takes constitution to get to a point where the shoe is on the other foot. It is difficult to be carried in this game as well, since it usually comes down to whatever team is best coordinated wins. This is not always the case, as skill is definitely involved and one person on a team can slaughter half the enemy's army through shrewd positioning, but that's an ""If.""~PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION: Yes.  If you have an interest in modern military combat, or even if you just like a fun and deep RTS, this is the game for you. I adore it for all of the reasons above, and I think the pros vastly outweigh the cons with this gem of a title. If you can spare the cash and you like the concept, go for it. You won't be disappointed.			"

												Got into the closed beta for my dedication to the series, and was not disappointed at all. China could use a little buff considering the fact that the game is called Red Dragon after all, and half of China's within time frame units have been questionably ommitted. Naval warfare could use a little tweaking as well, because its implementation was poor at first. However the upcoming naval patch notes look extremely promising.In terms of improvement over the AirlandBattle, this game has done it all. Land battles are now far more realistic, intense, and tactical thanks to some of the revolutionary changes that Eugen has made in map design, pace, and terrain. Indeed, this game has taken the openness and unlimited tactical/strategic opportunities that were the trademark of W:EE, and combined them with the ferocity that was characteristic of W:AB battles.But overall, from my many hours of closed beta testing, this is the ultimate culmination of the awesome Wargame series. The enormous scale, realistic terrain, and the unlimited tactical, operational and even strategic options that this glorious game provides has never ceased to amaze me. Indeed, this is any amateur wargamer's/armchair general's (like myself) wet dream, and I would fully recommend this to anyone seeking an immersive, immense, and ultimately fulfilling historical/military experience.I wish I had the Mad Money guy's bullish button to press right now...BUY BUY BUY			"

												I am not a good reviewer, but since I clocked in so many hours of Gameplay into that title, I try my best to tell you, why I would recommend this title.The amount of units is astonishing, Over 1000 ""different"" units can be choosen in your decks. Many different nations are avaibable and these use their representing units of the ""cold war era"". You build decks with a set of ""cards"", which are the units you are using, showing you their stats and quirks. I probably took the most time of the game in building said decks, trying to achieve the best outcome of my units. There are no ""best""-decks just better ones, but even these don't always succeed, because of the different playstyles you can use. I advice every newcomer to play either the campain or skirmish at the start. The Multiplayer-community can be toxic at times, so watch out. Many people are helpful, but some aren't, don't get yourself overly upset about that. I also advice to watch some youtube-videos of let's play, to get a feeling how that game actually plays, it may not be your liking. Read guides and ask many questions, until you get the grip of the game.Even deckbuilding can be very complicated at first, but ask around in the forum, or other players (like me) what to use or what not to use.The game is extremly fun when you got good teammates to play with. Even Solo it has its good moments. All in all a good title to sink in many hours either building decks or playing around (or for some just chatting in the wargame-chat). Very good value if you can grab it in the next sale. I would even pay the full price (again), consindering the hours I clocked in.Thanks for reading!			"

												I'm surprised that I still haven't written a review of this game yet.It's a great game; in my opinion the most polished Wargame of the series. Although European Escalation has the superior campaign. Scripted campaigns (European Escalation) are a lot more fun to play than a sandbox-y campaign where you play against an extremely predictable AI on rezoned multiplayer maps (AirLand Battle and Red Dragon).Wargame's always been an RTS with greater focus on force composition and positioning rather than micromanagement. Deathballing that you typically see in Starcraft/Command and Conquer does not work here. Your forces have to be spread out, ready to support eachother, and be able to take their objectives on the map.The force you deploy in multiplayer is your ""deck"", which you build not unlike decks in popular card games such as Hearthstone. Select an alliance/coalition/nation, create a deck with logistics, infantry, support, aircraft, navy, tanks, and the like and deploy that deck in battle. Since the game uses a deck system, like the cards in a real life deck of cards you're limited in the number of units you can deploy. Try not to lose both your Su-27PU's in one go.The game also places emphasis on logistics, which I have never before seen in an RTS game. All units have health, fuel value, and ammo value for EVERY weapon (including coaxial machine guns). You must sustain your forces through a well maintained logistics line. Supplies are also limited (and the amount of supply you have depends on how much supply units you've included in your deck) so use sparingly.Combat is fairly realistic. Engagement ranges seem more plausible than in traditional RTS games (where a marine can only see and fire up to 10 feet in front of him).The game is extremely well optimized; I was able to run it at a steady 40-60 FPS on a laptop that could only use Intel integrated graphics (albiet on medium settings). You can zoom all the way out so that you can see the entire map and your units icons, or zoom all the way in to see combat from a footman's perspective.The naval portion is a bit gimmicky. Sure, sometimes it's fun to play with ships but the combat is not nearly as exciting or engaging as land/air combat. However, amphibious land units does open up more tactical options since you're not 100% restricted to crossing bridges or chokepoints.As a Cold War history buff, having access to over 1400+ real life units from over a multitude of countries spanning North America, Europe, and Asia is extremely exciting as well. Even now I'm still overwhelmed at how many variants of Abrams tanks there are (M1 Abrams, M1IP Abrams, M1A1 Abrams, M1A1HA Abrams, M1A1HC Abrams, M1A2 Abrams).I don't play this game as much nowadays, but only because I've played it almost exclusively for the past few years and it feels slightly stale to me now (although I do get on every now and then). Wargame: Red Dragon is one of the few games I've bought that has kept me entertained for so long.A warning: this game is not meant for everyone.			"

WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!In this astounding masterpiece of RTS games, you can control many of the major military powers on earth. I have participated in the closed beta and was granted access for being dedicated to this ground-breaking series from Wargame: European Escalation to Wargame: AirLand Battle; Wargame: Red Dragon is set to be the greatest modern military strategy games of all time. With access to nearly 1500 units at your command on land, sea, and in the air; the methods of your attack and defense are limitless.The terrain is so gorgeous and vibrant that it will make one hesitate before calling in an artillery or napalm strike and desolate the area. The dynamic campaign is something to salivate over and you will even be able to simulate a battle between the two Koreas and see who will be the last nation standing. Play as the Soviet Union versus the United States and find out if you have what it takes to sink the enemy fleet to the bottom, pluck the feathers of their air force, and fire the last shot to claim your victory.With so much to say about this great game, check out some gameplay here...

												One of the best strategy titles ever released. An otherwise perfect game dragged down It's by subpar naval and horrible community. The Wargame series is unique in that it takes away some of the more tedious aspects of RTS games such as base building and resource gathering, but still manages to be more complex and harder to play than most RTS titles.The scale of this game can be truly staggering, even for veteran players. Even the smallest of maps will divide your forces between two or three fronts, and having a good unit composition (which is key to winning any RTS game) requires combining a lot of different unit types to support each other. You won't be able to win by simply spamming one or even a few types of units. Positioning and logistics are key, even the heaviest armored tank will die like a ♥♥♥♥♥ if hit from the rear and It doesn't really matter how powerful your units' weapons are if they're out of ammo and panicked.Another feature that sets Wargame apart is the deck building. You're spoiled for choice when it comes to units. With over 1500 units between 17 countries and 7 deck types, you're bound to go up against a bunch of really interesting armies while playing. Objectively weaker nations are given more unit availability, ensuring they stay viable and each nation has their own unique playstyle; UK being the slow moving juggernaut while nations like France hit hard and stay mobile. With the addition of national coalitions to all of this, there's an amazing amount of strategic depth just in nation choices themselves.Ultimately, this is a game that heavily rewards common sense and intelligent play, if you simply attack move your units without a care in the world, you will get obliterated. This is likely the source of a lot of complaining that the game is ""unbalanced"", ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t"" or just ""too hard'. I can honestly say that most people I've met who complain about balance talk about the game more than they play it. Spam Artillery? Your opponent will simply fast move into your sectors and destroy you. Forgot to take AA? Enjoy watching your entire army get massacred by a few helicopters.The game does, however, suffer from a pretty horrible community. Most people seem unnecessarily rude and are so impatient that about 50 people join and leave lobbies before a game can actually get going. The naval aspect of the game is so barebones and poorly balanced that I almost never play naval maps. This is by no means an easy game to get into, but once you get rolling; It's one of the most rewarding experiences you'll have.			"

												For prospective buyers, here's what you need to know:ProsThe game features a great number of nationalities, etc that are rarely (if ever) included in games with this sort of setting. Countries such as France, Canada, Norway, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and North Korea are fully playable with their own pallet of men and material to work with. The introduction of the Coalition deck type, which allows you to build your own army of units drawing from a pool of two or more countries, allows nations deemed to be 'minor' to join forces and in many cases become more relevant than the period giants of the United States and the Soviet Union.Red Dragon maintains the playable nations and features of the previous titles. The setting being moved to Asia really just means they've added new nations, and the maps available for multiplayer have shifted to that setting, as well as a time line bump into 1991 for non-prototype units.The units are acceptably rendered. Save for some model and texture nitpicks for grognards and military enthusiasts (ERA tiles in the wrong place, etc) the graphics are overall pleasant.While the ranges of weapon systems represented in the game are by no means realistic, they are still measured in thousands of meters.If you liked World in Conflict, this is the closest thing to a spiritual sequel you will have access to.ConsYou may notice that in the above, I didn't mention the much-advertised naval component. Roughly 50% of this game's seling point, the naval game is completely botched. It's a sloppy mess with no direction, where the prime strategy is to huddle up your ships and pray that their combined CIWS can shoot down incoming missiles. There is no witty maneuvering involved. In multiplayer games, few players bother with the naval maps. And whose who do find an imbalanced implimentation where ComBlock ships objectively trounce NATO vessels every time due to more powerful anti-shipping missiles and better CIWS scores. Eugen is supposedly going to address these issues, but it has been over half a year.Multiplayer community is measured in the hundreds, rather than the thousands one might expect from other genres. RTS games tend to struggle if it's not Starcraft or Company of Heroes. Because the game has boiled down to its hardcore online community, public games tend to be with people who are extremely experienced with the mechanics that will obliterate a new player without the new player having a chance to learn anything. This is definately a game to play with friends, unless you're an RTS pro or a masochist.Modding support is on the low end of the spectrum. Modders can edit unit code and behavior, but there will be no mapping.Previous titles in the franchise, I feel, had better maps.OverallI would recommend this game to anyone who has a passion for this era in history and 'what if' scenarios. There is an upcoming (free) DLC worth of content which may or may not address some of the cons I pointed out above. The relative scale of the game is something we don't get to see very often and promises a unique experience. Because the developers are planning to move on to a different franchise after development for Red Dragon ends, there is no fear of this game becoming 'obsolete' in a matter of months.			"

												Pros:+Great developers constantly update the game years after release. +An intimate community (but not exactly warm).+Well priced, goes on sale often, can make a great gift.+Extremely well optomized.+Able to play with players around the world, +200 ping? No problem, game will often still run smoothly for all players.+Deck building gives you somethng to do when you have nothing else to do.+Varied maps and units allow for any style of play, albeit some mor viable than others.+Looks beautiful even on a medium-range PC.+Free maps every few months.+Warchat is /pol/+In depth gameplay+Micro is not king+Traditional military strategies can be implemented.+Warfare is realistic enough to immerse the player in the games setting while being balanced.+Campaigns are really interesting.+After losing immersion of the game I quickly learned the game was better than I first thought.+Can be equally approached as a great RTS or decent Cold-war simulator.+Multiplayer is very rewarding.+Playing with friends is very rewarding,+Over a thousand units to use and learn.Cons:-Warchat is /pol/-Game tends to crash once every 12 hours or so.-AI is terrible.-Campaigns lost their magic once I learned the game mechanics.-The immersion of the game was lost upon me once I learned how to play.-Multiplayer buffs affect campaign making them harder/easier.-Cheesy tactics do exist in the game.-The community, being older and developed, can lead to problems of unspoken rules, team-stacking, cheesing etc.-Naval warfare is a general dissapointment.Things to note:-Nvidia graphics cards have been problematic recently.-This game has a steep learning curve. Visit /r/wargame and /r/wargamebootcamp if you get stuck.-Some DLC nations are better than others.-Wargame takes time, like WoW, Dota, or LoL, you need to invest a decent bit of time into the game just to learn how to play.Overall this is a great game. Just note it is not a 1 to 1 simulator of the real world. If you are new to the Wargame series, get someone to help! Like playing your first paradox game, you will need someone to help or someone to watch in order to understand what is going on and how to go about it. Other than the steep learning curve, not much seems to put off the players from loving the game. I and many others find ourselves sinking time into this game year-round and with the Finland and Yugoslavian armies being added now is a better time than ever to hop in and learn the game while the community learns the new factions.

												Outstanding quality RTS that any military nut would enjoy.  Will also stress out your grey matter, too.  If you aren't familiar with the Wargame series, it's a borderline strategic simulator more than an RTS. No base building, no real resources (besides point income from holding sectors), and every unit has morale, health, ammo, and fuel that needs to be tended to carefully with supply lines.  The scale is unlike what most other games in the genre offer.  It reminds me almost of the original Supreme Commander in terms of sher volume of units on the field and map size.  Every unit you take into battle will never come back alive once destroyed, and you need to make your own decks of units to take into battle, which is almost a kind of game in itself...finding the right unit combos or roles to take.  One of the major reasons I recommend this game is because of that.The army variety and unit selection is also awe inspiring.  You can pick from about 1,500 units, all modeled correctly to their real counterpart and act like the real one too.  Nations to build from include the US, Canada, France, UK, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Russia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, China, and Best Korea (I mean North Korea).  There's an army for everyone's taste and they all feel and play unique.Naval battles need some work and balancing, though, but it also may be just the nature of modern warfare on the ocean.  It revolves around who makes the biggest ship blob and has the best radar gattling gun screen to stop incomming cruise missiles.  Overall if you wanna work your brain a little in an RTS and focus entirely on the war and not the bases/economy, this is the thing for you.			"

												I would have to classify Wargame as my favorite RTS of all time. Here is my rundown of the game.You will like this game if you enjoy battles that depend upon knowledge, tactics, and force composition for victory. You will enjoy this game if you dont like base building or economy management in an rts and prefer to focus on gaining territory and destroying enemy units. You will enjoy this game if you like a mostly realistic approach to war, including logistical supply lines, reconnaisance, artillery, and aerial attack that are lacking or understated in most rts games.You will not like this game if you feel base building and economy are essential to rts games. You will not like this game if you want a simple rts. You will not like this game if you like micromanagement of units and twitchy gameplay like in a starcraft game.Now here are some need to know things. The game's tutorial sucks. Go watch some youtube tutorials and gameplay videos to learn better. 1-2 games watched should be enough to learn the basics of how to play. That leads into the second thing. Mastering this will take time, and the learning curve is steep for 2 reasons. Knowledge of the differences in the units in this game is critical to long term success, and identifying whether the T72 variant shooting at you is a 50 point cheap tank or a 150 point expensive tank is very important. This means that learning what all the different stats for each weapon type mean is important to know the capabilities of a given friendly or enemy unit, and then to know what capabilities of the hundreds of units in the game have based on that. This isnt extremely complicated, as there are several weapon types even if the individual weapons are different damage values, but it is time consuming to learn and memorize this. This is the steep learning curve mentioned in several reviews for this game. But what it does mean is that those who persevere through early losses as they familiarize themselves with the game are rewarded with a deep and satisfying strategy title that emphasizes combat itself and knowledge of the enemy to gain victory.Now lets get to deck building. As there is no base building or economy to speak of in the game, you army is determined before you enter battle, when you build a deck. Every army has a certain amount of points it have total and every unit you put in the deck counts against that point total. It is important to look at unit composition and strategy at this point, but dont worry - even veteran wargame players routinely adjust their deck compositions for maximum effectiveness, and you should expect no less as a newbie. The deck builder is where you go to look at the stats for all the units and it really helps out with learning the game before and after a match to look up a unit that did well against you to see why it did well.Last but not least, visit the eugen forums and also ask players in the chat for advice. There are trolls, true, but there are also people who will help out with any questions you have despite how stupidly childish and amusing the chat may seem (i enjoy just watching the chat sometimes, its really funny).Overall, I give the game a 10/10 because I have never played an rts this much, or liked one this much, since command and conquer generals and the first starcraft. And now I cant go back to those because this is so much better.			"

The GameThe premise of the game is to play on Korean War, and for conflict between Western bloc and Eastern bloc on East Asia. The primary addition of this release is naval warfare, instead of just air and land battle that has been covered in previous series. This release will also (realistically) adds new units to all nations, as years shift to 1990 era. Like in previous series, Wargame series focus on ""combined-arms"" approach, where tactics and strategies are required, as just simply roll out your best tanks will only see them turned into scraps in a space of few minutes. Like in Wargame series, there are no base building, the only building you would have is the FOB (Forward Operating Base).Before the battle, you are given option to compose a ""deck"" of units. Each unit have limitations and advantages. For example, you could bring out newest US armor, the US M1A2 Abrams, but you could only field 2 of them in the battle, and it costs a lot. Or you could bring out M8 AGS tank, it is weaker than Abrams, but you could field more of them, and is more cheaper. You could also set the focus and the theme of your deck. You could focus your deck on Soviet Union units, where you could only field Soviet Union units but be able to field prototype Soviet Union units. You could also focus on the type of your deck. For example, you could focus your deck theme on ""Airborne"", where you get bonus of deployment to helicopters and aircrafts, but may not be able to field some type of units. The battles are fought in standard RTS mode. The game uses ""true line-of-sight"" where trees and buildings could block your vision and your firing solution, creating tactics to hide in the forest, hide in urban areas, etc. Because of this feature, scouting before advancing is really important, so that your tanks did not run into enemy soldiers with anti-tank weapons, or small vehicles with anti-tank missiles. As usual, tanks are the king of open field battles, where their guns and armours could be really beneficial. In the urban areas, it is the areas where infantry and special forces, like SPESTNAZ and Green Beret shine. Aircrafts are fast, but can be shot down by SAMs if they are not careful. Some aircrafts have better counter-measures than the others, allowing greater risk to be taken. On the other hand, careless SAM, who kept their radar on at all times, will also falls prey to SEAD (Suppresion of Enemy Aircraft Defenses) aircrafts, who uses the radar electromagnetic pulse to target the SAM system.ObservationsImportant gameplay features and observations:Complex GamesAs outlined above, tactics, mixed arms approach, and fluid tactics are required. There are no units that are truly superior, each unit have weakness that could be exploited. Even in some circumstances, units that usually can't defeat other units could do that. Helicopters could wreak havoc on tanks that are open terrain, but if the helicopter gets close to a tank without detecting the tank, the machine guns on tank could do shot down a helicopter.Lots of UnitsThis is quite clear. Each nation is unique, each faction is unique. For example, as historically accurate, the Scandinavian nation don't possess much armor, but possess a lot of mechanized units. US and Soviet Union, as superpowers, have extensive choice of units. The Soviets, as their armor tactic, is focusing on superior armor and ability of their armor to destroy other armor, hence a lot of Soviet units and tanks could fire anti tank missiles. On the other hand, focus their armor strategies on mobility, thus US tanks have better stabilizers to better fire on the move. Soviet choppers are focusing on gunship choppers like the Hind that can mete out huge punishment and took a lot of damage without failing. The US choppers on the other hand focus on mobility, optics, and more accurate AT missile. Each nation have unique units, each nation have different tactics.Naval WarfareThe naval warfare, on the other hand, have some limitation on units. All naval units on this game is not tied into a particular nation. For example, the US could use a Kongo-class ship, which is obviously not a US ship but a Japanese ship. In some maps, there could be naval and land-air warfare, but there are some exclusive maps that only allows naval and air units. Naval battles are fought with anti-ship missiles, that could be launched by smaller crafts, helicopters, ships, and aircrafts. Interestingly, bigger ships have CIWS to stop missile, thus modern ships that have modern CIWS like Russian ships need to be overwhelmed with missiles. MultiplayerThere is nothing special in the multiplayer. I find it interesting, you could play in 10v10 map. There are people who despises newbies, though they are usual but I find them in bigger numbers in this game. Though honestly, most of the ""newbie-haters"" hates newbies because newbies sometimes don't want to listen. Most of the newbies mistake in this game are using too much artilleries, consuming a lot of team supplies (it is limited) and uses aircrafts without thinking.Look and FeelThe unit looks great, sound great. The maps theme of South Korean and East Asia are great, but we do need maps that represent Europe, as in previous games. The units are richly detailed, a very distinctive. You could find out subtle differences in M11P and M1A1 Abrams. Same tanks, different series. If you compare distinctively different units, like T-90 to T-55, you would see clear differences.Final VerdictA great game that should be played for all RTS lovers.			"

												It's a bit late for a proper review but why not. Overview	 If you know the series, Red Dragon doesn't really change much. Take ALB and add a few more countries and more units. A few more maps. A dubious artillery buff, to say the least. And there you go.If you don't know the series, well... Get it now. Especially if you are even remotely interested in military or real time strategy. Specifics	 The main thing that Red Dragon purports to innovate from the previous series iterations is naval combat. It's a great idea on paper but of difficult execution, and unfortunately Eugen didn't pull it off. The ideas of amphibious invasions, maritme support, and even straight out naval battle are all exciting. But somehow it doesn't deliver. The scale is wrong, the balance is off, the tactics are not right, and the naval gameplay is down right terrible. You won't even find multiplayer games for naval battles. On the positive side, it is a somewhat cool novelty for the single player campaign -- with the caveat that if you are focusing on the campaign you are missing out in what makes this game great: Multiplayer. The one cool innovation though is amphibious units in a small scale. You're able to cross rivers with APCs and such. That's applicable to many maps and it does change the gameplay, giving access to more areas of the map and changing the dynamics around bridges and water. Unfortunately, don't expect to run water-dedicated units.The maps are improved. There are a few new ones of course, and in general they are more varied. They have a more rugged terrain which is better than ALBs and much better than EE's flatlands, Where there are larger hills in RD they are more accessible, especially for infantry. The down side of it is that the number of maps is rather small. If you play quite a bit you'll quite soon find yourself thinking ""oh no, not this map again"". It's a shame, really, as a large number of maps could add so much to replayability. If Eugen can't deliver it I can't help but think how much this game would benefit from the Steam workshop for player-made maps, or anything of the sort. Unfortunately I don't think it'll ever happen.The community has its problems too, especially if you are looking for pickup games. Pub-stomping is widespread, and a huge problem of playing with randoms is the rage-quitting. It happens more in bigger matches (and especially with 10v10) but it does happen in smaller ones too. Your team mate starts out with 2 expensive jets, flies them into enemy territory and gets them all shot down, and since he lost so many points he immediately quits 30 seconds into the match leaving the team seriously jeopardized. That's the norm rather than an exception, quite unfortunately.The solution for that is the same as for many games: Try to play with people you trust. It's not hard to find people online to play with, so do it. Lastly in terms of gameplay is the artillery buff. I have to say I hate it. Arty in ALB worked just fine but apparently too many people complained it was not lethal enough. No, let me rephrase it: People who didn't know how to use artillery said it was useless. Unfortunately Eugene listened and now arty is a sniping machine that can pin-point kill units across the map.To start with that irks me because it's unrealistic as♥♥♥♥♥♥/b>. Yeah, I know. Wargame is not meant to be realistic anyway. But it's nice if it has at least some resemblance. The purpose of artillery in the battlefield is not to shred whole armies to pieces with every salvo. Its uses are to affect morale, to wear out and injure, and to majorly suppress whole areas of effect. Shelling is quite the annoyance but it doesn't cause major casualties to dug in units, not even to infantry. But in Red Dragon, one salvo will destroy numerous units and you'll snipe even armoured vehicles with surprising ease.Its effects on gameplay are double-sided. On the one hand this buff could be a good thing to deny the opportunity to do trench warfare. You have to be on the move frequently for if you stop an arty salvo will come and destroy a lot of what you have. Giving you incentives to move is not a bad thing. Bad players will invest too much on arty (since it's so powered) so you can just steamrole their defenses and keep moving. The bad thing is that some matches risk turning into a  shell flinging contest between the two sides and that's as dull as it goes. Shame.As for the rest, graphics are absolutely fantastic although you won't be seeing their best part most of the time since you'll be zoomed out to better control your troops. But it's cool to, every once in a while, zoom in close to the battle and see your troops on the ground. Plus it's a great feature for the replays. The controls are simple and effective, if only a bit demanding on the side of micro-management of some units. I'd prefer some options other RTS titles have such as ""skirmish"" with which your troops will keep a safe distance from the enemy by themselves. In Wargame you have to tell your troops everything and they'll act as lemmings. The sounds are there: Not great but they do their job, although if you are a sound freak you'll likely find them lacking.One very last thing is that the tutorials and whatnot are ridiculously lacking. Red Dragon is not friendly to new players. But since European Escalation and Airland Battle go on sales often, some times for as little of £1, it might be useful to pick one of those up for doing the tutorials alone. Conclusion	 There are to reasons why you shouldn't pick this game up: If you have played EE or ALB and haven't liked it (because RD is more of the same, with small tweaks), or if you are certain the genre doesn't interest you. Anything else and this is a must-have, especially if you can get to play with friends. Just try to do the great tutorials available in the previous titles and/or watch some youtube videos with the basic dos and don'ts.			"

												A very challenging and rewarding RTS. This is probably one of the best RTS' ever made. It has definitely been one of my favourite gaming experiences of all time. 10/10 The Good + Multiplayer is fun, and good enough to keep things competitive (there has been a laudable level of commitement by the developers to keep the game balanced, although the general sense is that it isn't perfect but pretty darn close).+ Build 'decks' from over 1500 different units, based on real-world models.+ Use real-world tactics to win! Feigned retreats, ambushes, combined offensives - this is absolutely awesome!+ The dev has brought out several free DLC's adding new units, coalitions, and maps. The Bad - Naval combat was a real selling point for this game originally, but it was never well regarded by the community and has been practically abandoned.- The AI is pretty stupid in skirmishes, but multiplayer is where you want to be anyway. The Ugly ~ The learning curve is steep, but definitely worth it! (check out SandyGunfox's 200-page guide to Wargame before you even load the game)~ You'll want to find people to communicate and play with - if you're going solo with random teams you will get railed every single time!~ I haven't played the campaign...

												Ahh where to begin. Well, this certainly isn't your average RTS. Far from it in fact. This is frankly the kind of strategy game I've been hoping to see for over ten years. Now, I have heard some say that you really need to be a military or cold war history enthusiast in order to appreciate Wargame. I may be biased as I have studied military weapon systems since I was a little kid, but I have to disagree. From the standpoint of an RTS game, I believe it is unmatched and I will give some reasons why.It’s actually a bit difficult to compare to other games... see with many RTS games you're building your base, having little skirmishes toward the beginning to gain unit experience, with the ultimate goal of massing units for a big push. With Wargame, there is no base building... it is all actual military maneuvers, weapon system knowledge, use of cover and concealment both for survivability and ambush, use of recon to spot enemy units for more combat oriented units, gaining Line of Sight (LOS) prior to and maintaining it during engagements (more difficult than it sounds), use of support systems such as Artillery, AAA, and SAMs to provide cover for advancing infantry and armored units, use of special forces infantry to wreak havoc behind enemy lines, capitalizing on terrain features to enable better LOS, spreading out of units so that a single airstrike won't eliminate half your assault force... but not so thin that they cannot cover each other. At the beginning of a match, there is usually a push to gain strategic positions (which supply reinforcement points) and dig in, then using recon to find gaps in enemy defenses and pushing through, encircling the enemy and/or simply cutting off their supply routes and territories. So... Wargame really is an interesting combination, it’s slow like a chess game at times... and then in a matter of literally seconds it can turn into a massive brawl.In multi-player, which is really the heart of the game, it utilizes a ""Deck"" system where you will pick and choose what units you wish to deploy into battle not terribly dissimilar to the Total War series of games. Thinking of it like a deck of cards, each one can only field a certain number of units... and once they're gone... they're gone. More advanced or higher trained units will mean that you will only be able to field a very limited number of them, making highly specialized extremely advanced Decks very difficult to play with as EVERY unit loss is a major one... but if you are very careful, and very clever, you can win.Bringing more units into battle requires reinforcement points, which are gained by capturing strategic points on the map. While this system will sound familiar, it plays out differently than in most RTS games in that not just any unit can capture and hold a point. In fact, a single insignificant and vulnerable command jeep or other ""CP"" unit can capture and hold a point. If the enemy discovers this command unit, then you are just one artillery or air strike away from losing the point and having to bring forward another CP unit to secure it again.Another system worth mentioning is support via supply trucks and helicopters. Every unit can run out of ammunition, and any unit utilizing a combustion engine will run out of fuel. The only way to keep your units in the fight is to resupply them utilizing cargo transports. These supply units are very vulnerable... they have no defensive weapon systems, and little to no armor. Special Forces units can ambush and capture enemy supply units, so if your enemy is pounding you with a constant barrage of weapons fire... chances are there is a major resupply operation in progress and if you can disrupt that, you can deal a crippling blow to your adversary. With resupply made impossible, your opponent's constant spam of shells and bullets will render his units helplessly dry on ammunition... easy targets.Air forces are a big part of the game. Frankly a single well executed air strike can shut down an entire assault, and force your opponent into a defensive posture... but that is not to say that attacks from the air are TOO powerful. In fact, aerial units are very easy to shoot down, very expensive, and fixed wing aircraft can only fly for a short period of time before they have to bug out due to low fuel. Jets can also be particularly difficult to utilize effectively because most of the time the enemy will cover their ground forces with AAA and SAM units. However, in the off chance your opponent miscalculates or sends his forces in with little to no cover... responding with a couple A-10 Warthogs along with fighter cover and witnessing the destruction they are capable of is truly mezmerizing.Now, I haven't messed around so much with the naval aspect introduced in Red Dragon... but there are some balance issues and tweaking to be made there. However, for ground forces, the game is amazing, made even more so through the use of amphibious units. Your opponent think that you're helpless against his wall of tanks overlooking the lone bridge in the area? Not a problem, send in a group of amphibious tanks or anti-tank missile equipped vehicles to traverse the river around the flank and put fire into the sides of the aforementioned problem. Did I mention that all vehicles, armor, helicopters have differing top, front, back, and side armor levels? Tank armor is usually very strong to the front, and weaker in the rear or side... makes flanking maneuvers or ambushes on unsuspecting armored units quite devastating.In closing, the learning curve is high, the 1300 units is daunting to think about, and the pacing may not be what everyone is looking for. It can be very slow and almost chess-like at times, and then turn into a firefight with unrivaled intensity. If you're looking for a unique blend of game and simulation, that you could play for years and still learn new things, it's tough to beat Wargame.			"

												So as of writing I've played this game almost 1200H, so I know what I'm talking about. Learning curve:There is a significant learning curve and it will take a bit of time to get good at this game. First you might think that buying lots of tanks and spamming them in a frontal attack onto the enemy is a good idea, later realizing you didn't account for the enemy having larger firing range on their tank's guns. Also since they where defending they probably also where hidden in the terrain or otherwise taking advantage of it. This is something you will learn, by doing these tactical mistakes. Hell I've made lots of them. Learning the reasons why you made the mistakes can usually be found out fairly intuitively or easily. For example, you can take note of the tank model your enemy used when you charged at him/her, then look up the specs of that tank compared to yours.Play style & Team play:There are many ways to win a match. Usually you have an limited amount of currency to buy stuff with and you have to go strong on Anti-Air capability, but weaker on Infantry support or similar. If your opponent then goes with Armored offensive capability and you gambled he would not do so, then you  might lose the game because you can't negate his strengths or exploit his weakness. This becomes much more complicated in big 10vs10 matches, where teamwork will be absolute key, instead of points of a individual player. All this, allows you to develop play styles that fits you and your strategic & tactical thinking best. I like to play with motorized decks, since they provide usually enough of everything, while providing benefits in areas where I'm good at and allows me the most flexibility when adapting to changes in the battle situation.One important factor in team play is marking the zones that you are going to be responsible for, so you signal to your teammates that they should go somewhere else. This way you avoid critical game starting mistakes, like leaving a zone or flank open, from where the enemy can pour in and attack you in the back. There are still MANY experienced players that haven't understood this fact, a good team  however can cope with this fast and neutralize the threat, but 90+% of the times this is not the case.			"

												I bought the tripple pack with.  first time player, as a friend recomended it to me from steam.  We used to love Command and conquer and any RTS and FPS games really.   This game owns all thought because you just dont build 100 tanks and spam your enemy.  You actually have to use tactical movements to engague your enemy.  if you rush, you will die! for the price this game is deffinity worth it.  I am just now sure how ive missed out and not heard about them when they first came out. SO the game is VERY detailed with stats.  there are like 50 countries to choose from or combine forces. All the units replicate real life vehicles and names and mimic their capacitys as best as possible to ballance the game.   Vehicles range from I think 50s-90s.    AMMO and GAS are used out in the battle feild and require you to bring in heavy supplies from your base.  It was a little weird at first getting used to but adds to the realism.    sure Multi player does have its problems, Artillary spam..  but as with ANY unit in the game,   there is always a way to counter it with another unit.   there are lots of hills, trees and small cities with 2 story houses in the game..  ALL units require a real life style line of sight to engage enemey units.    This game is like a war simulator.  At the start of a multi player match you can have up to i think 6vs6 that you host yourself.   if you want up to 10vs10 you have to host a linux server.  But there are others you can join in on. You start the game off with a certain amount of tickets lets just say 2000, a Jet can cost 150,  while crappy tanks are 50 and the best are 180.  and you gain spending tickets by gaining territories, Which some give you a +2 if they are close to your base, and +7 which are the ones in the middle that are hard to capture.  again there are SOOO many vehicles in the game.. I think everything that was every made is in the game.  There are like 6+ Abram tanks to choose from,  and the same goes with all other vehicle types.  Logistics - Infantry - Support - Tanks - Recon - misc. Vehicles - Helo - Air - NavyUnits all have different visual ranges,  Infantry units in forrest are hard to  spot while tanks are easier etc etc.  VERY VERY Detailed game.  a+ to the creators			"

												This review may not please the multiplayer only/PvP players in the crowd but I thought I would write up a review from the perspective of someone who mostly only plays single player (campaign, skirmish) or co-op with friends against the AI. This review is in no way implying that single player is somehow more important than anything else objectively, just that it is personally one of my primary concerns.  With that disclaimer out of the way, let's get down to it.   Wargame: Red Dragon is probably the worst iteration of the series when it comes to single player. All the major elements like a vast selection of units and interesting maps are there but the AI is not just bad, it is pretty much the worst AI I have ever seen. For example, if you give the AI a deck with a single selection of T-55's, a single selection of BMP's, and perhaps a single selection of Mi-8's, they will first send every T-55, then when you blow them up, they will rush you with BMP's, when you blow them all up, they will send Mi-8's. There is not a whole lot of actual tactics or nuance on display (even when compared to the AI of prior Wargame titles) and the single player just becomes boring at best and annoying at worst.   The other issue for single player/co-op types is the perhaps over-zealous amount of deck balancing that has happend since the game first came out. While I am sure all the different unit ""cards"" are very balanced and make for solid competitive style play, the arbitrarily limited, nerfed, and buffed unit cards make for rather stale single player. It makes me wish that they had taken a play from Men of War's book and offered a lot of options to make it good for either single player types or multiplayer types. That way everyone could have been happy and nobody (single player focused folks like myself) would get left out in the cold.  If you are a PvP multiplayer focused gamer, this is going to be a good purchase but if you are looking for solid single player content, you should perhaps move on to other titles in the series or other RTS's entirely. To be blunt, Eugen might as well have not even bothered with single player considering how obviously ignored it was.			"

												Wargame is a gateway drug. It's like weed. You may think it's bad, may think it looks bad from its difficulty, or just don't like it anyways. But all your cool friends say it's great and you should try it. So, you being curious, you decide to try it to fit in more with your friends. Turns out that it's better - much better than you expected it to be, and you want more. You say you'll only do it once a month, but that turns into once a week, which turns into once a day, which develops into an addictive death trap. Even if you're a newbie to it you still do it since it's so damn addictive.You do it more. Do it alone. Do it with friends. Do it with strangers. You can never stop; saying ""5 more minutes"" soon turns into 5 more hours. Once you get the hang of it, you start experimenting more with other things - things that will make your little gateway drug of a Wargame look like a vitamin gummy. Your friend shows you one such thing. It's some strange pill in an orange bottle called ""Israel DLC"" that's supposedly way better than the Wargame you've been smoking. Pretty soon you've devolved into some froze vegetative zombie state like someone dependent on Opium. You start taking risks, challenging other people, and, worst of all, you cheat. You troll. The warchat - previously the area where all the other junkies like you gathered, has self-destructed into a hotspot of hatred and vice. Your whole personality has changed  just by taking that one choice - something that'll haunt you for the rest of your life. And even if you quit, it'll still haunt you forever.Take my word for it. I was a Wargame addict for some time - I quit a while back, and I've limited the toxicity coming into my system. I still do it, even if it's wrong, because it feels so right. Every waking hour on this planet I'm thinking of Wargame. It is my only love, and my only life. Nothing can change that. Even as I write this review, I can still hear the voices of my troops, calling out my name for their next objective. I still see rows and rows of tanks on the roads to certain doom, just so that they can satisfy me. And- oh god.. The artillery. The MRLS... The apaches... All those units, all those points gone in an instant, for what? Fame? Bragging rights? Money?I'm going to have to leave now. My army calls me. I leave you with this message: Don't be like me. Don't be the guy sitting on his♥♥♥♥♥writing reviews for a video game for humorous effect. Don't overdose so much on Wargame. Go outside and ride a bike or something. I'm Gucci Gilgamesh, and I approve this message.			"

												I love the concept of Real Time Strategy games, but am too damned old to play StarCraft or any RTS that comes close to the APM needed to keep up. Wargame delivers a beautiful RTS, at a pace I can keep up with, using units that I grew up reading about as a Cold War kid. What more could I ask for?The learning curve is a little on the steep side, and there is definitely room for improvement on the interface front (selecting units, looking at the status of things, etc) but these are all aspects that you get used to with time. Are you on the edge of considering a purchase? Just buy it, you won't regret it, *if* you heed this one piece of advice:Learn how to use your recon units first and foremost. Most people get frustrated because they never see the enemy before their units start to die. This is because they can't see the enemy, because they're not using their Recon units appropriately. Playing recon takes a little getting used to, but once you have it down, it opens up the rest of the game.			"

												Developer Eugen takes the RTS genre to a cold war gone hot. Gone is the concept of base building, and resource management. WG:RD introduces players to a realistic RTS unlike anything seen before. No longer will players contend with Actions Per Minute, but rather with tactics, units, and teamwork. With a blistering amount of units (1500+) they've managed to capture the most minute, and accurate features of nearly every unit.  Players will find themselves lost in the sheer number of statiscal difference while attempting to create the perfect army. The complex task of ""deck building"" becomes simplifed by a restrictions and bonuses. The more you limit your military the more you have available. Graphically speaking WG:RD shines above almost all RTSs on the market. With almost painstaking authentic  detail to units it's a shame to realize they are only utulized when fully zoomed in. The games scale makes it impractical to play any attention more than what's needed. Although WG:RD is a shining example of the RTS genere; it does fall short with it's limited maps, and often sidelined naval battles. You'll easily find yourself playing the same maps time after time. Not necessarily a bad thing when you have 17 nations to choose from, and more FREE DLC along the wayWargame: Red Dragon is an armchair generals wet dream. Pick it up today.			"

												Community is literally garbage.  I have hundreds of hours in all wargame titles, my victory ratio in EE and ALB is 60%.  I'm not even mad, and I'm saying the community is terrible.I mean, if you're the type of person who likes to sit in teamspeak and flirt with your clanmates, then this title might touch you in all the right ways.But if you're a normal person, it's just a headache.  These clan-oriented people basically stack the nato half of lobbies, then wait, sometimes for hours, until noobs fill the pact team.  I'm not even exaggerating, they WILL NOT switch and balance the lobby: they will WAIT until the pact team fills with noobs who don't understand what's happening.Oh, then after crushing a team with 5 hours played combined -- they all act like they're really cool and good.Game itself -- 8/10.Game + playerbase -- 3/10.

												The first Wargames was pretty awesome, totally new.  The second Wargames introduced some interesting stuff, but really could be best described as ""now with airplanes!""Red Dragon of all the series is least functional.  It had a half-hearted ""navy"" layer added that was so comically broken that it was more or less left unchanged after it was terminally broken in the beta.  There's such a lack of focus, while there's thousands of units, only maybe a few dozen are actually relevant, and frequently they're represented by marginal quality models clearly done by the lowest bidder.  Worse, the developer itself refuses to change models that are 100% wrong, or entirely substandard quality because someone on their forums hurt their feelings once.Please note the last statement is entirely 100% true.  They call the no-updated-models thing the ""UGBEAR"" policy after said poster.In terms of gameplay it goes more or less like the following:1. Single Player:Terrible.  It's your more or less bog standard skirmish maps arrayed in a sequence, with a tissue paper thin ""strategic"" level.  The AI is frankly too moron to do anything but ""drive towards things!"" which it will do with gusto.  The key to any mission is successfully destroying whatever blob the AI has summoned forth before it destroys whatever much smaller blob you were allocated for the mission is destroyed.Then pair this with some really stupid choices in terms of campaign design (Fact: Did you know South Korea's defense hinges on French and German intervention?), and just how many damned times you'll fight on the same map, doing the same thing, with the same units against the same total lack of objectives except ""DESTOY TANKS,"" and it's really quite telling how few folks play singleplayer more than a few missions.Which is rather a shame, the campaigns in the first Wargame were quite well put together, challenging missions with a wide variety of objectives and terrain.  Additional caveats:a. This is the least Asian game to be set in Asia since video games were made.  You basically have two terrain types, Europe with Pagodas, or the American Southwest with Pagodas.  These two terrain types represent everything from the Russian far-east, to Tokyo.  b. Again, despite being a game oriented on events in Asia, most of the effort went into making the European countries in game larger and more full of  weirdo stuff that never actually reached service.  The Asian factions, the ones that you would think would command some attention in a game called ""Red Dragon"" are very poorly realized and hardly worth playing.  The Chinese forces are a curious mix of equipment China never had, and total exclusion of several key systems they used extensively, the Anzac formations are pure crap, and the North Korean force, which arguably are pretty central to a game that spends so much time in Korea are....terrible.  Not gameplay terrible, but poorly researched, poorly realized, and ultimately best skipped.2. MultiplayerThe best way to describe it is whatever broken cheesy tactic of the month on a loop.  MRLS type rockets are powerful this week?  STANDBY FOR ROCKET SWARMS ALL MATCH AND NOTHING ELSE.  Super-cheap planes spammed out?  It's going to be raining planes for a few days.  Somehow crappy bottom tier infantry becomes way too cost effective?  Waves of mans for forever.You'll note a recoccuring theme.  It's not even like ""the heavy tank shuffle!"" or some other weird tactic just works really well.  From the first Wargame, to the last most of your games start with a spammy spam rush or artillery spam and end with same.  It's all right if you're playing with a friend, or folks you know aren't douches.  But public matches are an exercise in pulling your own teeth out.  Which ties into a few subtopics on multiplayer:a. There's only a handful of ""good"" maps, which is to say, ones that are not broken/unbalanced etc.  And you'll play on all those maps within the first day of playing the game more than once.  It gets old, fast.b. Many of the maps are...boring.  Like imagine a flat open field.  Put a river through it.  Add some trees.  CONGRATS!  I just described several of the maps you'll be playing on.   3. Eugen is a terrible company.Here's things they do okay:+You do not have to pay for any of their DLC.+Wargames EE was pretty good!+As far as I can tell, none of them are terrorists.Here's things that make them marginal-They do not deliver on promised features, and then lie/have really bad excuses why it's your fault those features do not exist.  Examples:    a. Red Dragon was promised to have sufficent ships to fully flesh out the smaller combatants of all the factions that had Navies.  This is several times over not the case.  If you want to play Naval stuff (which you shouldn't do anyway because its pretty terrible), as NATO your force is an all nations dreamteam of Japanese, French....and really skip the American and British stuff because it's not like either of those countries had Navies anyway (and are represented by a bad frigate and a not really used in number missile boat, and a terrible frigate respectively).    b. A map pack was promised with the last major patch.  It was claimed the maps were being withheld because...well either to give the dev team more time to work on fixing a HUGE exploit that went more or less un-fixed for a month or so, or because we're sinners and don't deserve maps I guess?  Either way the maps have never showed up, and asking about them on the game's forums will get you either banned, or at the least the thread locked without comment.    c. Think of it like this.  You know those Twilight Zone episodes, where the guy finds a Genie in a lamp, and he gets his wishes, but the wishes are some jacked up terrible version of what he wished for?  That's Eugen in a nutshell.  Folks who played mostly US forces were concerned that oddly enough, despite the USAF being the largest air force in the world, is having some major issues with air to air combat.  Eugen's fix to this was to add in the PATRIOT missile system, which did not fix the US's lackluster air to air capabilities, but did totally break the rest of the air force part of the game as now there was a SAM site that could shoot down things over half the map.  Broken part broken, and new game breaking element added in for giggles.-Their community manager is pretty much the biggest troll on their forums.  You have a problem with how things are balanced? Honhonhon, you watch too many movies.  You say something unkind about France?  He's going to be insulting as he can get away with, and then get you banned if you say so much as anything but stating a devout love of froglegs and terrible movies full of ennui.- Things stay broken for reasons known only to God.  You can shoot down helicopters in this game with artillery.  Like seriously, here's Mr. Helicopter hovering along, and OH NO INDIRECT FIRE! helicopter is dead.  This is stupid.  This is also the reality of the game since the first one.  This has never been fixed, or addressed.  This is also but one of several brokey broke features that have remained with Wargames since 2011 or so.  You get some vague answer about ""the engine cannot handle it"" but that's a bit like saying the Ford Pinto is designed in a way that causes it to catch fire, so drive safe! vs fixing it when you make a new one.I really could go on.  I'm still annoyed enough when I see this game on my list though to finally write this review.  This really is not the game for you.  If you want a good RTS, there's plenty of better ones out there.  If you want a good cold war game?  God avoid this mess, it's pretty much like if Tom Clancy was french and mildly mentally handicapped version of the cold war.  If you want realism, this game is just as much not for you.  Perhaps you could instead try a nice game of chess?			"

												It's not garbage or anything but there's too much emphasis on artillery and helicopters. The game tends to devolve into a shower of DPICM and heavy rockets landing on any attempts to make maneuvers on the ground followed by the inevitable assault helicopter sweep that ends the round. Airland Battle had much more tactical complexity since you couldn't just obliterate any movement with the sort of artillery barrage the would make the WWII Red Army proud. The constant pounding makes air defense in any sort of concerted way, pretty much impossible and that opens the door for helicopters, lots of helicopters. The avilability of attack helicopters and their low price has always been a bit odd in Wargame titles but now that maintaining air defense is tough and their abilities in terms of aiming and firing on the move have been beefed up, it's gotten surreal. It's not uncommon to see dozens of attack helicopters wipe out entire teams.The artillery is also kind of sad for the game because it makes loads of new and pretty cool looking vehicles worthless. Basically only tanks  are worth using because everything else gets pounded into porridge as soon as it takes a shot.The other issues:1. Naval combat just doesn't work. I think the engine could handle it reasonably well but the scale is way off so it just feels strange on maps that are mixed. There are also balance issues. I think the notion was to give RED surface fleets and BLU airpower each an edge, but instead RED surface fleets dominate any BLU fleet (their faster, longer range, and more powerful missiles blow apart even the best BLU ships often before they ever get a shot off)  and have no defense whatsoever against BLU aircraft (you only get two fighters in the Naval section with enough range to counter incoming BLU attack aircraft and these are easy prey for F-14s).2. They made it extra easy to stack the lobbies.This has always been an issue but it's been maximized now that you can see other players' stats from the lobby with ease. You pretty much always know which side is going to win and so the multiplayer is full of half empty lobbies, despite having 5x the players as ALB it's just about as hard to find a game.What is really needed is a system for lobbies that asigns random (or better yet, equaized by level) and binding team selections. It doesn't need to be mandatory but it should be something a host can set so the sides have a better chance of winning.3. Balance is titlted in favor of BLUIt's not impossible to win with RED by any means but Eugen themselves admit BLU wins around 50% of matches. Given that 10-15% of games end in ties, BLU is probably 25-35% more likely to win. It certainly feels this way in practice. usually with BLU I find I can romp to an easy victory while scraping out a tiny lead with RED is an accomplishment. Airland Battle worked out much better fort balance and either side could crush the other in the right hands.I think the reason for this is that in earlier titles new players generally took NATO (because they saw some disco channel special on how the M1A1 is invincible) and were beaten by more experienced players on Pact teams (since fewer new players were willing to play as those commie scum). This led to a lot of whining and the result is a title where subtle little changes favor BLU and add up to a pretty substantial advantage.4. Infantry combat remains problematicAirland battle has a rather serious issue where flamethrower infantry eat everything else for lunch. The most hardened special forces soldiers are often wiped out to a man by conscripts with cans of gasoline strapped to their backs. To their credit Eugen has tried to address that here but it hasn't really worked. Flamethrowers are a lot less powerful but now the basic infantry units are as well. An entire platoon of standard infantry can be wiped out by a squad of special forces who run across an open field for hundreds of meters under assault rifle and machinegun fire, charge into the block holding the enemy platoon, and kill them all in CQC. Additionally, because they are so much faster, they can avoid at least some of the artillery pounding while the regulars simply get vaporized. The result is you rarely see much in the way of regular infantry units and special forces troops are vastly overrepresented.5. Too many high-level assets with uneven distribution.The US gets a Patriot battery but the Soviets don't get their long range S-300 systems. There are F-117s providing close air support but no TU-22Ms for naval strikes. There are ATACMS and Long Lance tactical missiles for BLUFOR but no SCUD or FROG-7 for REDFOR. Overall it's just a bit irritating.All in all this could be a decent game but it's got a bunch of little flaws that mean it can't keep up with its predecessor when it comes to providing a fun, engaging experience.

												Got called a noob as I died for the honor of muddah Russia10/10 Drank vodka and weptThis game has one of the steepest learning curves in existence. Expect that you will probably still not be pro after 100 hours of gameplay. However, in those n00by 100 hours, you enjoy it all. This game is beautiful, the maps, units, everything is very detailed. There is a wide variety of units, but the allocation is kinda uneven, leading to overpowered countrys and weaker nations. Although this is realistic, the developer does a good job attempting to balance things out.

I then had to figure out whether to take them in Ural trucks or Hind gunships, then whether I wanted the A model Hinds with lots of infantry support rockets or the D model Hinds with racks of anti-tank guided missiles.Two seconds later an F-16 flies over and blows the Hind to pieces, sending my poor GRU operators to tumble to the ground 300 feet blow and splatter against the pavement and the East German APCs they were supposed to be covering.

												Currently my Favourite RTS (played all C&C series)played all the wargame titles in the series.A lot more thinking than clicking.The game is very complex in a good way, for new people reading(There are over 1,000 units! & 17* Nations)-There is no base building in this game. -Income is time based, depended on sectors controlled-Certain sectors have spawn points &/or different point values. -Decks are used to decide what units can use in battle.The main game mode is \'Destruction\' where you have to destroy the enemy units to a specfic value.If the score is close it can be a draw or a minor victory/defeat.Units, (Land, Sea, Air)- own point value; to spawn/destruction- different armour values,(Front/Side/Rear/Top)- states; calm, worried, panic etc- have problems, like detracked, weapons jammed, damaged optics.Weapons, so many different types, better if you play ingame to understand.Tank Cannons, Rifles, Laser Guided Bomb, Anti-Radar Missiles, Mortars, Guided Missiles & more.200 page guide will explain everything (link)

-------------------Random Notes: -you can hide the console chat, as its a troll fest usually \'A\' is better than \'B\' arguments.-just check what the lobby you join, as rules are modified, the 2 extremes are, low or High income. Low income is usually \""Tactical\"" as you manage a few units as it is will be a long time before you span more. Or high, which can be Unit spam at times. There is medium income lobbies as well.- I prefered Wargame EE\'s scripted campaign more than this sandbox style.- Please used combined arms & recon, if you only use one type of unit you will be heavily countered.

												Amazing game. ~1600 units, lots of factions playable (such as the Red Dragons (North Korea + China), Blue Dragons (South Korea + Japan), Eurocorps (France + Deutschland), Commonwealth (England + Canada + ANZAC), soooo much deck possibilities.ATM, no boats available in the open bêta, but maps are bigger than WAB which results in mid to slow paced games, with spaws usually far away from your lines. Added the new amphibious vehicles that allow you to use some strats you wouldn't on WAB, and you get a very very good and fun game. However, arty is still a bit too strong IMO, and in conquest mode, it's heli-opening-feast as you have to uppermost hold some villages / strategical roads. But this early-game stage done, it's really good!			"

												im just going to go right into the pros and cons, so here we goPROS. 1. fun gameplay, (once u get the hang of it)2. tons of units, and u get the dlc free, or ateast i did3. awsome battles, on land air and sea, (forces u to form new stragys for different battle types, like u might be good at land battles but have no idea how to win at sea, or maybe its the other way around, if you've ever played total war u prob know what i mean)4. controls are easy to learn, being able to zoom in and see the battle up close or zoom out and see it from a broader scope.CONS.1. like i said once u get the hang of the game its awsome, but it may take some time for new players, 2. singleplayer kinda sucks some times, cus its pretty much the same thing every battle, the ai just send tons troops at u at a time, theres not really much manuvering around the battle field on the AIs side, but its still not as bad as some games. other then that theres not to much i can say about the game, its really a fun game and worth picking up, but if your not really sure bout it, just wait til theres a sale and get it. also some advice, dont try to reason with anyone in the main menu chat, there all crazy and well there Aholes, so you've been warned.

												I really wanted to like this game but I can't give a recommendation for it. It's designed for online play, but there is only a tiny online community for it. Most public battles are 4 friends on one side vs a bunch of randoms on the other and that goes about as well as you'd think it would.So what about offline play? The AI is horrendus. All it knows how to do is throw units into a meat grinder. Additionally, sometimes it just stops making moves or spawning units and just sits there (probably a bug, but c'mon this game has been out for what, 2 years now?)Finally there's the steep learning curve. I like complex games, but forget 1 type of unit and your whole force is destroyed in seconds. The micromanagement is also pretty horrific. Every unit has to be given very specific commands and it will not take any automated action what so ever. Helicopters taking ground fire? They just sit there until they're destroyed. Same goes for tanks. The notification system is terrible. All you hear is ""trouble...trouble....trouble..."" and no indication of who's in trouble or where they are...yeah lemme just scan the map for the 5 guys standing next to a burning tree...again taking no action on their own to move 3 steps to the left so they don't burn to death.

												Question; Do you like commanding several units up to maybe 100 units simultaneously in a huge map?I'll save you the trouble of wasting your time. If your answer is No to the question above, don't be bothered to purchase this game on its full price, wait for a sale and a least you don't risk spending too much money on a game you're gona uninstall and let digital dust fungus obscure this game in your library. Or just ignore this review entirely and this game because its gona upset you, since you're gona have to be busy controlling and checking the battlefield all the time.If your answer is yes to the above question and you''re interested scroll down.Let me just tell you really the fundamental facts about the game, that constantly keeps you busy when you're in the battlefield;Call in Rocket Cluster Bombs at unsuspecting enemy tanks, whilst your sniper recon hides right behind enemy lines.Use your heaviests mbts behind your hidden recon, and engage enemy units using your long range cannons, whilst your infantry unleash atgms against their moving tanks.Spotted their airforce? No problem turn on your aa missiles and guns. They brought in a radar hunter? No problem turn off radar system and turn it back on when they have flown over.Enemy infantry rushing you? No problem throw in some napalm and flamethrowers. What's that? Special forces engaging your men in the front lines? No problem send in an autocannon vehicle with a napalm rocket infantry at them.Enemy Artillery incoming? No problem just loosen your formation and move away from the incoming barrage. What's that they brought in boats? Bring in Anti Ship Rocket Artillery.Your units' are not hidden no problem, just fire on position on bushes where enemy recon might be at , or just move away and commence a small tactical retreat and replace that position with your own recon.You're gona be contantly on watch, and interacting with the in-game terrain with your units, ranging from different capabilities and strengths. You're gona find yourself finding the value of having recon scouting forward positions and using several units of different categories cohesively to secure your desired sectors or zones.Anybody need advice on how to play just write on my wall and send me a friend invite, I will advice and help you get familiar with the game if you wish, just contact me.

												The best modern era combined arms warfare game currently on the market. Units are varied and have amazing models and details. Maps are excellently designed, with many free maps having been added as free DLC. Gameplay is deep and hugely varied given the option you have for crafting your own playstyles. It can be obtuse though.However, be aware that multiplayer is abusive if played with randoms and the community players in chat can routinely be seen praising racially motivated genocide and other such nonsense. It is bad. "

												Wargame: Red Dragon is the culmination of 20+ years of RTS legacy at its purest form.  Cover, veterancy, supply, fog of war, unit limits, force specialization, etc... and the best thing about it is that these are all real world units.  The graphics are amazing.  The choices of countries to play as are phenomenal.  What other games let you play as China, Finland, Israel, North Korea, or even Canada?  Yes, even Canada.  I mean the game obviously takes place before Trudeau, but that is still a testament to including even the most irrelevant for the sake of enjoyment.Also, that public chat is very sophisticated and geopolitical.  You may find yourself getting lost nights watching Russians chant Putin over and over or hearing your local, domestic Navy washout rant about the F-35 being a false flag attack on the war again tooth decay.  Sometimes I go to turn the television off while I'm watching NCIS and instead realize I've been chatting on wargame.  Wow.10/10 gameAlso, it's not another WW2 game which is a pretty big deal			"

												IF you have the intelligence to understand game mechanics and to memorize the stats of 1469 different units that are currently in the game, BUY THIS GAME. It is probably the most in depth RTS out there, the devs are awesome and every game they make has amazing support. Did I mention free DLC, because this game has it. Don't expect too much out of NSWP and Scandanavia at launch, but look forward to seeing them updated in game soon after.			"

												My Review for Wargame: Red DragonI have always been a lover for strategy games. I loved playing Empire and Napoleon Total War ( Which I highly recommend playing aswell). But there was a very limited amount of modern war type strategy games. And then I found the Wargame Series. Gameplay:Warning: There is a HUGE learning curve for this game. You just can't start off and know how to play well. I recommend reading the 200 page guide(By SandyGunfox) about how to play the game. I remember starting off without reading the 200 page guide and my army got streamrolled. I didn't know what to do. But after the reading the guide I got the hang of the game a bit. But just reading the 200 page guide is not enough , experience is vital for this game. Every game is different, no games are the same. You need to learn how to defend your flanks, how to assault enemy positions and other strategy's for turning the battle into your teams favour. You also need to learn the strength and weaknesses of the unit's you command on the battlefield. It also takes a LONG time to win your first game , this is because EVERYONE on the team is vital to the outcome of the battle, so expect many defeats at first, but when you get more experience and training the wins will come rolling in. Overall this game has a difficult learning curve BUT after learning to play properly the gameplay is amazing. Gameplay Verdict: 9 / 10Graphics:One of the best graphics for a Real-time strategy game I've ever seen. Of course you need a good computer to run it on high settings, but even not on high settings it looks good. The tank battles and Infantry battles in towns look good too. It's also great to see an enemy heavy tank go up in flames as your Spec Ops infantry sneaks up and blows it up, or watch as an artillery barrage kills a vast amount of charging infantry.Graphics verdict: 8 / 10Audio:The game sounds great! The gunshots of infantry battles in towns sound really realistic and going close up on an airplane and hearing the engine as it is getting ready to drop napalm on a load of infantry in a town is amazing!Audio Verdict: 8 / 10Overall: This game barely has any flaws , except that it has a large learning curve, you just can't pick up this game and start playing. But after that the game start's getting better and better as you win more and more battles.This game is amazing and a must buy for any strategy game fan.Final Verdict: 9 / 10 "

												This game right now is imbalanced, broken, buggy and kind of a♥♥♥♥♥♥show.  It pains me to say it because I genuinely love this game and it's predecessors, but I would not recommend buying it.There's several reasons and I will bullet point them (feel free to convo me for a more thorough analysis)1: Community: the general chat is some of the worst people you will ever talk to in life.  (yes it's really that bad, think nazi apologists, excessive trolls, people with 0 games who sit in the chat all day deterring newcomers)2: Community (dev/""marshall"" perspective) the devs and their chosen few (Marshalls), ignore reasonable player input in terms of balance, ridicule people who disagree with them openly, and generally break the game every time they get a chance to suit their view.  Sure, they're the devs, they can do whatever they want.  Does this make the game better?  No.3: Balance: This game is terribly imbalanced and despite many many user threads detailing very reasonable steps to start the balancing process it has remained so.  As a amatter of fact they continue to introduce half baked mechanics that break the game further such as ""stealth infantry"" who were bugged and invisible for weeks.4: playerbase: This game is rapidly dying.  A few weeks ago there would be about 900 people on during a weeknight.  This week it has fallen to about 600, and it's been decreasing prior to a few weeks ago.  The chat trolls and high learning curve don't help.  Neither does the pompous attitudes of the devs and players.5: Naval: it's broken, it sucks, and no one uses it.  They should have just patched ALB (the previous game) and stayed away from naval entirely.  There's about 15 ships for each side, and none of them balance at all with the rest of the game.  It's literally a folly.I actually have a guide on this game where I go through a few play throughs.  I won't be wasting my time on it anymore because basically this game is done.  It's a real shame because it used to be my go-to and really did scratch that tactical/strategic itch.  Now it's more just a spam/click fest with very little tactical thikning or strategy involved.  Basically you spam OP units or planes or artillery.  I know that sounds trite, but that's what's it's moved to.  It used to be a game based on positioning and tactical movment of limited forces.  Now it's more of an APM/creep game.			"

												Extremly realistic models, my father was US army in the 80's and he recognizes all of the units the game displays. Badass gameplay really gives you a scale of what COULD happen if there was a war in the 80's.                                                           Naval, Air, Land it has it all and they all work for you to kill as many North Koreans as possible. SO many differnt units to chose from on each country/faction. The game is beautiful and I have had NO bugs and glitches while playing. I have  enjoyed the campaign (Which is not very story oriented) and the skirmishing and multiplayer is up to par as well. The game mostly has a particular audience and fan base on the side of Army nerds (Me) and RTS players alike. If you play CSGO maybe it's not the game for you. If you play Arma, than give it a shot.

												Only 8 hours played, and it's clear that this game is absolutely mind-blowing. It's basically Total War: Modern Warfare. But way more in-depth and complex than anything in Total War. Hundreds of real world units, and you have to manage your actions down to tiny details like making sure your tanks face forwards, and retreat in reverse etc. Units have weak spots on their armour (such as the back of a tank) etc, and using smart tactics can turn a battle around in seconds. There is far too much to explain here, but I highly recommend this to any fan of strategy games, this is absolutely one of the best I've played.			"

												ArmA 2-from-above.This game is awesome and definitly worth anytime spent on learning how to play it. Learning curve looks more like a learning cliff if you never saw any other wargame serie, but In fact, if you have some basic strategic knowledge, you will be surprise how effective the tactics can be, and how much details counts, such as ammo penetration, such as the direction from where threat hits your vehicles.. frontal / side armor.. tank gun's depression, etc..learning curve is a cliff, but once u've acquired the basic principes, it is SO rewarding and enjoyable!

												(THis is like a review but is kinda not like a review. Well maybe like a rant or advices or whatever. Up to you people to decide, i just don't care)This game is definitely not for everyone, I tried forcing..ahem...i mean advised 2 of my friends to play this game and it didn't work. It is a 'dog eat dog' world out there and only the strongest will survive. Only the most willing and determine can survive in the multiplayer realm of Wargame: Red Dragon. ...... OR just play the damn game longer and learn the basics, there's a damn 200 page guide for this game and almost no one bothers to read it. And stop talking on the damn wargame:chat, YOU FOOLS!! (unless you like the chat.it's a very interesting place where you can talk about politics, rage at people, discuss about fetishes and other crap.)After fighting your first 100 battles or less while losing about 3/4 of them or all of it, you soon will be at the point where you say ""Why am I playing this game??"", ""JEEBUS F@#K this Game!"", "" WHy did I buy this game?"" Don't quit. DON""T F##King quit. Everybody has experience this point of time at least once in this game. This event is inevitable, hundreds of new players quit at this point of time. SO I advise to you to not give up!This game has a very high learning curve and THERE is player stacking or pub stomping in this game which is the biggest reason why alot of newcomers quit this game but there is a somewhat-valid reason for this....YOU are suppose to make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Team or join up with veteran players.the main reason why you keep losing is that veteran players will team up together and pub stomp new players. There is no proper matchmaking system. EUGEN puts too much faith into the wargame community to make one. Nobody likes to lose, so these veteran players have friends who are at the same skill level and call upon them to join in their battles. They will then proceed to rain down hellfire (LOL hellfire missiles if you know what I mean)  upon their unsuspecting foes. Generally, the strongest and most skilled players are those who have played the game the longest and have a high victory ratio and also rank. (victory ratio is overrated, gametime experience is all that matters. Nobody plays rank anyways). (This part is just a estimation so might not be true)60-150+ hours players are mainbulk of the community. Anything above that range makes up a larger minority compare to the number of beginner players, these players are considered quite good as they have played long enough to handle tough situations ingame and have a good understanding of the mechanics and unit stats.  There are 1000+ hour players, these guys are the most dangerous of foes but luckily there is only a few of them. Making friends or apprentice under any players from 100+ hours and above is already good enough to teach you tips and tricks of the game. There is alot of notable players in this game, so you get to meet them on a regular basis depending on timezone. The best time to play wargame is usually when it is from morning and night time in the US, this is where most players from all around the world are on. Amount of players flactuate between 400 to 1000 plyaers depending on time.This game is not a singleplayer game, it is a multiplayer game. Like Battlefield 3, there is singleplayer campaign but it is not satisfying. it only serves to be a place to just practise abit. TUTORIAL IS USELESS!! There is no tutorial, it's just some pages on the menu that call itself a tutorial. Read the 200-pg guide or find veteran players to show you the ropes. Just randomly go into lobbies, look at their stats then add them to your friends list. Seriously find someone to teach you, or you will have to do it the hardway like like how I did. So many defeats... so, so many defeats...Naval combat is what most people are dissapointed about. If you are like me, who is okay or fine with it then don't bother reading this part. Opinions on the naval combat is like a mixed basket, people complain that naval combat is useless or is not what they wanted. Eugen tried its best to make it right but people still don't like it. Perfecting naval combat is not easy, especially in this type of game considering the mechanics to how this game works. Let's face it, this is not the first game that have tried to implement naval combat and it didn't work out. For example , the total war series' naval combat is boring as hell and most other games with naval combat are clunky or broken. Trying to fix naval combat for a rts/rtt game is like trying to fix the entire game genre. Atleast wargame's naval combat was not like in its beta/alpha version, oh god the HORROR!?Lastly even after playing this game for quite sometime, I still find alot of moments ingame which surprise me. The TRUE satisfaction of this is not about winning or losing, it is about experienceing the craftiness and usefulness of tactics implemented by players. Fighting battles against foes who are equally match with you or, holding your ground against a foe who have numerical or have tactical superiority over you, or managing to repel a massive unexpected infantry BANZAI charge with the help of close air support and artillery from your teammates, or working together with your friends to attack a heavily defended sector or so on. 10v 10 Battles are massive and intense. Even the tactical matches where you only control a tiny amount of troops are just as mind taxing. This is a game which will test your skills in controlling your units and your teamwork with other players. You will realise the true values of this game only after putting your heart and time in to it. These values are why there a still many players playing this game since its beta/alpha stage.			"

												I played as North Korea.I bombed my own peasant infantry when the Americans attacked my lines.I sent new troops to replace them.My housemate sat dumbfounded as he had just lost 2 squads of high-end American infantry in Bradley IFVs, an M1 Abrams and a fancy AA piece; 100s of points of high quality men and equipment, while I lost about 30 peasants.---------------------------------Then I assualted my housemate's lines..He had a few pieces of expensive tow along a distant treeline, a very dangerous attack helicopter, more fancy AA, and a single M1 Abrams which was parked in the middle of the road at prime range from a river crossing.... I sent 64 T-34s ... straight across the bridge ...Albiet, I had a bit of mortar support to take out the tow, and I somehow bombed the helicopter out of the air.But the T-34s had to close into near point-blank range to even score a chance at penetrating the M1 Abrams, so it sorta ended with about 5 or 6 of my T-34s surviving, while the M1 Abram's carcass was literally surrounded on all sides by near 60 destroyed T-34s. (fyi, I believe the T-34 must be stationary to fire)--------------------------------------------------In every case that I play as a 2nd rate power, I give the enemy a bloody nose, no matter whether I win or lose.My only wish was that there was a WW2 version of this game - with a few changes to account for infantry without transports, brigade / regiment structuring, fortifications (in attack  / defend scenarios), and fixed or towed guns.Oh, but there is a hilarious learning cliff. My housemate didn't know was SEAD was, and kept wondering what was blowing up his RADAR AA. "

												I've played the Wargame series since the beginning with European Escalation. It is immensly complex and has a tough learning curve, but is definitely the best stratgy game on the market. I was excited to see there would be a third game, and immediately preordered it and started playing the beta. There is a lot of balacing to be done, but that is not the reason I'm giving this a negative review. The game was advertised as incorporating navies for each country and naval combat mechanics. There are a grand total of 30 ships for 17 nations, yes 30. Blufor and Redfor each get a pool of ships from their nations' navies, and some major navies such as the United State's and the UK's are sorely underrepresesnted. Naval fights are blobs to see who can mass the most ships with CIWS and missiles, and there are no tactics at all. I love the wargame series, but I cannot in good conscience advise you to buy this game. Buy Airland Battle, which is far more balanced and doesnt lie to consumers about its features. Really dissapointed with Eugen, I had very high hopes for this game.			"

												One of the best strategy games I have ever played. It takes a while to get into the game, but once you understand the subtle differences between the units you will find that this game can be played for hundreds of hours without getting boring.Each unit has several key metrics (e. g. range (air/heli/ground), speed, size, surpression, rate of fire, armour piercing & high-explosive damage, amount (e. g. 10 soldiers in a squad)) and up to 3 weapons. For anti-air tanks this can mean that the vehicle will boast anti air missiles (infrared) and a dual 25mm canon based on a radar targetting system. As long as the 25mm canon is activated, enemy ECM planes can snipe your AA, however, if you turn off the radar they won't be able to spot your unit. Another factor adding to the longevity of the game is the deck system. You choose a block (PACT/NATO), a Nation (I believe about 15 on the NATO side and 10-12 on the PACT side at the moment) and a specialisation (support, marines, air, armour, motorised). Each nation has a plethora of units (about 80 I believe).The community isn't the largest one due to the sophisticated nature of the game, but there's still sufficient lobbies to find a game at all times.Eugen recently starting releasing new nation decks, which keeps the game alive and inserts fresh content from time to time.

												Since the game is on sale, I know many of you are reading the reviews wondering if you should buy this game or not. Well you came to the right place. Starting off with the multiplayer, 10v10's are a thing of its own. Unless you're on teamspeak or your team actually communicates, it's just a giant cluster♥♥♥♥. Teamstacking is a thing on 10v10's so stay away from them until you know what you're doing.. and please if you do buy this game, don't always use a support deck in a 10v10. The artillery spam gets so bad that eventually it turns into a♥♥♥♥♥♥flinging contest to see who can fling the most♥♥♥♥♥♥to the other persons' side of the map.Warchat on the other hand, is an entirely different thing. It's all politics seeing which country's♥♥♥♥♥♥is better, and thats the best it gets. Most of the time though, its autism. If you want to test your resistance to autism, read the warchat.PS... whatever you do, DONT MENTION THE F-35 IN WARCHAT!!!!!!			"

												Warfare on a large scale. There is so much to keep up with. So many tactical options. One of the most realistic stratagy games there is. The unit roster is huge. block to block infantry battles. Tank warfare over planes. Ambushes coming from forests. AA hiding in rubble. Long range artillary strikes to lay down smoke for advancing troops. Bombers, Fighters and SEAD planes. Tons of naval warfare which I am still working on understanding. You have to take so much into account that is just not present in other games. Like fuel consumption, terrain for vehicle speed, whether to land or keep your helicopter in the air, To napalm objectives and sacrafice future cover, What transports to use as they cost differnt amounts, the veterancy of troops to bring, what time period of weaponry they should have. This is the most intense large scale modern warfare game to date.			"

												One word for this game would be: ""Amazing"".Before you read the whole wall of text Ill give a tl'dr for lazy people: Great game, hard to get into, good community, ask for help get help, even better game if you know more about what you're doing.I entered this game expecting an rts I could spend days on. Boy I did, but not with what I was expecting from the start.Which would be playing the game. Now what I did my first few hours after playing one singleplayer mission and noticing that I got shrekt, was reading and watching, alot of reading and watching.What was I watching? Youtube videos of the game being played, and help with deckbuilding.What was I reading? A huge guide, of 200 pages covering the basics. Sadly, I didn't get past 20 pages of the guide, because I'm lazy and play a game to play the game, not to read about how to play the game. Thus I started playing the game. I found a subreddit, (www.reddit.com/r/wargame ), and a great post on there ( http://www.reddit.com/r/wargame/comments/2futc3/announcing_the_wargame_learning_program/ ) So joined these guys's teamspeak, and asked if some could help me. They could, I got help in deckbuilding, and unit control, and they played some games with me explaining things, while kicking♥♥♥♥♥Im in love with the game now, I now know a bit about NATO and PACT, know the basics and feel confident enough to join random multiplayer games. And whenever I do, it's amazing, wheter it's a wellfought loss, or a hardfought victory, you always learn.Pro's  Incredibly in depth  (IMO) good balancing  You can create your own fighting force with deckbuilding  Loads of units  Lots of unit diversity. Tanks, AA, APC, infantry, Helis, jets, Artillery, even logistics!  A lot of maps  A lot of support for new players from the community, not so much the game itself  Fun and open communityCon's  Really hard to get into (but you can overcome this, if you just keep playing, and ask for help)  A lot of maps but some maps feel like they are the same with just a few small changes  REALLY HARD TO GET INTO  Hard to find other newbies to play games with, but possible.   ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ingame tutorials, you have to watch everything on youtube, and really ask for help.That was it, buy it, and play it. Its fun and amazing and great and hard and challenging!			"

												It was poorly delivered...Firstly,When the game was first announced, there was a lot of talk of naval been added, which is the biggest feature of the game aside from the fact that it now focuses on the Korean Peninsula and has the Asian nations in the fight.Sadly during the Alpha, navel was horrible... The OPFOR (now called REDFOR) was overpowered in terms of the naval aspect of the game forcing NATO players to try to ditch naval altoghter and try to win by land. This can be seen in some of the early videos of the game during beta.In the game current state, the naval feature is still looked down upon by players because it still involves the same way to win as it did in Alpha, although there seems to be somewhat less blobbing of the ships.  But to a beginner, he would come to think that blobbing his ships together is a good thing.Which there is nothing wrong with that thought, because the only way or the main way your ships will be destroyed are by missiles.  They can fend off the incoming missiles using a Close-in weapon system or CIWS.  While one ship that has the CIWS can stop (at best) two missiles, a second ship will stop a third.  So following that pattern you can see why players tend to “blob” their ships.The same thing can be said for the player who is doing the attack.  More missiles means you’ll need a better defense and if your opponent defense is not strong enough, some missiles will punch through.  Which in terms... leads to the spamming.So, during my entire time of playing this game (which was a total of 300 hours) I can honestly say that I tried to avoid any games that involved naval, because it seemed like a stupid feature to play. So if your looking into buying this game for the naval warfare, don't because it feels like a taked on feature that doesn't introduce anything new after your first 2-4 battles. It's nothing more but who can shot more missiles at once will win...Now my second biggest problem which is that new deck system, or the number of limitations they now have on it.  For me, that deck system ALB (Wargame: AirLand Battle) had was perfect.  Comparing it to this game it now feels like I can no longer put a specific nation to fight in various ways, because of the newly added five card limit to a section for standard deck. This newly added limitation was strongly noticeable for me when putting together the infantry for my decks.  The first limitation I had to get over was the five card limit for a standard deck, while the second limitation I have to get over was the number of specific transports I was allowed to have for my infantry.The second limitation was strongly noticeable when I created my decks for the SSSR. (USSR or the Soviet Union) The number of the BMP3’s I was able to use in this game was laughable compared to the number I was able to have in ALB.  Which was odd because in that game the BMP3 was a prototype but mind you, it no longer is in this game. So oddly enough the word ""prototype"" means you can have more according to this game.  But ignoring that and talking about the fact that they're the BMP3's only comes with one of the weakest infantry in the game. This helps illustrates that the added deck limitations makes more units useless than others and also shows something I hated most about this series. It’s that units and the things they come with aren’t very modular…Now my last problem with the game is the community.  The number of “pub-stomps” has increased dramatically in this game to the point where you’ll see game lobbies named “randoms only”.  Your chances of coming across a game that is not a “pub-stomp” are like 1 in 10.But here's the kicker of this problem... When players ask for help the on the forums.  Typically I’ve seen a number of responses that state, “Play with friends”.  Which if you think about it, that’s what “pub-stomps” are made of.  Players playing with friends or clan mates against randomly teamed up players. Basically the number one solution is also cause of the problem…Then the typical attitude of the community...  Typically when one loses the match in this game, chances are they will leave.  Which puts you at further disadvantage making it nearly impossible to win. (But really it’s not like you have a chance when you’re paired with un-coordinated team members. So you’re better off quitting yourself…)To make even worse, sometimes you’ll come across ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that will taunt you and your team while you’re losing to them.So because of this issue I literally limited myself to only playing the “10v10” matches, which oddly enough is something everybody is beginning to do because of the issue.  Basically the game is really only fun if you’re playing in those 10vs10 matches or 1v1’s. This issue with the community was a huge blow to me for this game because I primarily played this game with random players in the 2v2’s 3v3’ 6v6’s etc…Sadly the last thing I retreated to (the 10v10's) also is suspected of pub-stomps acts also. I can even recall me being kicked from a few servers to make room for friends…Speaking of being kicked from games... Because of eugene’s GENIUS idea of adding a view profile button for others to see the stats of players has also caused me to be kicked or even banned from some people’s games all because of my low ""victory ratio"" due to me playing with randoms all the time. Then you have morons in the game that will judge other players based on their victory ratio... Just note this, if you have a victory ratio anything less than 40%, You might be considered a retard that doesn't know how to unistall the game, nor exit out of it...I have yet to see a response from the developers themselves on why they added that button. If you played the first game of the series (WarGame: European Escalation) you should remember that you had a number that was large next to your avatar. It signified what level you were. They basically added that feature back just disguised as a button...Since we're on the topic of features needed to be removed or added, I’ve also have yet to see a response from the developers on why they remove the visibility of the deck names...  Which is something most players took pride in during the second installation of the series.So now that I’ve said all the bad things what are the good?Well, you now have the Asian nations in this series and the game now takes place on the Korean Peninsula.  You also have more units!  Also because of the crappy implementation of naval, your units can finally cross Rivers, which adds more dynamics to game also getting rid of or minimizing “chokepoints”.But honestly these are the only things I can think of that are good.  Overall I will say that as far as multiplayer goes, the game deliver""s"" poorly and was deliver""ed"" poorly.  Since that first launch, the game was horribly imbalanced, forcing a number of players to wait for a balancing patch or what has been called ""DLC"" which took two months... Why not make this an expansion to Airland Battle? Because all it really does is add a few new features, units and maps. This is something I've been seening happening a lot lately with games. Before what was called ""expansion packs"" are now becoming Yearly ""re-releases"" of the game you've already bought. EE:2012 | ALB:2013 | RD:2014Then you have a fragmented community amoung your three different games that really are the same thing, just with more stuff.The series is great, but this game was the worst of them all…			"

												First of all, this is a very under rated quality game. Massive battles, wide variety of strategies and units, good single player experience (though the computer does cheat) and a multiplayer experience that deserves to be in the professional gaming leagues. This is an absolute gem of a game for any strategy game player.One of the great aspects about the game is that it makes losing troops very difficult for me, but just like real war, sometimes you have to push your troops in order to take an objective even though you know you'll take losses. As a commander, it is your job to make those losses worth the effort.While I am mostly praising this game, there are some big drawbacks that can potentially be patched with a hotfix. #1 There are several hidden stats in the game. Units with silenced weapons are not clearly marked and neither are units with auto-loaders. In the forums it has been stated that there will be a stat indicating auto-loaders with a proper description if I remember right, so this is likely to be fixed in the future but I wonder if they will reveal all the hidden stats and abilities in a clear defining manor.#2 The multiplayer community can be quite toxic. For a game that focuses on its multiplayer aspect, it is the biggest detriment to the game since you will have people who leave the game just because their initial push failed or even if they lose one unit. This often causes a cascade effect where people leave  one after another and while there are bonuses for the remaining team members and it is quite possible for the remaining members to win on their own, it often means that there are too many fronts for so few people to deal with and there is nothing that can be done. In addition to this, team killing is a potential problem. Luckily the team killing problem is rare, but when you're waiting in a lobby for a 10v10 map for about half an hour just to begin, it is quite disheartening when one of your team mates decides to bomb the spawning location killing most of the allied troops then proceed to bomb all of the supply bases and command vehicles before leaving.#3 Artillery is very prevelant and there are few counters. This is somewhat a reality of war that I mostly don't mind in this game, but this is bad in a few ways. One of which is that it just becomes an annoyance when you're constantly getting spammed by arty even when you take little to no losses since it often isn't used properly. Another way is that you'll often have team mates on your own team that don't know how to use artillery properly, then they waste all of their supplies achieving almost nothing, and then they start taking from allied supplies which deprives front line troops with repairs, ammo, and fuel. The final way that the artillery spam is a bad thing is because people neglect to mark the locations they are sending artillery shells (or bombing runs from airplanes) and thus there becomes friendly fire issues.My suggestion for avoiding the pit falls that somewhat plague this game is to manage to get some friends in the game that you know are reliable, or even better yet, bring friends with you to buy the game and play with you. It's the best way to play and provides a lot of enjoyment for anyone who can work together as a team.Update as of 11/28/2016: With the new nation packs being required to pay for unlocking there is a slight feeling that things are turning to ""pay to win"" and this is a legitimate concern in a game like this. I can say that the nations that have been released so far are actually pretty balanced and they finally give bluefor a couple of capabilities that Redfor players have had all along. That being said, since these capabilities are so strong and made Redfor nations superior before, it also gives the feeling that the older Bluefor countries are obsolete in many ways and not only should these capabilities not be held behind a pay wall, but the older countries that are more limited could use a facelift.

												""War never changes."" Is a quote thrown around often.  While philosophically it may not, strategically it sure as hell does.  Wargame: Red Dragon is a lesson in that.  Each multiplayer game contains lots of stress and nail biting maneuvers when player skill is balanced, but for the inexperienced it’s a dredge.  The learning curve is much of a curve, but more of a vertical line, when passed you can hold your own against another experienced player.  This is a target that I am still trying to hit, while I pride myself as a quick learner every map, every game, and every encounter is a mix between luck, recon, and unit composition, which I haven't quite nailed down yet.  A huge variety of units is at your discretion, from the absurd to the very practical, and all of them are worth giving a shot, provided that they are utilized properly.  The controls are simple and endlessly customizable.  The UI is a bit big by default but you can change the size to fit your preference in the options.  The game allows you to make everything just as you like it, which is great for someone who is moving from another game and wants their hot-keys to be the same or someone like me who wants less clutter on the screen.The AI that you can fight is not a very good opponent, it makes stupid decisions but it's a great way to learn the controls, and test performance (which unless you play on a potato is great).  Take a quick run through a campaign that is intrigues to you and then try the multiplayer.  I also suggest sticking with the default decks, or if you are so inclined building your own, be warned every unit has a ton of info, and some aren't as good as the prices suggest, read each stat and use the compare button as needed, also check out the competition through the armory, it lets you see every vehicle you could ever want to know about or kill, also hover over icons if you don’t know what they mean, sometimes they have multiple definitions that change between units even if they look the same, they can also give hints to the role of the unit.  Alternately if you tire of the provided decks but don't trust your building skills, you can import them, all it requires is a simple copy and paste and there are great resources online.This game is a wonderfully strategic, if you have the cash pick it up now with the Israel DLC, otherwise wait for a sale.  Any new players would be a great help in revitalizing the player base, and I can promise that this is the best realistic strategy game you can buy.  This game offers hours of endless–admittedly stressful–fun which I personally love, while games can run long, on a weekend it's a great way to break boredom.A couple of quick tips:RECON EVERYWHERE- there is no sense in charging blindCHEAP UNITS FIRST- when advancing it makes no sense to put your valuable units first, let the replaceable stuff take the hit, it can save you from a bad advanceDO NOT FORCE UNFAVORABLE ENGAGMENTS- unless you’ve been forced back to your spawn there is no reason to keep throwing units at a wall, you can always retreat, reorganize, and then soften your enemy with artillery or airstrikesIF YOU LIKE IT HIDDEN DISABLE ITS GUNS- if you want to keep a unit hidden in a forest or some other type of cover, make sure that their guns aren’t on, they stop being hidden when shooting, this is especially important for forward recon that doesn’t really have a need to fight, if you want it to fire just turn them back on.COMMUNICATE- if you are doing an air heavy rollout tell your team, so that they don’t waste points on their own aircraft, or if you want to take a specific point, call it out, so that your allies can focus efforts elsewhere.

												In a NutshellThis is hands down probably the best RTS I have ever played. If you like Strategy Games, Wargaming or RTS: you should give this gem a try.GameplayWargame Red Dragon is a Cold War RTS. Actually it is a mix between RTS and Wargaming (meant as a category of games). Instead of building a base you will create a ""Deck"" which symbolises your army. In each battle you can call in units from your deck, but every unit is limited. Depending on your choices in the deck creation, your army has only a limeted number of units. This gives this game a quite realistic approach in terms of resource management. You don't want to loose your men. The combat itself is again, a mix between realism and gameplay features. Although this game is not a full simulation, the battle evolves quite realistic. terrain, recognisance, supplies, weapon technology, morale - everything comes to account.GamestylesThere are 5 campaigns to play which involve a strategy map and the normal battles. The core of the game is mulitplayer and skrimish. You can also play this against the AI (alone or with your friends).As mentioned above: I can only recommend this game. The developpers made several free DLCs (Map Packs and Faction updates). If you are going to buy this game, I suggest the ""200-Page Guide to Wargame: Rad Dragon"" by SandyGunfox.

												This should have just been an expansion. Naval units only make a small impact on naval maps, and are missing from anything else. The lack of riverboats on all these other maps that include rivers and lakes was a real letdown. Ships move like tanks on water instead of like ships. Very disappointing.Deck building is more limited than Air Land Battle, there is really no reason to take a year restriction now.The only positives are: Asian militaries, amphibious crossing of rivers/lakes.Overall, not a big enough improvement over AirLand Battle to be worth purchasing for more than $15EDIT: There is no check on your army list, and it is all kept client side. Right now the game is full of cheaters who will change their deck to illegal combinations and availabilities.			"

												The Good:Wargame Red Dragon provides a unique RTS experience that is plenty challenging, and frequently rewarding. The playable units are beautifully detailed, in both form and function. I loved learning the difference between semi-active and f&f air-to-air missiles, and the paint jobs on the Leopard-2 models look phenomenal. Players who value detail and authenticity will be in for a real treat. Each individual unit has its own set of statistics and abilities that a good Commander should be well familiar with. What level of optics are your recon infantry equipped with? What is the dispersion rating of your long-range artillery? How much armor penetration can you get with your anti-tank guided missiles? Are your APCs amphibious? Are your surface-to-air missiles radar-guided? What's the turning radius for the F-15 Eagle? Do your main battle tanks have enough top armor to withstand enemy artillery bombardment? What may seem like an overwhelming array of available choices to a novice player is actually a true tacticians dream. There are a dizzying number of play styles, but it's up to you to make your tactic successful.The Bad:The learning curve. Everyone complains about it, and rightfully so. With each new Steam Sale comes an army of new players who insist on throwing units at the enemy, Starcraft style. The instant gratification type players typically choose the most expensive units to feed the other team, and it's not uncommon to see fighter jets casually sailing over the enemy lines, only to be effortlessly swatted out of the sky by enemy AA. Worse, is that after the novice player has squandered all of the state-of-the-art units in his arsenal, he will promptly quit, leaving teammates to pick up the slack for the rest of the battle. Since the game has no form of quit penalty, this behavior often goes uncorrected.The Ugly:To this day, the game is punctuated by occasional bugs and crashes that the developers do not seem to have any intention of fixing. Units get caught on bridges, planes will clump up inside each other so they are destroyed by a single missile, sometimes selecting multiple units also selects a random unit on the other side of the map. And a match can be ruined at any time by a single team killer. Bomber aircraft can drop bombs on friendly units, but there is no way to target that bomber in response. Vote kick? Report player? Nope. The game has nothing of the sort. Players must visit the developer's official forum site and post a complaint. So instead of fixing glitches, and adding critical game features, the developers seem content with rolling out a new DLC every now and then, to rake in more money. I bought 0 of them.Conclusion:In spite of these shortcomings, I'm glad to say that I own and still play this game. I can't believe how much I've learned about battle tactics and modern war from the detail offered here. If you have more patience than a twelve-year-old, go ahead and pick this up the next Steam Sale. Be patient, have good Recon, take smart positions, and read the unit stats! See you on the battlefield.			"

												A lot of people say that this is just an update of the last Wargames. They would be right, if there werent substantial amounts of changes from ALB.Not only is Navy included, but the devs are constantly adding new content and free DLC packages out to their community. These games have super high replayability and endless amounts of hours of gameplay in them. Its a shame that games like these are overshadowed at times by micromanagement RTS games like CoH 2. I feel the combination on large scale war mixed with the unit by unit commanding is so immersive that you cant not play it.			"

												Initially played single player and bounced off the game after a while, but got back into it after I started playing with the folks I play Arma with.Pretty interesting game, encourages and rewards knowledge of weapon systems and has a rock-paper-scissiors way of doing things. If you understand this system, then you'll be good at it. Has micromanagement but not Men of War level of micro, so it's not too bad. Not a traditional RTS so don't buy this expecting Rise of Nations!Naval is probably underutilised in our games.Not too demanding on performance, more GPU bound. I'd recommend at least a GTX 560 or equivalent for 1080p.TL;DR: Recommended if you have a bunch of people to play with. General public community is quite weird, I find.EDIT: I successfully ran the game with Intel HD4600 Graphics when my 560 died. It runs well if you let it auto-detect settings, even though it won't look pretty when zoomed in. It's quite fluid with a 650 Ti BOOST and doesn't appear to want more than 2GB VRAM at 1080p.			"

Requires strategy and a plan beforehand in order to win most battles. Requires thinking, requires patience. Most military units are made from real life counter-parts, adding into the realism this game delivers.   Overall 8 Wargame recieves a 8 from me because it is overall a great game with a few minor issues ( Mostly balancing issues and the community being a bit less friendly to new players.This table is small because I couldn't think of anything else to add, most people just play multiplayer which is gameplay.

												If you liked European Escalation then I suggest skipping Airland Battle and getting this one instantly instead.If you have no experience with the franchise yet I still suggest getting European Escalation and then this one.Airland Battle is cool, just... Red Dragon does everything it did, just more and better. European Escalation has a cool singleplayer campaign (it doesn't look as good with the two sequels) and it's just way simplier than the other two, making it a good game to learn how things work before engulfing yourself in Red Dragon, which has approximately one billion units from what I can tell.Honestly, if you're an RTS fan this is one of the best titles there are in my opinion. Since there are so many units the amount of strategies is really vast, every unit is a counter to some other unit and every unit has a unit that is its counter etc. It's like if the world had a great war of rock paper scissors, just with cool explosions and infantry destroying your♥♥♥♥♥in cities.-there's field of vision/scouting system, which means your units need to have a clear view of the enemy units in order for them to appear on your map, and there are special recon units that can spot the enemy more easily, so they're essential in your army and an essential target to destroy,-there's cover system in the forests and buildings, so it's harder to see your units while they're in there,-there's morale system that affects your units' aim when they're under pressure and eventually they might even flee,-there's size system, which means that the smaller the unit is the harder it is to hit it,-there's detailed armor plating system that forces you to position your units in such a way that they have the most amount of armor facing the danger, and if you can get your enemy from behind that's an easy kill,-there are random events like ammo explosion upon getting hit, or getting stuck on uneven terrain, which can often screw one over,-THERE'S JUST SO MUCH COOL STUFF OKAYThe graphics look absolutely gorgeous, which you could have not expected at first. Since you can zoom out literally into the freaking stratosphere and overlook the whole map at once, you may think the developers probably didn't bother with putting in a lot of details, but nope. You can then zoom in so close that you can take a look at the driver of your little jeep. Everything looks great and shiny, from water and terrain to the units themselves. Special effects such as shooting and explosions are also very pleasing to look at.Like I said, the singleplayer campaign is ""ok"". If you're in only for that then you'll be disappointed. The game focuses more on actual battles between players, but if you like playing skimrishes against the AI then it's there as well. You can now even team up with the AI, which wasn't a thing in EE. Depending on how you match your skills with other players the match can take from 15 minutes of absolute devastation of the unprepared party to about two hours, where your decks are exhausted and supplies dry, fighting with your damaged tanks without ammo and the most crap reserve units you had. You can also set the time limit artiffically if you wish, or make the match shorter or longer by taking a map of the appropriate size. Commanding your units on a large landscape and capturing areas one after one when there's still so much ahead of you really makes you feel like if you were a part of some great war.Overall it's just so good, I love it to bits. I don't have too many hours in it simply because European Escalation had me covered for the longest time... but man. This is the kind of game I always wanted to have.			"

												Best RTS I've ever played.  Set in 1975-1990 Cold War era,  it's practically a warsim with its excellent realism with a heavy emphasis on positioning, planning and combined arms rather than micro.   Don't buy this for the singleplayer as it is more a tacked on feature, but it's an amazing multiplayer game, and the multiplayer scene is thriving and very fun.   Very high skill cap, and lots of variety in factions too.  10/10 would flank with Vickers for glorious Australia again.			"

												This is quite lengthy but I've basically split it into FAQs which I see new players often ask in the game chat (this is mainly for people who have never played any of the Wargame series before instead of people coming to this from EE and ALB):Q: Is the game hard to learn?Yes and no. It's easy to learn how to play; it's very hard to learn how to play well (which in my opinion is where a lot of the fun lies).Q: Is it a bit overwhelming to new players?It was for me, and I think that can be what puts some people off this game before they've really gotten into it. The huge number of units is quite scary if you've never played any of the Wargame series before (I hadn't). Perseverance is key at the start, but once you get used to the game, you'll find this a joy rather than something to be afraid of.Q: Should I play the tutorials first?There are actually no playable tutorials in RD. The tutorials are basically just text with instructions on what to do. It is worth giving these a read to start with, but I appreciate that this is likely to be quite boring for some players (although if you really dislike this idea, I'm not sure if this is really the game for you).Do not despair, however. There are plenty of people who have made Youtube vids to give you instruction not only on the mechanics of the game but also on deck-building (which is important to this game but not something you need to spend tonnes of time on if you don't want to). I can highly recommend ICBMRaptor (I love his tutorials and other Wargame vids, it's worth watching them if you're new since watching someone else play multiplayer games can be a good way of learning), Bubblebox (nice, clear explanantions of stuff), Boltsauce and VulcanHDGaming.Q: What's the community like?When I first started out and was resorting to the general chat for questions, my experience was pretty good (and I maintain that the community is better than a fair number of other multiplayer games I've played).However, recently the game has obviously been on sale and it seems that lots of people have picked it up while it's cheap. This has led to quite a few - how can I put this - ""not-so-nice/mature"" people entering the game and general chat. My mute list has been filling up a bit recently :( (prepare for spam sometimes)On the upside, two things: 1)  you can just close the chat window if you don't want to see this, and 2) a lot of the people who helped me and people who are good players are still around and willing to help out :)Q: What's the gameplay like?Sometimes intense, sometimes slow-paced. It depends who you're playing against and what your opponent's play style is like. I won't say a lot more than that because it is quite hard to generalise due to the vast amount of unit combos/deck types you can have combined with the different play styles of different people.However, one thing I will add: beware of spammers and stacked games. If you enter a lobby and you see 3 people on, say, the BLUFOR team and RED is empty, check their stats immediately. This will help you decide whether these are just 3 friends who want to play together (and maybe aren't that good) or if they're 3 pro players who want to ROFL-stomp some newbies. Spammers can also be an issue, especially in 10 v 10 or 20 v 20 games. Some players will just chuck tonnes of helos/artillery at you, which can be frustrating if you're not ready for it and they crush you. However, if you and your team are ready for it - and act accordingly (i.e. making sure you deploy enough AA to keep yourselves covered and not taking predictable routes to avoid arty, as well as coordinating) - the boot will be on the other foot when you smash their spam and then utterly wreck them ;)Q: Is the AI any good?In general, it's fine. Sometimes it will do smart things (i.e. try to flank you, change its attack approach according to what you bring against it, especially if you thwart it once, etc.) but often it will also do some stupid things (e.g. advance infantry across open ground towards tanks).I would always recommend when starting out that you go into Skirmish mode and play lots of games against the CPU, as this will let you become familiar with the various maps and gameplay. The CPU will punish you if you make mistakes, so this will also teach you some good if basic things to be aware of when playing and basic tactics. Contrary to what some may think, I would NOT recommend immediately jumping into the single-player campaigns - you will likely just get frustrated unless you learn the game mechanics in Skirmish mode first.I have spent a lot of hours in this game just playing against the CPU because it is good fun :) if you find it boring by yourself, team up with a friend and go comp-stomping. If you have general chat open, you might see some good players also opening comp-stomp lobbies for games vs the CPU.Q: Does the AI cheat?Yes. As far as I know, Easy mode AI gets the same number of deployment points as you (you'll learn what these are when you start the game) but it gets a slight bonus to how fast it receives them during a battle. Medium gets more of a bonus to this and gets c. 1,000 extra points to start with (don't quote me on that, I just remember seeing it somewhere), and so on. This might put some people off playing against the CPU.However, it really isn't that bad for the most part. The CPU, while making mistakes, is sensible and plays well enough that it can be a challenge, even without resorting to spam (which it can do on higher difficulties). It can also be fun sometimes to face off against a vastly superior force than you and be able to defeat them with the right defensive tactics (or offensive if you're particularly good/bold/brave/stupid :P).Q: I hear the naval combat sucks. Is this true?There are definitely some issues with it. It isn't as varied as land combat, that's for sure. However, saying it ""sucks"" would be too harsh. Naval combat is fun, especially on maps with mixed land/naval action! Playing against the CPU can prevent issues with spam which may occur when facing players - otherwise I actually enjoy it and don't find it ""imbalanced"" as some sayQ: Am I good at it?Hehehehehehehehehhehehehehehehehehe no. Q: Do you care?Nope! :DTHE FOLLOWING TWO QUESTIONS AREN'T SPECIFICALLY FOR THOSE CONSIDERING BUYING THE GAME, BUT QUITE OFTEN APPEAR IN GENERAL CHAT FROM PLAYERS STARTING OUT:Q: I see people in chat using flags/coloured text. How do I do that?


How to Flag! v2.0 
A Guide for Wargame: Red Dragon
By: MobilizedPanda

			All zeh flags you need to spam the Wargame main chat! (v2.0 Now in technicolor!)		


There you go ;) (but please don't spam. Don't want my mute list getting any bigger! :P)Q: When I try to join games, it says that I have the ""wrong version"" (or something similar). Why is that?Make sure you read the Steam news feed for this game - recently, Eugen (the developers) released a beta version of their latest DLC for this game (coming out officially in January). If you try to access most servers without using beta (unless it is a specific non-beta server), you likely won't be able to join. Joing is easy, though. Simply right click on the game in your Steam library, select ""Properties"", then select ""Beta"" and choose ""Opt in"" on the right-hand side of the window.If you are any sort of RTS fan, I can highly recommend this game! :) come and join us for some great fun!

												Tl:dr; It's epic, intense, extremely detailed and takes a while to learn.Do you cringe to see your RTS tanks and helicopters move at the same speed? Do you want a modern style RTS on a big scale? Do you want semi-realistic ranges, strength and fighting power for anti-air, vehicles, tanks, infantry? Look no further. Wargame has (to me) been the breath of fresh air the RTS genre sorely needed. It's on a massive scale, and allows you to zoom out to see the entire map, but you can also zoom in to follow a particular unit in incredible detail. This game has been around for a while, but thanks to the community, the devs are still working on putting new nations out. Next to the positive things mentioned above, here are a few things you should consider before buying:-The scale works both ways, it's easy (as a beginner) to get stomped by something you didn't know existed.-The learning curve is very steep in the beginning, know that you need to make your own unit deck, since the default ones are useless.-Don't read the chat if you're easily offended.-(in my opinion) There's little GOOD wargame footage on youtube etc. from which you can learn as a beginner, reach out to the community to get some good decks at the start!

												Solid game. Having 16 years of gaming experience (across all platforms, genres, etc) I can easily say this is one of the best games I've ever played. It really is just a well rounded game. People who enjoy intense strategy will most likely enjoy this game. The learning curve is relatively steep. So my advice is player multiplayer, with the expectation you will be defeated constantly for your first month. But instead of quitting out of games, learn from the better players. Once you start getting a few key aspects down, it is not difficult to become a competent player. Matchmaking can be a little one sided at times. But remain positive... it is through failing and learning that'll you'll become a very good player. People don't master this over night. That all being said though, the game is still massively better then alot of other strategy games out there. And it is very easy to become absorbed by it. Community online is healthy. Id like to think after the disappointment I've seen around Act of Aggression, the developers will return to make another one of these games. Only time will tell - until then I'll keep enjoying this game. I highly recommend this game.			"

												This is hands-down the finest RTS ever made.  The level of detail and sheer complexity (and associated learning curve) are unmatched.  Other reviews cover this well though so I won't elaborate on this.After playing 700+ games (on a different Steam account), I must say though that it suffers from a horribly fatal flaw -- you can see the statistics of other players in the lobbies.  Why is this a problem?  Team stacking.  It's horrendous -- I might have played one game in ten that was balanced.  With all the others, the ""smart"" players (myself included), click around to see which team is better, then go to that team.  And the cycle repeats until you get a team of noobs against a team with 5000+ games of experience between them.  This leads to other problems.  It can sometimes take 30+ minutes to fill a lobby, as skilled players join the team destined to lose, realize it, and quit.  Or they linger hoping a spot on the to-win team opens up, then quit en masse right before the game starts.  Or anonymous lobby hosts will kick newer players and people they aren't buddies with off of the stacked team.If Eugen simply removed this option -- the ability to see the win ratios and game counts of other players -- this game would be very near perfect.

												As opposed to normal categories such as visuals, gameplay etc, I shall address this game as its individual parts and mechanics (specific mechanics and additions), primarily how the game is different from past entries. This review is for people who are familiar with wargame to an extent and may contain jargon, my apologies. For those who are not familiar with the wargame series, it is a military simulation (to a degree) of Communist aligned nations fighting NATO and capitalist aligned nations. Each side, and the subdivisions (coalitions and nations) have their own strengths and weaknesses, and most importantly their own varieties of units. According to the game's files, there are around 1500 unique deployable units in wargame, and this is part of the series' appeal. Battles are fought in real time, with emphasis on tactics and positioning, as opposed to base building and unit micro and the pace is slower than many RTS games out there. Think ARMA, appropriated as an RTS with the vehicle damage modelling of Company of Heroes with the map scale of Supreme Commander and the UI and setting of World in Conflict mishmashed with some of the atmosphere of EndWar. Or something. Its probably better to watch a video of the game to see what is is like. Wargame: Red Dragon is in many ways a series of steps forward as opposed to a leap and a bound from AirLand Battle. The foremost change is the addition of naval and new units that accomodate this new mechanic. Unfortunately - to put it bluntly  -the naval gameplay is quite broken. However, it is not the black pit of despair that trawling the forums and boards would lead you to believe. While inherently flawed in its execution, there are redeeming features. NAVAL:Well, like I said, its quite broken, but not for the reasons many people seem to think. The biggest issue that impacts immersion and gameplay is the scale. It is simply out of scale entirely to have Soveremeny destroyers and Arleigh Burke (oops I mean ""Kongo"") destroyers duking it out 5 kilometres from shore and 2 kilometres from each other. Ships in real life almost never meet to exchange cannon fire. This means for balance, the ships in wargame are nerfed to hell, and even then, they are very powerful. The scale should have been increased or naval should not have been included. Naval pathfinding is an issue, with collisions and whats become ""balls of death"", ugly bunched masses so that CIWS reaches critical mass. Redfor definitely has an advantage with not one, but TWO 500 point heavy ship options. But, the general strat in naval is clustered ships potshotting with missiles until inevitably, Blu air inflicts unsustainible losses or Red destroyers close with the Blu fleet. River boats, on the other hand, work fine, if a teensy bit overpowered vs land. Then again, I've seen a T34/85 Obr 55 kill a Kongo, so go figure. GAMEPLAY GENERAL: For the most part, it works fine, there is a measured sense of balance in asymmetry. There seems to always be overbuffing of the recipient nations following a DLC release, but that is a minor issue. The gameplay remains largely the same since AirLand Battle, with the inclusion of naval not matching the revolutionary change that the inclusion of jets was. Air has been nerfed slightly with better AA options across the board and tanks are less viable as well, with seemingly every single unit being geared to kill tanks - a hyperbole, but an apt one. Artillery has been buffed significantly since  The battles are fast and hectic, with 10v10s a sight to behold. The most popular modes in public multiplayer are Destruction-kill more of the enemy, and Conquest-capture points and gain victory points to win. Both modes have their pros and cons, with Destruction boiling down into static trench warfare, artillery slugging  being the decider and Conquest seemingly being an excuse for most people to ""suicide their entire bloody deck in the first five minutes"". However, with competent teams on both sides, Wargame multiplayer is an enjoyable affair, but inevitably, with unpleasant people in public games. This cannot be helped.SINGLEPLAYER:SP exists in the form of offlien skirmish with the AI and dynamic ""Theatre of War"" style campaigns. Both are marred horrendously by the laughably bad AI. The extent of the AI is grouping a bunch of ground offensive units and fast moving them down the nearest road straight into your defenses. As a stopgap solution to the bad AI, Eugen upped the availiblity, income rate and starting income of the AI's forces, meaning, most skirmish matches are zombie wave modes. Custom decks make skirmishes bearable, but still needs work. The ""dynamic"" campaign unfolds on a Total War style grand campaign map, with turn based gameplay. While better in quality than ALB's campaign in terms of AI and presentation, it loses some of the freedom and scale of ALB, in exchange for a more scripted affair. The actual battles are disappointing to say the least. The campaign map basically serves as a connector for a series of skirmishes against a zerg rush AI. We'll see if the ""Second Korean War"" DLC improves things.DECKS AND UNITS: The deck builder remains largely unchanged. In Wargame, starting forces are chosen from a pool of units in a deck you have constructed. Everthing comes in cards, with limited availiblity, both of the cards and the units themselves, which fill up slots in a grid, categorised into various unit roles. This is where the meat of the game is IMO and makes the 1500~ units a legitimate feature that makes sense as opposed to filler. Deckbuidling is one of the most fun and involved processes in wargame, with a single slot, card or activation point (How many slots you can fill with cards) making a world of difference on the battlefield. The armory is wonderfully presented with every unit rendered in high detail and with stats, however one must be aware that the armory LIES. Also, Category B and Category C (time period restricted) decks are functionally useless now, with the availiblity bonus gone and more activation points which you likely don't need. Eugen has always been fast and loose with regards to their period accuracy and scale (A Rafale with early 2000s' aams? Really?), and while the game ostensibly has units up until the mid 1990s, this is skirted around a bit. There also appears to be a somewhat prevalent French bias to the game, but its not really an issue for me.PRESENTATION:Wargame is slick in its menus and user interface, albeit a bit cluttered at times in game. The game looks and sounds much better than ALB and textures have had a noticeable improvement. Voice work is a bit iffy, with accents ranging from well done to comic. The game scales well too, with graphics that will burn out your GPU down to European Escalation era textures and rendering. In short, Wargame: Red Dragon is a fine offering from Eugen Systems and a good step forward in the series. However, naval has some severe flaws and the single player experience leaves a lot to be desired.			"

			This review breaks all of the rules. Not only is it reviewing a game that is almost a year old, it's also reviewing a two year old game and a three year old game.		

If Wargame: Red Dragon were a person it'd be the loner geeky kid that no one understands.  We're sure he's a really deep guy, but no one can understand him.  Wargame: RD is the most complex RTS on the market.  You will definitely have to invest a little bit to ""get"" this game.It's a very deep game with a lot of excellent and worthwhile gameplay, however it might be too niche for some.			"

												Great game. You play as one of the many modern factions like America, Russia, China, Japan, Korea, British, Germany, etc and you build a 'deck' which is basically something you stuff with vehicles, infantry, naval units or air from that said faction or multiple factions. (Bonus to sticking to a single faction, and there is prebuilt decks for beginners)There is land, air and naval combat. The vehicles are realistic. There is fuel, detracking, getting your rotor shot out and your copter crashing into a tank column and blowing it up. There is ways to get fuel again, because you start with a FoB (or Forward Operations Base) which supplies your troops with ammo, fuel, repairs, etc. The jets come in off-map from an air field and do what they do, and can retreat back to the air field (if they make it) for repairs and ammo restocking.The maps are absolutely gigantic. The enviorment feels alive. You can hide your troops in the foliage, secure and use buildings, craters are left as permanent scars in maps from your wars (Just for the duration of the game, you won't go back into a map filled with craters from previous games) there are mountains, forests, plains, plateaus, rivers, lakes, oceans, you name it, it's there.It's balanced. Yes, factions may favor one type of unit over another, like (example only, not true) USA may favor Infantry and have better infantry than the French, but the French have better air support, etc. Everything has a counter. Air has anti air and other air units like fighters and attack helicopters. Bazookas and RPGs and jets and other helicopters for ground and naval and air for other naval. There is objectives, you get command vehicles to secure sectors in a map usually codenamed something like a military term such as Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta. The more zones you control the more advantages you get such as new ways to bring in units to that zone instead of your FoB's location. The graphics are superb. Extremely realistic, and you can zoom in on ongoing battles and see from almost a 3rd person perspective.I definitely recommend it whole heartedly, it's a great game extremely addicting and very fun. 9.9/10			"

												330 hours played. RTS at its best. The good:This is the most detailed, tactical RTS you've ever played. It is quite well balanced even for multiplayer, with no single team holding advantages that can't be counteracted by other teams. The community is generally pretty good. You do occasionally find people surrendering too early in multiplayer games, especially 10v10, but if you're playing 10v10 you're not taking advantage of how tactical the game can be. Micro is somewhat important but not to the same degree as in other RTS - tactics is at least as important. The wide variety of nations and coalitions to play and the variety of units within them will see you not get bored. This game rewards attention to detail, well-planed logistics, knowledge of each army and general tactics, and dedication bordering on study. The multiplayer community is still active several years after release. The bad:There is a steep learning curve to this game. It is likely more complex than other RTS you have played before. There is no build queue so preserving your units, accomplishing actual objectives and getting your logistics right will be unfamiliar to someone coming from other games. However, you can download other people's decks (army composition), watch replays online and there are extensive beginner and advanced guides out there. Buy this game. You will come to judge all other RTS by it.			"

												I do and I don't recommend this game.  If you have Airland battle already then really all you are paying £30 for is some more units and a few maps, basically it's an expansion pack. The trouble is so many people have migrated to red dragon that it is almost necessary to get it in order to get a game as servers seem to have got real quiet in airland battle.Red dragon needs much more work, there are various balance issues, naval combat whilst a great idea is awful and brings little or nothing to the game.  It is of course a Beta, to be fair but still not worth £30 notes, £15 perhaps.You can at last ignore people on the chat so all the racist/jew haters out there are forever silenced which is lovely.  AI is still at times frustratingly annoying, the number of times I have sent jets on a bombing run for instance that fail to drop on their target and instead carrying on flying merrily deep into enemy territory to be shot down by the 4 million pieces of AA waiting for them.  And this is depsite clicking madly to get the bloody thing to turn around.  When you are playing as Redfor(pact essentially) you get to buy 3 or 4 planes if you are lucky whilst Blufor(nato essentially) seem to have endless jets at their disposal.  The same applies to the navy, again balance issues.  That said Redfor seems to attract a more tactical player so they do seem to win equally as often.I also do not like the points limit per deck, whereas in airland battle it was 40 or 45 maybe? so you had to really thick about your deck purchases - now it sits at 60 and you can buy everything thus making deck specialties utterly pointless.  Perhaps this will change - I hope so.			"

												Been playing since the orignial European Escalation.  I've loved and played RTS's since the original C&C.  Times then were simpler.  However, just like everything, times have evolved.  This game is a perfect example of RTS evolution.  It's top of it's class and frong runner for RTS.  This game does have a learning curve, and a steep one at that especially when playing online.  However, once you get the hang of it and start to understand how fragile even the most powerful units are,  Its very rewarding!  So rewarding I cant put the game down, I've literally been playing it for YEARS, and even when i stop playing it for a couple months to try something new... I come running back!  The graphics and sounds are decent, the base building doesn't exsist, however unit authenticity and reward for being tactically sound are rewarded 10 fold!  Best feeling in the game is killing an expensive unit with a cheap crappy one just because I made the better decisions.  I would love to see another sequel to this explosive game.  FOCUS did a great job with this game.			"

												Wargame:Red Dragon is one of the best strategy games I have ever played. The price is way too high and when you just start out the game doesn't give you any tips and tricks in the main menu.The deck system is balanced except some redfor AA but other then that I never see the russians have a better jet then the F/A 18 (comparing one jet to another 1v1 1v1 1v1 etc.) The maps are made also to a fair point. Not one side and 2 starting points(Besides Foxtrot/Alpha) As if your looking into a mirror (Objective wise). The units are also very fun to play with. I have won a round just by going naval only and I managed to flank my opponent.I can say the BB's (La fayyete Kongo etc.) Could be buffed for health because I've seen a T-90 take a Kongo down. Thats messed up.I would give this game the double thumbs up and recommend it.			"

												1 Step forward, 3 Steps backward from its predecessors.+ Better graphics as compared to ALB/EE.+ Single player campaigns are well designed.- Game has not reach a proper balance since beta, what I've received is a shame. There is absolutely no point in putting more units/nations/naval into the game when they do not improve the gameplay.- Lack of co-op campaign.- Auto-matchmaking is garbage, there is no point for casual RTS players to play more than 48hrs on this game if they do not have other friends to play with. Pub-stomp is the norm.Lack of focus is the problem with this title. It simply becomes no fun.			"

												This game is a great simulator, but I warn prospective users to brace yourself for a pretty intense learning curve.I picked this up as an experienced RTS player and I spent probably the first two hours of play just frustrated out of my mind trying to figure out how to make things work the way I wanted them too. You really have to take some time and get used to losing to master this game.Other than the learning curve, the game is awesome.

												The game is hard to learn but it's good. You must watch some youtube tutorials before start playing, because the game tutorial is @#$!. The reallity of the battlefield is the best part of the game which you cannot find it in other games. Many nations and may units to customise your army (deck).Pros : Reality and nice grafics.Cons :Bad tutorialOverall 9/10.If you r a military RTS fun just buy it!!!			"

												Absolutley love this game. I've loved RTS games since I was a kid playing C&C. I absolutley love the realism in vehicles and other units. The fact how I have thousands of units to pick from is amazing. Although this game does have some problems (Such as lag issues or other issues such as my motion blur) it still is a good game and I reccomend it to anyone interested in getting a good RTS game.			"

												'Wargame: Red Dragon' created by Eugen Systems for their game series titled 'Wargame' is a real-time strategy game where the player commands a military unit that comprises of everything from logisitic assests to naval assests. The game or more correctly the entire 'Wargame' series has the player either play as a country or coalition from NATO or the Warsaw Pact, as the game takes place during the Cold War era. Specifically for this release of the 'Wargame' series the developers have you be in East Asia, focusing mainly on the relations NATO and the Warsaw Pact through the Korean Peninsula. In the several months that I had played 'Wargame: Red Dragon', I found that the game has an amazing assortion of different units from both sides and from many countries, inside that assortion were tanks like the Centurion to the M1A2 and infantry equipment ranging the early L1A1 to the modern C7. Playing the game I also found that it has your brain working and improving overtime, this is the case because the game expecially in multiplayer where you're pitched against expierenced strategists, has you thinking critically on where you would or could be moving your assests you, where could that enemy mortar be, what would the enemy throw at me this time. Like these questions I have just said even if they sound vague to you right now is something that has you seriously thinking and probably in-game could possibly have you panic depending on the situation. This is an even more accurate statement as even though there are a few assortion of maps that people actually play, the maps themselves could even if you have a superior force could have you play yourself, everything from difficult terrain to forests, strange terrain angles and small towns, perfect for an ambush or an artillery bombardment or aerial strike.However playing the game, I have found that the naval assests no matter how amazing that sounds like, is utterly bland there is variation of naval units strangly from 9-12 different nations on the NATO side and there is also no variation of units from the 6 nations of the Warsaw PACT side. In addition to that I have also found that the ships on the PACt side are utterly overpowered, you would find it impossible to kill their ships compared to those on NATO. Nonetheless, I find that 'Wargame: Red Dragon' is a highly enjoyable game especially once you actually put yourself into it. It has it's flaws but overall a really good build and on a side note if the developers of the game actually read reviews from the community ""FIX THE NAVAL AND ADD MORE NAVAL"". Overall I rate the game out of 10 a 7.5.			"

												One of many simulation battle i loveUnlike any other RTS, this one is real combat mechanism, you dont need to looking for resource to buy/create things, and you do not have unlimit stock of army.More than selection of 100 unit you can choose for your deckEvery unit has it own counter, every unit has it own pro and conBefore join MP, try to learn the basic at least until you can beat medium AI 1 vs 1 or easy AI 1 vs 2, because in MP you dont have so many time to think your planFirst time play i thought this very much alike with airland battle, then im joining MP and when the battle start i send barrage to enemy FoB so far got many point from arty, sending my arty to shore and turn out so many ♥♥♥♥ing enemy naval.Lost 3/4 of my entire army in shore defeating those stupid navalStart MP again this time using Naval with very confident i will clean all enemy beach, before arrive at the beach enemy plane bombing my naval, and ended up lose all my entire naval unitBEST RTS in my libary 9/10			"

Beware dubious servers that can alter the odds in their favour and some random players who are teamkillers, spies or will spawn a heap of units to be targetted then quit. Also the game can be really bad when your team has a lot of random newbs. The devs never allowed an algorythm to prevent pubstomping.			"

It can have a bit of micro involved but once you get it, it really adds to the experience and takes the strategies and tactics to another level. Highly recommended.			"

												The best real-time strategy game I have played in my life. Takes a bit of decking around to figure out what all the stats mean and how to abuse them in a nice deck, but when you beat your friend in a 1vs1 its oh so sweet. Try reading The Art of War by Sun Tzu if you're having problems, its in audiobook form. And I suggest you get some friends to play with you, the ones that roam the public multiplayer games can be very good. Whereas if you have friends that are as noob as you are, then you can win some, then they win some as they adjust their approach, then you win some because you adjusted your approach, etc. This is very rewarding gameplay. The game is known for being as close to realism as possible, and strategically it actually is. You have to supply your troops and ships with ammo and rockets if you have a prolonged engagement (so your ships in naval battles need supply ships as a part of your deck). You also have to use infrantry in forests and buildings to spot and sneak up on the enemy (you can't shoot what you can't see, though you can shoot artillery at suspected locations). The battles are very intriguing. You can't just rush ahead, because to win you have to kill a certain number of points worth of units, but if too many of your own units die then the enemy wins because they killed enough units before you killed enough units. This gives a very real feeling, because you have to take care of your troops as you would in real life. Each unit you get killed is another set of points for the enemy. The trick is to make each exchange worth it, so you take more points than you lose in the engagement. This is tricky, but very rewarding gameplay. Pros: Everything, the only thing missing is a pure city map (unless I missed it). Just about every military asset in the world worth its paint is in the game, and there's endless replayability because no two engagements are the same. No base setup, no tedious setup of power-stations and resource harvesters, no tech-tree to worry about, no real unit cap that you'll ever approach (except in naval battles), there's a counter for everything if you only have the presence of mind to get it out when you need it (and managed to fit it into your deck).  Cons: It can be overwhelming, because there's so much to figure out. But this can be negated by playing with someone who begins playing at the same time as you, then you're on equal ground and will win every other match against each other as you figure things out.

												This is a good game which you should definitely get, but I would actually recommend Wargame: AirLand Battle over this game, which has several flaws. A few key points about the game:1. The maps are beautiful and are well-balanced for the most part. Maps manage to feel unique even though there are very many of them, all for different numbers of players.2. Naval combat, while it sounds cool, is underwhelming. It's basically like a downgraded version of land combat and the naval maps aren't very imaginatively designed. 3. The developers seem to have trimmed a game mode or two from the previous game which, in all honesty, isn't the end of the world since we still have the most important game modes, but when you get a new game, you expect it to take what was present in the previous game and expand upon it, not remove from it.4. The campaigns are pretty mediocre and are gimmicky. The AI is extremely stupid even on the hardest difficulty, and you can bait it easily. To counteract this, the AI gets a handicap in that it gets extra units at the start of the game, which isn't that big of a deal. The AI's basic strategy is to send waves of vehicles at you in hopes that you will just give up. The only thing that interrupts this is the constant artillery bombardments against your command units which, by all accounts, should be hidden to the enemy. The campaigns themselves are interesting and based in history, but they get old because, when it comes down to it, there is generally either one solid strategy or two solid strategies which allow you to complete the campaign successfully, and there isn't any room for strategic creativity.Multiplayer is super fun.Score: 83/100: If there were as many people playing ALB as there are people playing this, I would just play ALB, but this game is still worth your time.

												This is not a review of the single player campaign but of the online multiplayer.After play 200 hours of this game I feel as though I have earned the right to write a review. The first thing to say is this is a  spectacular game. The game has so many good points I cannot list them all but here are some.Firstly the number of units is incredible. There are over 1,450 units spanning 17 nations. This gives a huge variety in game play and no two games are ever the same. The second point is the maps. These are huge, covering vast areas of terrain, oceans and rivers. This allows players to use the terrain to their advantage (for example sneaking through forests with tanks or going over mountians with infantry). Thirdly all DLC (at time of writing) is free. This goes back all the way to European Escalation where DLC was also free. Another point about this game is that although the devs had said it needs a 2.5 GHz processor it doesn't. My computer is very low end and can still run this at 15-30 FPS.A word of warning though! This game it not a layed back RTS where you don't have to do much accept order where units go. There is a lot to micro manage and if you don't micro manage then you stand not hope in winning. There is also a steep learning curve and from my understanding no tutorial though i'm sure YouTube will have the answers.All in all this is a great RTS and in my opinion the best out on the market at the moment and certianly the best in the series so far. Don't be put off by the price in my opinion to get your monies worth you should play at least the same number of hours as pounds you paid and its certainly done that!10/10 "

												TL;DR: It could be the best real-time strategy game ever released, but it is just game which has so much lost potential. So, what's the story. When you starting this game for the first time your reaction is ""Wow! A lot of units! A lot of paremeters! A lot of different armies!"" Yeah, but... It is not super-realistic or thought-out game as it seems to be at the first glance. This game trying to be realistic sometimes, here is no tanks shooting each other on 30 meters like in CoH or whatever, but a lot of things are sacrificed to ""balance"" and it doesn't make game balance better. If you think that you can get multiple different experiences playing different types of armies, you are wrong. There is a few optimal choices while most of armies unable to achieve anything but hurt you. Eugen made the basic parts of the game long time ago. And they did really good job! But they stopped driving this game to make it better. Currently, only one guy is continuing to work on this game and oh man... that would be better if they stopped touching this game. That guy doesn't even play his game or play it very occasionally on very low level. It seems like once a quarter he's drinking something, opens excel file and doing balance changes randomly. Today german regular infantry dominate over against anything, tomorrow they are not even usable. Today Eastern Block and Commonwealth are the worst, tomorrow they are the best. Why? Because f*** you, players, that's why. Pros- Unique gameplay;- Decent replayability;- Decent number of strategies and tactics (but it's gotten repetitive and formularic at this point);- Matchmaking and rating system for 1v1.Cons- Poor support;- Poor balance (in multiple acpests, not just between Red and Blue forces);- A lot of mechanics that should be in the game are missing;- Lack of content (like online campaign, different game modes, different theatres, etc);- No map-generator or map-editor and existing maps are mediocre;- No matchmaking for team games + smallish community size = lobby sim;- Huge amount of minor faults (some of them are not very ""minor"").So, playing this game is a quite specific experience. It is fun to play through the first time and explore the game, but once you have gotten experienced enough there is nothing to catch up to here. It is too unfinished to play it competitively and too complicated and noob unfriendly to play it casually. I wouldn't recommend to waste your time on it.			"

												Pretty fun game if you have an interest in larger scale military strategy, with a combined arms approach rather than just spamming your high cost tank. Alot of units have their utility, so cheaper units are not always directly inferior and have their use - aswell as cheaper units will give you more numbers. If you have for example a 180 cost tank, you will only get 1 or 2, where as a 90 point tank will give you maybe 8 or 7, allowing you to capitalize on numbers at a cost of a more powerful unit.Not too easy to learn, so it's good to have a friend who is good at the game to teach you the ins and outs.Alot of people complain about balance and there is a balance issue in certain places with the game. Depending on who you are, this is either a good or bad thing:  You may like a game balanced away from realism to make it slightly more 'fair', or you may prefer that the game lets both sides/individual nations have their strong and weak points. Personally, I prefer to play against an enemy and in the lobby see what nation they are playing as, to know what their strong points and weak points are in terms of units, to help devise a plan to counteract that. I prefer to play a game where I have to think to nullify the enemies advantage, than have everything completely balanced.At the end of the day, superior tactics will win games over just good units - Adapt and overcome. This sort of thing comes apparent when a team of 1980s North Korea beats a cocky well rounded BLU team. I've seen it happen, and no, it really isn't easy, but if you can outplan your enemy, you'll have positive kill/loss ratios in any match.If at the end of the day you really just can't get a grip on the game but are willing to learn, theres an entire 200 page 'red dragon for dummies' guide that can teach you everything you need to know, although you really just need to in most cases think realistically about things.

												I think if anyone were to ask me what was the best RTS of all time, this game wouldn't come up.Not because this isn't the best RTS of all time, but because I know despite how amazing and incredible it is. How it's such a ridiculous technical marvel with the most incredible depth in an RTS to date.It's because just like Dwarf Fortress, I know that if I send regular joes into this with that impression, they'll just come out loathing it due to the sheer incredulous difficulty that comes with it. It makes TA: Spring or Forged Alliance look like Baby's First RTS. It makes Starcraft 2 look like a kid's show. It's like someone took the time to kill from modern FPSs and threw them into a super hardcore RTS so your hour long plans can get wiped out in five seconds. It's actually somewhere along the lines of Men of War, but with 10x the unit diversity.This game is only just slightly under games like Dwarf Fortress and Aurora in terms of difficulty to learn. But just like them, if you bother to actually learn all its intricacies... you will be rewarded with something truly magnificent.You'll still get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked though. All the time. Also the subreddit and forums are full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and nothing helpful plus all the guides are outdated so don't expect anyone to hold your hand.---------By the by, you don't actually need any of the nation DLC. Maybe get them if you like the countries but other than that they're not required to be competitive at the game. I have 118 hours in Red Dragon and I don't even have a single one of the DLCs. Never felt like I needed them, though they are fun and extensive. "

												This game will challenge anyone who enjoys RTS. It takes a little while at first to understand how to play as the tutorials are not helpful, but after watching several YouTube videos I figured the basics out. With regards to the Navy action, it is fun just buying a medium sized ship or two and sailing around shooting down air craft, blowing up unsuspecting land units, or sinking other ships.The land battles are very complicated, it is not easy taking over the map by just selecting a whole bunch of high end units and sending them to an area, you must move your units in a layered fashion very slowly. Sending in a tank or helicopter rush is just a waste of good units. You need infantry and artillery as well as plenty of support vehicles, otherwise your tanks and helicopters are useless. With regards to the air units, wow... not at all easy to use as they get shot down in seconds if you are not extremely careful, and those air planes are very expensive. Being Canadian, I can't help but play Canada. I like the proto types they included for Canada, but still, it is a big challenge to win (my win loss ratio is horrible) but that has not stopped me! Go Canada Go!			"

												This game took a while for me not to suck at it. Key lesson: If you don't utilise the advantages of each unit, they will die quickly and you will lose. In a nutshell: This is a real time tactical game with over HUNDREDS of real world units to choose from. It is the perfect sandbox to employ modern millitary doctrine with said units to kill the enemy. The way you would build a British Army is different to how you would build a USSR army. How you use soviet infantry is differnt to how you would use US marines. Soviet helicopters are different to the US helicopters. The key to this game is building a deck that is optimal for your tactics, and understanding your units pros/cons. If you are unsure the nature of this game - watch some pro replays and see how the macro/micro mechanics of this RTS works. It is quite unique. TO ease into it I recommend playing some solo skirmishes before playing some 4v4 online battles.One of the most satisfying games to learn to play, with a competative multiplayer community. As an RTS fan, this is one of the deepest games out there that has captured my attention. If you are looking to get into some deep strategy with a steep learning curve: Red dragon will reward you.

												Pros : This game is a very advanced strategy game set in and around the fall of the Soviet Union. Unlike other modern strategy games you aren't just looking at a black and blue map seeing missiles being dashed across the board and that's the most combat that the game ever witnesses. Wargame : Red Dragon allows you to enter the battlefield and control your units down to a single soldier. In the Air, on land and wait for it... sea. There are many powerful western and eastern countries to play that you might not expect in a video games when it's usually just US/UK against USSR. Countries like Canada and Denmark or even North and South Korea. This game offers so much with its many maps for multiplayer or singleplayer battles. Very fun Strategy gameCons : Personally. I found it very difficult to learn how to play. It's not like minesweeper where you just mess around and figure out the basics in five minutes. It takes time and even now there are still new controls and options I find out about.Other than the learning curve the only other issue I had with the game is in a multiplayer game if you, your teammate or your opponent are having bad internet connection and constantly hopping in and out of connection it pauses the game until you reconnect as opposed to having you fight against a blind General. As fair as this is to the other team it does make it hard to play a match when someone is disconnecting literally every 10 seconds. As well, after you disconnect you are given 30 seconds to reconnect and if you don't you are kicked from the game and your forces are then given to one of your allies which this could really go into the pros stage because it doesn't just make a game go from bad to great  right away if you're being destroyed by the guy with bad internet. It keeps it fair.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR SINGLE PLAYER, the AI difficulty is ridiculous.  Instead of each difficulty changing the way the AI chooses its tactical decisions, it gives the AI MASSIVE discounts on its units, effectively turning any match into a 1 unit type spam fest.  Every time I try to play, no matter what tactics I use, whether it be a tank blitzkrieg or a guerilla war, the results are always the same: the sky is blackened by the sight of dozens of attack choppers, or an entire wall of tanks.  The AI makes very little tactical plays and relies on simply zerging you down by out-pacing you with units to an ungodly level.  I've played the multiplayer and this doesn't seem to be an issue and focuses on strategy, rather than the bologna that is its single-player.			"

												Good game, with a lot of room for tactical play, and quite a steep learning curve. Had some problems with the graphics though, so I had to set stuff on DirectX9 and low settings.PROS:- Definitely a must-have for armchair generals. Sound tactics will get you far, weak points will be exploited, so you have to have a balanced army in the field.- Deck system is a very important element in the game. It's also fun to mess with.- Multiplayer battles with multiple players vs. multiple players could make for interesting battles.- Lots of units to choose from, although some countries have more variation (and sometimes seemingly useless units).CONS:- Problems with graphics forced me to play on medium settings.- Not a big con, but the game lacks good tutorials. To really learn the game you should just play a lot and look up youtube videos of experienced players.8/10 zones occupied			"

												Great game that supports Tactical & Strategic play. Probably the ultimate RTS game - designing and deploying a modern ultra realistc military force to engage in battle on massive fields of war - it does not get better than this! Perfects everything that was in Airland and expands on it. Must buy/play.			"

												Wargame Red Dragon is simply one of the best Real Time Stratigy games I have ever played. However I can tell you that it is not for all RTS players. If you like building  your massive inpenrtable bace, defened by automated turrets. Sorry but there isn't any bace building in this game. If you like having one or two sets of units wipe entire forces ten or twelve times as numerous. Again that isn't possable, because just like in real life one can only carry so much ammo and once it is out you have to go get more. Also with tanks, trucks, helicopters and transports having limited range and use up their fuel supplies that is also something you have to keep an eye on. However even if you are put off by all of that added ""realisem"" (remember it's a game, not a simulation so somethings aren't all that true to real life like the scale of maps and ranges of weapons for example) I would recomend you try it. If you are good at micormangement or macromanagement then this game will have a place for you. The single player campains are well scripted and interesting to play, although I would say that the AI could use some work when it comes to attacking/defending with singular type forces. As for multiplayer some people are amazingly good, however it doesn't take too long to become good enough to enjoy the game while being able to help your team. But as with every multiplayer game if you end up on a team (should you want to play on a team as you can do 1v1 if you desire) who has rocks for brains where as you are playing against some fivestar armchair geneails don't worry if you cannot carry the entire match. Also many of the very good players have reliced theory guides or have posted youtube videos showcasing what they do to win matches and generaily if you watch the replay of a game you lost or won you can usualy come up with the reasons why that happened. Which is one of the best features of this game in my mind, if you loose horably because of a break through attack on one flank that you weren't watching close enough or the player in that sector was unable to defete it you can see why they were able to beat you If you are sold now, please note that the game curently has some flaws, for example some nations do not have any upgraded infentry, where as most of the others have a basic pre 1980 form of infentry than a upgraded infentry from 1985 or 1990 with better eqipment and access to more advanced transports. However it has been confermed by the developers that some of the first DLC (which would suprise me if it cost you anything) releases will address this problem.That last paragraph has been mostly delt with, with the release of The Milionth Mile most (but not all) of the nations have had an infentry upgrade option added. Also added were land based anti ship missile systems.			"

												I should have written this Wargame Red Dragon review a long time ago. Better late than never I guess. I'll compensate with kind of a mega review.Wargame Red Dragon is definitely one of my top 3 real time strategy games of all time. (The other two being Supreme Commander and Starcraft II.) It's the third game in the series and it takes the franchise to a new level with the implementation of naval warfare, several new nations, graphical polish and rebalancing of old mechanics like artillery power. I don't think any RTS game offers the equivalent experience as Wargame and I believe every self-respecting RTS gamer should play Wargame.Wargame series is so deep that you could sink Mount Everest into it. And it's not just the sheer amount of units and all the simulation, but the tactical opportunities.Perhaps you should shoot smoke to cover your advance? Or would you like to do an amphibious landing behind enemy lines and cut their reinforcement route? How about sending an elite recon squad behind enemy lines to observe what kind of troops enemy is bringing in? They can also direct artillery fire on enemy supply depot and artillery battery. (Just watch out for counter-artillery) Perhaps you could open the game with an airborne assault to an important crossroads town?  Can't stop enemy advance? Try napalming the important bridges to block them and buy time.It's amazing what kind of devious evil plans human mind can come up with. I personally really enjoy this aspect of the game. When tanks get boring you can spice things up with some crazy special forces action.Realism is a big word in Wargame. Every one of the 1 500 different units have their individual statistics for weapons (type, ammunition, armor penetration, explosive power, fire rate, range, accuracy, stabilizer, targeting system...) armor (front, side, rear, top) and all sort of miscellaneous stuff like fuel, speed, size, stealth, countermeasures, operational range etc. They are all significant when you decide what units you call to battlefield.However, Wargame is no Dwarf Fortress. Even my 57-year-old dad has managed to master the game. I think it's common sense you shouldn't move your tanks through a town in which you have spotted enemy special forces moving in. Most of us also have brains to understand that an AT missile can one shot even the heaviest tank if you expose its side or rear armor, or that enemy AA will most likely shoot down your old slow bomber which doesn't have any countermeasures, or that napalm strike will paint pant's of your infantrymen brown, or that your artillery needs ammunition or that 20 is more than 10.Sure, you don't know all the tricks when you start your first match but you'll get there. There are great single player campaigns (both in Red Dragon and the previous titles) and there is also a chat window in the main menu full of people who can answer your questions and give tips. (At least when it's not full of Russians mocking Americans and Americans mocking Russians and Europeans mocking everyone.)Single player offers a lot of practice opportunities. You can either play skirmish games and adjust the difficulty the way you want or once you think you are ready you can try single player campaigns. I found the campaigns challenging (=fun) even for a Wargame veteran, not to mention the amount of interesting tactical and strategic opportunities.Addition of naval units was a big thing of Red Dragon so I guess I should say something of it. The naval units are often called unbalanced by the players and I guess they are slightly. It's also kind of unfortunate that the ships are only from few nations. I however wouldn't call it a total failure. Naval warfare is still fun and it makes the game more interesting in coastal maps as if you lose your naval presence you are in risk of amphibious landings in your rare. Ships' cannons are really powerful against ground units IF you can spot them, which the ships usually can't. On the other hand if ships move too close to shore pretty much any kind of tank platoons can make serious damage.The deck system from Wargame Airland Battle is also here and better than ever. For those who are unfamiliar with the deck system, a deck is basically a pre-defined selection of units you choose for a battle. Decks are really fun to make because you can (and you should) get bonuses by adding restrictions and specializations. For example I really like my South Korean Marine deck, Canadian motorized deck or pre-1980s REDFOR tank decks.The system has been rebalanced so all the deck types have become feasible. Especially airborne decks are really cool. Besides the five new countries there are coalitions which consist of several nations. The bonuses for coalitions are smaller but at least they get to keep their prototype units. My Commonwealth mechanized deck and South Korean-Japanese motorized deck just rock.The maps in Wargame Red Dragon are also really cool with mountains, towns, deserts, forests, coastal areas, rivers and all of those potentially in a same map! This opens a ton of possibilities and makes almost any kind of deck playable in every map. We sure have come a long way from Wargame European Escalation's never-ending plains with some occasional woods.As I said in my Wargame Airland Battle review, what makes Wargame really cool is the variety of everything that keeps the game fresh. Every player makes his own decks and chooses his own tactics. That's why every match is at least slightly different and you can never know what kind of BS enemy has in store for you.The fun factor will also get multiplied by 10 if you have a friend in your team in a voice chat to coordinate with. That's where the possibilities of teamwork rocket through the roof.Wargame Red Dragon is the ultimate peak of the evolution of Wargame franchise. It's probably the best think that has happened to RTS games for a few years and I love it just as much as I love the smell of napalm in mornings.TL;DR: Play it. Play it. Play it.			"

												First, if you enjoy RTS games, this is one you will definitely enjoy whether you like campaigns or multiplayer.The first most important things in regard to first playing is that there is a learning curve, and its pretty steep. For many, few games offer the dynamics or air and land comat with the lethality and speed that WG does, and remains blanced and fair. That boils down towards, if you want a game that is slower paced, it may not be for you,Having over 400 hours, i can say i am well acquainted with the pors and cons of the games design, and firstly i'd want to ring up the campaigns. There is a few scnearies with the last two being expansive and very long. Theyre great and ultimately they turn out the way you craft your forces to tackle the problem. Every time you play it, it ill turn out somewhat differantly which makes the games replayability remarkable. The downside is that the game compensates the poor intelligence of the AI with spam, and that spam is typically utilizing superior units, and those you can match are hard to replace when lost. it's incredibly easy to lose and unfortunately i've had to reload previous saves in order to actually win. The end result overall is still a great experience well worth your money alone.Second is the multiplayer. The multiplayer is similar to the campaign with its owns ups and downs. The first most obvious and great thing is your ability to hand craft your pre-set battle group or ""deck"". It allows you to play however you choose. It again requires a degree of understanding the game. When that is reached though, the creative and dynamic limits are only limited by you. This paired with other players doing the same leads to games where the outcomes are wildly varied. This is where the game really is worth your money. It is the reason why i can comeback time and again over games like Fallout 4 and other titles that are immedialtely boring after only a single playthrough.There are huge negatives which i Eugen needs to address though. The first is lobby stacking. The greatest problem that turns me away is the ability for experienced players to simply stack into one side of the team and wait for the lobby to fill up essentially gauranteeing a win. This is literally game breaking, and anyone new to the game will immediately realize after a dozen loses that the game is against them. It is a terrible and unfair system and isnt fun. If this wasnt an issue, the game would easily be a 9 out of 10,Everything altogether though, this game is brilliantly designed and encourages varied strategies and dynamic mindsets to counter and succeed against real people or computer AI's. Aside from its quirks, its well worth your money. "

												Wargame Red Dragon, a game that can make RTS ♥♥♥♥ to♥♥♥♥♥ i can't think of any RTS game that uses the same theme as the wargame series (The Cold War), most RTS tends to take Medieval theme, the Civil War theme, WW2 theme & even Futuristic themeThe game also tries it's best into balancing units and depicting the real life counterpart's stats, and not many RTS games has this, even the so called ""Realistic"" ones (Men Of war series), unfortunately it still uses an HP system for the units, but that's only natural considering that making realistic damage models & system would mean that the game needs more higher specs to play, which is not really that great since i am on a Low-end Macbook Pros :+ A ♥♥♥♥ ton of playable nations+ A ♥♥♥♥ ton of deployable units+ Different nations varies in tactics and special units and they're still taken from real life+ A large variety of multiplayer maps+ Multiplayer matches are hosted everyday by players and dedicated servers alike+ Affordable Price (The summer sale Discount makes it really cheap)+ Outstanding unit control and user interface + Active developer that adds more playable nations (even if that you'll have to pay extra for it, the developer knows what   a DLC should be, unlike other game developers *cough* EA *cough*)Cons :- No Tutorial, recommended that you play the first 2 game series (European Escalation & Airland battle)- Unforgiving AI for new players- Only 5 campaigns (repetitive after a while)- No mods & no community map creator (yet)- No matchmaking system (recommend you play w/ a friend first before you plunge into a random match- Bland after battle screen (shows only stats of the game, tbh i would prefer a national anthem to play after a match w/   the current nation you're playing)yeah that's basically it, if you like to wreak people w/ the Soviet deck or just want to create a fictional battle between 2 coalition or nation then this game is definitely for you.

												I'm not generally a big RTS player, but this game has such depth (and a steep learning curve) that it has sucked me in. Great fun to plan out and build decks around a strategy or style of play you have in mind. I much prefer this style of game, in which you call in and deploy units, to the type of RTS games where you have to build and manage a base. If you're on the fence about it, there's no question that you should pick it up next time it goes on a $10 sale-- that is an absolute steal. I'm also glad I picked up the DLC nations as they are all fun to play and tinker with.			"

While stays simple... well, perhaps  a little, just dont try to play like in other game like Star Craft.			"

												Picture a sexy multi ethnic group orgy where you have girls from Poland, Norway, Sweden, France, America, Japan, South Korea, Australia/New Zealand, China etc etc .... Where you are the only guy and they are all drooling for you to come and jump in. This game is what it is. They all play good, look good and just feel fantastic. You don't know where to start so you jump on your back and wait to see which girl feels good for you to play with. BUT there is that one girl, who looks slightly retard and walks with a limp (the ships). You don't know if you should do anything because its slightly weird but you have to try it and see. You leave slightly disgusted and feeling weird because you don't know what just happened. Land maps are great while Sea combat is just painful and lame. Do buy for all the other girls, don't let that slightly weird chick in the group let this great opportunity slide by!			"

												To those who may not know me, I was a long time community figure for this game and have the good fortune to speak to the devs directly on many occasions. Simply put, this is RTS series has some of the greatest depth that I have seen in a very long time. It is fairly easy to get into and will take effort to master, but it very rewarding once you do so. Managing multiple actions, many weapon types and all kinds of tactical situations is very fun. It is also a game that rewards forethought, correct force composition and having a plan. Red Dragonj is very engaging on both a tactical and strategic level, some of the best fun I have had in the past few years has been playing this series while on VOIP with friends, fighting challenging battles.Should you need further convincing, I’ve clocked in 1038 hours into this game so far according to Steam and that number is likely to keep growing. No other game in my collection comes close to matching this.Give this game a go!			"

												It is a Real time strategy game, just so we are clear.At first, I believed that I made a mistake and that this game was going to be awful. I. Was. Wrong. This game is off my charts on the epic factor, I mean, just check out my screenshots. For a cold war based game, everything was accurate for the time period and has many different armies and alliances to choose from. The ""Deck builder"" army creation is easily mastered and allows for thousands of different combinations. The combat is breathtaking, even though the AI gets an advantage on more occasions than one, it is one of the best combat simulations I have experienced. The different camera POV system allows for both tactical and cinematic views giving the player the feel of being a general and a soldier in the field.If you're a serious RTS guy or gal who loves to cause utter annhilation to your enemies with over a thousand different ways of doing it all while in a beautiful enviroment, then look no further, you found your game.

												This. Is. A. Fantastic. Game.HOW I GOT STARTED WITH WARGAME RED DRAGONI am a die-hard Supreme Commander fanboy, and I was skeptical of this game. I had tried European Escalation and it really wasn't my jam, however my friend bought this for me (Thanks, Jack) and I decided I should give the series a second chance.GAMEPLAYThe gameplay mechanics are, well, great. If you play a great deal of RTS's within a small area of time like me, then controls can get confusing, but that's just boling down to if left click or right click assigns orders. Through my time playing this, I've found that unit placement is far more important than numbers. Having one Stinger standing in the treeline of a forest is far more useful than two stingers in the open. Unit placement is also key, because the enemy gets points for destroying your stuff on the most common gamemode. One problem I have always had is anti-ship missiles versus ships, as the missiles would get destroyed and then my plane would get shot down. I am not sure if the range of the AA on most ships is intentional, but I feel like I should get that out there. There is also a counter to everything, and make sure you cover every type of potential attack in your deck, which I will talk about next.DECKSIf you are a fan of Wargame long before Red Dragon came out, you can skip this section entirely as I want to share how decks work and how a deck with a blend of cheap/expensive units (versus all cheap / all expensive). Decks are a lot like unit designators. You design your custom deck (Or use a prebuilt one), and you have two options to start with. BLUFOR, or OPFOR. Within those choices, you have the option (But you don't have to) to pick a country within those two factions. Within THOSE choices, you can ( But you don't have to) specialize within that unit, which will restrict the use of some units, but unlock others and give you extra unlocking points towards infantry/armor/air/etc. Finally, you can restrict yourself to a time period to give you more activiation points, but you lose the avaliability of some units. I have never had to use this type of deck. Covering the blend of Cheap/Expensive units, if you have an army of crummy, cheap units, then your army will get destroyed quickly by the enemies (Presumably) superior force. If you have too many expensive units, then you will not be able to get enough units out to cover all your sides, and you will be flanked.MULTIPLAYERThe multiplayer is fantastic. But I write that with a conditional tone. The multiplayer is some of the best you'll ever experience if you have teammates that know what they are doing and support each other. However this is only 40% of your random games. I don't have much else to say about multiplayer, except it is certainly a challenge no matter what sector you're holding down.OVERVIEWThe whole bloody review was an overview. Great game.9/10.I realize that my review was a little pieced together and guide-ish, but read some other reviews and keep mine in mind and you'll see if you'll like this game or not.			"

												Red Dragon is phenomenal despite a lackluster naval aspect. The dedicated ground combat is mixed with aircraft dropping ordance and firing off MRAAM's off at each other. It is fast paced with a bit of turtle mixed in. Like it or hate it, you will eventually work out your own strategy based on a deck you have created from the near 1600 units in-game. There are no games like this.If you want a game with your favorite combat vehicles and aircraft, then this game is for you.*The learning curve is STEEP - beware.			"

												I recommend this game, but there are lot of disclaimers to note:1. There is a STEEP learning curve to the game, and there isn't a good tutorial in-game.2. While there are a few good guys who don't mind helping out a noob, the vast majority of the community will view you as prey to get an easy win. Proof? Create a multiplayer game, title it noobs only, the first 3 people will be level 15+, and won't even apologize that they tried to take advantage of you being a beginner for an easy win. 3. Lots of battles are won or lost within the first 5 mins. These are 20 minute battles, mind, so there's a good chance that you will be on cruise control for 15 minutes of it.4. Artillery units are overpowered as of now, and matches could boil down to people just shelling the crap out of each other for 10 mins.Now why do I recommend the game?1. There's no other game like it. It is like Total War on steroids, every unit has a counter-unit...It is the very basis of strategic thinking.2. Once you get over the big hump of learning the game, it is quite a lot of fun...unless you match up with one of the vast number of people who are diehard followers of the game and know every key-binding and inch of the map in the back of their head.3. There is a HUGE amount of units to select, granted some may be the exact same (but made available for different countries) but in general, you can browse through each unit with a very detailed model to boot for a while.4. Like I mentioned, there are hidden gems in the community, and some of them have written up some very comprehensive guides for the game. Whether you want to read through a 200 and 180 page guide for a game is a whole different question altogether though.			"

												I only discovered the Wargame franchise this week due to the sale.  I can't believe this one slipped under my radar.  I'd say of all the RTS games I've played over the last few decades, the one this is closest to is World in Conflict.  However, there are way more units, and the high level campaign is really well done.  It's like a game of chess, even more so than in any Total War game I've played, since you don't have an economy / research you can lean on to stack the odds in your favor.  It's all about how you set up the board.  You can recruit new units, but there are only one of each type in the end that can be used on the map.  The name ""Wargame"" isn't just a cool sounding title; it's very, very apt.  The simplified rock, paper, scissors approach of traditional RTS (i.e. calvary beat archers who beat infantry who beat calvary) is greatly enhanced by the variety of real-world units.  You'd need a lost more nouns than rock, paper and scissors to make that metaphor apply here.  This game is very well done.A couple very minor gripes, mostly with lack of documentation on gameplay mechanics:1) the manual doesn't explain a whole lot.  I can't figure out of there's a way to issue complex movement commands (waypoints) like you can in every other RTS game.  Maybe shift right click works, but there's no clear indicator.2) What does R&R do?  Does that give you more command units?  I think there was a pop up somewhere that migth have told me, but I can't find that online, and it's not in the manual.3) How precisely does Line of Sight Work?  How far from the edge of the woods does you scout need to be?  Do you need to zoom into the scout to see what it sees?  Does it matter which direction it faces?  I frequently find my scout units fail to find targets I would think they should see.			"

												This is the worst Wargame I've playedThe AI is basically a massive cheat knowing the exact engagement distances of your units, so it skirts you constantly making you run around like a idiot taking massive losses.  Should you be bold enough to set up a defense it will literally walk over you, if you try that move on the AI it become amazingly strong suddenly.The singleplayer is rubbish as well, you make one mistake on the EASY campaign and you have to start from the beginning, hardly easy nor good to introduce players to the game.Naval battles, what was the main addition to Wargame is a tact on after thought and it a massive spam battle, I bought it for this and only played it a handful of times because it's so poor.Frankly if you have AirLand Battle stick with it, somehow this is a whole lot worse, and I really can't put my finger on it.  Either way worth about £5 at a push AVOID like the plague.			"

												Another fantastic Wargame to add to my collection. Naval battles are especially exciting as they are new and fun, but they really lack units. There are very few large ships to choose from and they seem to neglect many ships that were being used in the 1980's-90's; namely the Ticonderoga class and the Arleigh-Burke class in the US. That being said it is still extremely exciting to sneek some smaller patrol boats up rivers and take out enemy cammand vehicles and tanks. The land units are absolutely amazing. There is a huge range of vehicles, tanks, and infantry. They have put more importance on having specific infantry units than ever before. There are still some of those same annoyences with tanks sitting in the middle of a field staring at clearly seen enemy and not shooting or moving. Overall this game is great, and is a good step from the previous two titles.9/10			"

												Okay, I am not objective coz it is my favourite game. As all games have its ups and downs, pro and cons but it can be highly adjective and I do simply love it. Great job by eugen team, including great support and free DLC policy - very rare in those days. Game is very realistic and can get ur whole attection for long time. Never boring. Never 2 same games, mssive replay potential. So may variations. Big choice of units and always can find something sweet. Very few ""OP"" units. Match maker can be an issue and very steep learning curve. Be patient coz if you will rush in to the game game will kick you back very badly. Be patient and learn, check replays from your victories and failures. And most important is TEAMWORK. Play against AI is pleasant but not very challanging and simply completly different than against human players. Keeping that in mind, if you are good vs AI that do not mean you will be any good vs human players! Still strongly recomend, and if some one is new in the game very happy to give some advice and help.  "

												Wargame:Red Dragon is a fantastic RTS game that is very difficult to master but is very fun to play. Wargame has always been a series that focuses on realism and fantastic graphics. However this game is very complicated and for newcomers may be quite daunting. Sandygunfox's guide  Here  is a fantastic guide that is free and gives some great tips for newcomers to the series.Things I like:-Fantastic range of units and factions to play.-Graphics are fantastic and very detailed.-Maps are very well designed and thought-out.-3 big DLC packs that were released for free.-Gameplay is very slick and the larger maps with 20players run very smooth.-Massive online maps and battles.Things I don't like:-Sometimes the AI is a tad dumb-Not enough maps possibly.-No more dlc have been announced and I feel that possibly more maps would be good.-Game can sometimes do some strange things, like planes flying through mountains.-Online can be a bit pub-stompy with higher level players dominating lower level ones. While not really a problem as you can view their wins etc and just make custom games with people around your level.Overall I think this is a fantastic game, I've put alot of hours into this and was also a beta player. During this time the game has evoled greatly. The free DLC was a great bonus but these three were the only ones planned and they plan to work on other titles. Despite this Red Dragon is a great RTS title with superb graphics/gameplay that may appear daunting at first, but is very rich and diverse once you get to grips with its style of play.			"

												This is quite possibly my favorite game of all-time. The game is an RTS in the same sense as the latest C&C4 (No real Base-building) Except it doesn't arbitrarily limit the number of units you can have. Maps are gigantic, battles are huge, and there are some aspects of it that everyone just loves. That being said, there are a few limitations that might drive some away. I'll address them below.Good:-Battles are gigantic-Amazing variety of Units-Free DLC-Large Map Replayability-Wide variety of countries available-Land, Air, and Sea combat-Immense experimentation possible-Challenging Campaigns-Multiplayer battles (TO THE MAX)Bad:-Sea is kind of half-baked and does not work realistically-Otomatic was never sold to Denmark (Hehe)-NO GOOD TUTORIAL!!!!    I know a lot of people complain about this one, but to be honest there's really nothing there! The in-game tutorial explains what each value means, but it never really explains how to play the game well. Many people just come in without any knowledge whatsoever and pick units arbitrarily. It requires some pretty intensive effort from experienced players (Like myself) to actually help these new guys and give them a hand. There are plenty of resources available for them on steam, but it's not always obvious where to find these.-Planes are unrealistic as well-SPAAG ground range is arbitrarily set at 1050m (Except for otomatic which is 2100, down from 2275)-Tank Range maxxes out at 2275M (for no real reason)-Ships don't fire KE/AP Rounds!!! (like they do IRL!)Overall, I absolutely adore this game. The dings I gave it above are things most regular players won't care about or really notice. If you like RTS, you couldn't go wrong with purchasing this game and having a blast. Please read the tutorials after you do, and check out a guide or two! If you're still confused, ask someone like me who knows how to play the game well for advice! We're happy to train you new guys! "

Short review.This game series has turned out to be one of my favorite RTS games as it depicts ""almost realistic"" modern warfare with things sacrificed for the sake of gameplay. But, never the less. It's complex gameplay makes up for a hard learning curve, so at the start of your playing of wargames, you will get obliterated by other players in online matches. Deck system and no traditional basebuilding, Every unit has their strenghts & weaknesses and everything has a counter. These reasons help this game to stand out from the rest. To be really good at this game, you just have to learn constantly about the mistakes you make in your past games, so you know what not to do the next time you wind up in a match again.Naval combat was advertised for this game a lot, but it winded up to be a big disappointment. It's all about who has more  anti-ship missiles or CIWS. But where this game shines is the land combat. No one really plays naval on multiplayer for that exact reason.You really don't want to play in the 10vs10 servers, because it is usually, in my experience very inconsistent. I had a thing going on for 10vs10 games, but it just winded up too many loses for my profile, often due to other players leaving too soon or after deploying their sovre without any escort to the sea and ragequitting when it gets killed by anti-ship missiles. So you really just get sick of it. So stick to the usual matches, 3vs3 etc.But, it's positive sides really outweight the negatives. So I really really recommend this game to any RTS fans out there, it's an very solid RTS game optimized for PC gaming.			"

												Strategy games are fun as ♥♥♥♥.This game is no exception.There are countless units to play around with, a very interesting campaign system and many cool challenges you can do with or without your friends.Some of my challenges are:Tiananmen Square Protests - Make a china deck for you and your teammates but make an infantry-only deck for the bots, max out their team size and make sure their transports are unnarmed. You'll have 10-15 minutes of preparation per game before swarms of protesters attack your tanks. It's a lot harder than it seems.Black Lives Matter / Ferguson - Basically Tiananmen Square but with american decks.Zombie mode - Make a deck for yourself without any air vehicles (maybe korean B-5's for good measure), but with the enemy deck, make it completely out of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cold war era tanks and jeeps. It may seem unfair but those ♥♥♥♥ers move so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fast and they overwhelm you even faster.Star Wars - (use the sandbox mod) Basically make a naval deck with all capital ships (Luda, Sovremenny, Congo and Oliver Hazard Perry). The enemy's deck must be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ethiopian fishing vessels and small boats alike. Basically with all of the tracers flying around it'll look like a Star Wars battle and with the sandbox mod the AI will spend ALL of their OVER A MILLION POINTS on instantly unleashing a holocaust of REFUGEE SHIPS at you. (Prone to crashing).-But yeah, it's a really fun game. One downside is that servers are not so populated and the game has a very steep learning curve.			"

												Overview:This isn't your typical Command & Conquer or Starcraft style RTS, this is a somewhat complex combined arms simulation with a little bit of a learning curve. It helps to have some background or at least a basic understanding of modern military strategy, technology and terminology but with a little bit of research that can be achieved. As long as the player has an understanding of what the units are, what their purpose is and what their strengths and weaknesses within that purpose they should be able to play the game efficiently. The player's army consists of a ""deck"" of ""cards"" which are purchased with ""activation points"". In each deck their are nine unit types, each with their own row of slots. There are logistics, infantry, support, tank, recon, vehicle, helicopter, plane, and naval units. Each unit type gets a limited number of card slots based on the type of deck. For instance, an armored deck would have more tank slots and less infantry slots. Each card represents a unit and costs a set amount of activation points, starting at one point and gradually increasing up to five points as the player purchases more units within an individual unit type. The player is normally given 60 activation points to spend on each deck. When a player enters a game each card costs a certain amount of points to place on the map. the more powerful the unit is, the more points it costs. Points are earned over time and the income increases when a player or their team takes a point and places a command vehicle in them. The Review:I have been playing Wargame for a little under a year, starting with Airland Battle. As a Marine Corps veteran I immediately noticed that the developers did their homework and created a very accurate representation of most of the American vehicles and infantry units without sacrificing balance. Within a week of playing I was hooked and the addiction hasn't worn off since. For the most part Red Dragon was a big upgrade from Airland Battle. The maps are more detailed and look more natural, the units are more balanced and the gameplay became smoother without taking away from the original Wargame experience. I was very dissappointed with the naval units, they seem like they were thrown in at the last moment and they don't fit in the game very well. Every game I've played against someone who had a large naval presence I've won. I think it would have worked better if they removed the frigates and destroyers, leaving just the river boats and other small ships. The only other negative aspect of the game is the AI ""Fast Move"" pathfinding, it would be nice if the player was able to select specific roads for a vehicle to travel down instead of selecting a location and having the AI take the fastest road. There have been too many instances where I've called in a unit, forgotten about them in the heat of a firefight and they've blindly driven into an enemy line. Other than that the game is great, there is a massive amount of units to select from allowing for a huge amount of variety. Each unit has strengths and weaknesses and I have yet to find any overpowered units or exploits, the game is very skill based and well thought out. It isn't too often you find games of this quality. I would reccommend this to anyone willing to put in the little bit of time it takes to get past the learning curve. Happy hunting!			"

												Never rated a game. Tend to keep the goodies to myself.But THIS.......Words are kinda beyond me. To put it simple, you can buy it in FULL PRICE and wish you had paid more - the sheer hallucination that they're taking the premium you paid to develop the next game or dlc will keep you optimistic for EVERYTHING ELSE IN LIFE.- It comes with a pack of 3 games: Multiplayer, Warchat, and Reading the Steam Reviews (which I am adding to).- Multiplayer = everything you dreamt or imagined about the Arms Race that should happen but didn't happen - EVERYTHING, I mean it, execpt the part about the nukes.- Warchat, best chat room ever, takes you back to the Cold War when all kinds of ideologists and extremists - Leftists, Rightists, Communists, Jihadists, Imperialists, Fascists, Nationalists, Racists, Sexists (WTF?)... discuss how they wipe one another out IN REAL LIFE.- Play single-player and AI-skirmishes as ""tower-defense"" and achieve a kill/death ratio > 100:1.- Play single-player as a tutorial before playing multi-player and witness the ratio getting reversed...for a long time.- Beginners plz don't start by choosing a ""support deck""......or your house will get torn down by an elephant.- Rock cissor paper/ Heli Tank AA/ Grenade luncher rules all infantry.- Patience. Grow up and learn not to quit when having a hard time. When you do, you leave all the♥♥♥♥♥♥you summoned to ONE OF your poor teammates on the OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP. Unable to manage, he quits, leaving all the♥♥♥♥♥♥to the next guy......GG in 5 min.Last but not least, I'll tell you a joke: Act of Aggression.			"

												This game is a semi-realistic adverserial game for military nuts. There are thousands of year world military units from about two dozen playable real world nations. The online gameplay is fantastic, if complex and occasionally stressful. The graphics are in my opinion pretty amazing, the sound is fairly good and the maps are very large. The only downside to the game is the AI and singleplayer campaigns are very subpar and not worth mentioning, which is a big shame. Get this game if you enjoy: Multiplayer, military history, tactics, technology			"

												I recommend this game because there isn't any compition to it.There is no other RTS which let's you play with this many units.Nor is there any RTS that deals with the cold war like this. If you play this game you will probably end up knowing a lot about military hardware from the cold war that you didn't know. That being said. There are some warnings to this game. Despite it being very unique, and still being worked on. I should point out a few things:1. Navy Is broken, don't get this game to play with ships, very little effort was put into them, and they do not function very well at all.2. All of the screenshots for this game on steam are fake. All of them, for example, Wheeled vehicles move faster on roads so in the screenshot where tracked and wheeled chinese AA units drive together, is litterally not possible in the game, since there is no fuction to make units move together at the same speed.3. There is no formation control at all. So if you want any formation you'll have to manage all your units one at a time. 4. The game isn't particularly balanced, overall Western Forces has some huge advantages, they may not be obvious, but to competitive players they are blatant, hence why that 80% of competitive players play NATO. This has been the case since release and also in wargame ALB, so do not expect this to be fixed anytime soon, especially since the developer doesn't acknowledge overall balance concern raised by competitive players.5. This game has a lot of hidden statistics, some of the most imporant statistics are not displayed ingame, and in order to play the game efficiantly you HAVE to go on the forum, and do a lot of reading.Some pros to this now:1. Huge amount of units, you'll see how simplistic and silly, most games view on units are when claiming to be authentic.2. There are genuine differences in units, and they feel powerful mostly.3. The engine is pretty hardcore, unless you have litterally a thousand units on the map, this game runds extremely smooth in my oppinion.4. Despite the unbalances, the game has a lot of room for skill progression, if you have the wits for it, it's possible to be really good at this game, and in that case it doesn't matter what faction you play.5. If you are a nationalist this is probably the game of your wet dreams as you will be allowed to trash evil communists/capitalists with just about every land or air vehicle made in the Soviet Union, USA, western europe, east asia and oceania the past 40-50 years. Even as Denmark.  "

												One of the best RTS ever made. Worth every penny. I have 1800 hours in this game now according to Steam, and I still enjoy it. I still learn new tricks and tactics every now and then.If you like (semi-realistic) RTS, you will love Wargame.There is no base building and it has a very steep learning curve, but once you've figured things out, you're going to love it.Made by a great studio which is still supporting the game with patches and DLCs. On top it still has a very active community and you will always find a multiplayer game.Estimated online player count:Minimum: 500Maximum: 1000 - 1200 (late evening and saturday night [CET])Steam sale peaks: 1500 and moreThose numbers have been stable throughout the past at least 12 months.Since the game is pretty complex and detailed, you will need some time to get good. But at the same time this ensures the game isn't going to get boring anytime soon. So many nations, so many units, so many different tactics you can try.			"

Game does provide armory where player can view every units characteristic.Adapted from another person's review. Credit to Sunbeam for an accurate overlook of the game.			"

												A refreshing take on the RTS genre, if you love tanks, guns, bombs, planes and the sound of artillery then its for you. This statement comes with a big WARNING: the learning curve is steep. When I say steep I mean its a sheer cliff. The only way to get true enjoyment, and better at the game, is to try things out. You will be called a noob and it seems that anyone who deploys more than one of a type of unit is ""a spammer"" to the majority of the community. Disregard them and find your path.			"

												I greatly anticipated this game for a long time, after falling deep in love with AirLand Battle. If you are a veteran RTS player, or never touched one in your life, or a military buff that has never even played a game, this game is really something for you.However, I will warn you now, that there is a large learning curve in the multiplayer. To compete against experienced players takes a lot of learning, as the massive selection of units, maps, and mechanics makes it an enormous task. This does not mean you can not have fun learning though! (read on..)In skirmish modes (Against the AI) You have the option to slow down and stop (as well as speed up) time to give you more time to give orders to your unitsThe deck mechanic is really what adds so much to this game. You can spend many hours (I have) browsing the armoury, analysing and comparing unit stats, adding them to your deck, checking out the amazing unit models, and then getting to take them to combat! With 1450 units in the game, there is an amazing feeling with finding that an understated unit is a beautiful performer - You can get very attached to them.The devs have really taken what was excellent about the two previous games, and then piled on more. There is plenty in this game for you. "

												Wargame:Red Dragon not change anything too much from Air Land Battle. It just add some new units and Ship into the game include Naval map for Naval battle. Gameplay still the same as other Wargame Series. So this disappointed me because it cost  30$ to play few Naval map, Naval battle and boring campaign. From this point i can't say its not good at all but its not worth your money on this price if you already own Air Land Battle. When i said gameplay not change thats mean it still hard for new player, you need a lot of time to learn and enjoyable this game. If you are someone who looking for really strategy game that require plans and tactics (Micro a lot of units as well), this game is for you. But as i said before its still not worth you money if you already own AIr Land Battle. It's your money, It's your decision this just my opinion. Not recommend for who already own Air Land Battle except you can buy it in half of current game's price. Sorry for bad grammar though.			"

												WarGame Red Dragon. 8/10I love RTS. My favorite to date is still Company of Heros because of the story driven theme and it's a good RTS in general.Wargame Red Dragon is next up. While there is little personality to the game, I love it anyway because I am also a sim junkie. This is what would result if World in Conflict got A-10 warthog Flaming Cliffs pregnant. I really like the scale, the terrain, the Era, the models and the depth of comand. Just creating your own special decks for multiplayer is fun, and is perfect for satisfing your mico manage OCD.While many people complain about balance, I do not. I would rather try to come up with clever stratagies to bring an underdog up. We have played using the worst OPFOR decks we can create and still win (more so than with a premium Blufor deck). Some features I personally like. 1) When you are playing a multiplayer game, you are sort of stuck watching the battle from birds eye view so you can keep an eye on the field which isnt that cool, but when the battle is over, you can replay it and adjust the time. Now you can watch the battle from any angle, even from a units shoulder. Those who make epic vids will love this.2) While the scale isn't ""realistic"" it is scaled very well.  Well enough to give you some feel for actual stratagy. This is why I say it has a nice SIM feel to it.3) VARIETY. You can create the deck you want to play! It's not a matter of caping an ""AMMO"" dump so you can afford tanks. You get what you bring, you bring what you want. Great for team play.4) I LIKE THE NAVY! This notion of one Navy being better than another is false. It's all about your deck and how you use it. If your enemy showed up with a better navy than you, then chances are your Air Force is better than theirs. Every battle is an excercise in knowing what is your strength and thier weakness is this vast combonation of units.5) I like friend chat and invite features. You dont need to tab in and out of Steam to invite friends to join game. 6) Choke points are only partially important.  As a result there is always a way around a fortified position, it's just time consuming and risky. Not a mindless meat grinder that devlopes the same area each instance of the map.7) The best and really only modern arms grand command simulator! If you like games like Total War Napoleon for the battle instances, you will like this one. That leads me to what I wish the game had.1) A grand campaign like the Total War series. Then you could bring other units into it like ICBM, spies, satalites and diplomacy. Have populations and national rescources.2) Combat enjineers who deploy bridges across rivers for battles.3)Anywhere but enemy territory placeable FOBS that dont run out of supply if in a friendly zone but can be placed in a neutral area. 4) A topigraphical overlay. I love the importance of LOS and elevation, It would be even better if it was easier to see from a distance.5) Better concealment for infantry in forrest. Some AI behaviors for them. Like running away from napalm, taking cover automaticly under fire from heavy weapons.6) Navy divers that can swim unseen and Marine units that can forde rivers on foot.7) Loss of communication to units if all your Command units are destroyed.That about sums it up. I don't subtract from the game for the things it dosn't have, because it's unrealistic to expect everything. I giive it high scores because it aproaches RTS in a way I always wished they would, and I like the theme that so few have tried to do, and the Few that have tried were not this good. I.e. Real War, JTF, or World in conlict.A very good game. If you don't get it, chances are you'll spend just as much on somthing not as good. Keep in mind it can be very rough on the video card and memory. The Auto tune for graphics will set it too high. Unless your rig is pretty epic, this will push even the better computers just a few years old to the brink. Once its set right though, it runs like a champ and looks great. You can run replays better than the play out.Hope to see you all on the battlefield.			"

												This is like no other RTS I've played, and such comes with a period of unlearning things you thought you knew about strategy games. This is much more real worldly and rewards cunning, not spamming. Playing my first game online (3v3) wasn't as intimidating as I thought, although there are plenty of pitfalls to catch you out if your deck is missing something important. This is the only way to learn.			"

												Best strategy game ever made. Nothing even comes close to how good this game is in scale, control scheme, realism, and thoughtful gameplay.Playing this game should be a mandatory part of high school education. It illustrates in no uncertain terms just how important it is to perserve the peace in the world. When you see squads of infantry with names and faces getting turned into minced meat by 203mm artillery because you ordered them to hold a town at all costs... ... That will make you think twice about voting for stupid politicians and supporting militarist and nationalist policies.			"

Disclaimer: I am not a big time RTS player. The only RTS games I have played are the earlier AoE games, 1, 2 and a little bit of Mythology; so my review of this RTS game may not be framed in ways similar to others who may have considerably more RTS gaming experience. I also have really only played the Destruction multiplayer game mode and tend to only play with friends or play solo. Wargame: Red Dragon is a fast paced RTS set during the Cold War. Players control individual units that they deploy from a pre-selected group of units called a 'Deck' that they can build (or share with friends!) based on nations belonging to NATO or the Warsaw Pact.W:RD takes out the boring aspect of resource collection and keeps the action fast and intense; It is not easy to learn and very hard to master. After 144 hours I still have yet to beat the first campaign. (My perfectionist habits have something to do with that, but only a little bit). Pros:- Obvious learning curve (only a pro if you're into that sort of thing. I am).- Intense, fast paced action.- A lot of units and nations to choose from. Deck building actually got me interested in other nation's military hardware/history.- Multiplayer is great with friends; ignore the overall community in the global chat. Frankly just turn that off.- The AI on higher difficulties punishes you for stupid strategies.Cons:- Lack of tutorial content. (Lots of good stuff on YouTube if you don't have any friends to help you learn).- Maps start to feel a tad boring/same with how many there are. This game could benefit from a lot more maps.- Without your own server you can't host games larger than 4v4. (This game supports 10v10)- Lack of simplified mod support. There are mods, but the support for them could be more streamlined for creators and users.Notes: I'm sure a lot of people may talk about 'balance' and such but I have yet to fully experience the full potential of this game and different potential strategies so I cannot rightly speak about balance yet. Favorite deck style: West Germany Mechanized.This is a definite buy for me. Full price. Even better if you can get it on sale or in a huge Steam sale Wargame pack deal and get the older games, too. See how the series has changed between releases.			"

												Welcome to the land of the Hard Core Gentlmen over 1500 units spanning Land, Sea, & Air representing a Host nations all built an trained to fight... If you step up to the big league ...you better know how. This game is unforgivably hard an multiplayer is even more brutal, for every one tactic, there are 2 or 3 counters so you better bone up on your combined arms tactics quick fast in a hurry. You micro manage logistics making sure your army that you create to form custom decks have the fuel an ammo it needs in real time while overseeing an executing strike taking enemy teritory an denying them resorces. This is a game of punch an counter punch. You have to think big an 2 steps ahead making sure you have the intel and equipment to in the right place to take your objectives, Cause if you loose a unit its gone. The battlefield is fluid an vividly rendered .... your not going to find a better looking game. It is painfully hard with a steep learning curve and it wears it as a badge of honor. If you like RTS's or a Military buff, or you just want to live out your dreams as an armchair general. Do me a favor Get this game you wont regret it.

												Wargame: Red Dragon is an interesting take on the strategy genre. The game takes place through two screens: the map screen and the battle screen. The map screen takes a form similar to that of WW2 planning boards you always see in movies, and is quite novel if not effective. The battle screen is as one might expect: a bird's eye view of the battlefield(with the option to zoom in to an incredible range) but what is interesting is not the screen but the mechanics of battle. If you've ever played almost any other RTS then you'll know ammunition is not usually a feature of those games. However in Wargame: RD you must worry about logistics, you'll need to send in supply trucks to keep your tanks armed and your Helicopters filled with missles.The only real failing point of this game is the lack of the proper tutorial. The entire game is summarisied in text screen tutorials which do little to explain the complex mechanics of war. The RTS afficandio will quickly pick up the tools of the trade but I fear that someone not familiar to the genre might not fare as well.			"

												Grand RTS, a game which rewards the perfect combination combined arms warfare, It's not an easy game to jump right into, but with some practice and persistance, the game really comes together in multiplayer. Because the multiplayer is the main focus of this series, i would recomend either picking this up or 'airland battle' if your new to the series, however due to the community not being so mainstream, the player base in airland battle maybe low, Red dragon has a flurishing community however and definately a game worth your time.

												Only played SP, so read this review for that, not for MP, but am a big fan.  It's the most fun I've had playing a Eugen game SP since RUSE, and a big step up from the mechanics-limited SP campaigns in European Escalation and AirLandBattle.  Great tactical play, enemy AI is interesting and keeps you on your toes, and varied and interesting maps.  Naval combat isn't terribly engaging, but there's no real need to play a lot of it, so it's no biggy.  Highly recommend it for people looking for a quality RTS :).			"

												The game is ok. I waiting for developer to improve the the animation of unit since wargame european escalation it the first game of their series the animation look same they just improve a bit and add mroe unit and air then naval. The air unit isn't bad during airlandbattle but some how the naval is a lot fail may be because in real world each ship have so many gun lolz.I don't know the AI is spam a lot and useless tactic than it should in wargame airland. It a bit confuse me should i recommend this game to you but i said if you love RTS may be yes. But becareful that if you find some game it will be atillery fight rather than tank or infantry or air fight because in Red dragon atillery really powerful which make me boring game a bit.But the good point of this game is their are so many unit but developer lazy a bit as model of infantry look like cloning from the same factory. No camoflage for each unit i mean the infantry. Also the infantry just like a robot. The helicopter landing still my headace as they landing very very slow than they should But the game is still ok. Not many RTS at this time this game is good but not best so if you want to enjoy the animation of infantry fight may be consider go to company of heroes 2 or even world in conflict which 7 year old. This game the developer try to make game less spam as cut the respawn area but i found out it a bit boring because as the map size increase you have to run from the start serious ? it tactic i knowany i recommend for hardcore RTS only			"

Nothing even comes close to how good this game is in scale, control scheme, realism, and thoughtful gameplay.Playing this game should be a mandatory part of high school education. It illustrates in no uncertain terms just how important it is to perserve the peace in the world. When you see squads of infantry with names and faces getting turned into minced meat by 203mm artillery because you ordered them to hold a town at all costs... ...

												Wargame: Red Dragon is an interesting take on the strategy genre. The game takes place through two screens: the map screen and the battle screen. The map screen takes a form similar to that of WW2 planning boards you always see in movies, and is quite novel if not effective. The battle screen is as one might expect: a bird's eye view of the battlefield(with the option to zoom in to an incredible range) but what is interesting is not the screen but the mechanics of battle. If you've ever played almost any other RTS then you'll know ammunition is not usually a feature of those games. However in Wargame: RD you must worry about logistics, you'll need to send in supply trucks to keep your tanks armed and your Helicopters filled with missles.The only real failing point of this game is the lack of the proper tutorial. The entire game is summarisied in text screen tutorials which do little to explain the complex mechanics of war. The RTS afficandio will quickly pick up the tools of the trade but I fear that someone not familiar to the genre might not fare as well.			"

												Overall, one of the best games I have ever played.. I haven't played any multiplayer games yet. But seeing the videos online, playing against humans certainly is different than against the AI. If want to play against the AI, you will find a mixed bag. Sometime the AI is simply overpowered and sometimes it's acceptable. The game, just like any complex strategy game, requires a steep enjoyable learning curve but it is certainly worth it. On the negative side, the game is better played in multiplayer which is a problem for people who doesn't have the time or friends interested. The game could use some better terrains system. I can consider this as a future development. I am looking forward to see the next iteration and I would like to see the following:1. Better AI. 2. Better terrain system that can give more depth to the game. 3. Modding 4. Better campaign  If I choose only one thing to ask, it will be better terrain system, building to hide in, real towns and cities, ability to build ground defenses (mines, sand bags, camps and so), ability use the commandos and infantry in more deep way). The game is really good in terms of weapons management and selection but the maps are not interactive.  Will definitely buy the next iteration. Modding is what makes the PC games superior.  "

												Although the game takes a little adapting to, Wargame: Red Dragon is a unique RTS experience. With a competitive multiplayer and pretty good singleplayer (albeit with wildly differing playstyles, as the AI is rather different to a 'real' player). However, my preferred method of play is the AI Skirmish - there's nothing quite like giving the AI hordes of cheap tanks and taking them on with a hand-picked selection of my favourite units! Truly a game with something for every type of RTS gamer!Oh, and one more thing: The developers have released 2 free DLC packs for this game, and, at the time of writing, they're working on a third to upgrade the Scandinavian nations from the previous game (you can play them, but they're sub-par) to the same standard as the others and add some new maps. Support FreeLC! Buy this awesome game!			"

												Pros: Great RTS, good multiplayer, good graphics.  I love to play this game, my friend and I play this all the time, and the DLC is free.  Games are easy to get into, you can find multiplayer games on any difficulty.Cons: AI.  I have a few problems with the AI in this game. 1. Whenever I try to play the campaign, I lose, even on easy, the AI somehow has enough great tanks from 1000 points to bum rush and defend against 4 K1s.  2. Stupid stuff- My friend and I sometimes play against AI.  Whenever we get to the last zone the enemy controls, and destroy their command, the game doesn't end, which it should if you destroy their last command, and we spend 30 minutes looking for it (we don't quit because it will put a loss on your record) and we finally find it hidden in forests in the middle of the map, and even right next to out main base!  It is literally trying to find a needle in a hay stack.  3. Balancing- I played a 4v4 game (3 very hard AI and I vs 4 medium AI) and the 4 medium AI won! (I did better than all the very hard AI).  4.  Spam- I had to make my own deck for the AI to use because every time I play against AI that is using a regular deck, they buy commands and billions of attack helicopters that frustrates me to no end.Overall:  I love this game and highly recommend it.  Yeah, the AI has some problems, but multiplayer is very fun, plus, how can you beat free DLC?  Worth the price!			"

This game is very competitive and it requires thinking in order to conduct your moves on the battlefield. In addition to this game, to the developers, I recommend that you guys add Israel into this game. Israel has a good defence force and I was wondering if you can add Israel, since they have a world reknown military and I think that as a Nation, it can go good in this game.			"

Posted: February 18, 2015
												From a newcomer with no experience with the prior games, but one who has been obsessing with this one for the past 3 days or so: Wargame is an amazing endeavour and is one of the most in-depth RTS's on Steam.The Wargame series is heavily influenced by World In Crisis, another WWIII RTS, and if you've played that game, you'll be familiar with the broad strokes. The biggest difference is one of scale. In WiC, an armored commander will end up controlling maybe 3-4 heavy tanks and a couple other random units once he's maxxed out. In Wargame, a player with an armored deck (more on decks in a minute) will *start* the game with maybe 8 heavy tanks, or else mass hordes off lesser or obsolete tanks, in addition to support... and it goes up from there. The maps are also truly massive, with even the smaller ones roughly 100km by 100km and going up from there -- the scale is more in line with the first Supreme Commander. Within that vast distance, even specialized commanders must jostle with multiple control groups of their frontline guys, recon, supply/logistics (this is a big one), air defense, and so forth.Like WiC, the game is built around hard counters, with even the mightiest unit reduced to scrap in seconds if it meets its counter. The key is recon, to know what the enemy has and where, so that you may counter it. Are they sending in mass hordes of tanks? If your recon spots it in time, you can counter with helis or Maverick-armed AT planes. Does the enemy have an assload of AA? Keep your helis/planes far away, and charge your own armor or light vehicles in. Do they have a bioball of massed infantry in a town? Time for your arty to step up -- or even better, napalm-equipped units. All of this depends on having good recon to know what counter you need to bring onto the field.As far as the much-derired naval content goes: Yes, I'm sure the pure-navy maps suck. But coastline maps are where your navy shines. You do not command capital ships in this game -- think more along the lines of patrol boats. And every deck gets free naval units the player may build if he chooses. Completely ignoring the water parts of these maps is a valid strategy, letting you concentrate everything on your land and air; but on the other hand, owning the water denies the shoreline to the enemy, and the heavy AA of most ships gives you an excellent no-fly zone.I mentioned supply and logistics. All units have only limited ammo, some more limited than others; all units besides infantry also have fuel; and, naturally, units need healing after taking damage in combat. Supply units take care of all these needs, but the supply units are all vulnerable and die if an enemy even looks at them wrong. This adds an extra dimension to combat not found in most of these games.The graphics are servicable, and are mostly enjoyed in replays. In-game, you will be too busy to enjoy them, similar to Supreme Commander: you're zoomed-out, dealing with icons. Sounds are also basic and servicable; unit prompts are always in the unit's tongue.As far as decks go: this is one of the greatest innovations of the game. A deck is the selection of units you bring into a match. Decks can be generalist, or (in the spirit of WiC) focused on armored, air, etc; focused decks give you bonuses to focused units at the expense of reduced options everywhere else. You can draw units from the entirety of your faction (NATO + Japan/S.Korea, or else WarPac + China/N.Korea), or you can limit yourself to just a few or even one nation for further bonuses at the cost of, again, reduced options. (Want to play as Denmark fighting against the Soviet Union? This game has your back!) You can and will spend hours simply building various ""decks"" you can bring into a game.The AI is servicable, but limited. It will keep a new player on their toes, but its quirks will soon be learned by even the novice. It ""fast moves"" on roads too much; it never buys ships on coastal maps; it seems confused on what to do with infantry. On the other hand, it can build a mean armored column that will take you by surprise and back it up with gunships and AA. If you want the AI fighting at its best, give it a more armored and support-focused deck that neglects infantry.On that note, it should be mentioned that the multiplayer community of this game is filled with racists and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. You are better off with people you know IRL.Anyway, if you are looking for an incredibly deep RTS with a steep learning curve, yet one that eschews the APM-centric style of most RTS's, you've come to the right place.

												Wargame: Red Dragon is an RTS expandalone, so there is no need to buy the other games. In a genre defined by dogma, this game is a beacon of hope. This game has many western and eastern countries, set between 1970 to 2000. This game attempts to strive for realistic depictions of real life hardware.There is no base building, you create your army before venturing into the flames of battle. It does this in an addictive deck system, in which you can pick and choose your units. There are a staggering amount of choices, including motorized infantry, mechanized infantry, tanks, helicopters, hq units, supply units, planes, and others. The scope of the maps matches the scope of the deck system, including massive maps built for combined ops. This allows for massive engagements with semi-realistic weapon ranges.Even though this is the third game in the franchise, it does have obvious flaws. One of such is the infantry. Infantry moves strangely, with speed and animation not synchronizing. The formations of the infantry is often staggered circles, they do not take cover unless you shove them in structures. For some reason, tanks and other vehicles cannot use coaxial machine guns. These another factors contribute to make this game's tactical side to appear shallow. There are no strategic bombers or missile launchers, and the ship combat is grossly scaled down and simplified. This game features multiple ""dynamic"" campaigns, which are annoying but pretty well crafted. The skirmish and multiplayer are solid. The multiplayer features a very ecstatic community, if you take it with a grain of salt it can be vary humourous. In conclusion, this game is a fresh new take on RTS, only one of its kind, however it suffers from a lack of polish and attention to detail. I cannot wait until the next installment.8/10 "

												Let me assume that you like a rts games, may be with emphasis on tactics. Let me also assume that you are intrested in mordern warfare, realistic one, with a full variety of war machines... I think you will be intrested in this game.This game isn't a simulator, there are no real parameters of vehicles, there is no accurate ballistics, there is no physically based armor penetration. This game utilizes a really impressive, tuned for balance and scales of the game, set of parameters to imitate combat like a real one. And what is more important, it does it quite well. The number of fractions and available war machines are very impressive, nevertheless some intresting vehicles are absent . There are two blocks - Nato + Allies (Blue) and Warsaw Pact + Allies (Red). Every fraction has it's pros and cons, but overall Reds a less accurate, but more endurable, while Blues vice versa.The single missions are not very important and can be considered as a training before you jump in multiplayer games. They are all about hypotetical conflicts and quiet entertainig. Unfortunately your experience in these missions won't help you much in multiplayer games. In latter ones you will suffer, because there are a lot of skilled players. They know tactical tricks, they have a good micro, they know maps. Thus it would be much better to play with a friends.As a summary, Red Dragon is an intresting realistic-like strategy game with emphasis on a multiplayer game, if you like rts genre, you should probably try this game.

												Pros: Great RTS, good multiplayer, good graphics.  I love to play this game, my friend and I play this all the time, and the DLC is free.  Games are easy to get into, you can find multiplayer games on any difficulty.Cons: AI.  I have a few problems with the AI in this game. 1. Whenever I try to play the campaign, I lose, even on easy, the AI somehow has enough great tanks from 1000 points to bum rush and defend against 4 K1s.  2. Stupid stuff- My friend and I sometimes play against AI.  Whenever we get to the last zone the enemy controls, and destroy their command, the game doesn't end, which it should if you destroy their last command, and we spend 30 minutes looking for it (we don't quit because it will put a loss on your record) and we finally find it hidden in forests in the middle of the map, and even right next to out main base!  It is literally trying to find a needle in a hay stack.  3. Balancing- I played a 4v4 game (3 very hard AI and I vs 4 medium AI) and the 4 medium AI won! (I did better than all the very hard AI).  4.  Spam- I had to make my own deck for the AI to use because every time I play against AI that is using a regular deck, they buy commands and billions of attack helicopters that frustrates me to no end.Overall:  I love this game and highly recommend it.  Yeah, the AI has some problems, but multiplayer is very fun, plus, how can you beat free DLC?  Worth the price!			"

												Overall, one of the best games I have ever played.. I haven't played any multiplayer games yet. But seeing the videos online, playing against humans certainly is different than against the AI. If want to play against the AI, you will find a mixed bag. Sometime the AI is simply overpowered and sometimes it's acceptable. The game, just like any complex strategy game, requires a steep enjoyable learning curve but it is certainly worth it. On the negative side, the game is better played in multiplayer which is a problem for people who doesn't have the time or friends interested. The game could use some better terrains system. I can consider this as a future development. I am looking forward to see the next iteration and I would like to see the following:1. Better AI. 2. Better terrain system that can give more depth to the game. 3. Modding 4. Better campaign  If I choose only one thing to ask, it will be better terrain system, building to hide in, real towns and cities, ability to build ground defenses (mines, sand bags, camps and so), ability use the commandos and infantry in more deep way). The game is really good in terms of weapons management and selection but the maps are not interactive.  Will definitely buy the next iteration. Modding is what makes the PC games superior.  "

												I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys real time stratergy games (rts) and enjoys playing war related games. This game is very competitive and it requires thinking in order to conduct your moves on the battlefield. In addition to this game, to the developers, I recommend that you guys add Israel into this game. Israel has a good defence force and I was wondering if you can add Israel, since they have a world reknown military and I think that as a Nation, it can go good in this game.			"

												Although the game takes a little adapting to, Wargame: Red Dragon is a unique RTS experience. With a competitive multiplayer and pretty good singleplayer (albeit with wildly differing playstyles, as the AI is rather different to a 'real' player). However, my preferred method of play is the AI Skirmish - there's nothing quite like giving the AI hordes of cheap tanks and taking them on with a hand-picked selection of my favourite units! Truly a game with something for every type of RTS gamer!Oh, and one more thing: The developers have released 2 free DLC packs for this game, and, at the time of writing, they're working on a third to upgrade the Scandinavian nations from the previous game (you can play them, but they're sub-par) to the same standard as the others and add some new maps. Support FreeLC! Buy this awesome game!			"

												It was very hard for me to fully summarize all interesting & facinating aspects of this game, since that  every setting , every element connected with mechanized warfare attracts military fans like myself. After the entire a hundred hours of playing default campaign(25) and Outposts (75), I managed to recommand it to three of my friends and now we Netplay every few days, of course they're also military fans. Actually I mean, not close to C&C or RA, neither does it like CS1.6/CS:GO or other FPS, first of all you need to be interested in military affairs, which those previous games does not require. Also, you have to be very clear what those equipment & troopers are for, what they can do during a battle, and how can you reach the best cost-effectiveness ratio rather than gathering a collection of bad choices. It is kind of like the Art of War, containing certain military theories if you noticed, which sets a very hig threshold for normal players. Anyway, ￥79 is definately worthy.			"

												Wargame: Red Dragon is an RTS expandalone, so there is no need to buy the other games. In a genre defined by dogma, this game is a beacon of hope. This game has many western and eastern countries, set between 1970 to 2000. This game attempts to strive for realistic depictions of real life hardware.There is no base building, you create your army before venturing into the flames of battle. It does this in an addictive deck system, in which you can pick and choose your units. There are a staggering amount of choices, including motorized infantry, mechanized infantry, tanks, helicopters, hq units, supply units, planes, and others. The scope of the maps matches the scope of the deck system, including massive maps built for combined ops. This allows for massive engagements with semi-realistic weapon ranges.Even though this is the third game in the franchise, it does have obvious flaws. One of such is the infantry. Infantry moves strangely, with speed and animation not synchronizing. The formations of the infantry is often staggered circles, they do not take cover unless you shove them in structures. For some reason, tanks and other vehicles cannot use coaxial machine guns. These another factors contribute to make this game's tactical side to appear shallow. There are no strategic bombers or missile launchers, and the ship combat is grossly scaled down and simplified. This game features multiple ""dynamic"" campaigns, which are annoying but pretty well crafted. The skirmish and multiplayer are solid. The multiplayer features a very ecstatic community, if you take it with a grain of salt it can be vary humourous. In conclusion, this game is a fresh new take on RTS, only one of its kind, however it suffers from a lack of polish and attention to detail. I cannot wait until the next installment.8/10 "

												It is a good RTS, but it is hard to learn. Deep and rewarding the day for this RTS has passed a bit. The community has boiled down to die hards with anyone with under 200 games being considered bad or a smerf. It has every unit from the cold war you know of any many you don't, decent graphics, an okay single player, and really fun 10v10 mp brawls. Best played with a team of people who know what they are doing it is a really good game. Pick it up on sale, find a group to play MP with, or just give the single player a wirl just remember the AI are dumb as bricks and have to cheat as a result. Really just stick to MP 10v10s and have some fun.			"

												Absolutely engrossing as a real time strategy game although a little deep if you are not familiar with the genre. Best played with friends of a similar skill level to have a fun experience. This is the first RTS game I've got properly in to and after an initial (and considerable) learning curve I'm really struck by how solidly made and deep this game is. There is quite a high barrier to entry here and you will be frustrated at first by tactics or units you are unfamiliar with.   If you are new to RTS games or even the Wargame series I'd recommend playing against friends at first - as the difficulty ceiling is so high, you'd be spending hundreds of hours to become competitive with other players who already have a good understanding of the game. Unfortunately the AI appears not to be able to fight you in the same way a player would and this becomes more and more apparent whilst playing against real opponents.   I had no technical issues with this game at all and the it runs remarkably well considering the graphical detail on screen.  If you are a long time RTS player or new to the genre all together there is enough depth here to keep you hooked for a long time.			"

												A truly fantastic RTS, this game really should go up on the shelf alongside Command and Conquer, World and Conflict, and all of the other classic Real Time Strategy games out there. Wargame: Red Dragon is the refreshing 2014 installment and sequel to the 2013 Wargame: Airland Battle. Red Dragon is the third installment in the series and provides new features and choices for gameplay while retaining the best features of the Wargame: ALB. This time the Cold War moves from it's Theater of War in Northern Europe to the Pacific and Eastern Asia. Fans of the previous Wargames franchise as well as players new to the series will be really delited with this latest sequel as developer Eugen Systems debuts it's 2014 installment in the Wargames series. Oh Yeah, did I mention they added Naval Combat?!Singleplayer:For those of you who have played Wargames before, whetehr it be Wargame: European Escalation or Wargame: Airland Battle, you will know that the plot line for the franchise is set in a ficticious alternate historical timeline set in the late 1970's and well into the 1980's. Wargame: Red Dragon features four new campaign plot lines set during the cold war in Asia; each is set in a different time with a different faction. The reason there are four different campaigns is because of the fact that each campaign goes along with a difficulty setting: command the South Korean military forces in order to repel an overwhelming North Korean invasion force on Easy Difficulty. Try reigniting the Sino-Soviet border conflict as the Chinese on Medium Difficulty. Repel an immense offensive by the PLA of China in an attempt to reclaim Hong Kong as the British on Hard Difficulty. And for the finale, lead a conquest of the Japanese mainland before the American forces can arrive in order to support their comrades in distress as the Soviet Union on Very Hard difficulty. So, with all of these different campaigns the player is given more choice in how they go about tackling a situation then in most RTS campaigns which I found to be really enjoyable since the game conforms to your playing style. I think that the developers of this game did a great job in not just the way the game plays but also in the storyline in order to make it as realistic as possible but still balanced enough to fight a fair war. Choosing the late Cold War as a time to set an RTS is really interesting because weaponry and warfare are still balanced at this point between either the PACT faction or the allied NATO forces. The context of the setting takes place before the information era so weapons systems haven't quite yet reach a point a point where a drone strike can whipe out a unit of hostil forces with the push of a button from all the other side of the globe. This games storyline and multiplayer provides two different ideologically parted empires waging violent and destructive skirmishes across the globe. While Wargame: Red Dragon's campaign is a fantastic embodiement of these features and incorporating them into it's storyline, the only thing that bugged me a bit was how in the singleplayer storyline the conflicts didn't seem to have much connection to each other and should have been drawnout longer. Multiplayer: While the Wargame series is infamous for it's setting during the Cold War, the embodiement of these factors is better brought out through the multiplayer experience. Set on a number of maps throughout Asia (I presume) the multiplayer element feels the same and doesn't stray too much from Wargame: ALB with the exception of new Asia based factions and units added to the game. In terms of map diversity however, the game does feel a bit different in the details. The more traditional maps of the first two Wargame installments were set in European countryside towns with some Urban presence including buildings for infantry to duke it out in, but usually it would be forests and farms. Wargame: Red Dragon's maps are different both visually and aesthetically. Since the addition of naval warfare to the series, the maps in Wargame generally revolve around coastal areas with dense jungle and plots of rice farms. The forests have now generally been replaced by jungle. One of the latest items of the maps for this game I was excited about was the introduction of denser maps which means more urban areas and denser jungles which really allowed for the tank battles to take place further away then the infantry battles. The overall experience of Wargame multiplayer feels like it's gotten a refreshing new update and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a good pop-in and pop-out RTS.  "

												Perhaps the best modern based RTS game I've ever played, this game is amazing, expansive and a load of fun. It is rather complex and to succeed you may need to change your mindframe into overdrive, but this game is just incredible. I recommend this 100%			"

												Having played both wargame's prior to Red Dragon this game is definitely going in the right direction. Graphics are great, the sheer scale of the game is best seen on a 10v10 game where it gets mental. Semi-realistic damage models and fun strategic play keep me coming back to this game!			"

												This is one of those games that may feel overwhelming at the beginning but once you start playing it's just GREAT. If you played with plastic soldiers when you were a kid this game is for you. Great level of details for the units and mechanics of combat with a great aereal view makes you feel you are seeing a real combat situation. Also the chance of ""building"" your own decks, as in putting together a specific Combat Group (Airborne, Armored, etc)  from wich you can buy units in combat gives you the chance to really play as Commander with may different possible strategies.The multiplayer part of it is even scarier and harder to get into but extremely rewarding once you get the grasp of it.Edit:I guess its important to say that this is my first ""Wargame"" game, being an old Grognard in war games in general. Also that even if i haven't tried the naval part of the game i smell it won't be as good as the land part.			"

												I'm a single player guy (yes, I know I am missing out on all the fun, but I don't have that much time on my hand). I love the Cold War Scenario turning hot and that is why I loved the Wargame Titels from the start - even though I did see the problems they have. This one has problems too - for me it is basically the Wargame ALB turned out right - just don't play the sea missions. The whole Idea of long range balistic battles is reduced to nothing. This does however not include naval landings (much fun). In my opinion the best wargame titel up to date. But, as beeing a wargame titel, don't play it unless you like the franchise per se.			"

												Absolutely engrossing as a real time strategy game although a little deep if you are not familiar with the genre. Best played with friends of a similar skill level to have a fun experience. This is the first RTS game I've got properly in to and after an initial (and considerable) learning curve I'm really struck by how solidly made and deep this game is. There is quite a high barrier to entry here and you will be frustrated at first by tactics or units you are unfamiliar with.   If you are new to RTS games or even the Wargame series I'd recommend playing against friends at first - as the difficulty ceiling is so high, you'd be spending hundreds of hours to become competitive with other players who already have a good understanding of the game. Unfortunately the AI appears not to be able to fight you in the same way a player would and this becomes more and more apparent whilst playing against real opponents.   I had no technical issues with this game at all and the it runs remarkably well considering the graphical detail on screen.  If you are a long time RTS player or new to the genre all together there is enough depth here to keep you hooked for a long time.			"

												PROS:+its fun+it runs well even on potatoes+its in depth+its challenging+great community *citation needed*+two facions, lots of nations+hundreds of real life units+fun single player campaign+fun single player in general+fun multiplayerCONS:-no playable tutorial, and the tutorial it has is pretty useless-jet spam-cheatsy AI-not as many game modes as the earlier games-cheap unit spamI really really really love this game, like, alot. When I saw this game was on sale i bought the pack for me and two friends at a grand total nearing 50 bucks, a total ♥♥♥♥ing steal honestly.I had seen this game before on youtube and i knew it was something that id love to play. when i installed it and loaded it up the first thing i noticed was that the tutorials are more like simple manuals than anything, infact im really happy i had airland battle because that game comes with a playable tutorial, that showed me many of the basics, afterwards i spent several hours on youtube learning about all sorts of different stuff in the game like tactics, unit types, how to build a decent deck, etc etc.Once I thought i had the basic idea of deck making down i made an american deck and went into a 1v1 against the AI and got my♥♥♥♥♥whooped, i revised this deck several times and have since made dozens of decks for america, with just as many for other nations as well.This brings me to the AI, it is extremely frustrating and seems to carry the same issues with it that the previous games had. it seems to have limitless points and it will always know where your units are. if youve got an ambush set up with whatever unit type, when the enemy arrives, if ever, it will also happen to bring with it what it needs to ♥♥♥♥ your♥♥♥♥♥♥ In other cases they have a large attack elsewhere that forces you to redirect your forces and right when you do that, they come rolling through the now lightly guarded flank you just moved forces from. another thing i noticed is that its either to easy or to hard, medium and easy bots i can steam role so much so that it normally ends in a 15 minute man hunt with every single unit i can muster searching the whole map in one large net that covers everything, however if i play agaisnt a hard bot my units are always out numbered out preformed and destroyed with ease.When i got this series i also bought it for two friends, we hopped into airland battle first and had fun playing the defense game mode and the multiplayer campaign, both of which i was heart brokento see didnt return to red dragon, which is fine, because the 3 it has are fun to play regardless, just kina sucks i cant play those great modes in this new game.The first issue i ran into in this game was deciding what units to use and what nations i should play as. i eventually settled on maining the US and brits and making specialized decks for pretty much every occasion, and decks that covered more than one specialtty and were more generalized. this game has way to many units for me to even begin to memorize honestly, i look at youtubers or listen to players who can identify a vehicle just off of its fire rate, mobility, or its black outline. each of the larger nations have its own one of a kind units, while smaller nations not only use some of their own, but have a large slew  of tech from other nations, one of the most common examples are leopard tanks. some nations even get really old units from WW2 and that makes for some fun custom games with friends or against bots. each of the large nations has its own specialty, with the US your airforce is unmatched and for the UK you have some of the most powerful armor in game. while the game doesnt showcase exact armor values, speeds, or preformances of vehicles, it gives you an accurate representation in values much easier to understand. rather than saying that tank A has this much armor at this angle and this ATGM can pen this much at this angle it will say tank a has 12 armor at the front and this ATGM can pen 20. same thing carries over to planes with their values. there is honestly so much when it comes to units its very overwhelming to many players.one of the biggest issues this game has is the spam of one unit type, it can either ruin your forces because its a♥♥♥♥♥♥idea or ruin your enemies fun because its ♥♥♥♥ing cheap. something that bothers me heavily is jet spam or heli spam, the first half is more true for american forces while the second half more so for russians. with the jets they comletely ♥♥♥♥ing ruin your ground forces and your AA normally cant kill them, or tank all of them out. when it comes to heli spam youll have tanks or infantry roling into a city or jungle and out of nowhere there are dozens of rocket choppers ruining your forces before the enemy sends in its ground forces to slaughter any of the remaining stunned units, and to be fair this is a legit tactic, but  9 times out of 10 your AA cant handle such a large task and will get killed by the choppers. the same can be true for arty, something any nation can spam, but with that you can actually pinpoin the enemies location so generally they either have to move after a volley or two or risk getting killed by counter arty or some kind of plane or heli.another thing is the spam of cheap as dirt units, 60 jacksons, hellcats,chaffees,T3485s, or any other out dated unit costing 10 to 15 points they are often wasteful and its great when your enemy does it but infuriating when your ally does it, now there is nothing wrogn with sending these units onto the exposed flank of heavier armo to take them out or sending them against APCs and such, but spamming 60 or so and rushing the enemy with SU76s is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid.the community itself is very much alive in this game, and is, interesting to say the least, you can meet some great people playing this game  but ill say this, enter warchat at your own risk.all in all this game is excellent, and the issues i listed really get overshadowed by the pros. this game is a super in depth and fun to play RTS i seriously suggest it for any hardcore gamer who likes these kind of games and really wants a challenge.TL;DR REDFOR TANKS BEWARE, THE APACHE LONGBOW IS IN THE AIR			"

												If youre looking for a strategy game with real military hardwares such as tanks, planes, ships and infantry units, get this game. Gameplay is amazing in every way, Everything is quite realistic. Learning how to play this game might be a challange, but you could try playing skrimish games with AI to practice.Online gameplay is fantastic, only thing is teammate leaving you in the middle of a battle.

												I recommend this game highly.. BUT I DO NOT RECOMMEND PRE-BUYING it for the beta if you are looking for naval units that are missing from the other games.   They simply do not exist yet.  They will sooner or later.  But Eugen is trying to fix the 'blob' atmosphere of the naval in a game where blob atmosphere reigns supreme.    People blob tanks, airplanes, infantry, AA... why would they think they wouldn't blob naval?  The only real way this could happen is if boats had a larger collision radius, and could not physically be blobbed, forcing distance between them.This version of the game without naval is superior to Airland battle.  It changes a lot of things and the tactics of playing it change with it.  Its a bit of a learning curve, but BLOBBING = winning.			"

If your looking for a kiddie rock, paper, build order spam like Star Craft this game is NOT for you.  This game is much more advanced in the tactics needed to win most of the time.  The Wargame series is easily the best (non build order spam) RTS games you can buy.  Man up and play multiplayer and learn.  The game is not hard and is not complicated to play but it does require you to make the right calls at the right times with the right unit mix for success.  Or go back and spam zerling or build a victory fleet and think your awesome.  haha.  PS i do like Star Craft but it is like playing with kiddie toys once your learn Wargame.			"

												If you love strategy games in general, with the modern day setting there is no reason not to get this.It is very tactical, has quite a steep learning curve, but only in the sense that you need to understand that everything has a counter. Once you learn which unit does what, the combination of them makes for great gameplay. You should feel comfortable after about 10 + mulitplayer games. It`s an addictive, well polished and great franchise. With around 300+ hours in the previous iteration of this game Wargame Airland Battle, and around 20 + hours in Red Dragon, I cannot recommend this enough. Each tactic has it`s merits, and each player brings something different to the table. Your ability to communicate with team mates, and subsequent manouveres allows for exciting and nail biting intensity. "

The battles are bigger, yet seem more concentrated, units are deadlier, some general concepts have been balanced since Airland Battle.  The new naval units really change the dynamic, but there are maps without them for those who rather just have ground and air fights.

												Wargame: Red DragonA fantastic game that is loads of fun. An improvement over the previous titles, it is now much more of a complete RTS. It is one of the best RTS games available, and requires more realistic tactics, thought and gameplay than other RTS games. Imagine ARMA II as a proper RTS Game with each of the thousands of air, land and sea units have specifications based on real life. Multiplayer is where this game truly shines. The single player is just good as well with a ""pick your own path"" open gameplay. Multiplayer has a steep learning curve, but is well worth it once you understand the game play and functionality. The deck building function of the game is also great fun in its self and gives you the option to build your own unique forces. You'll be constantly trying to perfect your deck to be the best it can be, chopping and changing as your tactics change.			"

												Since the game has pretty much stopped development, I figure I would write a review.I have been invloved with this game since closed alpha and have followed its development quite closely. This game is a blast and as my hours show, my favorite game of all time. The unit choices are amazing, but keep in mind alot of those units you will never touch as they are outdated or useless, still it is quite amazing the level of choice you have. The game is quite simple, you build a deck thats unit choice is determined by its country, coalition (more than 1 nation) and so on. You fill these decks up with various units and play. The campaign is decent apparently, I have never touched it but it is worth playing for new players to get used to the mechanics. The learning curve is quite steep, but is completly worth it in the end. The community, while sometimes cancerous, has an excelent community initiative called the Wargame Learning Program that offers 1 on 1 personal tutoring that is completly free and incredibly helpful. People are more than happy to show you the ropes as the community is quite small and new players (who try ) are very much appreciated. I personally believe that playing with friends is mandatory and makes the experience far better. Since the game is often on sale, I reccomend palying with your mates. Finally, dont get this game for the naval combat, it is a silly gimick and has been completly abandoned by the devs. Ships still lack sounds and it is quite unblanaced. Also FRENCH BIAS IS REAL. Final rating French/10.			"

(Had to wright this review AGAIN from scratch because steam didn't post and save it the last time so bear with me if something seems off or typos.)This is an amazing strategy game and a MUST have for RTS fans. Has a high learning curve so don't expect any handholding. PROS:+ No Unit Limits. (I've had upwards of over 300 units on the field at one time this includes tanks/infantry/vehicles/helicopters, and jets not counting my allies or enemies units.)+ Thousands of Different Units. (Though some are kind of reskins each unit has their own special role on the battle field.)+ VERY Strategic. (Should I postion my infantry in the nearby town and have them take cover in the buildings below or just march a few thousand infantry in forest cover over that mountain and risk getting napalm bombed if spotted by a recon unit.........meh I'll just fire a few hundred artillary rounds at their base camp and try to get lucky.)+ Cinimatic AND Functional. (Not often does a game manage to create so many cinimatic moments yet be fully about a functional playing experience)+ Polished Land Combat. (Land combat is pretty much perfect in this game more on water combat later.)+ Resource Management. (Your Frontline Base(FOB) comes with a set supply number. Pay close attention as this will be your life blood. Your resoures are split into 3 categories Ammo, Fuel, and Spare Parts. Managing to supply units far off will prove to be rather challenging but all the more fun. You have a limited number of units that can deliever supplies with their own varying strengths and weaknesses. Supply ships can be sunk, Cargo Caravans can be stolen/blown to hell, and supply choppers can be shot down so be careful with them in high conflict areas as they will be high priority targets for the enemy.)+ Multiplayer. (Yay for some Nay for others more on that later)+ Lots of Factions. (From Nato, to North Korea, to Russia and many more)CONS:- Water Units/Combat Sucks. (Red Dragon introduced water units into the Wargame franchise and it really shows. What lies before you is a lackluster experience. Water combat is clunky, ship pathing is wonky and besides the many other obscure reasons I'd rather fight a donkey. Ok lame jokes aside the new water units mainly ships with the occasional sea helicopter or jet are sorely under utilized as most players have just given up on water units and maps altogether because of said problems. Not to mention maps that have a heavy water and land mix screw over infantry that ride in vehicles as they can not travel across water and there are no ships that can ferry them across. The only way to get infantry around on a water/land map is if they're helicopter troops. Eugene has something going here but it really needs more work put into it.)- Multiplayer. (1. If you expect to enjoy that glorious 10x10 multiplayer action BEWARE! As the game will kick you if your internet speeds are too slow. Honestly I've never played a multi match until the end because my internet speed  is such garbage. Thankfully the game has a great single player skirmish mode with a very competent AI where most players spend their time.  If you have pretty decent speeds this shouldn't be a problem though. 2. Because of said problems and a few other's finding a multi match may be a bit hard and even if you do the game will kick players for speeds or some may just leave for reasons causing you to be put in a situation where it's almost impossible to win a match.)- No Resupplying of FOBs. (Ok some people are gonna say that's what's so good about the game or that I'm a noob and using too much or I'm not playing strategically or I should have just built more before the start of the game. While that may all be true at times it shouldn't be used as an excuse to cover up such a glaring fault. If this game sales itself as a realistic strategy I don't know how they justify real world bases actually getting supplied but not here. Though you can increase the amount of supplies a FOB has in a txt file in the directory, an ingame feature where you order a resupply for limited amount should have been added.)- NO NEW MAPS! (There's been a lot of reasons given why Eugene hasn't added new maps such as they had to take time from the development to fix bugs and exploits instead . But now they're working on their new game AOA which is taking up all their manpower. What has constantly been requested is a Map Editor or some sort of tools where we the community can make our own maps. The excuses for this not being a thing have been varying and confusing from Eugene not owning the engine the game is made with too maps being too complicated for tools to recreate or something along those lines. Really we have the original maps but having something new to play on would be GREAT at this point)- No Modding Support. (Sure there are a few mods here and there but they're almost unheard of. Some people who have played the game for a long time still don't know their are mods and that mods could even be made for this game. So far there are a fair bit of skins and a few other mods like sandbox but nothing MAJOR grandbreaking like you know.......NEW ♥♥♥♥ING MAPS!!! When Eugene returns to the series they need to seriously think about making the franchise moddable) tl;dr: The game looks good, plays good on land, has ALOT of stuff and resource management but water stuff sucks, multiplayer is jacked for most, NO NEW MAPS and no mod support.Final Rating: 7.5/10  Updated Rating(5/4/2016): 8.5/10Great game but lacks in other areas luckly most of them are non-important. A must buy on sale and a must have for any RTS fan.UPDATE 5/4/2016: I was planning on doing this update to the review MONTHS ago but kept getting side tracked. Anyway the devs have not let us down and updated the game with all new maps FOR FREE! No dlc or microtransactions bull just free updates with new maps. And these were maps of our choosing as well since we had a community vote on it. The maps added new longevity to the game. Now here's hoping Wargame 4 is even better. Updated the rating.			"

												Wargame: Red Dragon will certainly come off a dissapointment to most AirLand Battle players, and while it isn't terrible, there aren't many reasons I could think of to recommend this game over AirLand Battle, especially for its hefty pricetag.To go into detail, let's look at what the game gets right. There is a huge roster expansion, with many new vehicles, factions, and maps. Sadly, most of these new units are reskins of existing ones, but this is true to life, so Eugen deserves some lee-way. The maps are massive and expansive. I am not sure if they are bigger than AirLand Battle, but it sure felt like it. Logistics is more important, as vehicles run out of fuel much quicker and the bigger maps also eat up more fuel. It is an interesting system that adds a dynamic to the game that we haven't seem previously, as going after supply vehicles will actually damage the enemy greatly.Now let us talk about where it goes wrong. Oh, there are so, so many ways this game goes wrong. First and formost is that they screwed up the deck building system. Now, when you make a deck, there are only five open unit slots, where as previous games held all 10 open for use for any deck. The problem is that the game forces you to use specialized decks, but specialization is a bad idea. What if you happen to bring a specialized deck that is vulnerable to the enemy's deck type? Well, you're screwed. The five slots prevent you from making a well-rounded deck. I get they wanted people to have incentive for using specialized decks, but this was not the way to do it. They should provide postive reinforcement for choosing to specialize, like making the bonuses for specialized decks greater (and making their unit restrictions less harsh: many units that certain specializations exclude you from don't even fit into the opposing category, meaning it just removes units for no reason), not by removing stuff that made normal decks good.Balance is all over the ♥♥♥♥ing place. AirLand Battle struck a nice balance, with only the jets being a little overpowered. Now that is flipped on its head. One SAM (or Redfor equivalent) can easily pummel a jet. Sure, anti-air availability has been cut, and so has their ammo, but now planes are weak as♥♥♥♥♥♥and they rarely even reach their traget. They are just a good way of wasting money. Infantry is also useless. Before, putting infantry in buildings was an effective way to ensure that area of the map was basically yours, unless your enemy used specific anti-infantry vehicles to counter. Infantry are now weaker. They die quicker, and their weapons are far less effective against heavy armor. They are, however, cheap. The worst thing is artillery. I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ went through Eugen's Systems combined heads when they thought of making artillery more destructive. Artillery is supposed to be a support tool used for bogging down and enemy and lowering their morale in preparation for a ground attack, but in Red Dragon they are an offensive tool that can snipe units from across the map and continuously pound just about anything (and I do mean anything) to death. Entrentched infantry? Dead meat. Top-teir armor? Be gone after 3 salvos. Even helicopters can get ruined by these things. It is such an abysmal decision and it ruins a game like this, where arguably balance is everything.Then there are navies. actual, proper ship on ship warfare can be fun, but there really isn't much to it. Whoever has more ships wins. You can spam extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥, low-level ships, but nothing will get through their output of fire.These changes completely ruin this game and remove any fun from it. It is replaced with frustration, as opponents cheekily snipe you from across the map (including the all-seeing AI) with artillery, amass fleets of♥♥♥♥♥♥teir boats and tear through everything you have, and make the airforce a complete waste of time and money.I thought Red Dragon would be fun because of the new units and setting, but I just got a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, unbalanced version of AirLand Battle that does not do justice to its predecessor. ALB is more well-rounded and balanced, and it is altogether more fun. Don't be tricked by fanboys throwing heaps of praise on this game, and don't waste your money. By ALB or EE.As a sidenote, there is ONE group of people I can recommend this game to. RD has the easiest and most fair AI of all the Wargame titles. That doesn't mean it is easy or fair, it just means it is actually ♥♥♥♥ing beatable. So if you are mostly a singleplayer type of guy, you should probably pick this up.			"

I would say to avoid naval combat games as they aren't very good, land based combat is much better balanced and less arcade-y.			"

												I've played plenty of strategy games and I can say that Wargame: Red Dragon is the most detailed and realistic strategy game I've ever played. You can create your own deck for Eastern and Western Blocks. If you are an agressive player you can customize it for fast and devastating attacks, If you're an defensive player you can choose powerful artillery units to fire strategic points. There are a lot of different tactics in battlefield. You should also be careful about units morals. They're getting panicked in raids. Comrade, If you like strategy games, this game should be in your collection.			"

												While it has a sharp learning curve, this game is an amazingly crafted RTS with heavily detailed units, a variety of nations and coalitions, and amazingly crafted maps that will affect how you choose to achieve your objectives. It can take a while to get the hang of the amount of things you have to be doing at one time, and you will be crushed handily by computer and human alike in your first few games, but as you get more and more comfortable you will relish in watching infantry be mowed down, tank formations reduced to scrap mettle, and jets knocked out of the sky because of your planning.

												Wargame: Red Dragon is a tactical war game set in the 1970s to as late as 1985, it can be both enjoyed inSingleplayer and Multiplayer.In Singleplayer, there are 5 campaigns based off real life events back then which the players can immerse in.-Busan Pocket [Player - South Korean]-Bear vs. Dragon [Player - China]-Pearl of the Orient [Player - UK]-Climb Mount Narodnaia-Second Korean War [Player - BLUFOR Forces]Each of those campaigns host a different style and strategy of gameplay which the player must adapt to and stand on the winning platform.The developers weren't lying when they said there were over a 1,000+ units in the game,they can all be found in the 'Deck Create' option in the Main Menu.In Multiplayer, the player can also select from a variety of gameplay modes to play from,- Destruction- Conquest- Siege- Vox PopuliEach of these gamemodes host a different kind of objective, for example, in Destruction mode the player has to destroy a certain amount of units which depletes their ""Objective Points"" for each kill, let's say that the enemy has 1,000 points. The player must then destroy units which points are equivalent to the number of ""Objective Points"" that they have.There isn't many flaws in the game and I can say that the game has never once crashed on me or shown me a bug, It's a great game overall, if you don't mind paying $39.00 to play it.

												As the third entry to the series, Wargame Red Dragon brings better graphics and a wider selection of units and retains the characteristics that distinguish itself from any other strategy games. I especially like the new coalition system, in which countries that used to be almost irrelevant can come together and form an alliance. For example, the Eastern Bloc consists of East Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, and each one of them hardly stands on its own, yet when put into a coalition they can be every bit as powerful as the USSR or USA. This makes a huge difference in gameplay, as now basically the entire armory can be seen in action, a very much welcome departure from Airland Battle.Naval Battle is indeed lackluster as many reviewers have pointed out. It just doesn't have the strategic and tactical element of the rest of the game. Take a look at the game room lobby and you will see that hardly any player plays naval.As with all strategy games, there are OP units and OP fractions, yet it really still boils down to what a fraction is good at doing and what the battlefield is like. Maximize their advantages and avoid fighting in areas where they are weaker, pay close attention to the maps and you've set yourself up for an exciting military themed RTS.			"

												The most realistic Wargame to date. Seeing as each game has gotten better and better I have no idea how they can top themselves again. Did I mention the FREE additional content updates they come out with?Even better then the other two. Same game as European Escalation and AirLand Battle but with more units, more nations, and the addition of the Navy and amphibious units. The minor change of adding an amphibious ability to a few vehicles (that have them in real life) changes tatical options dramatically and aircraft, both helicopters and fixed wing, have been expanded. The Navy is what sets this game apart from the other two. Coastal support ships you are my friend! The destroyers are floating battlestations that murder everything they see, at least until your anti-ship missles find them.			"

												Wargame: Red Dragon is hands down one of the best RTS games created in the past 10 years.  If you have a decent graphics card you will notice images that will blow your mind.  Zoom out to see the entire battlefield or zoom in to see the dense foilage and textures on groundhog level.  The variety of units is undeniably spectacular and the gameplay is fantastic.  I wish Eugen would have done a better job at marketing this game to the North American community; because I firmly believe that this would be one of the most popular games played today if they had.  Constant updates and new units to keep the game fresh over time, there are really not enough good things to say about this game.  Absolutley YES I recommend this game.			"

												AHHH! It goes on sale for 75% off 2 weeks after I get it, figures.  Could have had an extra $30 in my wallet for another game as well; but that's besides the point.  It's a great game and offers more over the previous iterations of the series.  Hours upon hours of gameplay to be had, and that's just the single player campaigns.  You could play online for years, no two games will ever be the same.   I would say GET IT NOW!!  It's well worth the $10 US that it is listed for now if you have any interests at all in the RTS genre.   9/10 for high quality unit modeling and gameplay mechanics.  It is at the TOP of its genre.

												Summary:  Great game, and one of the best strategy games on Mac.  If you've ever wanted to command the army of die-cast military figures you played with as a kid, then this is for you.If you're a military buff of any sort, or just love strategy games, this is worth a look.  The amount of detail is incredible.  It's not for everyone.  It has a tough learning curve, and maybe it's just me, but I wish the interface was a little more detailed.  It's definitely heavy on micromanagement, but I've never felt like the game was unfair, just that I wasn't able to keep up.  The campaigns (which I've spent most of my time on) can be brutally difficult (especially the final one), and each one is a bit of a puzzle as you figure out what units to move where.  The ability to speed up or slow down campaign battles is incredibly useful, and a huge improvement over AirLand Battle.I still feel like artillery is a little underpowered, though.			"

												This game is crack, I have wasted my life playing this real time strategy game. Rock paper, scissors is implemented in all the units even though real life wouldn't say so. This keeps the game play fun and easy for anyone. Many countries and thier military units to choose from, make a deck of nato or pact units to fight with. This makes sure spam doesn't happen and fair even balance in the game, and trust me when I say this. No other game brings military strategy to the table like this game. This game stands on its own, nothing can compare to it. This is a must have for any strategy player.			"

												Probably one of the most interesting games I've ever played. Just the units alone make this game garner my attention. There's 1200+! And the gameplay really is a perfection of the RTS gimic of countering. Every unit has a counter, but some counters are better than others, and it's that split-second decision of not only picking counters, but also attacking and defending, that really gives this game it's charm. However, this game certainly isn't perfect. The naval battles basically consist of spamming as many large boats as you can, which really kind of takes away from the constraint of the land and air battles. The learning curve is pretty steep, which isn't helped by the pretty awful community. There is also a lot of rage-quitting in games, with little to no punisment for it. I love this game very much, and if either updates or a sequel could handle these problems, I would be very pleased.			"

												One of the greatest modern RTS games of all time, far better than your average RTS. Features realistic combat between various units from Aircraft and Navies to Infantry and APCs. A small tactical mistake such as losing a strategic road intersection can cost you a battle. The game has a difficult learning curb but still is fun to play. Features every major Warsaw Pact and NATO nation such as ANZAC, UK, USA, USSR, West Germany, Japan, Both Koreas, China and several more nations. Each nation has at least 100-250 different units ranging between every kind of human technological innovation in the Cold War such as Jet Fighters, Anti-Aircraft, Modern Tanks, Rocket Artillery, and much more. The only thing this game needs is major Middle East nations that played a large role in the Cold War such as Iran, Iraq, Israel, Turkey, Syria, and Egypt. Otherwise, this game has over 2000 different units combined, intensely realistic combat, requires the player to make complicated tactical and strategic choices in both campaign, singleplayer, and multiplayer. One of the greatest RTS games of all time, if not the best.10/10			"

												War Game Red Dragon is really good made strategy.  Game consist big spectrum of opportunities.You can play as NATO states or Warsaw Pact or Scandinavian. Game offers create natinal decks or if you want you can create samo mixed decks. Every country has infantry, tank, supply, arty, navy, aircraft and more, more units with its possibilities. Also maps are different and evry unit will act differently so you have to think what type of vehicle or infantry is appropriate to surroundings. Game force players to create coopereation among tanks, infantry, planes and helis. Game also offers single player but in my opinion multi is enough good. There are some funny moments in game. Sometimes reservists can hold some ponit longer that elite units. When you are good in arty you can shoot down helis by it. You can also rush enemy by cheap tanks and for him to waste his ammo. Sometimes planes are running away from battlefield through enemy area and AA has good target.But game is really good to play. Esepcially when you have friends who will play with you.

Its a real time strategy game which is really realistic, top down, great graphics and u got every troop right at the beginning so the skills and experience of the player is everything u got to win. Even though its a good game u dont get addicted to it cause     there´s always a better player who will destroy u and u´ll rage quit, but with every game u learn the tricks of players and can use them for own matches. This game is not really 40€ worth eventhough the work behind definitly is, but there ar some sales every month when u can get it for 10 or 20€ and then u neeeed to get it. "

												The game is fun. Simple as that. Sadly because the mixed reviews, we have a smaller community than the peple over at Airland Battle. They're right of course, W:RD is just airland battle with boats in the mix, but because of the fact that it has the most features I would recommend this game especially for people coming into the series. The game is easy to learn (and no you don't have to read some long♥♥♥♥♥tutorial on the internet... unless you're ""that hardcore"" ) With minor difficulties when you start.PS I'm gonna tell you now that the game's multiplayer is better (and more easy to join a game) with friends.Buy it, play it, Love it.

												As the third entry to the series, Wargame Red Dragon brings better graphics and a wider selection of units and retains the characteristics that distinguish itself from any other strategy games. I especially like the new coalition system, in which countries that used to be almost irrelevant can come together and form an alliance. For example, the Eastern Bloc consists of East Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, and each one of them hardly stands on its own, yet when put into a coalition they can be every bit as powerful as the USSR or USA. This makes a huge difference in gameplay, as now basically the entire armory can be seen in action, a very much welcome departure from Airland Battle.Naval Battle is indeed lackluster as many reviewers have pointed out. It just doesn't have the strategic and tactical element of the rest of the game. Take a look at the game room lobby and you will see that hardly any player plays naval.As with all strategy games, there are OP units and OP fractions, yet it really still boils down to what a fraction is good at doing and what the battlefield is like. Maximize their advantages and avoid fighting in areas where they are weaker, pay close attention to the maps and you've set yourself up for an exciting military themed RTS.			"

Posted: December 31, 2014
												     This is a lengthy review, so if you would rather see the pros and cons, just skip to the bottom.          For those new to the series, Wargame: Red Dragon is the 3rd game in the series. It differs from the first two in that the battles and campaigns take place in Asia, mostly the Korean peninsula, instead of Central and Western Europe. It also differs from the first two in that naval combat is present in this game, but more on that below. Now onto the review.Graphics and Sound     This is first thing most people see when watching the trailer. They don't dissapoint. All three games in the series have amazing graphics, and Red Dragon is no exception. Watch in amazement as dozens of rockets, shells, and rounds pound the enemy and the ground. Craters are left, forest burned down, and entire neighbourhoods destroyed as you fight for control of the strategic sectors scattered around the map. Sounds are also well done. Not only will you see that 500 pound bomb hit the ground, you'll hear it loud and clear. Some explosions can even be heared clear across the map!Campaigns and Skirmish Mode     Singleplayer consists of two game modes: campaigns and skirmish mode. Skirmish mode has stayed the same from the previous games. Not much to say about it, pick your army deck, your enemy, and your map and fight it out. The campaigns are where things have changed. There are currently five campaigns:  Busan Pocket, Bear vs. Dragon, Pearl of the Orient, Climb Mount Narodnaia, and 2nd Korean War(DLC). So far I've tired Bear vs. Dragon and Pearl of the Orient, which are pretty challenging. I've more or less played through Busan Pocket and 2nd Korean War, each of which play well and are pretty balanced.      The main addition to the campaigns is the seperation of units. Unlike Wargame: AirLand Battle where each division had reccon units, tanks, planes, ect., Red Dragon seperates units into armored divisions, infantry divisions and squadrons. I found this an interesting addition, and I think it adds to the game. You'll now have to decide who gets air support, who gets armored units and even who gets proper supply lines. There are drawbacks however. I noticed that there are little or no random events and the strategic options such as commando raids and air reccon arn't present either. While they didn't really affect the campaign overall, I did miss the air reccon.  Naval Battles and Gameplay     For my last trick, I'll talk about the long awaited naval battles! From what I gathered, these were a long awaited addition to the game. Let me just say that if your buying this on account of the naval battles, don't. To be honest, they're harder than the ground battles, and not really in a fun way. If you play as NATO, you'll find yourself massing your fleet of two destroyers and seven PT boats together to avoid the rain of anti-ship missels being thrown at you by the Soviet-Chinease fleet, which is made up of one or two large destroyers, and dozens of light ships. I suppose it could just be me(I didn't really try to conquer the sectors to get more points), but it feels unbalanced. It also felt unrealistic because the larger ships can't fire over obstacles or even very far. If your like me, and your playing this more for the land battles, then you'll enjoy it. The navel aspect means some vehicles can cross rivers, and the PT boats are fun to use on the smaller rivers. Reinforcements can also come by sea in landing craft.     One thing I did notice from all this is the AI has been downgraded a bit from AirLand Battle. I find that the AI is constantly massing units together and rushing me. This usually ends in 90% of the AI's army being destroyed at bridges or other choke points. It did ambush me a few times when I was on the offensive, but overall it seems dumber. Another slightly annoying thing is that when your making custom decks, your now limmited to a certain amount of transports. So if I want to build an airborne army consisting of Huey helicopters, I can only select five units before I have use a different helicopter. Again, It's not a game breaker, but it is a little annoying. I suppose it does challenge you, though, as you'll have to decide who will get the best transports.     So overall, here's what I see:     Pros:        Excellent graphics       Great Sounds       Good campaigns       Lots of new units and new nations       F-86 Sabres with rocket pods!       New naval combat units for you to rule the coastal maps with     Cons        New naval battles a little out of wack       AI seems a little dumber       Deck building a little more complicated       No random events or strategic options     Overall, I've really enjoyed this game, and despite it's few problems, I still reccomend it. It's a good addition to the series and it is a lot of fun. If your on the fence, or still want it for the naval combat, then I'd wait untill it's on sale.			"

												If you enjoy real time strategy games, as a commander looking from a top down point of view on a huge map, with cold-war era armies battling it out with each other with amazing firepower and awesome graphics, this is the game for you!Before you start a (non-campaign) game, you have to create your own deck consisting of different units like infantry, tanks, vehicles, helicopters and jets. And in each category there are many choices of units, whether you prefer stronger but more expensive and in lesser amounts or weaker but cheaper and in higher quantity, and even the type of transports that infantry move around in, be it by helicopter or by apc/ifv. With the diversity that this game provides, you would never get tired of reediting your deck after every game to figure out the best combination for you, and that is one of my favourite parts of the game!The gameplay itself is very good, and the AI is always challenging as they will have point advantages over you according to the difficulty you set of them, ensuring that you never get bored and have a challenge in every game. Gameplay is also not linear, there are many ways you can go about engaging your enemy, be it infantry hiding in buildings to ambush oncoming tanks, using tanks  to make long range engagements, or even sending infantry in helicopter transports to make a sneak attack on the enemy base! The usage of jets is also very satisfying, something that you don't usually have in other rts games. The tactics you could use are limitless, it all comes down to your creativity!10/10			"

												Dang, this game surprised me. I've seen the Wargame series on Steam a couple of times and I knew it was a wartime strategy RTS sort of game but the depth and mechanics of the game surprised me. In the short time I have played it so far, this is a very polished and balanced game, and the developers are attentive to balance issues, which is something I cannot really say about Creative Assembly (or SEGA, or simply ROME 2). This game is basically Total War: Modern Era, and the devs are good. Recommended for anyone who enjoys strategy games and the total war franchise specifically.			"

												Tried of time by time military strategy game ? Then try Wargame Red dragon !! It's a real time strategy game where you are using modern military army in a big map againts the A.I or another player. Over 1000 units to use ( for real ) in 20+ countrieslike U.S.A, France, Canada, USSR , china, etc... Or play in an coalision like the CommonWhealth, Red Dragon coalition, Scandivania, Eurocorps, etc... Want to play a specific style of units ? Just choose armored type and you'll get better tanks or marines type and there you have , for exemple the U.S Marines Corps !! All units have base stats and are effective agains certain enemies in certain scenario. An Enemy front armor is to heavy to pierce for your tank ? Just attack him from the side or behind, he usualy have less armour there ! Want to see your units fighting closely ? Just zoom to him and see the deltail on each vehicules and units !!Hard to learn at first but you'll get used to it !!			"

												This is probably one of the best RTS games of all time. The setting brings alive what was an era of technological innovation coupled with the ideological conflict that spanned the world. Gameplay is not as micro-intensive as most RTS games, however it is rewarded greatly. The game does have some bugs, but they appear rarely.

												Despite the pretty difficult learning curve this game has, once I figured this game out, I found this to be one of the more unique, interesting and fun RTS out there. While there are some balence issues and bugs, the developer is very dedicated to this game and patches and fixes issues in a fairly timley manner. The only complaint I have against this game is that it has an extreamly poor tutorial, and is not very newbie friendly. If you are familar with other RTS and interested in this game, I suggest you look at some gameplay videos of it, as it plays extreamly diffrently to the traditional RTS.			"

												Wargame: Red Dragon is a tactical war game set in the 1970s to as late as 1985, it can be both enjoyed inSingleplayer and Multiplayer.In Singleplayer, there are 5 campaigns based off real life events back then which the players can immerse in.-Busan Pocket [Player - South Korean]-Bear vs. Dragon [Player - China]-Pearl of the Orient [Player - UK]-Climb Mount Narodnaia-Second Korean War [Player - BLUFOR Forces]Each of those campaigns host a different style and strategy of gameplay which the player must adapt to and stand on the winning platform.The developers weren't lying when they said there were over a 1,000+ units in the game,they can all be found in the 'Deck Create' option in the Main Menu.In Multiplayer, the player can also select from a variety of gameplay modes to play from,- Destruction- Conquest- Siege- Vox PopuliEach of these gamemodes host a different kind of objective, for example, in Destruction mode the player has to destroy a certain amount of units which depletes their ""Objective Points"" for each kill, let's say that the enemy has 1,000 points. The player must then destroy units which points are equivalent to the number of ""Objective Points"" that they have.There isn't many flaws in the game and I can say that the game has never once crashed on me or shown me a bug, It's a great game overall, if you don't mind paying $39.00 to play it.

												I love this game and while it has a steep learning curve once you get it you will love it. This is not a traditional RTS but more like a realistic military simulation strategy game. This adds more depth but it also means you need to really think in a strategic way compared to most other RTS strategy games where you win by spaming units. If you want a modern military strategy game that is heavily based on real military strategy instead of the typical RTS strategy game this game is for you.			"

You can choose which type of person you want to be in the game as well. You can be the artillery man of the battle, the spearhead of the operation with your tanks, control the seas with the ships, or have complete air superiority with your planes. The only complaint I have with this game is that there is not a huge emphasis on ships as advertised. I give this game an 8/10 and I highly recommend you play it if you enjoy RTS games.			"

												Alright, so you like RTS games and you're looking for a great one. Let me tell you, you've found it.The newest iteration in the series is great, and even though the new naval combat isn't as great as expected by fans of the franchise, the game itself is an amazing RTS,The only major complaint that that one may have is the steep learning curve: learning all the unit types, how they counter each other, how some are better than others and what strategies to use can be overwhelming to many new players. Because of this and the fact that the game is 100x better when you play with other people, I seriously encourage you to check out the  Wargame Subreddit and its Teamspeak server (Teamspeak address: 92.222.252.202:9990), as all the mods and mentors there will help you learn the game.

												One of the better RTS games I've played. The only other RTS to give me the same rush on multiplayer would be World of Confict. you can feild massive amounts of troops to the battlefeild and if you do not use strategy can still be pushed back. Steamrolling is less susceptable in this game like you would see in company of hereos 2 when facing germans. If your being pushed back use your artillery to pound the land between them and you or if they have a strong defence soften them up with artillary and airstrikes. land marines and vehicles behind their lines, or air assualt infantry into towns to hold the line for a rapid defence. Use destroyers and frigates to pound the coast or smaller ships up rivers to handle pesky amphibious vehicles from sneaking on the other side of the river. The game has a vast arsenal of troops and even after 100+ hours in the game i have not explored all of the different nation's varying units and how to best use them. If your a strategy nut that likes real time over turn based ones this would be a must have for you.Pros: - Very good balanced units between Nato and block forces. you can enter a match and not feel that one side has an advantage over another towards victory. - Having supply lines has always been a nice touch. Dont expect to keep units in a fight for ever. Fuel, ammo, and armor will deterioate over time along with morale. keep them supplied with cargo trucks and cargo helis. -challenging campaigns. -very nice models of vehicles with good accurate weapon names and characteristics. - infantry actually has a role on the battlefeild and wont feel insignificant versus tanks, can do plenty of damage if used properly and are the best units to have when defending parts of the map. in urban environments they are second to none and you'll have to burn them out.Cons: -Ships are lacking somewhat in larger combat classes such as frigates and especially destroyers. No cruisers so don't look. its mostly corvette and smaller style ship warfare using anti-ship missiles enmass.  - AI will always know where your command units are haha, does not matter if they are hidden. They will also artillary strike hidden units that sit in one spot too long even if they have yet to spot them.  - Some balancing is needed in ground based AT missiles still, depending on who you ask the block forces seems to hold an advantage there as many of their tanks are equipped with them. Very good game. I'd give it a 9/10 easily.			"

												This is without a doubt the best RTS I have ever played. Amazingly detailed campaigns which lead to huge multiplayer battles, from 1v1 to 10v10, battles and maps vary from small skirmishes to huge clashes between superpowers. Over 1400 units from numerous nations from NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Wargame: Red Dragon delivers all the best aspects of RTS, and Eugen Studios has now added Naval Warfare into this amazing franchise. Many maps contain the ability to bring in naval reinforcements, leading to naval landings, combined with tanks battles in the open ground, urban warfare in the towns and villages, special forces raids, all with fighter planes circling over head, shooting each other down, or delivering deadly payloads from cluster bombs to napalm. This is a must-buy for anyone who enjoys RTS, whether that be COmpany of Heroes, the Total War series, or even Civilization, this game tops them all. 10/10!			"

												Where to start. This is a late review, very late, but with Eugen you cannot write a review at launch, allow me to explain why.This game, at it's base level, is pretty fun, and pretty good, I will not lie. HOWEVER!!!!Eugen, the developers of this game, ever since the first game in the Wargame series came out, have been notorious for wrecking their games with bad ""Balance"" patches.Red Dragon is no exceptionYou literally cannot get a feel for how to play this game, because every few weeks it seemed Eugen ""WAS"" (I will explain more on the ""Was"" in a bit) releasing ""Balance"" (Read: Not balanced at all) patches. Last week your Radar Anti-Air might have been godly, but this week, it can't hit the broad side of a barn. Your M1A2 tanks might have ruled the field, but the buff to the artillery now makes them big beefy targets, useless, big beefy targets.Imagine, if you will, if a game developer one day, decided to look at it's forums, and released a patch responding to only the chronic whiners on their message boards. Well imagine no more, because that is EXACTLY how Eugen operates. If you have read my review on ""War of the Roses"", you can see the dark side of when a developer ignores it's game in how Fatshark operates. With Eugen, you have the exact opposite. They listen to the community so much, they cannot ""Finish"" the game. It changes it's mind more than a bi-polar woman in a shoe store (I know that's sexist, sorry, I could also go the ""Bi-Polar Fat Guy at McDonald's"" route if you prefer). One week, you finally get the feel for things, everything seems working fine, then squeaky Mc'IOnlyPlayOneArmy 12 year old lays down a lament about how his artillery cannot single handedly win the game for him, this brings along a whole slew of the ""I cannot figure out this game so it's unbalanced"" crew, aaaaaand....Eugen proceeds to ""Fix"" the game to help them.And it's never ""Fixed"", balance swings from NATO to PACT so lopsidedly that instead of realizing what ""Balance"" means, they fix the OTHER side so hard, it creates an vicious cycle. The last large patch that ""Fixed"" the Warsaw pact, also ""Fixed"" a lot of other things. There hasn't been a large patch since, and this was some months ago. (this is why I said ""Was"") earlier.Needless to say, the game is now pretty much dead compared to what it was Pre-Patch.Soon Eugen will release a ""Fix the Scandanavian Nations"" patch. So, again, screw all you know about the game because it's a lie. HOWEVER it should be noted, early previews of the patch seem to be rather, well, underwhelming. But the ""Balance"" that comes with it, should likely wreck the game again, so I will not worry.And the frustrating thing about all of this? I can actually RECOMMEND this game. It's not a BAD game at heart. It's actually a lot of damned fun. It's pretty, easy to get a grasp on, intense, I could go on and on! It's just cool!IF!And I cannot stress this enough, IF, you get a good group of friends to play with. Just like the ""Total War"" series, you need to find people to play with that you can set ground rules with. ""Pubbers"" will almost always exploit the broken units, spamming the hell out of you with Jets and Artillery until your eyes bleed. However, the innovative ""Deck"" system, means you can limit games to certain time frames, army types, ect. ect.And with the right group of people, that can be a blast! There IS strategic depth in this game if you dig deep enough, and set ""House Rules"" that allow them to shine through. Single Player is a waste, I won't even use up too much space to describe it. Just know, it sucks...bad. It has probably the worst AI I have ever seen. It literally ""Cheats"" while trying to make you think it isn't. (Such as, enemy AI units will go RIGHT to your hidden units, surround them, but won't engage until they ""See"" them with Recon) It's like playing with that one♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in high school, that always INSISTED he WASN'T looking at your screen (In my day we had no internet) but you knew ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ well he was.But reluctantly, I will recommend this game, but as I said, find a good group of friends, set some house rules, and pray Eugen doesn't make you have to recreate all of your decks (Armies). Because, oh yeah, I forgot to mention, their ""Updates"" constantly make you go back through and recreate the armies you spent so much time putting together.But! Good Luck and have fun!Here is the summary:Pros:PrettyGood, easy to understand GameplayDeck system is awesome!Free DLC!Pretty fun under the right circumstancesCons:*Miserable ""Public"" play (And a really annoying community, Wargame chat is literally a pool of trolls)*""Fix Patches"" often times cause you to have to recreate all of your armies, and often times swing the game's balance so off, that you have to almost relearn how to play.10v10 games, a highlight of this series, are limited by spam, over-powered units, mass player exodus, lack of maps, and terrible performance issues that have still not been resolved.Single Player is useless, seriously, f**k single player....with a wrench...in the♥♥♥♥♥♥Summary:A great game if you have friends! It may ruin friendships sometimes, it's that intense, but still...they'll get over it.If you want to go into this for the Single Player, or you have no friends and want to make some in the community, too bad.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy (Outside of Call of Duty).			"

												This is probably one of the best RTS games of all time. The setting brings alive what was an era of technological innovation coupled with the ideological conflict that spanned the world. Gameplay is not as micro-intensive as most RTS games, however it is rewarded greatly. The game does have some bugs, but they appear rarely.

												Lots of fun. It takes a little time and breaking the mold of normal rts games.Normal rts strategy games. Get the most powerful unit(s) and spam to win right?Not so much with this game. There are over 1500 different units in this game, ranging from infantry, APC's, trucks, supply trucks, tanks, mobile tank hunters, atgm's, helicopters, mobile sam rocket launchers, airplanes, boats, artillery and more. Every unit has a very specific function, whether it is dedicated anti air, or robust like infantry. There is a lot to learn about this game, but the community is helpful to new players learning, and everyone is always ready for a new challenge.Going back to earlier, spam to win. That doesn't work in this game because you need to balance quality with quantity. You normally have to defend many zones, and if you have your best troops in the center (and hoping they dont die) you have nothing to defend against the 30 squads of rangers creeping through the forest, or many you spent your points more wisely, and you have your own militias to counter, but they have better troops. You need to balance your troops and with a little luck, you may survive the charge.			"

												Wargame: Red Dragon is hands down one of the best RTS games created in the past 10 years.  If you have a decent graphics card you will notice images that will blow your mind.  Zoom out to see the entire battlefield or zoom in to see the dense foilage and textures on groundhog level.  The variety of units is undeniably spectacular and the gameplay is fantastic.  I wish Eugen would have done a better job at marketing this game to the North American community; because I firmly believe that this would be one of the most popular games played today if they had.  Constant updates and new units to keep the game fresh over time, there are really not enough good things to say about this game.  Absolutley YES I recommend this game.			"

This adds more depth but it also means you need to really think in a strategic way compared to most other RTS strategy games where you win by spaming units. If you want a modern military strategy game that is heavily based on real military strategy instead of the typical RTS strategy game this game is for you.			"

You can choose which type of person you want to be in the game as well. You can be the artillery man of the battle, the spearhead of the operation with your tanks, control the seas with the ships, or have complete air superiority with your planes. The only complaint I have with this game is that there is not a huge emphasis on ships as advertised. I give this game an 8/10 and I highly recommend you play it if you enjoy RTS games.			"

												AHHH! It goes on sale for 75% off 2 weeks after I get it, figures.  Could have had an extra $30 in my wallet for another game as well; but that's besides the point.  It's a great game and offers more over the previous iterations of the series.  Hours upon hours of gameplay to be had, and that's just the single player campaigns.  You could play online for years, no two games will ever be the same.   I would say GET IT NOW!!  It's well worth the $10 US that it is listed for now if you have any interests at all in the RTS genre.   9/10 for high quality unit modeling and gameplay mechanics.  It is at the TOP of its genre.

												One of the greatest modern RTS games of all time, far better than your average RTS. Features realistic combat between various units from Aircraft and Navies to Infantry and APCs. A small tactical mistake such as losing a strategic road intersection can cost you a battle. The game has a difficult learning curb but still is fun to play. Features every major Warsaw Pact and NATO nation such as ANZAC, UK, USA, USSR, West Germany, Japan, Both Koreas, China and several more nations. Each nation has at least 100-250 different units ranging between every kind of human technological innovation in the Cold War such as Jet Fighters, Anti-Aircraft, Modern Tanks, Rocket Artillery, and much more. The only thing this game needs is major Middle East nations that played a large role in the Cold War such as Iran, Iraq, Israel, Turkey, Syria, and Egypt. Otherwise, this game has over 2000 different units combined, intensely realistic combat, requires the player to make complicated tactical and strategic choices in both campaign, singleplayer, and multiplayer. One of the greatest RTS games of all time, if not the best.10/10			"

This keeps the game play fun and easy for anyone. Many countries and thier military units to choose from, make a deck of nato or pact units to fight with. This makes sure spam doesn't happen and fair even balance in the game, and trust me when I say this. No other game brings military strategy to the table like this game. This game stands on its own, nothing can compare to it. This is a must have for any strategy player.			"

												Wargame Red Dragon is the best real time tactical game ever made. It has the right amount of arcade components mixed with authenticity providing the best war experience you can get.  If you are searching for a game with a long learning curve, a game that rewards tactical planning and execution look no further. This is the game that will ask your brain to work unlike the 1000 Starcraft type clones out there who rely on reflexes and practice. Tired of overpaid DLC's, not here, Wargame Red Dragon gives you free DLC's and this DLC's are no joke, actual content like new units and maps.Not all is perfect, specially in the balance department, but when a game gives you 1500 different units and dozens of different maps, one can't expect balance to be achieved overnight.

You can create your own deck for Eastern and Western Blocks. If you are an agressive player you can customize it for fast and devastating attacks, If you're an defensive player you can choose powerful artillery units to fire strategic points. There are a lot of different tactics in battlefield. You should also be careful about units morals. They're getting panicked in raids.

												Learning curve is quite steep compared to other RTS I've played. This is because it is not simply about who has the most of best rated units. It comes down to who uses their deck to the fullest extent. For example in Total War games (one of my favorite RTS) you usually end up with a zerg fight at the end of the battle and huge cluster ♥♥♥♥ of units going at it.You could have the best tanks in the game and ♥♥♥♥ up and walk into a city with infratry waiting to amubush you and lose all your units. Thats what I love about the game is there as actual strategy involved, and you can play it many different ways depending on what type of units you like. In General if you love Cold War Era military tech and wonder what♥♥♥♥♥♥would have been like if NATO and Warsaw pact went to war without nukes, this is the game for you.			"

												Summary:  Great game, and one of the best strategy games on Mac.  If you've ever wanted to command the army of die-cast military figures you played with as a kid, then this is for you.If you're a military buff of any sort, or just love strategy games, this is worth a look.  The amount of detail is incredible.  It's not for everyone.  It has a tough learning curve, and maybe it's just me, but I wish the interface was a little more detailed.  It's definitely heavy on micromanagement, but I've never felt like the game was unfair, just that I wasn't able to keep up.  The campaigns (which I've spent most of my time on) can be brutally difficult (especially the final one), and each one is a bit of a puzzle as you figure out what units to move where.  The ability to speed up or slow down campaign battles is incredibly useful, and a huge improvement over AirLand Battle.I still feel like artillery is a little underpowered, though.			"

												Okay first, I know I don't have alot of hours in to it for right now. But still I don't think my review would've changed.Second the only thing i'm not happy about is the learning curve (it's HUGE), very difficult to start if you don't have any experience in this game genre. This is the first game I have in the RTS genre and it was not easy to learn. After watching alot of tutorials and gameplay I got the basic of the game (still though). I found it very weird of them to only give tutorials in the form of text (The text wasn't even helpfull). Still the graphics are amazing, same for the gameplay (If you get the hang of it). And the huge 15 v 15 battles! Oh my god, just amazing. So yeah, for new players, the learning curve is huge! The graphics and giant battles are amazing!So if you get the hang of it, it's an amazing game!			"

												Pretty good game.  Naval matches do need some work, they typically devolve into numbers based slugfests.  Additionally naval units lack some commands that would make them more effective.  This game uses a class system ie. armored, marine, support) with each class having unique units that aren't available to other classes.  In order to be at its best, teams need a blend of classes.  In addition to being able to play as nations, you can also play as coalitions.  For example, you can play as england, ANZAC (Australia and New Zealand), and Canada, or you can play as the Commonwealth that has units form all three.  Overall this is a pretty good game.			"

												There's three games to the Wargame series, and in my opinion this is the best. A lot of people will disagree with me, and say that the 2nd; Air Land Battle was the best. However, this one here adds a completely new realm to the series; naval combat. I've played the second, and to this, this is much better. Not because of naval combat, but ""stuff"".The Red Dragon version is just into ""stuff"". You load up the game in some sort of military command room lit with ominous red lights and given 16,000 units to chose from. Yes. Sixteen thousand! Now, a lot of the units are just different units with different weapons, but I'd say 75% of them are completely modeled, textured, for their roll. Now, the issue I had when I loaded this up was to understand the difference between a ""USA Marine Stinger"" and a ""USA Marine Igla"" was. The two weapons are anti-air, have the same strength and so on. And you'll realize how confusing it is when you are juggling tons of units.The game play is completely different to all other RTS. You really need to coordinate with your team. Tell them to flank here or there, smoke a certain position to cover retreating units, send recon helicopters behind enemy lines near a mountain top and spot what ever they're doing. Don't expect to walk into a game and win. You'll either lose the ones you play, or just be carried by some amazing commander. The Campaign is lack luster. Not amazing. It's good for starting out, mainly for practice. But I would rather do skirmish battles. They're a little more fun, and you have more freedom. There isn't even a story so to speek. Would I reccomend this? Yes. It's a great game. I don't have much hours because I don't really have someone I can trust in a battle to protect me from getting flanked. And that's an issue you'll run into. Many unskilled players. So you either learn quickly, or dominate the other team.I'd get this if you want a change to most generic military RTS's out there. Just get ready for the incredable learning curve this game offers. "

												When I first played this game it confused the crap out of me...  I didn't understand it, and thought it would explain itself as I played the campaign...  Little help did that do...  I then started playing skrimish matches, trying to understand this game.  Later did I find out what the deck really was, then as I played more and more and experimented with more and more the more I began to understand this game.Now that I know the weapon types, skill, level, and tactics to use, I know quite a bit about this game now...  now no I'm still not a stratigic Master, however the more and more I play with others and find their strategies, the more and more I begin to know.  Now I still consider myself a noob at this game, but the more I understand it, the more I find out about how to do things...So about the game, let me tell it to you like this... It is kind of like chess, however the peices have already been set up by you and your opponent, and another thing... you don't know where they set theirs up at and they don't know where you set yours, now,  once you find the peice and thing you want to make a capture with your peice that is already in position... you have to consider if there are other peices out there they can use to take your peice you just used, or if you have peices that you think they can't see in position ready to help that peice once captured...  So take it like a mix of chess and battleship...  you don't know where they are, but when you find them how will they react to your attack, or defenceI give this game a 7/10 and recommend it to anyone who likes real time strategy on the battlefield that you can control a bunch opf units at one time.

												Definitely a strategy game worth acquiring to fill a role in your library. Similiar to Company of Heros series, but still clearly its own game. Has several unique moments, and highly rewards the player that learns unit capabilities and tactics.Pros: Interesting strategy game has new features over previous installments in the seriesCons: Not a welcoming game to new comers, be prepared to lose consistently in even the easy campaign until you pick up the tips and tricks of the trade			"

												Wargame is a very cool game. It makes me come back to play it even if I lose most of the time. Pro:+ The game is esthetically pleasing and very detailed.In the game you can see the entire theatre of war from above and get a perfect view of the overall progression of the battle. Or you zoom in to the grunts seeing them assaulting, devastating and dying with flamethrowers, cluster bombs, mortars etc.It looks just like in the trailer.+AVAILABLE NUMBER OF UNITSI guess they have about 1500 units in this game. Each one beautifully detailed with their own country typical weapons and decals. This is concerning the land armies. The naval units are not typical to every nation. There are Russian and Chinese and American typical units. This might also be due to the fact that small nations don't have the money to develop their own warships. Anyway, 1500 units is good to me. I have to admit that there are also a lot of units that are just copies from other nations with another decal. An example for this is the leopard tank. It's a solid unit and that's why you can find it in nearly every NATO nation’s army. But even this tank has sometimes different stats depending on the nation.+ Air to Air and Air to Ground and Air to Ship combat is the best simulated one I know in a strategy game. It's very nice and a plus to the game since air land battle.+ONLINE BATTLESOnline battles are the bread and the butter of the game. So you will end up playing against other players most of the time. It is definitely a solid gameplay. I have to say it is hard for beginners so you better invest time to get to know your units. Which is kind of a draw back if you just wanna jump on the online game and defeat others like nothing? This is not what is going to happen. You will lose a lot of times before you win. This is because the game has a lot depth due to its huge number of available units. My mind set on playing online changed from ""I want to win the game"" to ""I want to give the enemy a run for their money"". + UNIT SELECTIONThe selection of the units is a really based on a really good system. You have lets say 55 points to put units into your unit card deck. A unit card deck defines the amount and kind of units you're leading into battle. You can increase these points to get more cards. So you can deploy more units or you invest points to get better units but less of them. You can also specialise your deck to lets say airborne. This means you have all good fighters, choppers plus Arial prototype units available but you are badly equipped with ground units. This system enables role play for you and your friends and is fun on the battlefield. It also forces army variation. BUGS:- When you zoom in to a place on the map where a battle was commenced, there is a graphic bug at times. The craters of the bombs appear above the ground and not in the ground. Single Player:- The single player is a complete different experience to the online game. With different I mean it is weaker. You have a strategy map with a lot of territories (maps) to fight on, which is good and a nice Idea because this way a campaign is fought on maps according to your decisions. This is a nice idea, BUT there are always some strategic more valuable territories to play on then others. This results in playing over and over again on the same map. The Idea is nice but it's not well thought through. - On top of this is the AI. It's not clever and in my opinion it didn't get better over the series. After 3 games you know what it is after and you can adjust yourself to it. The only challenge is the number of troops that are thrown at you. - Presentation of the single player got weaker with the series progression. Meaning it was the best in Wargame European Escalation and it's the weakest in Red Dragon in my opinion. Air Land Battle isn't a far cry from Red Dragon so you decide which one is worse. :)What exactly is weaker on the presentation?:In European escalation you have an introducing video after each mission played. It's not much but it's better than a screenshot show or some artwork colleagues who tell you what to do. This is what you can expect in Wargame red Dragon, cartoon colleagues with speech bubbles. In total I would say the single player is a tutorial to get you ready for the real deal, the online matches.- The Ship battles are boring. Let's sum it up to ""The player with the biggest host of naval units wins."" That’s it.BAD THINGS IN ONLINE PLAY:ARTY SPAM:A lot of people use artillery spam. This is pointless in my view because everybody can do this and it only drains resources of your team. It doesn't kill a lot of enemies; it stuns them at best and kills some infantry and light vehicles. But in the end it's just over used.PEOPLE WITH NO BALLS:If you join a game 10 vs. 10 Players you wait at first ages until the lobby is full and the game can begin. As soon as you are on the battlefield and start playing you can be sure somebody left the lobby already. Or and this is when it comes to the low number of balls. People leave the game when the see that there team isn't doing so well. This in turn makes the game short since if people leave the remaining people have to manage additional units left from the gone player. Micro mgmt. becomes a pain and you know you can't win since the enemy team has more players to manage their troops. GAME ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO LEAVE ONLINE MATCHESThe best thing is that the game encourages players to leave a game. Since there is a game mod that counts the number and the value of the units you lost and destroyed. If you are the last player on the map because you're a man that fights to the last man you get punished on the statistics. Because you are the one who lost the most units. It's just natural that the last player left loses the most units. So statistically wise the one player that was the best one because he didn't leave is the worst one.So this is it about my review. I hope it helped you to get an Idea about that game and if you will give it a try or not. And my personal thump up to you if you did read the entire thing.			"

												One of the better RTS games I've played. The only other RTS to give me the same rush on multiplayer would be World of Confict. you can feild massive amounts of troops to the battlefeild and if you do not use strategy can still be pushed back. Steamrolling is less susceptable in this game like you would see in company of hereos 2 when facing germans. If your being pushed back use your artillery to pound the land between them and you or if they have a strong defence soften them up with artillary and airstrikes. land marines and vehicles behind their lines, or air assualt infantry into towns to hold the line for a rapid defence. Use destroyers and frigates to pound the coast or smaller ships up rivers to handle pesky amphibious vehicles from sneaking on the other side of the river. The game has a vast arsenal of troops and even after 100+ hours in the game i have not explored all of the different nation's varying units and how to best use them. If your a strategy nut that likes real time over turn based ones this would be a must have for you.Pros: - Very good balanced units between Nato and block forces. you can enter a match and not feel that one side has an advantage over another towards victory. - Having supply lines has always been a nice touch. Dont expect to keep units in a fight for ever. Fuel, ammo, and armor will deterioate over time along with morale. keep them supplied with cargo trucks and cargo helis. -challenging campaigns. -very nice models of vehicles with good accurate weapon names and characteristics. - infantry actually has a role on the battlefeild and wont feel insignificant versus tanks, can do plenty of damage if used properly and are the best units to have when defending parts of the map. in urban environments they are second to none and you'll have to burn them out.Cons: -Ships are lacking somewhat in larger combat classes such as frigates and especially destroyers. No cruisers so don't look. its mostly corvette and smaller style ship warfare using anti-ship missiles enmass.  - AI will always know where your command units are haha, does not matter if they are hidden. They will also artillary strike hidden units that sit in one spot too long even if they have yet to spot them.  - Some balancing is needed in ground based AT missiles still, depending on who you ask the block forces seems to hold an advantage there as many of their tanks are equipped with them. Very good game. I'd give it a 9/10 easily.			"

												Alright, so you like RTS games and you're looking for a great one. Let me tell you, you've found it.The newest iteration in the series is great, and even though the new naval combat isn't as great as expected by fans of the franchise, the game itself is an amazing RTS,The only major complaint that that one may have is the steep learning curve: learning all the unit types, how they counter each other, how some are better than others and what strategies to use can be overwhelming to many new players. Because of this and the fact that the game is 100x better when you play with other people, I seriously encourage you to check out the  Wargame Subreddit and its Teamspeak server (Teamspeak address: 92.222.252.202:9990), as all the mods and mentors there will help you learn the game.

												War Game Red Dragon is really good made strategy.  Game consist big spectrum of opportunities.You can play as NATO states or Warsaw Pact or Scandinavian. Game offers create natinal decks or if you want you can create samo mixed decks. Every country has infantry, tank, supply, arty, navy, aircraft and more, more units with its possibilities. Also maps are different and evry unit will act differently so you have to think what type of vehicle or infantry is appropriate to surroundings. Game force players to create coopereation among tanks, infantry, planes and helis. Game also offers single player but in my opinion multi is enough good. There are some funny moments in game. Sometimes reservists can hold some ponit longer that elite units. When you are good in arty you can shoot down helis by it. You can also rush enemy by cheap tanks and for him to waste his ammo. Sometimes planes are running away from battlefield through enemy area and AA has good target.But game is really good to play. Esepcially when you have friends who will play with you. It is possible to create really good team to♥♥♥♥♥♥enemies.			"

The game is easy to learn (and no you don't have to read some long♥♥♥♥♥tutorial on the internet... unless you're ""that hardcore"" ) With minor difficulties when you start.PS I'm gonna tell you now that the game's multiplayer is better (and more easy to join a game) with friends.Buy it, play it, Love it.

												Massive improvement over Airland Battle, in nearly all aspects - from general gameplay like micro and macro management, to graphics and visuals. The new maps feature much more varied terrain than the previous game(s) and you'll need to think your tactics through with the specific terrain of each map in mind. The number of units nearly doubled, with new factions being added, and the existing factions getting some extra units, since the timeline has been extended to the mid '90s. The size of fielded forces in a deck has also increased, considering the somewhat larger maps and need to prepare for all types of confrontations (land, sea, air), or to further specialize with thematic decks (marine, motorized, airborne, etc.)Best part, though is that you can play as Best Korea. 10/10 GOTY.Edited later: Now they have Israel and Yugoslavia is only a few days away. The world's best kebab removal duo is in the gamme. How can you NOT want to play this?			"

This is a game where spamming tanks will not work, you need to balance your forces, like have some tanks, air support, maybe a couple attack helicopters, infantry (infantry help alot), and the list goes on. The amount of detail they put into the units is amazing and there are so many units to choose from, over 1000 units and 17 nations. There are 4 different single player campaigns you can choose from, all have a very good stories and very realistic/believable stories.			"

												Simple enough to pick up and play, but complex enough to sink in dozens of hours and still be far from mastering.My only gripe is the single player campaigns, although dynamic enough to be different from playthrough to playthrough, there just isn't enough of them, the scale is miniscule compared to what could be offered and the AI is lacking and makes strange decisions throughout - severely hamstringing the experience.

												Recommend this game to any strategy fans. Depth of detail is amazing. The game lets you layer your strategy, and the amount of different units and their stats means you have to really think about your plan to win. This game extends far beyond the ""paper, scissor rock"" format of many other strategy games.			"

												It was very hard to start playing this game but the more I play it more I like it now. I play only multiplayer because AI in games seems to be very dumb . So I do not recommend it for singleplayer.Also new player be advised - play only against noobs like yourself at start, do not play against stacked teams. This game has it flaws but it is the one of the kind and I do not know any game that is better in this genre.			"

												(Detailed Pros and Cons at the bottom)First off, So you disregard all of those bad reviews about software problems. I havent had a single crash yet. You may want to reinstall or check something that is wrong with your computer maybe you dont have the required hardware...idk, but I can tell you dont reject this because because of those reviews.Now This is a HUGE RTS with like many people are saying has a huge learning curve. You'll get the hang of it pretty easy but you will spend many months if you wish to master it. Maybe even years. I got this game at the beginning of this week and I already have 48 hours (Ive been sick, thank god i had this game.) This game honestly reminds me a lot of Close Combat:A Bridge to Far but in a larger scale. I Recommand this game to anyone that loves RTS, Military tactical game, Master a game and not take a day. I honestly wasnt going to get this game, until I saw a bunch of my friends get it. I was going to ask if it was worth getting it but I had 30 mins left for it to be on sale so I had no time to ask so I brought it and Im glad i did.Pros:Campaigns: You have multiple campaigns with extra features then multiplayer. You control entire warsOver 1000 Units: Overwhelming but great to see the amount of stuff they put into this gameDeck Building and Customization: You'll never see another player have the same deck. Unless you copy theirs.Environment: Detail is amazing. Zoom in til your in the middle of streets while a battle rages, or zoom out into mapMultiplayer: Great for playing with friends, thats all i do. Its a great feeling when you out do someone in this game.Master: Learn from your mistakes, watch replays, edit your army, fix your strategy, Win or Repeat. No easy COD killsMirco Managing: To master you need to mirco manage, It not that the Units are dumb as some reviews said. Its more you need to do alil more work if you want your units where you want. I understand this could be a Con to some people.Cons:Tutorial: This has to be #1 because yes it has a ""tutorial"" but its start up reading. There is no playable tutorial which really sucked. If you have the time, youll learn from playing...single player, multiplayer, even ask me...I'll tell you what I know. If you have the time read the ""tutorial"" because it has a lot of useful info. Its a lot of reading tho.Gamemodes: Just 3, could easily add more for this kind of game. 1 of which 90% of the community play.AI: The AI is dumb sometimes when it come to the gamemode. They are more trying to kill you then doing the objective.If you like games that you figure out and be good right away this game isnt for you. There is just far too much stuff to learn you'll never learn everything. It's i think 40$, I got it on sale. Would I recommand this game for full price. Yes but ONLY if your a HARDCORE RTS player and your friends all had it and played everyday. If not but you still want it then you can maybe wait for it to go on sale again. I dont buy anything full price so. Anyway hope you get it, hope you enjoy, message me if you have any questions or wanta play. My friends and I welcome everyone and we enjoy helping players out.			"

												I have to admit, Wargame is something that requires patience, a high toleration of frustration and even more practice to master, but once you got to a point where you understand what to do and what not, it is pretty amazing.It requires so much micromanagement to successfully overwhelm your enemy (assuming he's human, that is) that you won't even have time to grab a sip of coffee. It really teaches you to actually read the description of a unit and use common sense. Spamming 20 Tanks will cause your enemy to either ambush them with AT Infantry or call in an airstrike - and you can kiss these tanks goodbye.In StarCraft or CnC, it wouldn't matter - but here? If your Leopard is gone, it's gone. The crew is dead, the vehicle destroyed, and they won't come back.Sometimes, you feel so desperate but turn it around, sometimes you are so full of yourself that a single mistake will cause the deaths of all of your soldiers.If you want complex action and a lot of stuff to learn, Wargame is for you.If you want quick skirmishes with brainless rushes, play CnC or StarCraft (not saying either of the two is bad!).

												Very high learning curve, a lot to manage and figure out... but totally worth it. It's like World in Conflict on crack. Many of the same concepts as World in Conflict also exist here, but significantly more fleshed out, technical, and realistic. The generic unit archetypes of WiC are replaced by meticulously-modelled real-world military hardware from the latter half of the 20th century, but have fairly easy to understand stats and weapons. There is also a huge wealth of nations and their respective hardware. While obviously the majority of the hardware is Soviet or American, the other major nations of the 20th century are all well-represented with a mix of their own weapons and imports from the superpowers.Once you start to learn the intricacies of the game, it becomes a lot of fun, further amplified by the deck-building system which lets you create your own custom battle force. You can specialize in air power, tanks, infantry, and all other manner of battalion-level formations. Similarly, you can play generic NATO or Warsaw, or specific nations with access to those nations' newest top-of-the-line hardware.Very intricate, very fun.			"

												Absolutely recommend this game! One of the best games ever released. Every battle is intense, no such thing as a boring match. No game is perfect, yet for all the tiny detials involved, it is amazing! Nothing compares to this game. No such thing as base building, it is straight up battles. Sound strategy plus good tactics are a most. Graphics are amazing. Gameplay, for all the units and all the details, amazing! I def consider myself a huge fan of the franchise and will keep supporting! One of the best game developers in that they follow through with their game, upgrading it constantly and making sure it is finely tuned. Unlike many other games, the newest released game is better than its predecesor. I rate this game as highly as AoE and Rome. Def recommend it and will continue to recommend it!			"

												Could you imagine what would happen if Cold War becomes hot? Well you don't have to, just play Wargame. In the whole Wargame series (European escalation, Airland battle and Red dragon) you can see many different scenarios that were very possible just 25 years ago. Whats more units are very realistic and you have to know pros and cons of them. For example even well camouflaged  old T-34 can be lethal for M1 Abrams or well used Swedish reservists can stop soviet paratroopers. Pros+a lot of different, realistic units+interesting scenarios+really nice multiplayer+ability to create your own decks to make your army more suitable to your tactics+free DLCsCons-there are no all Warsaw Pact countries like Romania or Hungary (I can't find other disadvantages)In conclusion, if you like RTS games you should buy it.

												This is my first RTS purchased on Steam and it's certainly going to be my last because no RTS compares to Wargame: Red Dragon in terms of depth, eye candy, difficulty, realism and entertainment!I don't even need to entail why. Look gameplay footage of this game. Now compare that to spamming bunch of units of one type in a tight cluster attacking another set of units in a tight cluster with a 5 inch distance between the two groups like you see in other RTS's. Case closed.If you're a scrub-weakling like me then I hope you have a lot of patience and love for the game element because this game is ABSOLUTELY ruthless and you really have to dig across the internet to get every bit of knowledge needed just to figure out what to do. Then comes execution and I find this game challenges your micromanaging abilities but not so much that it's Starcraft AZN APM or die level. It's just that you need both to do well.I still recommend this game to beginners because there are valid alternatives via doing comp stomps (You and rl people versus the AI), Single-Player Skirmish Mode or just simply finding a weaker player than you. Just note that you should pursue 1v1's instead because 10v10's diminish your ability to influence games. Plus, all RTS's are a pain to learn so really seeking easier RTS to get gud at will still leave you feeling frustrated, especially since this is the BEST RTS ever in terms of realism, graphics and gameplay YET YOU DON'T OWN IT because you're still playing Battle of Toontow...err I mean RA 3.Expert RTS'ers should buy this because I'm obviously qualified to tell you so. Really though, I'm not a expert RTS'er so I'm in the dark about everything.Watching replays is quite a satori though. Especially if you're a beginner and you win you first match and it's well executed.Also qualifies as a educational game. Good for the children to teach or just those who like learning new things about real life military equipment and outfits.Community is toxic. Much worse than the World of Tanks community from my experience.Tl:Dr: Best RTS ever with the same hard af learning curve. Good for beginners because all RTS'es are hard to learn either way and might as well pick up a S tier RTS. Extreme challenge with extreme rewards.10/10PS: Dark Souls of RTS games?			"

												Very high learning curve, a lot to manage and figure out... but totally worth it. It's like World in Conflict on crack. Many of the same concepts as World in Conflict also exist here, but significantly more fleshed out, technical, and realistic. The generic unit archetypes of WiC are replaced by meticulously-modelled real-world military hardware from the latter half of the 20th century, but have fairly easy to understand stats and weapons. There is also a huge wealth of nations and their respective hardware. While obviously the majority of the hardware is Soviet or American, the other major nations of the 20th century are all well-represented with a mix of their own weapons and imports from the superpowers.Once you start to learn the intricacies of the game, it becomes a lot of fun, further amplified by the deck-building system which lets you create your own custom battle force. You can specialize in air power, tanks, infantry, and all other manner of battalion-level formations. Similarly, you can play generic NATO or Warsaw, or specific nations with access to those nations' newest top-of-the-line hardware.Very intricate, very fun.			"

												would have to be the best strategy game i have ever played. hundreds of units and no 2 multiplayer games are ever usually the same.  it has a steep learning curve but is quite rewarding once you get the hang of it. the type of game where u can wreck your enemies supply line with a few airlifted infantry squads.sas > most.the only downside is that i believe the naval aspect needs to be looked at better.generally large scale naval warfare is a spamfest.10/10 would redut again			"

												I wanted to love this game.  It had so much going for it - it was following up on two really good games, it had improved on some of the weaknesses of the older games.  It was going to have a naval component.It turned out to be much too ambitious.  The naval aspect was a question of who could spam more anti-ship missiles, there were few ships to chose from, and Eugen didnt even bother to add engine noise.   The single player campaigns are boring - a war across the most heavily defended border in the world comes across as a slap-fight.  There isnt much in the way of policing the multi - so expect TKs, nazis, racists, name calling.  You know, everything that's wrong with online gaming.This could be forgiven, if it werent for Eugen's policy of Nerf-or-Nothin' - every few months, we'd get an 'update' which radically changed the specs on the game's units - what you could buy, how strong they were, etc.  It was maddening - and not new - they did the same thing with Wargame ALB.Even THAT could be forgiven, if the game werent so unstable.  Stuttering is commonplace, CTD is commonplace.  Stuttering that turns to locking is commonplace.  Sometimes giving RD the three-fingered salute doesnt kill it - I discovered the game was still running in the background after last crash, despite having closed it in Manager.  Why is my GPU running at 70C at rest?  Oh, RD is still running.I really wanted to like this game.  There was so much potential.  But Eugen should have gone with its first thought, and just released it as a DLC.-DonEDIT:9/28/16Hey, look, they released the Low Countries for money.  Yeah, well, I'm not gonna spend more money .... uh...where are my aircraft?  You released a DLC - that I dont even own - that still screwed up my decks?  Not all of them, just most, so if I want to play the game I've got to go through the lot, figure out which ones are now missing their aircraft, and re-add them.  Oh, and you've done it for naval aircraft too!  Hey, so now I have a second round of going though and re-adding - not all my decks, just some - just to make it that much more of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥  Thanks, Eugen, you'll never see another dime of my money.EDIT:10/4/16  You ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  You ♥♥♥♥ing did it again.

The dizzying array of units to choose from is enough to keep you occupied for thousands of hours.  Game runs smoothly, player base is active, sounds are satisfactory, music a little repetitive, and pathing is fair enough.  You will remain a noob for many scores of hours if you're totally new to the Wargame franchise.  I can't say whether that should dishearten or encourage you.

												Wargame Red dragon puts you in command of a massive arsenal of cold war weaponry allowing you to out think your opponent and counter him before he can counter back. The thriving community and chat alone contribute so much to this game and make it even better than similar games. When I first started I sucked, and you will probably also suck to begin with. I mean I doubt you will memorize all 1400 units before playing your first multiplayer match, if you do then you are awesome. But my first few matches were fun and they still are now that i am no longer a novice. Even though I lost I still had fun, and you know a game is doing somthing right when even losing is fun. This game has tremendous replay potental in the Multiplayer though the campaign doesn't have the best AI. No two games will ever have be the same because of unit diversity. I reccomend reading Sandy Gunfoxes 200 page guide here on steam or in google docs if you are new to the seris to help familiarize you with the basics and unlearn conventional RTS strategies and adopt real world tactics which this game relies on. This game is amazing, and if you get bored of the game (which I doubt will happen anytime soon) you can sit in chat and talk about all sorts of things from the F-35 fighter jet to the Syrian crisis with the community. This game should be owned by anyone who loves military strategy and/or history. 10/10			"

												If you love RTS games, you will fall in love with this. Make sure you have a beefy computer and a good amount of time on your hands as these games generally are not short. Be sure to watch TONS of videos on this game and read a lot of guides to understand the sheer depth of this game. Realism, great graphics, satisfying to the core. Go watch some gameplay and be amazed as you control units on the sea, air, and land all at once while supporting each other.Once you make your purchase, you will find you really payed for a chat room with a great game added on.

												Fantastic game, with a huge array of options within the game regarding strats. However, when playing the DPRK (North Korea) there is only one viable strategy:1 - Deploy2 - Think everything is going well3 - Inexplicably die4 - Blame it on equipment and the Westerners5 - Repeat steps 1-410/10. True Korean is Best Korea.			"

												How do I start,A couple years ago I had a friend of mine introduce me to ALB and I was instantly in love with the franchise. I don't see myself as a hardcore gamer but more as a casual gamer. However, Wargame basically said ""♥♥♥♥ you"" and took control of every second of free time I had and made me a hardcore gamer that loved exterminating RedFor decks and trolling poor fools in multiplayer maps with my sneaky Longbows and potential spies on their teams telling me where their CVs were.When Red Dragon came out I spent endless nights slaughtering poorly built/researched North Korean and Chinese decks with my modern uberpowered European deck. What's a Scandanavian coalition doing in Korea? Idgaf it's cool♥♥♥♥♥♥so don't ask why. Basically this game took control of my life, had me realize my friends are incompetent/dickbrains, made me late for school many times and maybe even♥♥♥♥♥♥in a bottle.Buy this game if you're ready to expend countless hours of your life screaming, crying, touching yourself because of chub airstrikes, encountering real strategical challenges and making tactical decisions due to the dynamic nature of the game play.♥♥♥♥ B-5s,John Lenin11/10			"

												I wanted to love this game.  It had so much going for it - it was following up on two really good games, it had improved on some of the weaknesses of the older games.  It was going to have a naval component.It turned out to be much too ambitious.  The naval aspect was a question of who could spam more anti-ship missiles, there were few ships to chose from, and Eugen didnt even bother to add engine noise.   The single player campaigns are boring - a war across the most heavily defended border in the world comes across as a slap-fight.  There isnt much in the way of policing the multi - so expect TKs, nazis, racists, name calling.  You know, everything that's wrong with online gaming.This could be forgiven, if it werent for Eugen's policy of Nerf-or-Nothin' - every few months, we'd get an 'update' which radically changed the specs on the game's units - what you could buy, how strong they were, etc.  It was maddening - and not new - they did the same thing with Wargame ALB.Even THAT could be forgiven, if the game werent so unstable.  Stuttering is commonplace, CTD is commonplace.  Stuttering that turns to locking is commonplace.  Sometimes giving RD the three-fingered salute doesnt kill it - I discovered the game was still running in the background after last crash, despite having closed it in Manager.  Why is my GPU running at 70C at rest?  Oh, RD is still running.I really wanted to like this game.  There was so much potential.  But Eugen should have gone with its first thought, and just released it as a DLC.-DonEDIT:9/28/16Hey, look, they released the Low Countries for money.  Yeah, well, I'm not gonna spend more money .... uh...where are my aircraft?  You released a DLC - that I dont even own - that still screwed up my decks?  Not all of them, just most, so if I want to play the game I've got to go through the lot, figure out which ones are now missing their aircraft, and re-add them.  Oh, and you've done it for naval aircraft too!  Hey, so now I have a second round of going though and re-adding - not all my decks, just some - just to make it that much more of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥  Thanks, Eugen, you'll never see another dime of my money.EDIT:10/4/16  You ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  You ♥♥♥♥ing did it again.  Now none of the units which had the stealth fighter have it.  Stuff is missing from the Soviet decks.  You ♥♥♥♥ing incompetent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.  A professional company would have made changes when the DLC was bought.  A great company would give the DLC to its loyal customers.  Remeber doing that?  Remember how great we thought you were when you added stuff to ALB free of charge?  Really made me eager to buy your next product. Under new management, I guess. ♥♥♥♥♥♥heads.			"

												The third Wargame... game takes you to East Asia and lets you slaughter hordes of crappy Chinese and North Korean military units. It also added ships and small-scale naval battles. Those are not quite as good as the land battles, but thankfully there's still plenty of land-fighting action to be had.The single-player campaigns are better done than what was in ALB by having a proper story structure and events, but it suffers from repetition as you fight on the same battle maps constantly since the enemy keeps attackin and you keep making them die horribly. Also there's multiplayer. I'm sure that's fine too, but truthfully I never really felt like playing it because how I play this game seems much better suited for singleplayer. I guess that means I am a dummy. :(Anyway, this game is pretty good. Have fun! ^_^			"

												Pros: Challenging but rewarding. Extremely detailed graphics and units. Red Dragon seamlessly integrates air and sea combat into the foundation laid by European Escalation. You will lose days of your life, because the game will engross you. Like, seriously, pack a lunch if you plan on playing a match, because it's going to last a while (I love that). The only Cold War force missing is Cuba, and knowing Eugen, it's probably in the works.Cons: Lack of depth in naval units; the game only has twenty or so naval units out of maybe two or three hundred, but it leads you to believe there are more. Wish there was, frankly. There is a learning curve and it is steep; the game is unforgiving, and if you make a mistake you *will* pay for it. The game could use some video tutorials. As an addendum to that last, it's in game tutorials are woefully inadequate. There's a feeling that the developer expects you to muddle through, and this game is not forgiving enough for that. If Starcraft I/II are go fish, Red Dragon is a world championship chess match. Red Dragon is if anything more forgiving than it's predecessors, but it is definitely not easy to just pick up and play.TL;DNR (?): This game isn't for everyone, but if you're looking for beautiful graphics, glorious depth, realism, and a challenge, I highly commend it. If you just want simple RTS to play casually, RUN AWAY FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY. That said? Omigyad I love this game. "

												The best installment of the series IMHO. Highly recommended for anyone who is interested in intricate RTS games and military technology!An in-depth, somewhat realistic approach to modern warfare, with a relatively steep learning curve and a micro management intensive gameplay that will keep you pinned to the computer for hours. (Or scare you away, but do not be afraid! It is truly worth your patience).I absolutely love it. Make a deck/army to use out of more than a thousand units, different infantry sections and vehicle variants and then carefully manage your Leopard tank to rock Soviet armour... or set up an ambush with infantry waiting for the enemy vehicles to pass, just to active RPGs, when they can fire a devastating sideshot into weak parts of enemy armour.... there are lots of such tactical possibilites, thanks to the well thought-out combat system.This is not a rock-paper-scissor game like Starcraft. Just like in real life, every gun matters if properly used... no matter how elite your infantry is, it will get mowed down by the cheapest LMG on open ground, if you are not managing it properly and utilise cover and so aswell, the mightiest MBT can fall to auto cannon fire, should an IFV manage to sneak behind it.Truly a very enjoyable mix of reality and gameplay-balance decisions. I am sure everyone can find his way to fight in this game, especially in gigantic battles with 20 players, where everyone counts.Not to mention the absolutely stunning video engine, bringing great scaling and visuals, while retaining a good performance.A great game for every wholehearted strategy fan.

												This. F***ing. Game. Seriously one of the best RTS out there. It is really on a whole nother level than the COH series, or any rts for that matter. The attention to detail in the units is stunning (more talking about their armaments and pros/cons, but the renders are nice too) a good amount of effects found in combat are modeled in game, including morale, being stunned, failure of different systems if they are hit (firing computer reset, gearbox hit, ammo sorage hit (BOOM) etc). Word to the wise though. This is not your sit down, hop on, crush people. The learning curve is steep with this one. If you dont have some semblence of an idea of what type of armor is rolling down the road towards you, chances are theyre going to roll right through whatever you have if not equipped properly. Wargame: Red Dragon is easily the best RTS out there in my opinion.			"

												First of all: This is a love or hate title. The learning curve is quite steep and you will get smacked in the multiplayer for the first 10 hours (don't buy this game if you want to play against AI - it's horrible). But that is why I love this game: It took me forever to get used to all the hidden mechanics. I am biased in a way due to over a thousand hours played, but I genuinly believe that it is the most refined, in-depth depiction of a cold war gone hot. If your are into complex, challenging RTS set in the cold war, this is basically the only game available to you. Give it a try when it's on sale again.			"

												The Wargame series is a visually impressive quasi modern day RTS. The focus is on unit command instead of base building or economic development. I'm personally a fan of games that move away from the building RTS genre. Notable games such as the Ground Control and Total War series come to mind. If you enjoyed those games and also have an interest in modern day combat, I would highly recommend the Wargame series. Specifically to Red Dragon, it is clear this is the latest iteration of the series as the amount of content is truly impressive. The multiplayer experience is excellent in custom created games, however it is lacking certain aspects. As opposed to AirLand Battle there is currently no co op campaign. There is also a fundamental flaw regarding skirmishes in multiplayer verse the AI, there is a high occurance of dsync. If you enjoy regiment size or larger command games this game should be on your list.			"

												Now to many Airland players you may think this is just Airland with more troops and sickass naval combat, I thought the exact samething but its not. When you play this game things have been changed good and bad EX: good, more units with diffrent roles, Bad, I miss my Lav-25 for my marines :( . Not only that but you fell like your in a entire diffrent game, new tactics to learn, diffrent deck combos, and having to learn alot more new enemys and what thier capabilty is. Now for those non-wargame/ Airland players, this game is a unique RTS game, with land, air, and sea. It will chalenge you at first and most of the community will help you on your way to learn the basic's. But never underestamate the enemy, expect any little dirty move that they might use aginst you and always flank. Finaly i think this is a great additon to the Wargame treeline. 9.25/10			"

Some issues with the navy biggest blop usually wins in a straight naval battle, however in a combined battle (navy + ground forces) the use of tactics can win it for you. Great game dispite what peoples complaints, the game is even better when you dont have to rely on randoms. IMO its better to get 2 or 3 friends together to keep a cordinated battlefield. 9/10(navy could do with some tweaking)			"

												Ok, first note: this game is first and foremost a multiplayer game. To enter the MP may feel difficult in the beginning, but once you're in it's great fun! My advice for newer players: go look at some YT videos, although Razzman may be the best in the game, I'd advice stealth17 even more as he is more focussed at learning new players stuff. He also has rookie nights so I'd have a look at that. Besides that: just ask for some help, but not at the ingame wargame chat! (that chat is ****) You can comment on certain videos, or go to the forums, the wargane reddit page etc. Just ask for tips and tricks, and maybe there is someone willing to learn you a thing or two personally. All in all a great game, but you have to be willing to 1: keep learning and 2: be willing to learn from your defeats as well. With the good mindset you can have many hours of fun in this game!			"

												Nice and detailed wargame with Cold War(and beyond) units. Has a bit of a problem with historical accuracy though. As one game veteran put it a long time ago:""yea. i know, but is alternative history hereUSSR is the world's best airforce and navyUSA has the best AA and tank force but extremely crap infantry cause hollywood makes them badWest german troops are bodybuilders ,all of them can carry the heavy mg3 fire on the move, while the USSR infantry are ww2 movies and have the light pkm shooting peanutsFrance is a super power that brings the main force in the second korean warUK cannot into AA or navy but exploits their colony's infantry really wellNorth Korea gets super tech thanks to unicorn magic while China is just derpy derp, HK beats us! Japan doesnt know how to arm their airplanesScandinavia has the biggest population in the world where they get 15men reserve infantry""Despite these problems, I still recommend it if you're into wargames or Cold War era military hardware.

												Pros: - Tons of content and free DLC (aside from the newest DLC, which is $6)- The variety of maps and units keeps the game fun and interesting even with 480hrs of play time. - Incredible detail just in general. - Campaign is fun and can be challenging. Cons:- Match-making is awful. Most sessions are either in-game, setting up, or debriefing. Of the few that are open, most are nearly empty (you'd wait forever for the required number of players to join and the game to begin). Of the handful of games that have a decent amount of people in the lobby, most of those are almost always on the same 3 or 4 maps. - Players leave the match as soon as their team starts losing since there are no repercussions for doing so. - The units of the players that leave are given to another player. If half the team leaves, a single player can have half of their team's units. It's too much for anyone to handle, so guess what? they leave too.- A single person with a bad connection can slow the entire match down for everyone else.			"

												I think Red Dragon is the best part of Wargame series, first of all because of the naval branch is presented and affects campaings a lot especially in shore landing operations. Second of all is an ability to mix combat groups in sector during the fight it allows player to create more versatile force to fight various threats. And generally speaking i like Wargame series very much, especially campaigns, this series much beyyer than act of aggression or any other rts.			"

												All in all, Wargame as a series trumps the RTS genera in my opinion. The game has a steep learning curve but, it's well worth the effort, probably one of the most realist RTS game out there and by far the most encompassing as far as tactics are concerned.      The community can be VERY toxic and of little help but on occasion you run into some nice folks from time to time. Red Dragons Campaign is abysmal and far to complex for what it is and as there was in Air-Land Battle there is no Cooperative play in Campaign mode in Red Dragon.  i give Red dragon A 7 out of 10....If you like HARD CORE Real Time strategy game, this one if for you... if you don't, move along.

												Wargame is back! This time though, You won't be shelling German towns or sneaking in Scandinavian forests, You'll be burning poor asian women and children with napalm one more time! Thats right, The Wargame Theatre of War is now Asia!The game controls the same as EE and AirLand, but the folks at Eugen have added another layer of tactical micromanagement- Sea battles. The units never cease to amaze me how one second I can be applauding their perfect executions of my plans... To wondering how such braindead soldiers even understand the concept of breathing.Nevertheless, The game still proves it is fun, challenging and intellegent even if it feels like AirLand battle with the prototype date pushed back to '95. The addition of the new counties is always welcome, and Japan, China, North and South Korea, and Australia fit perfectly in the numerous factions. The addition of coalitions and the reworking of deck types makes building and customizing decks an extremly fun pass time.But newcomers to series be warned: THIS GAME HAS A LEARNING CURVE THAT RIVALS EVE. That's right, don't expect to drop in and beginning distributing letal doses of freedom, and the tutorials aren't worth jackshit. Still, If you got the balls and are willing to sick it out, the game is immensely fun and satisfying.			"

												If you like strategy games with the modern technology then i highly recommend you to buy this game. In my opinion, this game is the best real time hardcore strategy game ever made. This game is so hard and very realistic in the same time... It took me several hours to understand how to use the right unit in the right way/time. It has tons of units and free dlc's thanks to Eugen Developers♥. You should be prepared for every kind of decks and strategy from your opponents. The multiplayer is awesome you can even play a 10 vs 10 in extremely big maps with every playable nation.10/10 would buy again.			"

												Excellent game here, which distinguishes itself from most RTS by forcing the player to apply actual military common sense to the battle rather than gamey common sense. No Action Per Minute contest or mathematically calculated rushes of a single unit to kill the other side. Learning the Art Of War in this game can be tough, but is also rewarding as hell, as outthinking the enemy will allow you to crush even the mightiest armored push.The game is, in itself, really beautiful on the graphical side, and though the musics are not exceptional, they do their job correctly. The balancing might be disputed by some (usually the new players who think their favourite nation should crush everyone), but the fact is that BLUE and RED have the same amount of victories in multi, according to the released data.If you want to see a game with more than a thousand different units, with each faction having its own character and way of waging war, if you want to play something that favours actual planning and competence rather than mechanical application of drilled builds and rushes, Red Dragon is for you.Oh, and Eugen will release free DLC in the upcoming weeks and months. ;-)			"

												Wargame is back! This time though, You won't be shelling German towns or sneaking in Scandinavian forests, You'll be burning poor asian women and children with napalm one more time! Thats right, The Wargame Theatre of War is now Asia!The game controls the same as EE and AirLand, but the folks at Eugen have added another layer of tactical micromanagement- Sea battles. The units never cease to amaze me how one second I can be applauding their perfect executions of my plans... To wondering how such braindead soldiers even understand the concept of breathing.Nevertheless, The game still proves it is fun, challenging and intellegent even if it feels like AirLand battle with the prototype date pushed back to '95. The addition of the new counties is always welcome, and Japan, China, North and South Korea, and Australia fit perfectly in the numerous factions. The addition of coalitions and the reworking of deck types makes building and customizing decks an extremly fun pass time.But newcomers to series be warned: THIS GAME HAS A LEARNING CURVE THAT RIVALS EVE. That's right, don't expect to drop in and beginning distributing letal doses of freedom, and the tutorials aren't worth jackshit. Still, If you got the balls and are willing to sick it out, the game is immensely fun and satisfying.			"

												One of the best RTS I have played in a long time, and possible the best rts with a modern combat theme. It has most of the major element's from modern combat, including navies, tanks, armored vehicles, light vehicles, infantry, helicopters, airplanes, artillery, missile launcher and so on. You get to customize your armies for online battles and ai-skirmishes with units from a wide range of countries like, USA, Britan, China, Russia, north korea, japan, norway and more. The game seem to have a fairly decent root in reality when it comes to realism, altough it is as every game still far away from the real deal.The game also features a turn based/RTS hybrid ""campaign"", that is more or less the equivalent to scenarios in different strategy games, but still alot of fun to play. Overall the game possess very good graphic's, but still run on low end systems, such as my laptop.			"

												Okay, honestly I used to love this game. This game used to be fair, but nowadays the game creators chose to favor NATO over PACT and only release new units for them. The PACT players usually agree that all or most of the NATO weapons are OP and that this game is unfair. The NATO forces recently got maybe 80-100 new units and the game makers gave PACT none. Another update came by giving NATO more units. The one time that the game makers give PACT a new unit, the 40mm grenadier team, they took it away because it WORKED. if you compare anybody that plays NATO to someone who plays PACT then you can see that the NATO w:l ratio is probably about 90% and PACT is 10%. Gee, is it the players fault? or the fact that NATO has better weapons and stronger vehicles that we cant even fight against? Do the game makers even care about PACT? I would have recommended this a long time ago, but not any more.			"

												This is an RTSers dream first and foremost. This is not Star Craft, Age of Empires or any other ""I click faster than you thus I win"" kind of game. This is a game that puts you in the commanders seat behind a brigade size modern military element and tasks you with anihilating the enemy with customized warfighting capabilities tailored by your playstyle and tactics. The gameplay is non-stop heart pounding modern war that showcases not only an incredible array of real military units; but also an engine that makes the combat realistic. There is a solid modding community that is ever expanding on their home site for making the game into whatever your skillset is able, but I truly cannot speak highly enough about this game. I am a veteran of the RTS genre; CoH, CoHII, Supreme Commander (all), SC, SC II, AoEII, Rome, Medievall, Shogun Total war, but for this genre and time period NO OTHER GAME TOUCHES IT. Buy it....plain and simple you won't regret it. In fact the only thing you might regret is your lack of TRUE strategic skill as this game will test you and punish you, but that makes victory all the more satisfying.			"

												As far as the individual units in the game go, the game is quite realistic. However, as far as the overall gameplay goes that's where the realism starts to fade. I was looking for something more on the side of realism, but the nature of this game allows gamey cheese tactics. By the way, if you're new, expect to get kicked out of most lobbies in multiplayer as people always stat check people and those with low amounts of games played and low wins get kicked. Overall I would not buy this again but since I already bought it (on sale) I will still (tragically) occasionally play it but I advise you not to waste time or money on this piece of shiz community.

Easier to access and use.+ Able to ban people from your own Game lobby if you feel like they're an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥+ New armies and new coalitions added!+ Better mechanics with units (Fog of war etc)--------------------------------------------- 10v10 Games tend to end up badly with people either leaving or just using one or two units (commonly just arty or planes) And nothing else.- Some map adjustments required; (textures load speed, rendering difficulties)- Community still has Call of duty butthats claiming they know everything about the game when they're not.--------------------------------------------Welp other than that,  out of 1 of 10 i'd give the game a 9.

												DISCLAIMER: This review is mostly based on singleplayer/Co-op gameplay of the game.This review will likely receive a hard time from overawed fanboys that think they know what is going on in the world and know how it feels like to execute a near modern field battle.-Toxic chat. The global chat is filled with know-it-all show offs that try to impress others by speaking about politics as if they were experts. Most people using the chat are these show offs. Then there are those that are simply trying to persuade others to join their matches, which are completely benign.-Unit diversity lies. The game will try to make you think that there is an extremely broad selection of units. This is by no means true. Sincerely, there aren't that many different units in the game. The game will make you believe that there are, by reskinning the same units, changing them to another variant, and altering the traits of said unit, for example the M1 Abrams tank, there are SIX variants in the game. SIX! While these variants may (and probably) exist, this does not change the fact that Eugen has stated that there are over 1300 units in Red Dragon, but in reality, there are only about one quarter of that amount.-Unbalanced naval conflicts. People will always whine about the fact that BLUFOR has an aerial advantage when it comes to naval conflicts, which compensates for REDFOR's hardier sea vessels. This is true, but it does not completely compensate. Think about it. If you send a Tornado jet right into the midst of several ships, its destruction is guaranteed. Of course, this is a suicidal tactic, but you cannot always afford to wait for one of the enemy capital ships to become isolated, while your own ships (that must hold strategic deployment sectors around the map) are pounded into oblivion. Also, the more planes you bring along, the less ships you can bring, which limits your margin when it comes to ship expendability. -Incompetent AI. Something about all battles in general, when you're up against the AI. The AI always, ALWAYS has far more money than you, rendering them able to deploy half their cursed deck onto the playing field as soon as you hit the ""Launch Battle"" button, placing you at a severe numerical disadvantage. Also, the AI is abhorringly foolish. The milisecond you send a plane in, the AI launches EVERY SINGLE PLANE THEY HAVE BOUGHT at you, which will either result in your entire task force being reduced to smoldering ash, or, if you've prepared for this, the entire enemy air force will be littering the battlefield. If the former occurs, it will put you at a disgusting disadvantage, or if the latter takes place, you will be left with a monotonous and likely rapidly finishable battle.-Unrealism. Red Dragon can be really irritating at times. When your units (in this case, tanks) are moving through a village that is also being traversed by opposition tanks, in my experience, the enemy tanks somehow always manage to get a bead on my units, and destroy them, whereas my tanks can never seem to pinpoint enemy locations and neutralize them. Many people will just disagree, and call me a noob. Fine. But then when my tank is outside of the forest, and the enemy tank is in the forest, he can always establish a line of sight and send my crew down the expressway to hell. In naval battles, I have witnessed helicopters being hit multiple times by the MAIN GUN of my ships. THE MAIN GUN! The main gun would rip the chopper to shreds when the first freaking shell connects! The realism of this game is also contested in other parts of the game, such as the fact that tank shells NEVER ricochet, or that picket fences are taller than LAVs, but these can easily be forgiven. Sure, some will argue that it's just a game, or that it would be a bad game if it were too realistic. Red Dragon is a military RTS game, using historical assets. It pretty much revolves around realism. It cannot afford to let these things drag it down.+Astonishing graphics. This is a negative review, but that does not mean this game doesn't have somewhat of a silver lining to it. The graphics are quite simply extravagant for when this game was released.+Coherent soundtrack. Wargame: Red Dragon houses a sountrack that adheres almost perfectly to the setting. If you dislike the music of Red Dragon, you can easily switch to the soundtrack of European Escalation and even Airland Battle. +Battle map diversity. This installment has a multitude of maps for the land battles, which is great, yet it is severly lacking in naval maps, as there are only 6. TL;DR: The game has a toxic global chat, too many unit reskins, unbalanced naval units, multiple unrealistic tactical scenarios, a demented AI, but it does have good graphics, a fitting soundtrack, and a large selection of maps. Overall, I feel that the cons heavily outweigh the pros, which earns this game a negative review from me.			"

												I remember when this game used to be fun. Now its just made up of lopsided teams. Teams with people who have a victory rate of 65% or more just destroying teams with victory rates of 40% or less. The only time you have a chance to win is to try to get on the stacked team before it fills. There is no random matchmaking to even out the teams at all. There is no joy in this game for me anymore. I used to have some really good battles but now its just crap.			"

												I really was impressed to see this game on Steam and also really excited. I started playing it and everything looks awesome but really no way to teach the player how to play the game. They put instuctions which to me are just to confusing. Really would hit the like button if you guys could put in video type instuctions!! It looks and plays like a really cool game but its just too confusing.			"

They added new factions... good thingThey added navy... poor integration. Oh yeah navy can obliterate land units but land units can't touch them... smart idea. Not.Rolling terrain... yaaay... if sector borders would be ""rolling"" as well. Some sector borders appear to be underground if you don't look at them from specific angle. Which is a pain considering that you have to put CVs into them.SP campaign Nice concept. But considering that AI is stupid, there is no versus like there was in ALB and overall lack of polish leaves you saying ""poor realisation"" again.Many say that game doesn't have big player base because it is hard. No. It is because players don't have time to rally around a solid game since they get clubbed in their face with new one each year.This is how it goes:Release of the game with many things that would make it enjoyable to play being absent -> adding those things with ""free DLC""-> game is finally what it should be for actual release-> new game 4 months later (this time it will be with bases)-> most migrating to new game leaving you in a game that is to rts games what G+ is to social networks.Instead of focusing on MP part of the game (which Wargame should be solely about) and polishing it out considerably before release, they split their focus on both MP and SP thinking they will be able to pull it off but failing and ending up with rather sad product that will die out in about a year or so.Sad because in its core concept is a very good game. However instead of upgrading ALB they sidegraded, upgraded non cruical parts and even downgraded on some areas. And that is not something sequel should be about.Should you buy it? If you get it on massive discoutn.			"

												Warning: raw text.Wargame... what it does that word mean to you? Once a greatest contemporary RTS game... now it means another Call of Duty for... ehm... kids but in this case for 20+ y/o kids.I have been fan of Wargame EE since I saw trailer on TV in 2012, but now I must admit it became sh!t not ""the sh!t"", but literally sh!t. I will present you a little comparison between EE, ALB and eventually RD. EE was first of its kind, RTS with beautiful maps, authentic units, interesting and innovating gameplay. I have spent many hours of my life playing amazing campaigns, where I was defending Vaterland from commie basturds, where I was dealing with counter revolutionists in Poland... and I don't regret any minute of this time (this is WRD review so nothing much bout EE here). Life was going on. Year later came AirLand Battle with PLANES, at this time I have been like, OMFG PLANEZ NOW THIS GAME IS PURFECT. Along with now maps that weren't flat as chest of 10 year old girl this was a major step forward. Gameplay did differ a lot, since any thread could be resolved now with planes and rivers ingame did matter a lot but werent game breaking. City battles were amazing with new block system, all these US Marines versus VDV, Jägers versus Motostřelci etc. Even with it downsides as reservist problem (danish haer havernomnom something if you remember), F-14/MiG-31 tryhards, early SOVJET STEAMROLLER T-72B1/T-64BM/BMPT/BURATINO and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ singleplayer it was good game. But in this time it was clearly visible that this game should be a GREAT standalone expansion pack and not just a GOOD game. ""Here comes the rage"" aka ""Now about Red Dragon"". As any developer/publisher knows its much more profitable to release every year a new game, than updating old ones. First what everyone saw is obviously ships, but from the beginning I was skeptical about this... and i was right, the major selling point - the navy was (and still is) S.H.!.T., everyone expected F-14's taking off Nimitz to shoot down AShM Su-27's and then Iowa bombarding the battlefield (liek in World in Conflict!). But no. It was more like: ok lets use some LaFayettes and kongos to counter sovremenny's, in case they win call in some TRAMS, CF-18's and maybe some Super Pumas. In case when there is some river then spam some Monitor Zippo's and STRB's, oponent wont have how to counter 11 river boats for shure. Some tanks? Hellfire will pwn them like they are from paper. Some infantry? Monitor's napalm will give you smell of fried konkurs team. Planes or helis? Still no problem for you, coz blobbed 11 AAA canons will land it pretty fast. END. That was it... The Mighty Naval Feature (yep, instead of making something useful like towed weapons or playable campaign they made this).Overall, game feels like ALB with enlenghted (yes, i made up that word) timeframe. Now instead of Waffen SS Black PanzerDivision of Death consisting of Challengers, Leopards 2a4 and Abramses, you have to choose. Her Majesty Challenger 1+2's, or United forces of Freedom M1A* abramses, or combined Vichy France and Wehrmacht Leclercs and Leopards 2a5's. On other side vroom vroom T80UM and useless T72b upgrades. Now since last years where prototypes are accepted is 1996 we have some Star Wars techs already, for example Rafales using year 2000 Mira's, or year 2000 Caesar's too (guess in what country is developers HQ?), or North Korean T-90, omg devs apparently watched too much Kim Chong's propaganda. If we are talking about ""Red Dragons"" and ""Blue Dragons"", these factions are entirely made up by developers, because instead of making possible to use real advantages that these countries armies possesed in real life, for instead example human wave attacks of china they gave them some pewpew units that don't make sense from ""authentic/realistic game"" perspective that marketing departament of Focus Interactive tries to enforce. When Eugen first switched from mentioned realism to, ehm, balance, they started to including units that should never have been given to players for example other planes than ground attack ones and maybe some fighters (Mig-31's and B-5's are definitely out of frame here) or Patriot AA, srsly patriot in wargame, in MY wargame? One thing that bothers me is Eugene thinking they could fool us with ""we are making you a big favor releasing FREE DLCs"", from the beginnning i was in belief that even countries which should not be included in this war theatre would be updated immediately after release, but no, 40% of nations weren't updated, we had to wait another half year just to have some abandoned countries (GDR, CSSR, PLR) beign able to compete with factions updated from release. Now is 6th of November and Scandinavia countries are just plain useless. THANKS OBAMA, i mean, THANKS EUGEN. Lol, why were these countries included in first place, you might ask. Answer is people who play it are mainly from yurop and hurting your target audience is not a good idea. But when all resources were thrown on excellent navy feature, there was simply no time for minors. Eugene just killed two birds with one stone. Terms for updating were stretchered from March to...November! And also devs are looking like a knight in shining armor for giving player FREE DLC (FREE), for free. Blah blah blah, ur still readin? Maps are fabulous lookin from any distance, either from ""tacticool height"" and from close up, there are only two RTS's which could boast with it, and even here we see problem, instead of adding old maps from previous games, devs are making new ones, you might ask why? Because someone wasnt enought competent to do make map editor suitable for coverting own maps own games to different own games, lol. SO basically RD is ALB with new maps and new fancy units! First half of the year there were only 73 new models in RD, rest of ""new"" units were just fugly reskins of existing models so i wont glorify devs for it as reskining is relatively easy, personally, i made OVER 9000  HQ reskins (bulsht, i've done like 200 of them, you can chech my screenshots in profile or forums), so i have right to brag about, ehm, laziness of developers. Funny thing, EE was forgotten with no balance patches after ALB was released and ALB was lost in abyss of ignorance after RD seen the light of monitors, so guess what's gonna happen after Act of Agresssion (next Eugene game) will be released... yes you are right. At the time when i'm writing this wall of text, on virtual battlefields high end tank oneshots atgm team which is firing on it, mortars are shutting down any attempt of offensive, one spetsnaz squad is killing hundreds of enemies, meanwhile some cluster mlrs's are destroyng starting convoys, STRB's are pwning everything that has that bad luck of being 2500m near river, volley of patriot missiles from hedge near end of the map is shooting down another SEAD plane, while nordic vikings are bravely defending from combined power of whole soviet military somewhere in korea... Welcome to WargameTl;dr Red Dragon is not bad game, just developers are still disappointing us. Check wikipedia for definition of expansion pack. If you have an opportunity, try this game. You should make your own opinion about this game, instead of reading pointless reviews on steam. Thats all and I'm going to get pwnd in RD again, so thanks for reading. Thrawn out.			"

												Following on from the brilliant Air Land Battle, Red Dragon offers revised nations and Naval Warfare. The latter does not really appeal to me and I often wish they would have just run with an amphibious aspect of the game as the ships are just broken IMO. Which is a shame as no doubt the developers put a lot of time developing the units.As you can see from the number of hours I have ploughed into this game, I like it and why not. It is a very unique game and nearly all games played on MP are going to be different with the number of viable nations and coalitions. Like ALB it has a near vertical learning curve. So if you have skipped previous incarnations of this game them you might be in for a bit of a hard time. Don't be put off. You can play against the A.I which might cheat and not simulate human tactics and play. They will allow you to get to grips of what units do what. Also how to use them effectively. Howevr this will require some watching of you tube to get peoples views on deck building. As deck building is the core of the game. Ther are no bases to build, however in certain game modes occupying territory yields an income of sorts to buy units from your pre-configured deck.The game has been out for over a year now and this means that new players really stand out. However the forum is a good place to post and organise games with newer players. Smaller games are a great way to really appreciate the game. 1v1 up to 4v4 (other variations are available but require deicated server support). In house games are a great way to learn to play and offer feedback to mates after a game. Again there are more experienced players out there who offer tuition as they want to add to the community.10 v 10 is great fun and can be quite a punishing place if you are new. As new players have a tendancy to quit the game once they lose an initial push or are overrun. This has a big impact on the players left on the game and which is why a lot of newer players tend to receive the cold shoulder by some players. On the reverse of that it is also a gaming environment where new players mistakes can be corrected by other stronger players. As long you aren't feeding units to the enemy in the games most dominant game mode. Destruction, basically awards points for killing certain units with a set value. More expensive units give higher points.To summarise a great game with fantastic MP, it has been out a while so expect to do a bit of homework for MP games. If you wish to win that is. Alternatively play it with mates in your own in house environment until you are up to speed. A truly glorious game that deserves a thriving community, unlike the dwindling one of current. Hopefully Eugen will pull another out of the bag. "

This isn't a bad thing, however, because the complexity and realism of the rules and MASSIVE catalog of units means you will need to apply many real-world battlefield concepts to win your fights.

												I discovered the Eugene's Wargame series only recently, the European Escalation got me hooked pretty fast with it's setting, the story and of course the gameplay (escpecially in multiplayer). The features added in AirLand Battle made it even better so had no reason to hesitate when Red Dragon came out. And no disappointment here either. Don't think that the only difference from AirLand Battle is addition of naval combat and new units, the changes are many and the game made really big step forward in terms of balance and game mechanics. Even the graphics are better, I very often find myself completely distracted from commanding my units and just look and enjoy the heat of battle.Overall I really enjoy the game, for me it's like playing my favorite Arma from RTS perspective (which is awesome!).

Further more the whole 'naval' thing is an extremely poorly executed gimmick for which the developers should be sued. They never even bothered adding in engine sounds for ships, WTF Eugen?The maps in this game are a joke; they feature only a few types of terrain and none have a well implemented spot for the naval units, although no one actually uses them anyway. Most of them favour rushing tactics and thats what 99% of matches turn into.This game boasts about having an incredible amount of units but the majority of them are reskins of other units and are completely useless and you will only ever use a fraction of the total included.

												Well, here it is.Wargame: Red Dragon is a fun RTS/Tactical kind of game. I'm going to jump right into Pros/Cons.Pros:Deck Creating - Red Dragon really lets you go to town on making your army, your way. You can choose from not only countries, but coalations of countries to expand the amount of units you have available.Multiplayer - Multiplayer can be really awesome a lot of the time, a 10v10 battle can be really intense. Also, chopper rushes.Graphics - The graphics are really good for an RTS game, theres a lot of detail put into the game, and you can really tell the time they put into making the units.Cons:Scale - While the battles can be pretty big, the amount of units that are deployed on the battlefield are kind of small. Infantry squads generally only have a vehicle and 5-6 soldiers. Each vehicle is it's own unit. Unlike the Total War games, which have upwards of 2000 soldiers on the battlefield, Red Dragon only sees 500 or 600 soldiers at a time.Maps - Now, the maps aren't that bad. They're big. But that's the problem. See, as I sad above, the scale of battles is somewhat small, and the maps are HUGE. It feels kind of a waste.Well, overall, this is a good modern strategy game. I would rate it 7/10.			"

												If you like games with really stupid computers that alwars rush the S@#$ out of you and there are no realistic ways to fight when short handed with troops you'll love this game. I recommend it because it looks nice and is quite fun the 1 of 10 times you can  have a good match with out the super computer completely destroying you in a matter of seconds. Having 60 T-72s rushing whill you hold a bridge with 5 tanks that could not hit the ground if they tried yeah its great fun..........All i can say is if your like me and enjoy using strategy to take an army down when out numbered and if you lose you at least feel good about you tactics when short handed then STAY AWAY!!!! because it does not exsist here. It's balls to the wall killing using your points to overwhelm the enemy.  I bought all three hoping that i could at leat have a few missions where time was no concern this did not happen.			"

												This game puts you in the middle of a conflict zone, in real time strategy mode. You get to play withas many millitary units as you possibly can and defeat your enemy by capturing their territory. The game has a point system which means ,you can spend only a limited amount of points on your army strength ,before going to battle. The game features mmog features, which puts you up against other players of the game.The music is great and the graphics good.So all in all the game has many + points and relatively no minus. But to name a few :-Positives1.The game has mmog features which makes it competetive and fun2.The game has smooth graphics and good music3.A variety of war units to choose fromNegetives1.Lacks a microeconomics aronud it like cs:go hasAll in all a good game for any age. A solid 6/10 for presentation.			"

												Best RTS,well imho anyways. I love this game. Community is kind of demented but somewhat charming and definately entertaining. You could basically only read all-chat and it would be worth the purchase. In the 2 years since they released Red Dragon, 3 DLCs were added for free, as well as 3 map packs and semi-regular patches. So the game is still alive and if youre thinking of joining us; please do. I didnt get into the gameplay at all, but that is mainly because i would be ranting on like a madman ( its really really good ). So if youre interested in a little slower paced RTS with  hundreds of different units, deck-building and a proper incorporation of air land and marine forces into one big battle, dont hesitate and get Wargame.

You can play everything, from Big scale 10v10 battles to super tactical low income fight, really can't recommend this game enough. Besides, if even you don't like RTS you can spend some good hours just reading the marveulous place that is the battle chat, you can talk about everything between mechahitler to the illuminatti.10/1016/11 with  battlechat			"

For me it has just the right scope, you control a mix of units, not too few that a loss of one kills you, not too many that a loss of one isn't noticeable.  Strategy AND tactics.  It's a shame that the community is a bunch of racist, sexist losers, but hey, that's pretty par for the course for most games.  Ah the anonymity of the internet brings out the best in people.  Don't let it trouble you, get it on sale and you'll get your money's worth no probs.			"

												Wargame Red Dragon expands and improves from the previous games in the series. The new factions are interesting to play with and the new naval battles add to the already great gameplay. Be warned however that there is a steep learning curve, you'll need to sink several hours before you come to grips with the game. In adition the online needs some work, some factions are simply better than others, especialy in naval battles, but this will be fixed in a future patch.If you're willing to put in the time this game can be alot of fun.

I've found each of the Wargame series to be fantastic, with wonderful graphics, highly customizable armies, and a wide range of terrain with which to fight upon, with each of these variables increasing with the next game.Read Dragon in particular is a great addition to the series, introducing naval combat, along with many new nations' units to use.I'd give the series overall a 8.5/10, and Red Dragon specifically 9/10.

												As someone who plays the SP side only, I'm actually enjoying WRD more than I'd expected.  Having entirely new armies (North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, ANZAC) is fun.  I'd previously heard of the Type 59, the J7, the Korean K1, etc but never really understood what they were until having to lead or fight them in the campaigns. The campaigns themselves are a pleasant surprise.  There are a few mechanics I miss from WALB, but overall, the new organization around companies & battalions leads to a much wider variety of tactical situations than WALB.  I've had some surprisingly interesting battles where I'm fighting with scraps of different formations and having to put together a novel tactical solution.Far and away the best part of WRD is the variable speed.  While I eventually came to love WALB, the sheer franticness of the battles meant that I nearly always had to rely on setting up a defense and waiting for the AI to bash into me, since the AI could outmicro me in defending against my attacks (optimizing AH and ATGM ranges while simultaneously dropping mortars AND calling in CAS strikes :<).  With the new bullet time feature, I'm finally able to enjoy employing real tactics, and I can finally get down to ground level and enjoy the phenomenally beautiful engine.  There have been some amazing scenes that I always missed in WALB since I needed to stay high to monitor the entire board.  One downside is that the campaign map seems less well thought-out than WALB.  It's often unclear what you can and cannot do, and when you can't do an action (e.g. Assign a squadron to a new airbase), there's no explanation why.  I miss the ""cards"" you could play in WALB around the actual movement of formations, such as aerial recon, commando raids, naval strikes etc.  The ideal Wargame would blend the new mix-and-match formation system with the strategic actions and UI clarity from WALB.    The only other downside is that the AI seems to rely more on bull-rushing you with everything it has right at the start of every match.  My recollection is that WALB had a little more variety in how the AI would respond.  This may well be because they've removed some of the worst features of the ""all-seeing"" AI from WALB (thank you!), and without that omniscient vision, a full on rush is the only tactic remaining?  Still, it's early in WRD's evolution, and hopefully the AI will gain some more variability as the game matures.  So overall highly recommended.  There are one or two steps back from WALB, but also some real advances and I'm greatly enjoying my time with the campaigns.			"

												One of the best strategy games I've played, huge selection of units/factions. Strategy/tactics are SUPER IMPORTANT in this game, making bad calls can seriously handicap you and the team you're playing with.Positives-High focus on strategy/tactics.-Focus on realism (sort of)-HUGE amount of factions to play as, each have strengths/weaknessesNot really positives, but not really negatives-Large selection of units, this can lead to confusion amongst players (looking at you USSR tanks!)-Naval units, I'm not a huge fan of them mainly because there aren't any sea only maps.Negatives-Very steep learning curve, this is not a game you'll learn instantly. Even after playing Wargame Airland Battle and this, I still do not know everything about this game.-Random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in this game, like a ♥♥♥♥ing piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥AA unit blowing up my 180pt air superiorty fighter!!If you like strategy games, this is a game you should own.

												I am reviewing this as someone who has never played a game in the Wargame series before. And well I can tell you, buying this franchise now, when it has so much content is a fantastic experience, as everything is new to me.At first the game seems a little overwhelming, and you wonder how you are going to be able to concentrate on so many elements, and make tacticaly pushes at the same time. But after playing a few rounds of the game, and getting a couple of hours under your belt it becomes an addictive fever of how you can improve your army choice and their tactics of use. In this game you can create completely custom armys, with a choice of over 750 units per side, so thats over 1500 units in total. And you can put a combination of any of those 750 in to your army you want, or you can use a specific nation only, and if you want a specific role, airbourne, marine, mechanized, armoured, just some examples, and with these you will get bonuses, allowing you to field more units, not less, in your specialisations!I have only really played the British and USSR in any detail yet, although I have also created North Korean and Anzac (Australia & New Zeland) armys also. And well I can tell you, the choice of units you get, first seems overwhelming, but don't worry, pick something, try it out, after a game or two you will go, hang on, nope i prefer a longer range artillery type, or possibly you feel your vehicle anti air vehicles are to vunerable to being spotted and prefer to field infantry anti air in future. And this progression and refining is continual.I find 4v4 games enjoyable, but I find the 10 vs 10 games exciting, and thrilling, as ten people try to push and defend a line, and support one another, it feels a lot more unpredictable, and evolving and in the end realistic then any other RTS I have played. If you watched back many of the 10 vs 10 battles on video you would struggle sometimes to realise whos units are whos, and that it wasn't a real historical battle, the way lines are formed, holes found and pushed in the enemy lines, and weak spots reinforced in your own line.The only problem I have found with the game is when your team starts loosing, a lot of people will be quick to drop out of the game, which is rediculous as many times I have found you can fight back from a loosing position if you work together. I think there should be some form of punishing the statistics of those who quit out early. Okay the players resource points is shared out between players, but sometimes a team is only just slightly loosing, because they lost their harbour, and half of their team will quit, meaning micro management just got a lot harder! And even with half the team quit you got to give the guys sticking to it credit though, they fight on to the last fire base, and hold every inch of ground.I vow to be someone who never quits out of a game early because I am loosing. Its all about having good fun, gameplay, and in the finish, last stands can be great fun. You can hold them off to the end of the timer, it will be a draw often.Do not be put off by the lack of VOIP (Voice chat) in game, you will find the system, where you can type short messages and ping it, smoke tag a spot of ground, with the writing much more useful. You can quickly type ""Enemy AA"" or ""Enemy Arty"" and tag it on the enemy position. Or tag where you will capture, or what troops you are pushing on to a spot very quickly. And this is better then struggling to describe something on these huge battlefields some times.So in short, a great Real Time Stratergy game, if you haven't tryed this series of games yet and enjoy RTS games, I would say it is a must buy. A great experience, and a new level of large scale RTS. What are you waiting for, buy it!			"

												500+ hours on this game and still fun to play, Mainly a multiplayer game but the campaign is very fun. Your rank on multiplayer dose not affect the gameplay but more or less how your teammates feel when you're on their team. I would suggest for those who are now just starting the wargame series to check out EE or ALB first but you can still manage without prior knowledge. This game is like no other RTS . I highly suggest this game and remember #USA is not the op fraction as you would think, it takes skill to master itfinal verdict 9/10-would bang again			"

This game is amazing and truly shows hte power and conviction of the soviet army. it also shows nato's technological superiority and Hyper fighters power against soviet titans. this game is more like worth 20$ for misleading graphics in store screenshots but other then that it''s a good game. except for the french bias..

												This is the first game I've played that I've been really, really conflicted about.Pros: Graphically impressive, very complex tactics, amazing level of detail in unit design (including visibility, perception, armor, range, damage, etc. etc.). Probably the closest thing to real-time realism on the market right now.Cons: Extremely steep learning curve, zillions of units and game mechanics to learn, and the developers didn't support it with a tutorial. The fan community has brought up various resources to help, but general feeling is that to get a proper designer tutorial, you'll be looking at buying the first game, European Escalation.The game is very complex, which means it'll take time even for those familiar with the older games in the series to pick it up. (First game EE was purely land, second game AirLand Battle introduced aircraft, this game introduces naval units.)I'm fairly experienced with other historical RTSes (although none are as realistic as this one) and I found the learning curve for RD unworkable with the limited time available to me. I put eight hours in-game, trying out guides and putting what I'd learned from fan manuals into practice: my victory or defeat still feels entirely arbitrary. [Update: this is because the guides deal with playing against humans, but the AI uses several pathfinding shortcuts which give it several important differences from human performance - it has omniscient line-of-sight so concealment doesn't work against it, and it has ""human wave"" mentality for dealing with chokepoints.]The fan community has been great, and if you have a lot of time and attention to put into this game, it may be the game for you. Likewise, if you don't mind buying the first game and working through that as a prelude to playing this one. Folks who find analysis to be fun in its own right, or who are detail oriented, may enjoy this game too.I found the time demands of learning the game to be too heavy. I disapprove of the designer's decision to essentially shortchange new players by removing the tutorial on the assumption that they'll have played the prior games. The fan support is very heartening, but it seems to reinforce the designer's laziness so they can get away with it. The designer should include solo-play tutorial support in ALL titles in the series, not just the first few titles. This sales model of ""expecting people to buy your earlier games before they can play your later games"" was already proven unworkable with the Wizardry series way back in the 1980s. Eugen should know better.There's all the hallmarks of a good game in here, provided you can devote the very significant time and focus requirements to crack the shell, either by doing online mentorship with the fans, or by buying the previous titles in the series. However, in all honesty, it didn't work out for me and I couldn't recommend it in good conscience.			"

												Wargame: Red Dragon. Where to start? This is the thrid installment of the WarGame series. It is a semi-realistic game focusing on possitioning, strategy and tactics. It has over 1400 units from 17 nations to choose from. Every unit has limited ammo and fuel, maps are large. Recon and supplylines are crtical for victory.The only bad things I can say about the game is that the naval aspect feels unfinished, it has no proper tutorial and some game mechanics seem rather obfuscated, the two latter things can be solved by reading guides made by the community as for ships they will hopefully feel more complete after tons of patching by the developer and free DLC. They do listen to the community and they do actively patch their games.If you come into this game expecting something similar to Command & Conquer, StarCraft or Act of War don't. WarGame is a very different style of RTS. There's no base building and you only get the units you choose to go to battle with. The way you choose your units is similar to a deck of cards. You build decks before going to battle. Each card holds a certain amount of units - the stronger and more modern the individual units are the less you get in each card for example you get over 30 T-34/85's in one card but you get only 1 M1A2 Abrams in a card, a deck consists of several cards under several categories: Logistics, Support, Infantry, Armour, Vehicle, Reconnaissance,Helicopter, Plane and Naval. If you choose only powerful units you may end up with no forces to fight with. Unit cards are also limited by type, amount and an overall limit on how many cards you can have. A deck should have a balance. In the campaigns you cannot make your own decks, they are predetermined.You are not allowed to field your entire force at once. You are limited by points, you get these points by capturing zones with your command units - the more zones you hold the faster you accumulate those points - the more reinforcements you can call in.The game has several game modes:Destruction - Destroy enemy units for points, the more the enemy unit is worth the more points you get. Conquest - hold more command zones than the enemy and reach a certain amount of conquest points to win.Economy - similar to conquest, but you win by having a stronger economy than the enemy. You will be sending out units sparinglyYou win by hitting the limit or by having more points than the enemy when time runs out or by destroying all the enemy command units.This game has too many mechanics to descibe in a single steam review or maybe even a full review such as recon, camouflage, missile types, missile guidance types, tank shell types, and the list goes on. if they were all mentioned in detail we might end up with a book of sorts, even certain community guides for this game can be a 1000 word essay, but if you are open to learn them you fill find that WarGame: Red Dragon is a strategy game unlike all others and a very fun experience.

If you have enough CIWS in your shipball you are completely invincible.  If you have slightly less than needed all of your ships will die. There is no middle ground.Just play the land and amphibious maps (which are the vast majority of maps anyway) and you'll have a great time.tl;dr game's imba as ♥♥♥♥, Eugen loves frogs, Komandosi are based, buy it anyways and lose to cheese decks online until you get angry enough to become good at it			"

												Very fun combined battles. Also nice how they have amphibious APCs. They could make it better by giving the USSR its tanks, such as T-90s. A few typos here and there also. They should also add are that when vehicles explode, if it is hit in the right place, a part will fly off, such as the track, gun, turret, etc. The naval ships should also have people walking about and men in life boats and in the water if their ship sinks.

												Well, here it is.Wargame: Red Dragon is a fun RTS/Tactical kind of game. I'm going to jump right into Pros/Cons.Pros:Deck Creating - Red Dragon really lets you go to town on making your army, your way. You can choose from not only countries, but coalations of countries to expand the amount of units you have available.Multiplayer - Multiplayer can be really awesome a lot of the time, a 10v10 battle can be really intense. Also, chopper rushes.Graphics - The graphics are really good for an RTS game, theres a lot of detail put into the game, and you can really tell the time they put into making the units.Cons:Scale - While the battles can be pretty big, the amount of units that are deployed on the battlefield are kind of small. Infantry squads generally only have a vehicle and 5-6 soldiers. Each vehicle is it's own unit. Unlike the Total War games, which have upwards of 2000 soldiers on the battlefield, Red Dragon only sees 500 or 600 soldiers at a time.Maps - Now, the maps aren't that bad. They're big. But that's the problem. See, as I sad above, the scale of battles is somewhat small, and the maps are HUGE. It feels kind of a waste.Well, overall, this is a good modern strategy game. I would rate it 7/10.			"

												Absolute Garbage.The winner is the guy who rushes the most and the quickest. Strategy and tactics are negligible atributes in this game. Further more the whole 'naval' thing is an extremely poorly executed gimmick for which the developers should be sued. They never even bothered adding in engine sounds for ships, WTF Eugen?The maps in this game are a joke; they feature only a few types of terrain and none have a well implemented spot for the naval units, although no one actually uses them anyway. Most of them favour rushing tactics and thats what 99% of matches turn into.This game boasts about having an incredible amount of units but the majority of them are reskins of other units and are completely useless and you will only ever use a fraction of the total included.

												I have loved the Wargame series since the beginning and Red Dragon is the best it has to offer. Like those before it, Red Dragon has a wonderfully simple interface but provides an environment where modern warfare tactics can truly be applied. If you are in any way a student of warfare, this game is for you.Very stable, visually appealing, excellent gameplay.			"

												I used to be a sergeant in the army and in the army we use alot of planning, drawing, communication, create attack and mission templates., 90 % of what we did was planning+thinking  and and map reading before any plan was exectued.  This has almost none of that, its all about clicking speed with the mouse - it's more like 10 to 15  % planning and 85 % clicking on the map like a idiot.  I have played hardcore RTS (modded) games that revolve around realism and other realistic game genre such as operation flashpoint and ARMA series. From graphics to concept and gameplay everything has alot of potential and alot of it is well executed.  However interface and command options are abysmal and poorly executed, tutorial is completely lacking, the shortcuts are not intuitive. the interface and command options of the game '' AI war'' are thousands light years ahead of this game. What it comes down to is either capturing zones on the map or blocking the routes to that zones. This game revolves around micromanagement and speed of clicking, getting the right unit type to the right spot on the map at the right time. Everything about planning is thrown out the window in favor of poorly executed micromanagement and clicking speed. One of the worst interfaces and deployment/planning sequences of all the RTS i''ve seen. Basically you are put in the role of the general but without any shortcuts, interface options or planning details in order to execute a plan - you are on the field without the options a real general would have. You cannot draw on maps, pre plan orders for units before the game starts and compose battle groups before the game starts. The singleplay is the worst i have seen since 1998 Sorry but this game is highly overrated, its micromanagent all the way and has little to do with real strategy, tactics or planning. Unit balance is really bad and the Stats of units do not correlate to gameplay , the range of some weapons are ridiciously low and some units are just vastly superior. Also some eastern  units and real life tank types are missing. The Dutch nation DLC is ridilious and should be free , almost every conflict country is available but you are being punsished for being dutch. The dutch have been in every theatre of conflict since the 1st word war. Also most of the dutch units are just units that are available for other nations. When it comes to realism, interface and command i give this game a 4/10 , which is really poor When it comes to just casual RTS like games i give this game a 8/10, which is good If you like clicking around the map like a maniac get this game. Harcore realism has to do with intelligence , the ability to plan ahead and delegate everything in a proper way but also to be flexible when you have to change a mission template. This game has almost none of that and feeble minded players could easily rush you with  extreme clicking/micromanagement speed. If you expect real life realism don't even bother, it feels like a unpolished RTS version of ARMA 2 but and without al the options. Sorry but this game is not realistic.			"

												The most complex random number generator simulator on the market. Great graphics too.After playing all day with my top quality units missed 90%  of their shots it is obvious that player can make only very limited impact on the game, most of it is managed by random.This game was design to play multiplayer 1vs1, so called ""Ranked"" games. There everything is balanced and even random is fun. But any other game modes bring balance issues and get tedious quickly.			"

												I had 3 M1-Abrams tanks on a cliff, spread out into a line formation. The tanks were hull down, only the turrets were visible, the hulls were behind the raised edge of the cliff. My tanks were stationary. I had infantry deployed on two sides providing eyes on the kill zone. 5 T-64s approached single file on a road, coming into view one at a time. They destroyed all 3 of my tanks for no losses on their side. I defeated the enemy's entire force, taking over all of his zones. Inflicted 2700 points of damage to his 1500 against me. The game awarded the AI a decisive victory. I was not allowed to purchase reinforcements at all during the battle. The AI was allowed to. Of course. I had over 900 points accumulated at the end of the game, and had every zone on the map occupied.Lots of effort was put into the graphics, but no effort into modeling warfare. The pathfinding is a mess, as well. There is no way to change unit facing. Units don't move where you tell them to. Typically, your tanks will face the enemy with their rear armor facing them if you try to set up an ambush. Most of the game is spent trying to get the forward armor to face the enemy. Try to move your tanks, they will charge towards the enemy backwards.			"

												Think Company of Heroes, in a bigger scale, in modern times.  Units take directional damage, combined arms is a must, and using recon can be the different between a crushing victory and a surprise defeat.Single player is fun, but not very deep, multi-player is where this game shines. The feeling when you lure an opponenet into an ambush, or pull off a successful, tide turning attack, is awesome.If you like RTS, I would whole heartedly reccomend this game. And it's at steal at $30			"

												This game is great, perfect for anyone who likes RTS games. I found it a little diffucult to get in at first, as there is so much to manage, but when you get a basic grasp of the game it becomes really fun. The naval side of it could use some work, but other than that, this game is amazing. If you don't have AA defending, let's say, AT infantry, then that AT infantry is probably dead. It all comes together into an amzing blend of strategy, cooperation, and the feel you get when there are a thousand untis on the field under your command!			"

												If you like games with really stupid computers that alwars rush the S@#$ out of you and there are no realistic ways to fight when short handed with troops you'll love this game. I recommend it because it looks nice and is quite fun the 1 of 10 times you can  have a good match with out the super computer completely destroying you in a matter of seconds. Having 60 T-72s rushing whill you hold a bridge with 5 tanks that could not hit the ground if they tried yeah its great fun..........All i can say is if your like me and enjoy using strategy to take an army down when out numbered and if you lose you at least feel good about you tactics when short handed then STAY AWAY!!!! because it does not exsist here. It's balls to the wall killing using your points to overwhelm the enemy.  I bought all three hoping that i could at leat have a few missions where time was no concern this did not happen.			"

For me it has just the right scope, you control a mix of units, not too few that a loss of one kills you, not too many that a loss of one isn't noticeable.  Strategy AND tactics.  It's a shame that the community is a bunch of racist, sexist losers, but hey, that's pretty par for the course for most games.  Ah the anonymity of the internet brings out the best in people.

This game desperately needs some kind of tutorial, that isn't just words on a page.  Expecting me to know how to perfectly play your game the first time I launch it is ridiculous.

												The most in-depth strategy game I've ever played. Eugen deserves some felicitations for the ambition manifested by this game and its engine. Despite the learning cliff, this game strikes the right balance between predictability and replayability. The UI is deceptively simple, and the complexity of the game owes more to tactics than any other single element. There is no base-building mechanic or resource collection to speak of here; all the units are at your fingertips right from the start, ensuring intensity from the beginning of each game.This is not an easy game to learn. Each unit has hard counters, many of which will not occupy the same price bracket. Tanks get a special mention not as invincible death machines, but simply as counters to enemy armour, which are themselves vulnerable to all kinds of threats, ranging from infantry to ATGMs to airstrikes. There is no unit that cannot be killed in one hit by another, far less expensive one. This means that Wargame can also be highly frustratinng at times. It also means that the ability to predict where your opponent is going to place their units is a skill to be valued. Coupled with a unique recon mechanic that completely eschews LOS bubbles and fog of war, this makes each round surprisingly tense. In many cases the only thing telling you whether a treeline contains an enemy squad or not will be your instinct. Expect to spend the better part of 50 games figuring out the basics. Watch replays or you will find yourself going up against and losing to the same formations again and again.  Playing a match of Wargame is like conducting a symphony. Miscalculating maneuvers by mere seconds can mean you'll be picked apart. But when it all comes together- it's exhilerating, and there is nothing like it.			"

												This is a very fun game. Perhaps the best RTS game of the last decade, which is saying a whole lot. Why can I not recommend this game then? It has hands down the WORST community of any game I have ever played. Because the game lacks an automatch feature, expect to be kicked from lobbies for having too low or high a win/loss ratio. It can often take up to a half hour to find a game. Teams of extremely experienced players will sit in a lobby stacking one team and wait to fill the other side with players they can steamroll. This is how the majority of the small handful of games offered in the match browser are at any given time. Eugen is not interested in adding an automatch feature, so don't buy this game. At least you can easily find a match in Company of Heroes 2. Shame it's an inferior RTS in every respect.			"

												An absolute must for Wargame Fans. Eugene systems has done a wonderful job in adding naval to this game. Although there has been much improvement, I sometimes find it silly that a single battleship can take down so many tanks, among other units, which fire with ATGM's but don't get a single hit. Also wish certain planes would be available as regular planes not just naval planes, but I guess they're trying new things out. I like the extensions they've made, on creating certain game types, and more flexibility to custom games (no income for example is interesting for me). Overall I can say this is a worthy sequel to the wargame series			"

												In the early beginnings, this game was heading for greatness.The balancing was refreshing and you had a huge variety in tactics, because units had different stats, ranges, prices etc. for different nations.The point system instead of factories, and cardsystem to build your army....wow....Also, you had to earn your units in the beginning, so  you didnt have access to that super tank from the start.Then someone had an idea and thought they could become a competition game, and they started balancing so that every unit had the same stats in all nations on both sides, all tanks do the same damage and have the same range on both sides, all planes have almost identical stats, the amounts of units are the same regardless of sides and so onThe neverending nerfing of units, and constant cries of ""OP, OP"" started the downfall.Then they removed the ranking system, and everyone had all the units all the time.......the ""1000 units"" point actually became mute then, as there really only were 50-100 units that really were possible to use effectively...They stopped developing maps, and only recently started porting over older maps, because......The devs dont know their own engine!!!(fact)Then we found out that there were cheats out there, cheats that removed fog of war.....(Gamebreaker??Yup, think so!)One should think this would make them prioritize some anticheat or something, but the devs just ignore it, and pretend it doesnt exist.(basically, because they dont know their own engine and dont know how to fix it)So now, this game is reduced to constant spamfest, very little tactics, and since you always know there might be someone cheating, that actually makes sense, but playability has gone out the window, fun factor is gone and....well.....And then we have the AI......well, there is actually no real AI, it doesnt make tactical plans, or really ""play"" the game, it kinda just see everything you do and counter spam accordingly, then it cheats a lot and goes straight for your HQ's, you just watch how that one unit of his go, straight thru you units, unharmed.....well, when i think about it, its kinda like playing against another cheating player, only he's a little dumberSo.....do i recomend?Nah, not any more!Sorry, you were too late.There was a great game here once, really great, but it got FUBAR'ed by devs with unrealistic expectations (this would never ber LOL or Warcraft)And they put this game on the shelf and put all their effort into Act of Aggression, so now its kinda dead in the water...Its sad, i played a lot, but havent played it in months now, and AoA is not my cup of tea, so....well, i guess an era is over			"

												It really pains me to change my review of this game but god damn did Red Dragon drop the ball on way too many things.First off, the ships. They sucked from the get go, they were patched to suck less, and then were never touched on again. In other words, they still suck. A minor complaint to some as they are not mandatory, but considering it was basically the unique selling point of the game, its a shame that it never got the love or attention it really needed.Secondly, the balance. Eugen doesn't know how or to whom its balancing its games. It seemed for a bit that there plan was to make a game that was balanced in such a way that the people who played it a lot and learned how to get real good at it, there game would be a very balanced affair. Meaning that people with not as much skill may not recognize counters or better strategies and tactics here or there, but they'd be there, they'd exist to be learned and taught.But, if the idea of competitive Wargame ever became a huge thing to watch or experience I never heard of it, and so I think that whole idea fell through. Then there was this idea that they'd balance to realism. Which led to many fun arguments about why Hinds shouldn't have AA missiles and how the Marines didn't have LAVs as troop transports ever, both of which are hilariously false and dumb.So now we get to the point where the balance has switched priorities and objectives, and has been screwed with and muddled up so many times that the other major selling point to wargame, the amount of units it has and the fun hardware that it has, its depth of units... is also false. There is a best deck for each nation. There really isn't that much tactical flexibility that would allow you to bring A instead of B, its just that this one deck will always win out all other things being equal.All of which wouldn't be as bad if Eugen seemed to still be patching and fixing the game. But they're really not. They haven't touched it in quite a while, outside of adding in the new maps recently, and the community has kind of recognized that they've moved on to their other game Act of Aggression. Its a shame really because I think Red Dragon could have, with a half a years additional polish, made for a much better playing experience. But as it stands? Its a mess of different ideas and concepts and thoughts and mis-steps, that no one is even bothering to look at anymore.			"

												This review has been completely updated as I wrote the first review with little understanding of the game. Previously I thought the land battles were good, but I liked the naval battles more. That has completely changed. The naval battels are quite bad, land is the only worthwhile part of this game. So first, the naval battles.     Naval battles in a mixed land/water maps ussually handled by one person. It ussually ends up being blufor spamming anti-ship jets against redfor, or one of the sides will push towards the enemy spawn, and the enemy will have saved money and instantly spawn in 2-3 ships and destroy the aggressors. I have never had an actual naval battle on these maps. The closest I have come is missile stand offs. Occassionaly the navy will start bombarding land, and at this point you cant afford any sort of anti naval units, so it is just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ To conclude naval battles are essentially missile cheese battles.     Land battles are far better. My only gripe is with high end tanks. They run for about 170-180 but are a little lackluster. If a tank 1 has 15 frontal armor and a gun that does 18 damage, and tank 2 has 22 frontal armor and a gun that does 20, the tank 1 will do one damage and tank 2 will do 5. This means Tank 1 kills tank 2 in ten hits and tank 2 kills tank 1 in two hits. This seems fair enough, but it means that heavy tanks can be damaged by any sort of semi heavy projectile, even shots from a 30mm auto cannon on a BTR-90. They are also destroyed extremely quickly by any sort of ATGM. Any sort of anti tank attack helo can kill these high end tanks with 23 frontal armor in 2-3 hits. Other than that I have no problems with the game. It manages to be realistic, but still faced paced at the same time. Just make sure you play conquest, Destruction modes are essentially world war 1 all over again.			"

												Wargame Red Dragon is one the best RTS games i have played in the past few years, this game is perfect for amature RTS players and Veterans as well. the average players can seach for guides that the community has made, and the veterans can enjoy the Micro possibilities that the gamea allows you to make. You can play everything, from Big scale 10v10 battles to super tactical low income fight, really can't recommend this game enough. Besides, if even you don't like RTS you can spend some good hours just reading the marveulous place that is the battle chat, you can talk about everything between mechahitler to the illuminatti.10/1016/11 with  battlechat			"

												If you like games with really stupid computers that alwars rush the S@#$ out of you and there are no realistic ways to fight when short handed with troops you'll love this game. I recommend it because it looks nice and is quite fun the 1 of 10 times you can  have a good match with out the super computer completely destroying you in a matter of seconds. Having 60 T-72s rushing whill you hold a bridge with 5 tanks that could not hit the ground if they tried yeah its great fun..........All i can say is if your like me and enjoy using strategy to take an army down when out numbered and if you lose you at least feel good about you tactics when short handed then STAY AWAY!!!! because it does not exsist here. It's balls to the wall killing using your points to overwhelm the enemy.  I bought all three hoping that i could at leat have a few missions where time was no concern this did not happen.			"

												This game puts you in the middle of a conflict zone, in real time strategy mode. You get to play withas many millitary units as you possibly can and defeat your enemy by capturing their territory. The game has a point system which means ,you can spend only a limited amount of points on your army strength ,before going to battle. The game features mmog features, which puts you up against other players of the game.The music is great and the graphics good.So all in all the game has many + points and relatively no minus. But to name a few :-Positives1.The game has mmog features which makes it competetive and fun2.The game has smooth graphics and good music3.A variety of war units to choose fromNegetives1.Lacks a microeconomics aronud it like cs:go hasAll in all a good game for any age. A solid 6/10 for presentation.			"

												This is a very fun game. Perhaps the best RTS game of the last decade, which is saying a whole lot. Why can I not recommend this game then? It has hands down the WORST community of any game I have ever played. Because the game lacks an automatch feature, expect to be kicked from lobbies for having too low or high a win/loss ratio. It can often take up to a half hour to find a game. Teams of extremely experienced players will sit in a lobby stacking one team and wait to fill the other side with players they can steamroll. This is how the majority of the small handful of games offered in the match browser are at any given time. Eugen is not interested in adding an automatch feature, so don't buy this game. At least you can easily find a match in Company of Heroes 2. Shame it's an inferior RTS in every respect.			"

												An absolute must for Wargame Fans. Eugene systems has done a wonderful job in adding naval to this game. Although there has been much improvement, I sometimes find it silly that a single battleship can take down so many tanks, among other units, which fire with ATGM's but don't get a single hit. Also wish certain planes would be available as regular planes not just naval planes, but I guess they're trying new things out. I like the extensions they've made, on creating certain game types, and more flexibility to custom games (no income for example is interesting for me). Overall I can say this is a worthy sequel to the wargame series			"

												It really pains me to change my review of this game but god damn did Red Dragon drop the ball on way too many things.First off, the ships. They sucked from the get go, they were patched to suck less, and then were never touched on again. In other words, they still suck. A minor complaint to some as they are not mandatory, but considering it was basically the unique selling point of the game, its a shame that it never got the love or attention it really needed.Secondly, the balance. Eugen doesn't know how or to whom its balancing its games. It seemed for a bit that there plan was to make a game that was balanced in such a way that the people who played it a lot and learned how to get real good at it, there game would be a very balanced affair. Meaning that people with not as much skill may not recognize counters or better strategies and tactics here or there, but they'd be there, they'd exist to be learned and taught.But, if the idea of competitive Wargame ever became a huge thing to watch or experience I never heard of it, and so I think that whole idea fell through. Then there was this idea that they'd balance to realism. Which led to many fun arguments about why Hinds shouldn't have AA missiles and how the Marines didn't have LAVs as troop transports ever, both of which are hilariously false and dumb.So now we get to the point where the balance has switched priorities and objectives, and has been screwed with and muddled up so many times that the other major selling point to wargame, the amount of units it has and the fun hardware that it has, its depth of units... is also false. There is a best deck for each nation. There really isn't that much tactical flexibility that would allow you to bring A instead of B, its just that this one deck will always win out all other things being equal.All of which wouldn't be as bad if Eugen seemed to still be patching and fixing the game. But they're really not. They haven't touched it in quite a while, outside of adding in the new maps recently, and the community has kind of recognized that they've moved on to their other game Act of Aggression. Its a shame really because I think Red Dragon could have, with a half a years additional polish, made for a much better playing experience. But as it stands? Its a mess of different ideas and concepts and thoughts and mis-steps, that no one is even bothering to look at anymore.			"

												This review has been completely updated as I wrote the first review with little understanding of the game. Previously I thought the land battles were good, but I liked the naval battles more. That has completely changed. The naval battels are quite bad, land is the only worthwhile part of this game. So first, the naval battles.     Naval battles in a mixed land/water maps ussually handled by one person. It ussually ends up being blufor spamming anti-ship jets against redfor, or one of the sides will push towards the enemy spawn, and the enemy will have saved money and instantly spawn in 2-3 ships and destroy the aggressors. I have never had an actual naval battle on these maps. The closest I have come is missile stand offs. Occassionaly the navy will start bombarding land, and at this point you cant afford any sort of anti naval units, so it is just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ To conclude naval battles are essentially missile cheese battles.     Land battles are far better. My only gripe is with high end tanks. They run for about 170-180 but are a little lackluster. If a tank 1 has 15 frontal armor and a gun that does 18 damage, and tank 2 has 22 frontal armor and a gun that does 20, the tank 1 will do one damage and tank 2 will do 5. This means Tank 1 kills tank 2 in ten hits and tank 2 kills tank 1 in two hits. This seems fair enough, but it means that heavy tanks can be damaged by any sort of semi heavy projectile, even shots from a 30mm auto cannon on a BTR-90. They are also destroyed extremely quickly by any sort of ATGM. Any sort of anti tank attack helo can kill these high end tanks with 23 frontal armor in 2-3 hits. Other than that I have no problems with the game. It manages to be realistic, but still faced paced at the same time. Just make sure you play conquest, Destruction modes are essentially world war 1 all over again.			"

												This game combines the complexity and mechanics of card based or table top strategy games with the real time action of a conventional RTS.That's a good thing if you understand that, but it means there is a steep learning curve to the game. You can not zerg in this game. Well you can, but you won't be very popular with your team mates.Get to know the 100s of units' strengths and weaknesses, get to learn the complex mechanics, get to know the maps and their conventions and you there is a great sense of satisfaction to be had. You can't just jump in a guess though, and the game it's self doesn't offer anything in the way of education.The interface is clunky, half the time a left click works half the time a right click works. The move button is labelled attack, the flank button is labelled move and the layout is keener to be 80's retro than usable and sane.All that complexity and dedication to learn what's going on adds up to an unfriendly experience for new players. You play your first game and loose all your units in 20 seconds to rocket spam; then your team hates you for feeding the enemy. So in your second game you bring rocket spam and your team hates you for wasting their resource and attracting counter battery to supply routes and refuelling units. And so it goes on.Playing as a team will be a much more rewarding experience. For a start  you have a chance to be competitive when facing servers stacked with other teams, and your co-ordination and collaboration will give you a huge advantage to counter-balance your nubness.If you are a 'serious business' player and want a less simplistic RTS then this is right up your street, but it is in no sense a casual or accessible game, and games from outside the 'wargame' series will not have as much in common as you expect.

												Fantastic RTS. One of the few more modern strategy games that I actually enjoy playing. This game is still buggy to some extent indeed but most of the stuff is cosmetic and doesn't bother me very much. This game employs many real world weapons systems accurately and allows for real world tactics to be utilized because of it. This game is not necesarrilly a simulation by any means, but it is certainly one that you have to actually think about when you play, not just point and click and mindlessly win. I have played all the Wargame games from European Escalation (the first) and I already have more hours logged on this game than the other two (relative to the amount of time I've had them) and this game has only been out for just over a month at this point. The unit variety is enourmous and no single combat unit has an identical counterpart on the opposing faction, making for VERY fun and unique matches that vary player to player. Overall, this is a FANTASTIC game, and although it could use a little ironing out of the cosmetic bugs such as improper weapon animations and I believe some sound effects that are not that of the weapon being fired on certain AA missiles, is absolutely one of my favorite games that I have played, and that's a lot to say the least...

												Navy combat needs a huge balance pass. The level of imbalance is crazy, its so clear when you read the stats of both sides ships, and even more clear when you fight with both sides ships. One side is better, to the point of needing half as much command points to win.Many units across all factions seem to have huge errors in their cost, and power levels. Example: a flac gun with 16 frontal armor ( same as a main battle tank ) with a cost of 60 ( half as much as a main battle tank )Wait 1-3 months for balance.If you have a firend that you want to skermish with vs. AI or eachother - Buy it, you will have fun playing and learning the game. If you care about hard core competitive multiplayer where every side has an even chance and the only difference is how clever you are - dont buy the game.			"

												I had high hopes for this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥of a game, and so did most of my friends, and yet Eugen shitfrenchbaguette faces managed to ♥♥♥♥ up this game so badly that I have no intention of ever playing it again.So what's wrong with the game?Firstly, map balance. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥they really are ♥♥♥♥ing stupid when they can't create a basic map that doesn't give one side a massive advantage. Don't get me wrong or anything, advantages will always be created when you create maps for this game but you need to try to keep them as low as possible but the devs obviously did not give a ♥♥♥♥.Secondly, unit balance. This RTS has serious issues with balancing out units, take the BMPT as an example. It was good in Airlandbattle but in Red Dragon it absolutely destroys any opposition. It out ranges all MBTs, infantry and has seriously heavy armour. Now if this unit was a one off case I doubt many people would mind but if you look more closely at other units *cough* SAS *cough* you start to see more and more unbalanced units.Thirdly, bugs. I can't believe this game is out considering how many bugs it has, helicopters fly through mountains, you will bug out during the loading screen more often than you will play, player stats are off (apparently a week after release I had already spent over 1000 hours in game) and the list goes on and on.Bad game is bad, 1/10			"

												TLDR: It's an ok game if it's on a heavily discounted sale. You're not missing anything. I can't say i can recommend this game because you're not missing anything if you don't buy it. If you played the previous games and just want a new theater of war, go ahead. Otherwise, there are better RTS games out there.While European Escalation is still the best in the series and Airland Battle being a complete disaster, Red Dragon is a positive return towards a well balanced product. It combines some of the crafted and procedural campaign aspects of European Escalation that provided imersion and includes the strategic map from Airland Battle. The AI is improved over AB in that it doesn't just spam the highest value units at the player. There is some more rhyme and reason behind it's logic. The graphics seem unchanged from the first game. It looks fine. It's more or less bug free and it provides free DLC.  "

												Having played both EE and ALB, at this current point I cannot in good conscious recommend anyone spend a single dollar on this game. It says that it's fully released, however it's more deserving of the title early beta. It's almost impossible to find players for REDFOR as the devs who know not what they made a game about only take suggestions from the loudest members of the forums, who all happen to be NATO players that believe that REDFOR is overpowered, and this caused REDFOR to be nerfed to the point where no one wants to play them. On top of calling for unwarranted nerfs, they also claim their units are not powerful enough and ask for their units to be buffed. The devs often do both at the same time which leads to a massive shift in power that ends with BASIC infantry units from NATO being able to decimate REDFOR's top anti-infantry squads. TL;DR this game is unbalanced because of NATOBabbies and it's not worth spending a single cent on until they fix this♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Just avoid, horribly unbalanced, the AI cheats heavily on the easiest setting, and the always on chat is extremely toxic.The AI has infinite points/ammo/fuel they can see hidden units, their normal non AA tanks can attack aircraft yet yours cannot. The visibility for planes/helicopters that are non recons is awful considering how far they should be able to see.Due to seeing everything, the AI will launch artillery on your command vehicle or destroy your flanking tanks with a single plane, while yours barely scratches theirs.Something that helps in a RTS is flanking, but the AI sees everything so flanking is impossible, they'll just see you coming and kill you from a distance.The only AI weakspot is infantry in buildings where they die in vast numbers trying to kill your infantry with tanks.They get no penalty for moving through rough terrain while yours do.Multiplayer results in rushes or cheap tactics with sore losers and a toxic community behind it.The beginning campaign is not at all beginner level, the autowin is unrealistic with its expectations of your forces.Avoid unless you like a smashed keyboard, as this WILL result in one.

												I really like dthis game and had hours of great fun. I was thinking about getting this game as a present to my friend, who really likes RTS. However, after the last patch it has become absurdly obviously that the Eugen developers have a clear bias. They make one of the factions of the game, bluefor, overpowered with easily the best units in the game with competition. To list a few; Nighthawk, Longbow, Patriot, Challenger 2, Otomatic, KF-16C Block 52D, Maglans. These units make those factions fun for a short while and provide novice players a handicap and experienced players a challenge. However, Eugen has clearly presented a bias to the other faction, redfor, by not only refusing to provide counter balancing units, but also reduce the power of the ones already present. This makes the Redfor DLC pack virtually pointless to buy and makes the only redfor playable factions the Eastern Block Coalition and Soviet Union. This bias severely restricts the games' online playability as winning 1 in 5 games as redfor or boring “cookie-cutter” tactics as bluefor. I have observed units on redfor be nerfed time and time again, but this last patch was the final straw. If Eugen cannot provide a balanced gameplay, then I cannot recommend the game to others.			"

Eu tentei relevar este fato, dar uma chance, afinal dinheiro foi gasto., até que... chego no tutorial... Primeira vez na vida que vejo um tutorial completamente escrito, isso mesmo senhores, os devs não tiveram nem a decencia de incluir missoes introdutoria pra explicar as mecânicas do jogo, que aparentemente não é nada fácil.

Se apesar de tudo você ainda quiser comprar o jogo, sugiro começar a ler os comentários contra, vários,  e em seguida os positivos.

												I was really interested in this edition of Wargame because of the promised expanded campaign. That was an extreme letdown. There are 4 very short campaigns with fixed factions and no options. +Instead of bringin in army goups or MEU's, you bring in pre-made ""regiments"" that form an army in the sector they are fighting.+Units are destroyed on the regiment level instead of army level.+You can reinforce the regiments now instead of just playing a war of attrition.+Lots of new units, amphibious units.+Excellent music and sound.-None of the campaigns take place in the 90's (when the game actually takes place. Makes no sense). For example, in 1987, I have access to USMC infantry with a configuration from the 90's.-Campaigns are short and only the RedFor countries (china, russia, etc) start in good position. NATO/non-Warsaw is always spread thin and on the defensive.-Warsaw units are still stupid powerful. Their transport helicopters take more ground fire than an Apache or Warthog, all their units have the best accuracy in class, best range in class, best penetration in class, best health in class, etc etc.-You still have to play leapfrog with scout units, which is tedious (though non-scout units seem to have a slight increase in vision range, so it's a little better).On a side note, you'll probably want to turn chat off if you buy the game. There is generally at least one person ranting about how they are going to ""kill the West and♥♥♥♥♥♥all their children"". Trolling is EXTREMELY bad in this game. Probably the worst I've ever seen.

												I would love to recommend this game but I can't. The game itself is a lot of fun. Very punishing and rewarding play or you can soften it up a bit by having more points. The units are INCREDIBLY varied and I am still seeing new strategies tried. There is a very steep learning curve for this game and to be good you need a lot of micro. The reason I can't recommend this game is due to the community that surrounds it. There is no moderation in the wargame chat and there is no punishment for team killing. Team killing a command vehicle can sway an entire battle and there is nothing stopping it from happenning. To report someone you have to have a copy of the replay and create an account in the forums but it doesn't do anything. One particular player literally had a change.org to get him removed from the game. That's how bad it is. I literally can't even post the chat here because it's too explicit and racist. I can't play a match without constantly moving my command vehicles because I'm worried for friendly fire from my team. I would return the game if I could. Oh, and single player is fun for about ten minutes so you HAVE to play with the community. Do not buy this game and if you do then do NOT play with John Brownwood.			"

												If you are looking for sumthing casual this is NOT the game for you...

												Despite being in beta stage still and having some serious bugs, (deck making crash and unreliable mp flare beacons to name a few) this game is awesome! They fixed some of the flaws in Airland Battle and EE like improving artillery, and adding arrows that  show which reinforcement point your troops come in from which is very helpful. The new units are really cool and the new maps are beautiful and more realistic looking than their ALB and EE counterparts, and the new factions are cool as well. The naval units are not in the game yet sadly, but apparently they were very buggy in the closed beta and needed fixing, and I am sure they will be fantastic when the game is fully released a month from now. If you like RTS games and favor games that are more realistic I highly recommend Red Dragon. Wargame can be difficult at first for new players, but playing against the ai is a good way to practice for mp combat. I am very pleased with Red Dragon so far, and cannot wait for the game to be fully released so I have access to all the new features like naval combat and the campaign maps.			"

												This game is awesome. It has huge potential, up to best RTS ever. BUT this awesome game happened to be in wrong hands. Eugen team, the developers, destroying this more and more with every patch. They completely killing balance almost on purpose. Their purpose is to get money from certain nations fanboys, They throw at them OP units of their nations, hoping they will throw money at them in exchange (by buying more copies of game).The situation is almost like with free-to-play games where balance is on the side of donators. But unlike FtP games, this is not free. Actually its quite expensive.So think twice. If you are a specific nation funboy, and like easy wins, you will like what is this game in current state.  Otherwise you can only hope Eugen will come to its senses at some future and fix all damage they done to this awesome game.			"

												A really good game i sadly cannot recommend due to the tiny playerbase and its associated issues. Mainly because of the game's steep learning curve, but also because of the poor in-game tutorial and the absolutely unwelcoming, toxic, elitist community that seems to enjoy the ingame chat more than the acutal game. Games are often set up to be one-sided towards a team of veterans, and people often quit mid-game because of rage/connection problems/dinner-time. If you want to give the game a chance, then i highly recommend playing with a friend. Solo is a really bad idea especially in larger games.			"

												I have played all of the games in the WarGame series and have had a lot of fun. Red Dragon is a very fun game.But at this point it has a few big problems:1. (the biggest problem) navel is not even close to being balanced to the point were if you play a game that has sea with NATO. 99% of the time you will lose because you are outranged out guned and the enemy units are cheaper than yours.2. There is a few pathing bugs.3. Most of the mountains have texture glitchesThis also happens in forests if they have been shot by artillery.Apart from three things this game is VERY FUN TO PLAY and with over 1000 units there is always fun decks to build and the graphics are amazing!

												Not Recommend unless you have a very high frustration limit or already play wargame series games. This game is impossible to play, not because its difficult, but because you have to guesss or trial-and-error logically analyse the game in order to be successful. There is no sufficient explanation of the rules (there is some documentation, but it is a joke).Probably this a really great game that I would enjoy playing. I also accept that it takes quite some time to learn such a complex game and there will be a lot of lost battles in the beginning.  But I won't accept that I have to blindly play without a sandbox mode or proper explantion one battle after another in form of software test cases to conclude how the game logic works and to learn the game. Dokumentation / Tutorial is not present resp. a big joke.That's why you get a not recommended from. By the way - there is a sanbox mod, but it is not working at this time.			"

												They say this is the best RTS game currently availablebut its not a good game ,this game suffers for trying to do too much and ending up being a master of noneThe game itself plays like any Total War game ,one turn based where you sort out where you posistion your units,then a battle then repeatThe map and tile placement is exactly that ,place your forces to counter act whats going to attack youThe battles themselves are very poor there dull to watch with a relatively weak mechanic  ,it makes you wonder if anybody who gave this game a thumbs has ever played Blitzkrieg by CDV made in 2004 because in comparison this new and improved game looses poorly to a game produced over 10 years ago and looses on graphics tooThey say this game makes you fight in a combined force but so did Blitzkrieg but only CDV implemented theirs much much betterNever played online yet but which is where i suspect this game gets it popularity similar to World in Conflict both suffer from weak mechanics but because of that it gives way to a fast paced easy to play multiplayer which isnt really strategy My advice is if your looking to blow things up with your friends give it a try if your looking for a genuine strategy game with engrossing battles try looking for Blitzkrieg (shame its not on steam)			"

												My time with this game was brief, and that's because the ""tutorial"" is something you can read in about 10 minutes that explains next to nothing. The tutorial was 100% useless for when I went into skirmish mode - I'm an adult who works full time and I do not have the time to sit down and spend hours with a steep learning curve where nothing is explained. By contrast I play/understand games such as Europa Universalis IV, and Crusader Kings II - and those games are known for ""bad tutorials"" and ""steep learning curves"", so if I can take time to learn those just imagine how bad Wargame is.

												Bigger, Badder, BetterI love how this game completely expands upon its predecessors. While Airland Battle felt more like a rectified and updated European Escalation, this feels like an all out war for top sequel. The game practically hands you all these different units and says, ""Go have fun."" I love how units do not rout as easily, either. There are so many factors that can decide the outcome of a battle. Because of the lessened rout, the little guy has a chance to make the difference. One panicked tank is able to harass an enemy column long enough for me to reinforce it. Never have I had so much fun blowing through enemy units or losing mine in a single, decisive swoop by my opponets. It keeps you thinking quick but always two steps ahead. What are you willing to sacrifice? When should you retreat? How will you make your advance?The Naval aspect opens new doors. Just this morning, I used an amphibious assault to take my opponent's point. Using Infantry and LAVs, I was able to distract the enemy invasion from taking siege of my ally. When they turned their heads, I swung my sword for the killing blow. My ally poured his reserves into those countless PACT units. My aircraft finished what was left. It might as well have been the Highway of Death on that map. What an invigorating experience and a sweet victory. This game is now my favorite of all three Wargames. Great job to the devs. Who's with me?			"

Thats ok the rocket will still lock on and somewho jump over and then directly down onto your ship.The land battles are a bit better than airland, they have fixed things that should ahve been patched for the previous game. The campains are much better than in airland as you aren't fighting over the same province over and over and over, instead all the units in theat provicer are in one big fight, which works much better. But a lot of campains involve navalbattles which just ruin everything. Don't bother with this game if you want the naval side, the ground combat is ok. If you enjoyed airland you might like this a little better but stay as far away from the naval battles as possible. And as they are tied into so much that really ruins the game.			"

												I have followed this series since the first one and it has steadily matured without loosing itself in the growth, the addition of Aus (Being both Australian and additional factors) is both a welcome and long awaited changefurther the commonwealth red and blue dragons etc. are also good additions giving flexability to the way you can play from the old versions. if you ever wanted to have a taste at what it would be like to actually command forces in a realistic environment this is the closest thing i have seen yet to the real deal, at least short of joining the army and spending the 20 years on your career to reach brigadier +			"

												What are you waiting for, GET THIS GAME!So much fun.  So many different styles to play.  Wanna focus on air and dogfighting?  Go for it.  Wanna grind it out with infantry in urban fighting?  Sure!  Wanna blitzkrieg with armored columns?  You bet.  Wanna focus on naval battles and amphibious landings?  Can do that too!And deck making is half the fun, just playing around with different decks.Might seem like a steep learning curve but you pick it up really quickly. Also, naval combat was fixed after the beta and is a ton of fun now.  Definitely a huge upgrade after ALB, plus all the FREE DLCs they are coming out with.Seriously, how can you go wrong?			"

												This is the hardest stradgey game I ever played. When I started playing Wargame: Europe Escalation I thought it was okay hard. I unlocked almost all units and figure out a deck that can handle basically all situations. But Red Dragon is so hard for me, somewhat because I have no idea which unit is strong which is not since in this game not because it costs more points means it is stronger or more combat effective. No unit can go out alone without any AA or something and survive. Also the Air Combat system is still quite new to me but it is good. And naval battles are awesome.Overall this is a great RTS way better than Starcraft or Civilization because in reality you don't build structures on battlefield and you don't train units there you call in reinforcement when needed.

												Fairly nice sequel to Airland Battle, I'll say. It's definitely not any worse, at least. The way decks work was shaken up a bit, but all the core mechanics are there. You still have to keep your troops supplied, your troops ninjas when hiding in bushes, etc etc. Although, there are some pleasant surprises. For example, the campaigns have a lot more personality to them than WALB, with more story, and they have bits of dialogue, but you still can choose where to send battlegroups and what not like in WALB. Also, mountains are no longer considered cover for infantry, not unless there's a bit of forest on there. Also, recon infantry now can see from mountains to some extent, much better compared to before. Though not a surprise being a much touted feature, naval warfare is now available. And with it, you can use amphibious transports which open up new places to attack which you can exploit, if you're against a new player who doesn't realize you can go there. Also, useful for new players, hovering your mouse over rank selections in deck making lets you see the benefits of that rank.All in all, it adds a lot of fresh air to the series, I'd say. The mix of new features, new armies, and upgrades to how things work add up to make an improved game, though not without problems like some odd bugs that slipped through and things.EDIT: It's even better now that East Germany and Czechslovakia aren't more or less kind of crippled compared to their comrades, with DDR having Tunguskas, Wachregiment, and other nice toys, and CZ have new improved Ondavas, militiamen, paratroopers, and a Mig-29 that drops napalm.TL;DR buy for True Korea, boats, and more mentally degrading chat.

												POSITIVE REVIEW FOR SINGLEPLAYER ONLY!!!!!!! 10/10If you want this game to play five really good campaigns against AI, then why the hell are you reading this and why haven't you started downloading it yet?The campaigns are great, challenging for a first time player and sometimes, it pisses you off to no end. There is easy 100 hours of game time on the campaigns alone. Otherwise, skirmish is fun. You can have massive tank battles or human wave battles if you wanted. NEGATIVE FOR ONLINE!!! 5/10If you want it to play online against other people, 50/50 chance you'll regret buying the game at full price. Online community is small but that’s not the issue. From experience, PACT forces massively outguns NATO.How you ask?Bigger, better, more cost effective artillery Better, more cost effective AA to the point where they can shoot down your SEAD aircraft before you can even get in range (and they get 5 of those bad boys in the deck) Better planes (to the point where it is almost impossible to bring them down, even by spamming jets) Tanks and anti-tank units that are way too overpowered when it comes to their pricing (Seriously, when pricing is compared to a Challenger 1 MBT, I’d take the PACT tank because I'll kill it with a missile from my tank before it gets in range -.-) Their only downside is the lack of infantry. But why the hell would you want infantry to storm the town when you can have a plane dump napalm on it or do a massive artillery spam and then send in tanks to kill severely damaged and panicked troops? Even then, just take SPETSNAZ and throw them into the town, they'll take down 2 times their points in either infantry or vehicles BEFORE THEY START TO TAKE DAMAGE!!!Furthermore, at least once every four games if you are playing as NATO, you'll go up against a person who loves spamming stuff. And not cheap bad stuff that you can bring down with one or two missiles either. And at least 1/10 games there will be a artillery spammer. Although you can have fun with NATO decks in online games, you will only get victory by being a a**hole and taking out their command forcing the game to end early.Online is fun though, that is if you like being PACT and can actually find someone willing to be NATO. 10/10 single player 5/10 multiplayer			"

												This game is absolutely amazing. It made huge improvements from EE and it only gets better. The only people that give this game a bad rating are the ones who think it's unfair when they for example tank rush thinking this is company of heroes and then they get slowed down with artillery barrage and wiped out by carefully timed air strikes.. You have to THINK a little bit and support your attack with many different types of units. So that's what I constantly read in the complaints. But that's typical of noobs. The only complaint I have is that the game needs some sort of award system in the form of unlockable content. There is a GREAT deal of units in this game that are all open to you, but leaves nothing to you to fight for and gain with your victories except some stats in the form of numbers.. Need a little bit of motivation for all of the great battles people have online. If that was in there I would give this game a 10/10 and shoot anyone who gives it lower. Buy the game it is amazing. Nothing else out there like this and I play all types of games			"

												Edited after 200 Hrs.Edited after 400 Hrs.Edited after 500 Hrs + 2 new DLCs.On my third review, this is still mostly a negative experience. Which is a shame because this game has so much potential to be a GREAT game, rather than a mediocore experience.Let me keep it simple:-Small attempts have been made to balancing, but frankly it needs a complete overhaul, especially with Infantry and Prototype units (more so with DLC nations)-Power difference between Nations and Coalitions is shockingly poor.-Navy is officially dead.-Terrible gaming community full of pros and new players, leading to extremely one sided games.(great game tho to play if you have a group of friends to play locally).-Pointless Cat C and B decks/theme. Dont expect a Cold War game, this is now effecetive a fictional game of Cold War going into the mid 2000s.-Poor single player experience.If they fix these issues, this could be one of the best strategy games in my two decades of gaming. It could be up there in e-gaming with Starcraft, Company of Heroes.For a single player experience, I highly recommend World in Conflict which has a fantastic campaign. The multiplayer is good too, but I think given its age, its probably a empty scene.			"

												This is a great RTS. Probably one of the best I have played although I have one gripe; the unbalanced units and disappearing tanks. What bothers me most about this game is that as soon as you fire a TOW or SALCOS, FAGOT missile at a tank, they often disappear for no reason. I watch a lot of war footage and have never seen a tank disappear after a TOW missile fires at it. Makes the game almost unplayable at times.			"

												Awesome, awesome game. This game really surprised me. The real appeal of it is in the multiplayer. The game the closest to it would be World in Conflict, but still It's very different from what I have ever played before. A bonus to it is that the cold war era setting is kind of rare in video games. It has some downsides but they are all forgivable.			"

												中国将越来越大If you're a fan of previous Wargame installations, Red Dragon is a must have. However, if you have no prior experience in the Wargame series but still insist on getting the game; be warned, the online learning curve is very steep.Wargame is a unique kind of Real-time Strategy game, differing from well-known RTS games like C&C or StarCraft in many aspects. Typical base building -- or rather, base building at all -- is absent, as are typical economic systems (i.e money, different resources and all that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t). The latter of which is replaced by a single, universal ""resource"", to which you use to bring units in from off screen. Wargame also incorporates more realistic mechanics into the game. Units will react to situations more realistically, for example, a tank company being bombarded by artillery or caught in a napalm strike will freak the ♥♥♥♥ out and try to escape from combat, disregarding orders in the process. Most units also have limited fuel and ammo, which will need to be resupplied to them. And projectiles act like projectiles would in real life, having chances to hit or miss a target, with factors like an obstructed line of sight coming into play.Now, as much as I love this game, I find that the naval combat -- one of the selling points of the game -- is unredeemably bland. As beautiful as it looks, there's almost no depth to it at all; it's a simple matter of ""huck enough missiles at the bad guys to kill them"". Unlike the aircraft mechanic which plays a pivotal role in the game, the naval combat's role is minor at best, but more commonly is downright trivial.Overall I give Wargame: Red Dragon a 8.5/10, Eugen definitely has not disappointed with the beautifully detailed battles that we've come to love from the Wargame series, but the not-so-subtle lack of depth from the naval combat is hard to overlook.Wargame: Red Dragon is a masochist's Cold War enthusiast's dream. A tough as hell RTS experience that somehow has you coming back for more. However, if you do plan on buying it, buy it for the multiplayer, singleplayer isn't even half the experience of the game.(P.S, this isn't a ""meh C&C"", think before you speak.)			"

												Great RTS, Realistic war strategy.Difficult to get used to if you are used to the classic ""make the most expensive unit, roll in"" crap of other rts games. If and when you do that (you will once if you are a fast learner, more than once if you are slow) you will watch all of your units die. tank vs infantry does not mean tank wins. helicopter vs infantry does not mean helicopter wins.  Unit composition is important to this game. Nothing is more satisfying than a 10 v 10 match where you and 1 friend take out an enemy navy that was created by 10 of the other teams player by yourselves with a much smaller navy. By use of islands, sea depth, coastal forces, and aircraft it is possible to do more with less. Which makes this game the Strategy game to play. Also. every time you don't buy this game an orphan has to watch someone else eat ice cream. You think about that. do you want that on your conscience?			"

												I've been playing around in the Wargame franchise sinc European Escalation, and Air-Land Battle, and Wargame Red Dragon adds a whole new aspect of battle with the concept of Navy. In a smaller Multiplayer setting such as 4v4 or 3v3, Navy becomes a key role in winning matches, but in a 10v10 it is almost entirely useless as both teams will always have someone that maxes out their navy because they think it's a ""good strategy"". But in all fairness, gameplay of this game in almost identical to that of the previous version of WarGame and it is on the rather advanced side of RTS games. So if you don't have patience to play a multiplayer match that can take two hours, I suggest you don't buy the game, but if you like constant combat, in a large scale, fast paced enviroment, and you have patience as well as a love for blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up with your friends, This is the game for you. I would give this game a 8.5-9/10. It is fun, but can be frustrating. Hope this helps :D			"

												If you think of buying this game, realise that the game is inbalanced, so playing everyfaction to win is not going to work. The AI on higher difficulty simply cheats more points so when you have 1 yet the enemy allready has 1,5 yet on the hard difficulties. Also the AI knows where you placed your hidden command vehicles and maybe also your hidden units. Playing vs AI is only fun if you put it on lower difficulties or disable the reinforcement points (this makes the AI unable to exploit thier massive point gain advatage, and makes both players start of with 1 army where they have to fight the rest of the battle with).The campaign imo is not realy enjoyable, you will find yourself grinding out enemy waves of units which are moslty straightup counters to your regirments, so if you have only tanks and yets the enemy will spam helicopters and yets and then straigt up overrun you, the AI is able to do this because in every campaign the AI starts of with a massive unit advantage and deployment point advantage. So for the campaign you are mostly trying to keep as many units alive and killing as many enemy units as possible battle after battle in the same area with the same units.However the game is beautifull and remember to only play the most overpowerd factions because the game is not fun if youre losing as an underpowerd faction. The israeli faction pack is a must have you even want to set 1 step into multi player because this faction is absolutely overpowerd and not playing as israel is a certain loss.There is also a serious lack of indicators, for instance the following indicators are still missing:range indicator of weapons, you cant see how far your units can fire.vision indicator of your units, you cant see what you can see, you will have to judge what you can see by expecriance.and various other indicators such as minimum range of your artillerythere are also no help guides or such things, you will have to learn to understand the game through youtube videos or something.this game is worth about 10 euro's but no more in my opinion, its fun but the lack of help and tooltips and indicators make it extremely hard to play. The campaign is simply not enjoyable, and the inbalance of the diffrent factions is also very annoying. yet if you buy israel the game gets a whole lot more fun.i have played a total of 40 hours of this game.

												Wargame Red Dragon is an excellent game. I play it a lot and i will continue so.There are of course good and bad aspects of this Real Time Strategy game.This game requires time and a lot of frustration to master but it will be worth it.Strategic thinking is insanely is important.There are thousands of units and most of them have unique abilities and statistics. 2 Sides Nato And Redfor. A lot of countries and coalition to choose. What i really love that you can select a speciality for your Batallion Deck. Marines, Airborne, Mechanized, Motorized, Armored, Support. Or just a normal deck with no speciality. It really depends of your style of play. When you join a server, a server host can select 1 of many maps, starting points, points required to win and a gamemode. 3 Gamemodes: Destruction: Gain points for destroying enemy unitsConquest: Eventually qain points for capturing and keeping the zones. Economy: Having as much Political Points as possible. This game requires a lot of teamwork. At the start of the game you will have time to deploy units with political points. When everyone launches battle the game will start. Usually you have to be self dependant. The unit cateqories are: Logistics: Command units. Supply trucks, supply helicopters, or a Forward Operating Base which has a lot of supplies.Infantry: Line infantry, Special Forces, Surface to air teams, Long range anti-tank missile teams.Tanks: From cavalry to super heavy tanks.Recon: Special Reconnaissance Forces, Recon Infantry, Recon Helicopters and vehicles light and armored.Support: Gun air defences, missile air defences, mortar units and howitzers.Helicopters: Gunships, anti-tank helicopters. Anti-Air HelicoptersAirplanes: Air Superiority Fighters, Anti Tank Planes, Multiroles, and Supression Of Enemy Air Defences SEAD planes.Navy: Battleships, Destroyers, Patrol Boats, Frigattes, Anti-Ship helicopters and planes.What i dislike about this game that there are public statistics about players. Other players can view them in a game lobby. In my opinion it should not be public because players are literally judged because of level, or win precentage. If you have low stats you might aswell be banned by an ignorant host. Single player campaiqns are good time killers. Very well made. But this game is missing a Multiplayer Strategic map just like in campaiqns. It would be a cool addition.10 Versus 10 matches. I dont know does these even have moderation because its very rare but possible that your teammate will troll the match. Ex: Teamkilling or rejoining the game to prevent it to be started. Usually it does not happen. Reskins. As i mentioned that this game has thosands of units, yes it does. But most of them arent special. When you compare units you might see that a unit is completely similar to other nations unit. They just look different. But usually its only line infantry. Not a big problem though. Nations are a lot different than others and thats a good thing.Overall i love this game. I would recommend this to anyone who likes realistic modern stategy games.			"

												Good addition to the Wargame series in terms of the single player campaign, the multiplayer is also good. I feel that the addition of naval was good but could have been done better by giving each nation there own navy, for example Britain could get various destroyer, frigate and cruiser from post WW2 to the second Korean war in game. But I understand that smaller nations navies would be hard to balance. Overall I would recommend to anyone who like a complex strategy game (this game requires you to manage fuel and munitions in battle).			"

												Okay, In short: This is a superb game.Okay, In long: You can gather hundreds of hours on this game. It has over 1000 lovingly crafted units. The maps and cover system is amazing. All the weapons and damage mechanics are un-matched in realism. The recon and air mechanics are amazing and it is the first RTS game I have seen to correctly implement fast air.This game is extremly difficult, it is nothing like other RTS games, it requires alot of learning and the tutorials are hopeless. I recommend reading the 200 page guide. The AI SUCK! They know where your units are and it ruins the game. This game is born for multi-player if you dont have a regular internet connection I dont recommend buying it.Overall I recon this is one of the best RTS games ever made. However if you are going to curse at the screen because you cant understand how your fighters were shot down by enemy AA.9.3/10			"

												In this game, the user had a omniscient perspective. This means the user can see the battle field from above making the game like a board game. It allows you to make your own deck of infantry, support, tank, recon, air and naval units from many different countries around the world. The game is very detail because each unit is very unique. The game is semi-realistic  because units have a variety of accuracies and units are able to get stuck in mud, detracted, run out of fuel, ammo and can be repaired. The naval battles can be different each time and it's beautiful to watch the battle play out. You can see a missiles flying around the battle field, being intercepted by sea whiz, radar missiles and flares. The game is great for huge battles and great screenshots.     There are only a few problem is that the AI can sometimes be buggy and there should be more campaigns. Another  problem is that you can't close the hud during a battle so if you want beautiful screenshots you need to watch the battle on replay which is sometimes tedious and boring.			"

												Sent a swarm of missile carrying helicopters, and missile carrying jets against a naval force, and sat back watching as the enemy fleet desperately threw up gattling rounds and flare countermeasures against the spam of missiles, smiling as one by one the big soviet ships blew up and sent a blastwave to ring against the hulls of it's allies.Then I fired the combined guns of my artillery to blunt an enemy push down a vulnerable gap in our lines. The enemy forces came to their senses just quick enough to see the napalm bombs from my jets drop on their heads and create havok amongst their lines.The survivors, still shaken from the bombardment were just about to continue their advance against my ally's thin perimeter only to hear an ominous distant boom-boom-boom, before beholding the arc of an incoming barrrage of missiles to blanket the area in explosions and fire.The enemy retreated, to regroup and rethink. Their answer would shortly come and I wouldn't be so lucky to come off so unscathed. 10/10 would fight WW3 again.			"

												Amazing game, very deep and enjoyable, and I appreciate all the aspects of strategy presented here. If you like Supreme Commander series, Men of War series, or even Total war series and you enjoy the cold war (1990s) setting you will really like this.			"

												I recently got into the wargame series, and this is by far the best installment. It is by far one of the most realistic strategy games I've ever played, with 1000+ units to chose from. My only minor critisisms are that there is a very steep learning curve and the game is very unforgiving and also some more research into the units on the lesser nations would be nice. Other than that this game is a must have for any hardcore strategy gamer. "

												Bought it to play with friends. If you have a thing for Strategy, and want to move on from turn-based (Like i did) this requires alot more managing which i love, the time flys in a match.Positive-NegativeAddictive-Hard to pick up for someLots of units and indepth stats to consider-Too many for beginners to understand easilyGreat with friends-Community is toxicMy only wish was for, maybe actually building a base. I understand F.O.Bs and all but upgrading them would be awesome, and get them with actual defenses.			"

												A very good and complex RTS game. Very punishing to new players however, and requires a focused mind, as there is usually a lot to do, and not a lot of time to do it. The game looks like it is slow paced but combat is actually very dynamic. It's just that the maps are big. Worth playing. Only pick up the latest version as the previous games of the series always feel like a downgrade.			"

												You can love it or hate it. Love Real Time Strategy? Buy it NOW...NO excuses. First person shooter or Turn Based Strategy? You'll get frustrated to no end. Been playing since the beginning of the series and I am a proud owner of each game. Wargame: European Escalation, Wargame: Airland Battle, and Wargame: Red Dragon are just simply the best modern RTS and has no competition. With satellite view straight down to bolts of a tank, the wargame series' focus on beautiful graphics aside from the truely inspiring game mechanics is what makes this series the best. The new Navy aspect introduced in Red Dragon gives endless options to attack the opposing enemy, but don't think the Navy will save you in every battle. You have the power to do whatever you want. Thinking from different perspectives during battle is what leads to victory. You got to love having a fresh experience each battle, and then replay the video capture to look at your mistakes and successes all while enjoy how beautiful the battle looks.This series keeps geting better with each year. W:EE - infantry,tanks, helocopters, and artillery. W:AB - intro to Airplanes. W:RD - intro to the Navy. Who knows what lies next. Do you have to buy all the games in the series? No, each new game adds to the old one and you don't miss anything jumping straight to Red Dragon. Its in the Cold War times and what could have happened. They keep adding to the game as the timeline gets closer to the 1990s which means bigger badder units and more choices. More opportunities.What are you waiting for? This is the best RTS on the market to date. If you think you are the best at conquering in Civ 5 then just try Wargame. No more thinking for 10 mins about moving to one space (which the campaign will cover that for those who like that) etc. Wargame is quick and new each time you go to a battle. You got to be quick, thoughtful, and strategic in Wargame battles. Time to play a real wargame. Wargame: Red Dragon			"

												     First off, let me get something straight. I reccomend that you purchase this game IF you are not only interested in tactical and strategic combat but also constructing decks by comparing long lists of numbers.  If you don't enjoy the latter, you can get away with copying others but you'll have difficulty if you want to construct your own deck of units.     As early as the game is, this game does need balancing so I don't think that it's fair to critisize what they've done on that front.  Be aware though that many units are subject to change in ability so you might want to wait awhile if you don't want to deal with that.     Of course the big question is naval combat and how much it offers. . I think that there will be groups who despise that new system and others who love it but Eugen has gotten around that by allowing you to play maps which offer all naval, combined and of course your standard ground maps.  The focus is a lot more on mobility than before, reflecting an era where the battefields would be massive and commanders needed to get their troops to the point of conflict as soon as possible.  This makes battles engaging and they rarely slow in to a stalemate or slugfest.   "

												Good addition to the Wargame series in terms of the single player campaign, the multiplayer is also good. I feel that the addition of naval was good but could have been done better by giving each nation there own navy, for example Britain could get various destroyer, frigate and cruiser from post WW2 to the second Korean war in game. But I understand that smaller nations navies would be hard to balance. Overall I would recommend to anyone who like a complex strategy game (this game requires you to manage fuel and munitions in battle).			"

Figure out the optimal deck, select the nations with the best overall chances of wining and master mind the game (Duh). 2) Just go in to appreciate the detail and thought placed into the way the game plays out. You probably wont win much but you will have a hell of a time just participating. Yes there are balance issues but isnt that true of the world we live in. I know most gamers dont appreciate that but a valid argument could be made that this just makes the game all the more immersive. I have been on the losing side of a steam role in which the enemy units far over powered my units. I approached it as if I were playing as a rag tag coalition of worn out and over worked units.			"

												Sent a swarm of missile carrying helicopters, and missile carrying jets against a naval force, and sat back watching as the enemy fleet desperately threw up gattling rounds and flare countermeasures against the spam of missiles, smiling as one by one the big soviet ships blew up and sent a blastwave to ring against the hulls of it's allies.Then I fired the combined guns of my artillery to blunt an enemy push down a vulnerable gap in our lines. The enemy forces came to their senses just quick enough to see the napalm bombs from my jets drop on their heads and create havok amongst their lines.The survivors, still shaken from the bombardment were just about to continue their advance against my ally's thin perimeter only to hear an ominous distant boom-boom-boom, before beholding the arc of an incoming barrrage of missiles to blanket the area in explosions and fire.The enemy retreated, to regroup and rethink. Their answer would shortly come and I wouldn't be so lucky to come off so unscathed. 10/10 would fight WW3 again.			"

												So real combat game with many units (exists in real world) and details. Once you get used to its system (which shouldn't take long), you will know why I keep playing this game this long. And it's very cheap compared to its performance. My first comment goes to this game, since I would like to thank the game builder for such an excellent work on the game.  "

												Great game, however it feels like an expansion to Airland Battle rather than a sequel. Although it is a fantastic strategy game I am not convinced it is worth the full $40 USD as it is essentially the same as Airland Battle just with navy warfare and a few extra countries.			"

												I recently got into the wargame series, and this is by far the best installment. It is by far one of the most realistic strategy games I've ever played, with 1000+ units to chose from. My only minor critisisms are that there is a very steep learning curve and the game is very unforgiving and also some more research into the units on the lesser nations would be nice. Other than that this game is a must have for any hardcore strategy gamer. "

												A very good and complex RTS game. Very punishing to new players however, and requires a focused mind, as there is usually a lot to do, and not a lot of time to do it. The game looks like it is slow paced but combat is actually very dynamic. It's just that the maps are big. Worth playing. Only pick up the latest version as the previous games of the series always feel like a downgrade.			"

												Wargame: Red Dragon is hands down the best strategy game out today. The maps are challenging, and interesting. There are over 1000 diffrent units to fight with. Each unit having real world statistics, and loadouts. Single player campaign is a challenge. But, the multiplayer is where this game truely shines. Multiplayer server settings are customizable which makes for very interesting battles. Going from a 2 vs 2, to an all out 10 vs 10, is jaw dropping. I am a huge fan of the series, and I highly recommend checking it out. There is a VERY steep learning curve, so be patient. The best part of this game, is watching Starcraft players get stomped because Zerging doesnt work in the real world.			"

Posted: July 1, 2014
												I think a friend of mine managed to summarize this game in a pretty clever way;This game is the ArmA of RTS games.And I wholeheartedly agree with the statement.IntroductionThis game is a very realistic RTS game based in a modern era(Though, it does have a few selections of WW2 assets, they don't do too well against modern assets. Who'd figure?).You'll be able to select between 2 factions; BLUFOR and REDFOR - but can also select a coalition within either faction. For example, you could play as the Commonwealth, NATO or even Scandinavia(Really appreciate the addition of Scandi!).One of the biggest aspects of this game is not only the sheer amount of units available at your disposal, but rather they way that you use them. Similar to card games, you'll need to build a deck.This Deck will consist of 9 categories;• Logistics (Supply and Command Vehicles)• Infantry• Support (Anti-Aircraft, Artillery and Mortars)• Tanks• Recon• Vehicles (Mostly consist of Jeeps, Light Armour - pretty much whatever isn't a MBT. Lots of TOW and ATGM)• Helo• Plane• NavalSo as you can see, you have a fair share of categories to build a deck out of. Of course you don't need to use all categories - but it is highly recommended. Because if you for example make a deck without anti-aircraft to support you, you'll be having a very, very bad time.When you create a deck, you'll also have the option to select bonuses. Basically what this does is limit the amount of cards you have, but in return for faster veterancy gain and availability.I won't go into detail on how this work, there's a very nicely written 200-page guide which cover each and every of your needs - while also having a little but of humour in it.First ImpressionsBeing a big fan of slow paced RTS games such as Total Annihilation, Supreme Commander and Command & Conquer, I wasn't quite sure what I was getting myself into. Honestly, I just bought the game cause it looked interesting and had some nice tanks I'm very fond of.My first impression of the game was something like; ""Wtf, no base building? LAME!"". This was one of my biggest complaints, but only since it was what I was used to. I then realized this isn't just like every other RTS game out there, this one is REALLY unique.I had a really hard time getting into the game, until now. Because of the other RTS games I had played, you grow this kind of habit to just spam the most powerful unit at your disposal and just overtake your enemy with brute force. You see, this does not work in this game - not at all.Every unit has something that counters that unit. The key of learning this game is something called Combined Arms. If you do not get used to Combined Arms, you will die. Horribly. Even by the Easy AI.That brings me to another topic; the AI.The AII usually find the AI to be a big disappointment in RTS games, especially since I'm not too fond of PvP in RTS games since mostly there's a select few tactics which are always the best way to go, and if you don't do either - you'll lose.I haven't really done any PvP in this game yet, since I'm still learning the basics against the AI. And I'll give credit where credit is due - the AI in this game isn't that bad.Especially for a game of such a scale, I find the AI to be rather competent. It's not the usual cheating AI you see in other RTS games where they get bonus income because they're an AI, they're not affected by fog of war because they're AI and so on. As far as I know, the AI doesn't have any handicaps(Correct me if I'm wrong!)[/i].Final VerdictAt first I'd probably rate this game a mere 4/10, simply because I couldn't get used to the fact it's extremely difficult to get into. But now that I've started to learn the basics, this game really does a great job at introducing a new kind of genre of RTS games - maybe I've missed some, but this is the only RTS game I've played which such a focus on realism.The interface is alright, there are some things that could be better. But the main menus for all W:ALB and W:RD look great and feel pretty immersive.You have a absolutely ridiculous amount of units available, you can fulfill whatever role you have ever wanted - either to great success or great failure - nonetheless, it's great fun to explore new things and build decks from scratch.I would highly recommend this game, but I'd also like to warn you;This game is extremely difficult to first get into. I would highly suggest you read the 200-page guide available BEFORE you play this game. Or else you'll with most likeliness end up not liking it, simply because you were a fool not to prepare.If I were to rate it, I'd give it a 9 out of 10. Losing 1 point because it does a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor job at introducing new players.The BadOf course, as with every game it does have its flaws here and there. Some of which in my opinion are;• TOW and ATGM can feel a bit overwhelming. Both when used against your enemy and used by your enemy.• The game does a poor job at showing how to bed use infantry. Garrisoned infantry is wunderbar!• Scandinavian troops are pretty outdated, hopefully they'll be updated with some DLC in the future!• Some sound effects are really bad, most notably the infantry's firearms sound absolutely dreadful. Where as vehicles can sound very satisfying.• The maps feel really repetitive, just different landscape but usually the same amount of spread sectors. Maps with bridges can be great fun, though! Bottlenecks ftw!The SuggestionsReally all I'd want for this game is Scandinavian troops to be updated, since there's plenty of 1990+ units in some nations. Sweden has plenty of modern equipment from 1990 and above.Other than that, some things I'd like to see;• A more unique variety of maps, some with a tight spread of sectors, some very open ones.• Some maps with a GREAT focus on urban warfare, where infantry and IFVs would really shine. With this I mean perhaps a most mostly consiting of a city, with some forested outskirts.• More satisfying sound effects for infantry! Sounds like paintball for crying out loud... "

												Got it during the open-beta, so far naval combat is promising but is still a work-in-progress. Ground warfare is top notch with more pronounced ground texturing and map design. With nearly 1,500 units, coalition unit decks, strong national doctrine (to a relatively high amount of authenticity though some aspects a little arcade like), you can command as much as a brigade in game, with many different tactics of war you can utilise to defeat your opponents. Graphics is at an all time high, though it could be expanded further (map wise), overall a top-notch strategy game. If you are someone who one day would like to be a military commander, whether it be army, navy, air force commander, you may like this. Don't let the hard-core oldtimers and strategist protoges downplay you as a noob at first, everyone eventually develops their game play to a respected level of tolerance.			"

												If, like me, you've always wondered if the F-15's perfect combat record is more of a product of its design or an indicator of the quality of the opposition it's been up against... if, like me, the thought of a horde of WW II era T-34 main battle tanks rushing a state-of-the-art Leopard 2A5 in a desperate attempt to land a lucky shot on its vulnerable rear armor makes you a little bit giddy... if, like me, a modern warfare RTS that models ammunition, fuel, and morale and supports up to 20 players in multiplayer each of which can specialize in roles from air support to infantry to artillery or any combination thereof sounds like the game you've waited your whole life to play:  buy this game.Just be aware that the community is small and always will be on account of the niche target audience of the game, and that for some reason the preferred gametype is a sitzkrieg-inducing extremely campy team deathmatch mode where artillery sniping usually carries the day.  Don't let that get to you though.  The fun in this game is seeing cool military hardware in action, it's not the best competitive RTS on the market.And let us not speak of the toxic chat community.  As that would be giving them exactly what they want.			"

												Great RTS, Realistic war strategy.Difficult to get used to if you are used to the classic ""make the most expensive unit, roll in"" crap of other rts games. If and when you do that (you will once if you are a fast learner, more than once if you are slow) you will watch all of your units die. tank vs infantry does not mean tank wins. helicopter vs infantry does not mean helicopter wins.  Unit composition is important to this game. Nothing is more satisfying than a 10 v 10 match where you and 1 friend take out an enemy navy that was created by 10 of the other teams player by yourselves with a much smaller navy. By use of islands, sea depth, coastal forces, and aircraft it is possible to do more with less. Which makes this game the Strategy game to play. Also. every time you don't buy this game an orphan has to watch someone else eat ice cream. You think about that. do you want that on your conscience?			"

My only minor critisisms are that there is a very steep learning curve and the game is very unforgiving and also some more research into the units on the lesser nations would be nice. Other than that this game is a must have for any hardcore strategy gamer. "

												Good addition to the Wargame series in terms of the single player campaign, the multiplayer is also good. I feel that the addition of naval was good but could have been done better by giving each nation there own navy, for example Britain could get various destroyer, frigate and cruiser from post WW2 to the second Korean war in game. But I understand that smaller nations navies would be hard to balance. Overall I would recommend to anyone who like a complex strategy game (this game requires you to manage fuel and munitions in battle).			"

												Okay, In short: This is a superb game.Okay, In long: You can gather hundreds of hours on this game. It has over 1000 lovingly crafted units. The maps and cover system is amazing. All the weapons and damage mechanics are un-matched in realism. The recon and air mechanics are amazing and it is the first RTS game I have seen to correctly implement fast air.This game is extremly difficult, it is nothing like other RTS games, it requires alot of learning and the tutorials are hopeless. I recommend reading the 200 page guide. The AI SUCK! They know where your units are and it ruins the game. This game is born for multi-player if you dont have a regular internet connection I dont recommend buying it.Overall I recon this is one of the best RTS games ever made. However if you are going to curse at the screen because you cant understand how your fighters were shot down by enemy AA.9.3/10			"

Truely a WargameWargame: Red Dragon is a military enthusiast's dream. It places you in command of both Western and Eastern fighting forces in a series of hypothethical conflicts set in the 1990's with it's singleplayer campaign. With Red Dragon's multiplayer, you can also face off against other players in large scale, strategic battles with all sorts of military equipment. Artillery strikes will pound forests and towns into dusts as infantry companies are slaughtered in buildings. Tanks will crest hills only to be annihilated by airstrikes. Your army will be destroyed again, and again, and again in every circumstance.My biggest warning, and the ultimate reason why I do not recommend this game, is the mountain of a learning curve that it suffers from. The ingame tutorial is outright pointless, and user created guides for this game for newcomers are literally 200 pages long. You would face less difficulty in being a Soviet officer during the invasion of Finland than playing this game.My first experience in the beginner campaign was that of utter confusion. I have played one of Eugen Systems' earlier games, RUSE, which is very similar in style and presentation to this game, but I was still bumbling in the forest. You will see your units be destroyed again and again as you fumble with the UI and are subject to a hundred different game mechanics at once. Combined arms are the way to succeed in this game, but good luck figuring out how to even command your forces effectively, as you must study pages of statistics in order to decipher the barebones and lacking user interface.In this game, you must account for individual platoons taking towns while also making sure they are resupplied and well fed - but don't forget that you must also cover them with smoke at all times or else they will be vulnerable to enemy tank divisions. Hide your men in the forest - but wait, the enemy recon car spotted you! Now the forest is in flames as artillery barrages incinerate it. Quick, scramble your attack helicopters and jets to strike the enemy guns, but wait - the enemy has waves of anti aircraft weapons that will destroy your aircraft! It is a punishing experience in which you must act as the officer of every single element of an army. Even when in complete comprehension of the game mechanics, it is still a punishing and often frustrating experience nonetheless.I would only recommend this game to those who have played earlier installations of the Wargame franchise, or have the fortitude to withstand endless documentation and guidance on this game to learn it. For some, they will experience the enjoyment of a noble when playing this game - but for the rest of us, we will only toil as peasants to understand it.			"

												As far as I'm concerned, this game is a very good one, simulating real time battles in modern warfare. There are virtually every unit you can find in today's military arsenal. Imaginary as the campaigns are, they are also reasonable enough and very likely to happen in that specific time period. For me, I enjoy the Second Korean War most for it provides much liberty and it is not very hard. All in all, if you are a fan of contemporary military equipment, or enjoy being in command of a modern army, this is definitely a game you want to try.			"

												TL;DR Looks good at first but devs don't really care and has many, many flaws. There is no competing game and devs milk you by generalizing  ""realistic units and fiting them to a game that everyone can play"".Nice game but if you pay attention you can see the flaws which are really big but masked from different many other elements.  First and foremost no recconect feature makes the game unplayable some times as it is plagued by random dcs(my connection is ok). Ships added at Red Dragon are a Fail cause of the 3 maximum weapons per unit. some have CIWS as a weapon some have it hidden Udaloy's CIWS fires missiles but not a single mention at the description.Tanks can fire to ships from woods about 2 Km inside land stay invisible and ships cannot counter them as they are blind. also ships are designed just for naval combat. Forget tomahawks and any other idea of supporting land units with ships. Line of sight is f@cked up as hell. ATGM plane fires TV guided missile enemy tank vanishes momentarily and missiles miss. What ? you have TOW,Hellfire and so many other toys in your infantry/tank/anyunitinthegame?? Sorry TOW is atgm only. u can't  fire it at enemy infantry. Also if you play Naval combat the win strategy is ---> REDFOR. I have never lost a single naval-only combat with redfor. NEVER. Scale is off when it comes to airplanes ships infantry and tanks.AI conserning airplanes and generally all units just sucks the UI is bad and there is no excuse for the DEVS cause this is not their first game. What they do is market the ""OVER 1500 units and stuff"" but in reality they re-use content. There are so many things that are broken and yet people play the game... why? cause there is no other similar alternative. The devs know it and the take advantage of it. Soon after Red Dragon came out,  Air Land Battle became obsolete and died. Why make red dragon a dlc when we can market the same units add some combinations and say that we worked hard and created a new game oh sooo fresh.Also that lvling/exp gain per match thingie is total bs cause u can just delete the .profile file in the pc and voiala all is gone.Why add leveling up when it has no use at ALL??? .Cause FU that's why.Graphics and explosions will blind you at the beggining but in the end the whole game is just scripts upon usless scripts. check naval combat. when a ship is hit it always gets the shot in the middle but when they miss all cannon shots against it fall infront or behind it. also for some reason some tanks seem to have some sort of invisible shield cause missiles aproch them and then are getting ""deflected"" for some reason.prolly infantry said ""meh let him live "" or ""OMG he disapeared he totaly is not there any more just press the self-destruct don't guide the missile in that forest just to be sure.....""Still the same Game with the same problems. 10v10 with plenty of points and it lags. Custom Servers with ""skillful"" ppl. Current Winning strategy for BLUEFOR naval combat ---> Don't play bluefor. And ofcourse Over 9000 units... just don't think   they are ""unique"". The only reason to play this is because there is nothing else in the same category worth of playing or even all togeather exists.			"

												The first 2 versions of this game were some of the most fun I have had in RTS. This however, is absolutely terrible. The units they have added such as the overpowered artillery and boring as anything ships make the game slower than it has ever been before and more annoying than ever. The maps are also terrible, losing the pinch points of old for a go all over crap fest. Don't bother buying, get Airland Battle, it is a million times better than this rubbish.			"

												Not much different from AirLand Battle but still fun when you get past the political rants from other players...

If you want to dabble in the useless extra content like ships and anti ship unit's then go ahead and try this Expandalone...

												Fair warning is that the learning curve is the hardest to overcome I have ever experienced out of everygame I have ever played in my life. Once you grind a little of practice and get past the learning curve this game is fantastic. Not related to gameplay but the lobby chat is full of autistic 'know it alls' who argue about information that they definately don't understand.			"

												If, like me, you've always wondered if the F-15's perfect combat record is more of a product of its design or an indicator of the quality of the opposition it's been up against... if, like me, the thought of a horde of WW II era T-34 main battle tanks rushing a state-of-the-art Leopard 2A5 in a desperate attempt to land a lucky shot on its vulnerable rear armor makes you a little bit giddy... if, like me, a modern warfare RTS that models ammunition, fuel, and morale and supports up to 20 players in multiplayer each of which can specialize in roles from air support to infantry to artillery or any combination thereof sounds like the game you've waited your whole life to play:  buy this game.Just be aware that the community is small and always will be on account of the niche target audience of the game, and that for some reason the preferred gametype is a sitzkrieg-inducing extremely campy team deathmatch mode where artillery sniping usually carries the day.  Don't let that get to you though.  The fun in this game is seeing cool military hardware in action, it's not the best competitive RTS on the market.And let us not speak of the toxic chat community.  As that would be giving them exactly what they want.			"

												Best RTS game EVER! I am a master level starcraft 2 player. I am a bit old right now so I quit sc2 and turn to this brain-oriented game (instead of APM driven). This game is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥awesome! It even makes me have great interest in all things related to military lol.Good Side: -Fantastic graphics. -Use your BRAIN to crush enemy instead of Fingers  -Hyper close approximation of the real world Bad Side:- The learning curve is steep (I finally figured out this game after reading 200 pages of tutorial written by a PRO player from stream community. Thanks! It helps a TON!) "

												The game itself is good but it is close to impossible to get into it.Pointless to play against A.I, you can not improve your game playing against it. It knows where your recon/units are and just endlessly spams its own units without any penalty.The community is dead. A few servers with hardcore players only. No matchmaking whatsoever.People will check your profile and dodge games cause you're a scrub.Save your money or if you really have to get when it's on massive sale.			"

												Played some multiplayer before, often only with friends, tried the single player campaign. As always, step learning. Watched this game pretty much from day 1. Dident play Wargame: European Escalation at all, but i did play Wargame: Airland Battle and that was a great game. From what i understand alot of units from European Escalation was just ported into Wargame, so some units lacked detail.And here we are, with Red Dragon. Naval warfare galore it seems, but alas. No. I expected each country to have their own naval units, but instead each side shares their boats, so Blufor and opfor get their 15 or so boats, and every country can access all boats. That means that armies from like Scandinavia can use the Oliver Hazard Perry as their boat if they feel like it.There aren't alot of boats out there even, which sucks. For a game that boost about 1400 and something units it just feels... rushed. So it fails to deliver on that front. We do however get 4 new faction or so, and some alliance choices. You can now create decks of units from the commonwealth army or why not use scandinavian units et.c.Gameplay still feels like Airland Battle, nothing really new here. They told about terrain diffrences and that hills can block your line of sight and such, haven't really noticed anything diffrent from Airland Battle.And it might just be me but would'nt it be time to update the models abit. There are alot, and i mean alot of errors and problems in the models. Some examples are :Aircraft that are sunken abit into the ground when you create your decks (Landing gear clips through ground).Aircraft have payloads that are so large so they clip through the ground.Still uses models from European Escalation. Good examples are helicopters, some lack interiors all together. Some have interiors but no pilots, while newer helicopters have interiors and pilots.Many infantry units are portraited wrong ingame, sure you rarely play this game zoomed in but heres an example. The Swedish M90 uniform was formely introduced in the 1990, But was already in use since 1985. Wargame: Red Dragon is a game that spawns from 1970 to 1992 atleast. If we go after Eugen way of doing everything the easy way, why not butcher the U.S. Marine infantry model (They wear somewhat modern armor and BDU:s), arm them with the AK4 Rifle and just make a reskin so they use the M90 pattern? Easy as pie. (I know this might be slightly biased cause im from sweden, but as i see it, if i can find errors in a country representing my own, then others will do the same with their own countries)There are also some bugs here ande there, units that don't load in correctly, most units are just reskins of tanks from other nations et.c. Those skins are often portraited wrong, many of the nations camo dosen't even match (wasent there something called uniformity in the armed forces). I mean should'nt every nations unit look like they camed from the same place, instead of having some units colored in desert camo. Some in olive drab, some in digital camo et.c.These are mostly visual errors, the game has some bad problems with balancing. And suprise, suprise, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community from ALB has moved over to Red Dragon, new players will have an hard time getting help, bashing is to be expected and if thats not happening then theres always someone spamming the chat with flag emotes.And lastly, i find it hard to believe there are actully 1400+ diffrent units in the game. Most infantry can be ordered in diffrent transports. Are all those diffrent variations classed as a unit? I believe that's how they count. If someone actully counted all units (excluding their transport options) i'd bet there are alot fewer units to choose from.Can i recommend this game? No. Sorry, i really can't. It's nothing special, Airland Battle feelt like a more complete game all in all. At the time of writing this, the game was on -50% sale (19,99€). And i can't really tell if this is a reasonable price for this game... maybe, i guess? Get it if you feel like it for that price, or hope for an even better sale. Play it with friends, do not expect to much and well... maybe, just maybe you'll have a good time for a couple of games or two.			"

												I spent an evening drunk as I amassed an army of over 900 screaming Chinese and North Korean conscripts birthed for the sole purpose of giving their life for the Great Leader in a charge of glory across a 3km open field without any air defense. 600 meters in my glorious bulwark is buzzed by a pair of A10s, then followed up with a napalm strike from an F4. My army now stands at 700 flaming, incredibly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off riflemen armed with little more than a scrap metal in the shape of a burp gun. The march continues.At 1400 meters we are in range of the bulk of enemy defenses. I am reduced to a mere 300 men in the span of four seconds, The march continues. At last we are in range, with 200 of the Great Leader's finest troops collectively decending upon a lone M1 Abrams tank as the capitalist pigs look on in shock and mild confusion. The tank operator is slightly worried, but otherwise unhindered in his task. This is good, now comes phase two. A turboprop bomber approaches from the south, dropping a 3000kg warhead dead on top of the command Abrams. My conscripts are collectively granted the sweet release of death, and I even managed to detred the lone tank. This all grants time for the two man anti-tank unit to garison a building opposite of the valley and singlehandedly decimate the enemy armored regement. 11/10, I have proven my honor.			"

												Amazing successor to the already superb Airland Battle. The addition of a time-control feature is a godsend for people like me who struggle with very fast-paced RTS play. Slightly ambivalent about the addition of naval units, but overall this game still shines as a unique blend of fun, serious tactics, an absolutely amazing array of units and unit types, and for *many* different nations / alliances. A must-buy for anyone interested in modern-day combat. Even grogs who gravitate to the ultra-serious sims like Command: Modern Air / Naval Ops will find a lot to enjoy here.			"

												I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RTS games. It may take a while to get your head around everything in the game, but once you know how everything works it is great fun and easily takes up all your free time.			"

												Pros1)1500 units with real specifications2)Endless strategy3)The game finally has a slower button. It gets normal, slow, very slow and bullet time. No more battle frustration because of many things happening at once. You can now deply your strategy and lose fair and square.4)Active multiplayer5)Five campaigns6) you can now deploy ships, have naval battles and you can also invade through land7) Realism, which means everything you can imagine. Realistic damage, the units get battle hardened, each dead unit stays dead so you should preserve your units, enemy withdraws if you do extensive damage, realistic strategy, units need resupply and rearmingy, you win the map sector by sector, battles do not end in one day, there are political influences that can change the cause of war etc.Cons1)Steep learning curve, like all wargames. If you hate realism, do not play it.2)Poor tutorial3)Not being able to choose sides at campaigns4)So many units is wonderful for army freaks but can end up being frustrating for casual games. Then again, this game is not casual.OverallProbably the most realistic modern strategy simulator. If this is not enough for you, i do not know what else will be.			"

												Amazing successor to the already superb Airland Battle. The addition of a time-control feature is a godsend for people like me who struggle with very fast-paced RTS play. Slightly ambivalent about the addition of naval units, but overall this game still shines as a unique blend of fun, serious tactics, an absolutely amazing array of units and unit types, and for *many* different nations / alliances. A must-buy for anyone interested in modern-day combat. Even grogs who gravitate to the ultra-serious sims like Command: Modern Air / Naval Ops will find a lot to enjoy here.			"

												This game can be brilliant - the tactical thinking required puts it way beyond most other modern RTS games - the graphics are great, the units are varied and 'real' and the campaigns are stretching and a brilliant mix between semi-strategic and full tactical. I love it and I've found myself going back to the campaigns again and again to try out different strategic plans and battlegroup / company / battalion combinations.Would I recommend it? NOIt is mainly a multiplayer game, this is fine, it has a strong multiplayer community  - all the wargames have had this, but there is no multiplayer campaign - which makes this a multiplayer skirmish game with a limited single payer bolt on - a wasted opportunity, and my advice would be don't waste your time. Particularly as, at the point of both pre-purchase and full publication the Eugen website was advertising this game as having a multiplayer campaign - either an honest mistake or a strong indication that something went very wrong in development. I won't be purchasing any more Eugen products unless full multi campaigns are an option. Don't bother with it unless all you want is sup com style skirmishing - otherwise buy Wargame Airland Battle - it's cheaper and has a multi campaign option, though it isn't quite as good. Eugen , you really missed a trick there.			"

												If you like to micromanage every little detail of your army down to refuelling and resupplying ammo then this game is for your. It has 1500+ units with no descrition as to their purporse, just stats. It has no playable tutorial and i guess is a cool game if you played all the previous ones? I found it overwhelming and it seemed to put little to no effort into teaching you how to actually play the game. I do not recommend this for anyone who has not played previous versions until the get a good playable tutorial at the very least.			"

												I'm not a fan of Wargame, nor Strategy games in general. But this one interested me. With all it's trailers of Jets, Explosions and Furious Hell-ish Combat. So when it came out, I quickly sprang for my wallet. One of the things that interested me was how many countries and vehicles were in this game. So not knowing how to play a Wargame title, wondering if this is like any of its predessesors, I went to the Campaign thinking, like most games, it would have a tutorial at the beginning. (And yes I did look at the tutorial that was in the menu, however hoping that there would be a ingame video, or picture or something, and finding nothing but text, I didn't look at it too long).When I got into the campaign, I was greeted with a cinematic with old camera footage from the 80s, after that it showed me a big map of North Korea and South Korea and I had to defend the Capital of South Korea. A Picture of a Man told me that I had an incoming transmission from a Soldier. It then showed me a South Korean Soldier telling me my Objective. With no voice acted dialog at all, I was getting flashbacks for some reason of a mobile game called Clash of Clans which I despise because of its F2P concept that plagues modern gaming.After those interactions it let me take control of the camera. Noticing that there was no tutorial, I was stunned. So I decided to take matters into my own hands. On the border of enemy and friendly territory, I saw a North Korean Tank Battalion, and on the other side, I saw a South Korean Tank Battalion. So I though, ""Let them Fight"" (Godzilla 2014 Reference) So I dragged the SK Tank onto the NK tank, and nothing happened. I clicked on the SK tank and nothing happened.Seeing how a Planetside 2 Event had been launched by the AJSA. I quit to desktop and haven't played it since. If a Wargame Veteran could help me. That would be great.In my (short) Experience with the game, I cannot recommend it. Not to newbies like me atleast.			"

												Micromanagement and spam. Thats covering about 90% of the experience youre gonna get from this game. But one thing after another.The core gameplay is good, really good. Building your own deck each with its own strengths and weaknesses is fun. And trying it out makes even more fun, at least most of the time or at the start of the game. But once you notice that there are serious balance issues it becomes a lot more frustrating. For example:""Heli rushes"" (a ""strategy"" that means you invest all of your points into Helicopter and send them around corners of the map; attacking the enemy spawnpoint) are completly broken, because you are forced into a lose-lose situation. Either invest money at the start of the game into your base and risk not having enough in your front line (in case your opponent actually wants to play the game) or invest nothing and get instantly destroyed by the enemy if they decide to start a ""Heli Rush"". The worst of all is that it takes no talent or planning at all. Just spam one unit; send it to one location; win. You will encounter this ♥♥♥♥♥torm in almost every third ranked game. Almost none keeps playing ranked because of that♥♥♥♥♥♥ And if i say none i mean none. One person out of 1000 players per day start a ranked (and there are about 400-700 players per day activ).Air units become useless after the 10-20 minute mark, because all players build a relativ strong AA-Base at this point in the game. Tanks are a must have and easily the strongest units in the game. If you or your team dares to play without them they will have almost no chance at winning the game. This would be fine if it wasnt for the fact that this destroyes a huge part of the entire deck building. Aircraft based decks, infantry based decks, etc are just worse then the tank based decks. Of cource it depends also on the map your playing, but at the end of the day you will still have a significant advantge with the tank based decks every time. ---This could be accapteble. After all if the gameplay would have nothing besides balance issues you could easily play with friends or just ignore it (somehow), but sadly it dosent. The problem is (or cource) unreasonable and useless micromanagement. In 9 out of 10 cases the person with better ""micro"" will win no matter how stupid they might be.If you start a game you will get about 2-10 minutes of deploytime to select your units, try to think about your tactic, maybe talk with your team about a overall strategy and so on. However once the game starts you are forced to select each unit you deployed and send them to their location - *after* the game started. Its a annoying ♥♥♥♥ton of work every single time. Remembering the Typ, Plan, and position of about 20 (+/-15) units that are all called ""KA-52a"" ""T80UM"" or ""T80A"" is nearly impossible if you are new at the game and extremly difficult beyond that. And dont even get started about enemy Aircraft...""oh no there is an ""F-15A Eagle"" coming to Alpha"" or ""oh no there is an ""F-15D Eagle"" coming to Bravo"". One of these Aircraft units is a AA-Superiority Jet and the other one a heavy bomber. Have fun learing the diffrence. (Just a funny side note: you cant rename your units)And it gets even worse. If you finally managed to send all of your units to their location they will refuse to stay at the *exact* location you have given to them. They will stand around an 10m radius of the order you have given to them. This is just cancer since there are many situations where you need your unit at a absolutly specific locations, but this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ just refuses to do so.But wait...it gets even worse. If you somehow managed to send your unit to the *exact* location (usually by just command them to go 50m beyond x and then just hit ""stop"" once they are 5m befor x), then they will not face the frontline...with their own frontline. For example i command my tank to x; he goes x (after that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t) and then reloactes his frontal armor to y, because 1500m away (and thats no joke) is a cheap transport thats just standing the open - making himself extremly vulnerable to the Tank-hunter at x. I lost already way too much high value units because of that♥♥♥♥♥♥and there is not a single way to disable this ""feature"". And dont fool yourself. This dosent happen once every 50 matches, but *every single match you will ever play*. All of these problems. It just kills all of the potential fun, desicion making and overall gameplay. Just spam, micro and abuse silly mechanics to win the day.Dont bother and buy yourself something that you will actually enjoy.			"

												An inferior update to the venerable Wargame: Airland Battle. Red Dragon takes a lot of the worst aspects of W: ALB and magnifies them ten times - point & click artillery and airplanes are vastly superior to conventional ground forces, the maps are so large now that moving tanks and other ground vehicles across the map is impractical because they require micromanagement and extra resources just to ensure they have enough fuel to move halfway across, and the game is still missing many quality of life features like the ability to reconnect to a game (the netcode is even worse now than in ALB) or a ruler to measure distances. The community has devolved into nationalistic tribalism, and the developers do not take substantive and researched criticism into consideration.Red Dragon is a quick and dirty cashgrab compared to Airland Battle. If you want a modern RTS that isn't StarCraft, I heartily recommend ALB.			"

												I played all the wargames before and this is by far the worst.The naval battles are totaly unbalanced. Also the balancing of the other units was much better in earlier wargames. The maps are much bigger and favour air units even more than in wargame airland battle.Yes they have much more units but the balancing is ruined.A really good thing are the new menus, which are much easier to navigate and have been enhanced with some very usefull tools (copy decks and send as hash).Overall this is a bad addon for the previous wargames and just money grabbing. I really regret buying this game.			"

												Very authentic. Learned Russian, and the russian teenager's idea of a perfect world. Dos Vidania.I like cold war stuff this game very misleading tho cause the war is very hot and dangerous and not vry cold at all actually. You also get to kill many yellow skins if you play america which makes the game 10/10 automatic. I hate commies and yellow skins so this game is good buy for me. If you live anywhere but america you probably hate america cause youre a jelous ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cause we are better so if you buy this game you can play as the commie ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and kill young american heroes like the red piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥you are. I suck at this game and i argue with people in the global chat sometimes so don't listen to me			"

												This is what I first thought after an hour of playing it- Unplayably complicated with no tutorial, this game drops you into the fight straight at the deep end. The ""tutorial"" on the menu screen is basicly the manual, and you better read and understand it first go because you can't get to it ingame. If you want to spend two hours trying to figure out why you have no troops to command or lose thirty seconds in, buy this game. If you want a decent Real Time Stratery game, look elsewhere. I'm sorry I atually paid money for it.- UpdatedBecause I paid for it, I stuck with it. It took me about five hours of blundering around and re-reading the tutorial section, but I finally worked out the resource mechanics, how you have to secure sectors to call for reinforcements and the incredably complicated rock-paper-sissors system of weapons and counter weapons. I am, at last, enjoying it, although I still think it desperately needs some better introductions for new players. I have had some stabilty issues with crashing graphics, but infrequently, its not a massive problem. Overall, its a pretty decent, highly complex, combat simulator. Be prepared to sink a few hours into reading the online player guides, and more hours into learning the systems by losing repeatedly. This game will eat your time up.			"

												This game is a gem, a masterpiece. Eugen has fine-tuned every title in this serie, and in this the latest one put themselves in the absolute frontline of realistic RTS games.This is a deep game, with a massive amount of real world unit types which allows you to build your own combined force. The game mechanics are quite easy to learn but hard to master, but the pure amount of statistics of every single unit means you have to put in a great amount of time to learn how to use each unit the best way possible.You have to concentrate on your strategy and mastering the use of different unit combinations for the given situation and be prepared of your opponents units and how to counter them. The campaigns are not the strenght here, but the multiplayer are, and it is excellent. Eugen is continously and often updating the game and tweaking/correcting units, game balance etc to fine-tune the game according to the players response. DLC´s with new countries are continously beeing released.Prepare to loose sleep. The more you put into this game, the more it gives you back. It is timeless in many aspects.			"

												To put it simple, Wargame red dragon cheats its way with the 'Detail' by multiplying the same contents into different names and stats and use of same models. It has very little to do with actual stredgy for the terrain and condition of which units fight in has very little to no effect. It is simply an arms race game, just like rock, paper, scissor, each different unit become more efficent against what they were armed for. It boils down to a spawn and send gameplay, since it has no actual detail in the little things; game becomes a birdeyeview ant fight.			"

												One of the finest strategy games ive had the pleasure to play. punishing, realistic, steep learning curve for multiplayer. There are minor discrepancies in some of the units in how they should look vs how they are modelled ingame, but still worlds ahead in realism beyond any game ive played in the genre. I hope they continue to make more in the series. If they would just un**** their campaign mode and allow coop/competetive campaign, this would be my ""total war"" game covering the scope of the modern era 1960s-1990s. Your selection of units is so vast (over 1700 unique units last i checked) covering everything from warplanes to infantry to ships, tanks, helos, armored cav, air assault forces, AA, SAMs etc etc... that the people who inevitably cry: ""That side is OP"" ""US too stronk"" ""new update makes game casul friendly"" ""USSR tank-rush new-meta"" are missing the point. Modern militaries are simply unequal, not all technology held by one nation is comparable to that of others. Sometimes it is superior, sometimes downright inferior. But taken as an aggregate with so many advantages given to the various sides in DIFFERERENT ASPECTS of their forces (IE numerical advantage, accuracy, killing power, speed) It truly comes down to who is the better commander, something not easy to do in a HIGHLY assymetric RTS.

												As a long time fan of the series I have to say I am overall disappointed with Red Dragon. It looks great, and has a wealth of units from a range of nations and coalitions. Naval combat is a nice idea, but it fails really. But my biggest annoyance is now there is very little point in taking infrantry or setting up in depth defence. Cover or houses have very little effect against HE or bombs, and an inability to dig in leaves infrantry just sitting there waiting to get killed. The advantage in technology along with it being easy to see your opponents units with recce and air units makes taking an 80 or 85 era list rather pointless as well. You may as well just get the best units available and out range and out muscle your opponents, which is kind of what the western units do in the majority of games. Unless you are playing as part of a group of friends coordinating your moves winning as pact seems far to hard and far to rare. Personally I also think the game needs to be slowed down as the strategy side of it is diminshed by local area rushes which comes down to numbers and fire power rather than making defensive positions hard to crack they just get over run.
