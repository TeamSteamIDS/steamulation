												This is probably the first Arcen game that didn't hit the mark. All of their games so far have been fresh and quite fun, but have also always been flawed. None of them have been perfect, but they were innovative, and always try a different formula of game and were ultimately fun to mess around. Skyward Collapse is another really cool idea, but the game doesn't come together. Resource management is tedious, the idea is really cool, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. Turns keep taking longer, and every turn becomes a bit more boring than the last. I really want to like this game, but the longer it drags on, the more you see the game's flaws come together and create this game where there's a lot of different parts of the game that either don't feel fun, or feel out of place.If you're interested, make sure you watch some gameplay, or try out some demo's. This game just isn't for me.			"

												If being a God is like this game, it's pretty lame. Let's be honest: it's not the worst game ever, it's a game that is just average in everything. The graphics are pretty simple, and I understand that top notch graphics aren't required to a game be any good, but the lack of things like character animation make this title looks worst than most of f2p cell phone games. The objective is very inovative and distinctive from other God games: you should keep the balance between the factions. But it's simple boring, sometimes I just skip to the next turn waiting for something to happen, sometimes you need to make your ""civs"" ready to wage war, because there are an amount of points required to win the match in each difficult. And... that's it. The interface is kinda messy, the game doesn't do a very good job in order to show to you what is needed to be built and what are the requirements for each unit... I'm not saying that this info isn't available, it's just so much pain to get to it. So, let's wrap up: the concept is great, the interface is messy and clunk, the graphics are sub par and the music is quite good. Thats it, I can't recommend this game, but I would like to see this concept in a more polished and diversified game.			"

												My biggest problem with this game is that the ai does not do anything. both sides will stagnate and not do anything if left alone, and you are tasked with growing them to defend against bandits while stoping them from killing eachother, this is not entertaining. you end up having to grow both sides while defending against bandits, and it fails to feel like these are 2 civilizations, they are more like blocks you throw down, compleately inanimate.This can be fun, but you end up having to build the entire game and create everything becuse they won't build a single hut on thier own. I would enjoy the game alot more, if they showed a little bit of autonomy.			"

												Perhaps I had too high of expectations for this game, but unfortunately, it didn't live up to them.In more ways than one, Skyward Collapse feels more like a mobile game than one which, it seems to me, was developed for desktop computing. Its simple graphical sprites would feel right at home on a tablet, but seem out-of-place on a PC. Making matters worse, the clunky user interface manages to simultaneously overwhelm the player with information, while not giving her enough data with which to learn the game.Though the tutorial helps by walking the player through the early steps of gameplay, it seems very fond of telling her about things you'll have to worry about later on in gameplay, without telling her any appropriate steps to take when she does encounter them.By and large, however, the major strike against this game is, well, it's boring. After the initial setup period, gameplay becomes unbearably slow, a pain which is only mitigated by the shortness of the games themselves. The position the game puts the player in changes throughout the game, leading to what are arguably contradictions: she has both the power to summon wild beasts and unquestioningly place down buildings to aid the mortals, but is subject to the resources they have on hand. Resources the game is fond of telling the player she's missing, but not how to acquire without a scavenger hunt through the long-winded information prompts scattered throughout the game.While Skyward Collapse shows great potential through its promotional screenshots and videos, it fails to live up to it in execution, leading me as a player to be very disappointed in the overall game.

												Skyward Collapse asks its player to take on the role of a mighty demon, sworn to maintain the world in a state of war for all eternity. For three ages, he must torment mankind with the endless misery of constant war, balancing the bloodshed and destruction so that neither side of the conflict wipes the other out. Only if the ground is soaked with enough blood and tears will he be victorious. It's not billed to the player that way, of course.Skyward Collapse is an odd little turn-based strategy game where the player controls the building but not the movements of both sides of an ongoing war. The player chooses where each civilization's 5x5 towns will be placed on the game's isometric rhombic grid, and what buildings will be in them in what arrangement. Once units start coming out of those buildings, however, they do whatever they want.While the player can exert some control by altering the landscape of the constantly-growing field of play, doing so drains actions he could be using to enhance his cities. The core idea here is actually quite clever, and maintaining the balance of power under these conditions poses a fair challenge.The game is divided into three ""ages,"" and the player has to meet a score requirement at the end of each to continue (or, in the final age, to win). The only way to score, however, is for units to die or buildings to get destroyed. I suppose it's obvious that I found that representation distasteful.Skyward Collapse adds to the challenge with ""Woes,"" which are random events that can cause most of the map to turn into mountain terrain, or all the units to wander around aimlessly, or giant monsters to appear everywhere. Bandit Keeps full of non-aligned units also form frequently, sometimes quite close to towns, and can pose a serious danger to the civilization balance because their units tend to be seriously overpowered.The mighty bandits and deadly catastrophes mean that most of the time the game's civilizations are endangered more by the environment than each other. To meet these threats, the player has the ability to summon magical creatures and objects for either side, some of which can unleash the power of ancient gods worshiped by the denizens of his tiny world.The gods and monsters come from Greek and Norse mythology. While each has an impressive array of specific units, unique monsters and appropriate deities, most of the buildings are nonspecific, which gives the towns a samey feel. This is compounded, especially in the early game, by the fact that no matter how different the buildings look, the resources and support buildings needed to produce specific units are pretty much the same. As a result, most of the towns end up being pretty similar.The endgame suffers from a complementary problem. Once the production of units is well and truly going (and especially if the sides really are evenly matched) there's not a lot for the player to do. In most of my games I spent the endgame fast-forwarding as much as I could, only making adjustments when a town was in serious danger. The AI sometimes has curious priorities—I once watched a massive army parade peacefully past a minotaur that was destroying their city—but it generally works well enough that there's no need to interfere by altering the landscape.This means that of the game's three ages, only 1.5 or so end up being interesting. The foundational work of making the first towns is too similar, while the player's role in the final conflicts is too passive. That compounds the unpleasant premise of Skyward Collapse with somewhat boring play. Not only did I have to be incredibly evil, I didn't even get to have fun doing it.The core idea of a balancing a strategy game with limited player control is intriguing, but I found the execution of that idea, and the representations it used, unsatisfying. Arcen has made an ongoing and admirable effort to keep tweaking the game, but I'm just not sure that anything they can do will address the essential dullness of its opening and closing phases.			"

												It's an interesting premise; I rushed to it because I missed playing god games. Unfortunately, it doesn't manage to be a very good god game, leaning more towards the TBS side, and it's not a great TBS either. If you're anything like me, you'll probably love it for the first 20 rounds or so; then your interest will fall more and more. By turn 70 I just wanted it to be over.Some have said that the main problem is a lack of challenge: once you figure out how to play it, that's it. But if that was the case, you could just get more bandits and woes. (In fact, I managed to lose it once, and that didn't make it much more interesting.) In my opinion the problem lies elsewhere: it gets repetitive, and it feels pointless. In a god game, you usually have a “project” in your head, something you want to do; in an RTS or TBS, you're constantly under pressure by the opponent(s). Here neither thing happens: no use having a project because you have very little control over what will get destroyed, and also because there is simply not that much you can do; and the pressure simply isn't there either, since winning is “score X points and make sure both factions survive” — once you reach the required score and have one well-fortified town of each faction safely away from the conflict areas, it's an annoying game of attrition.Again, it's a very interesting premise, and I'll keep an eye on it — it has a lot of potential to be fixed in an expansion or sequel. But as it currently stands, I don't think it works.			"

												Skyward Collapse is a turn based god/strategy game. The goal of the game is to balance two opposing factions by supplying them with resources and buildings. You must cause enough chaos between the two factions to get your score high enough to pass through three rounds until you reach the end of the game to achieve a victory.Skyward Collapse features one of the best tutorials I've seen in awhile. The game can be overwhelming at first, but the tutorial does a great job of holding your hand through your first game. The tutorial will teach you the basics of the game while giving you the freedom to play around and experiment as you see fit. You won't know 100% of everything after your first play-through, but you should understand the basic concepts and be ready to play a better game on your 2nd time around.Skyward Collapse features very basic animation and graphics, it's best to think of it like a board game. Units move around the game like pieces on a board, and when they fight, they just bump into each other until one falls off the board.I would say if you are interested by this review at all, you should go ahead and pick the game up. It is only five bucks, and even if you end up hating it, you've only wasted a few dollars. If you do not like turn based strategy, or if a lack of graphics or animation is a big turn off, stay clear of this one.For more info, you can find my full review here: http://hashron.com/display.php?id=18 "

A Paladin's Steam Review: Skyward Collapse. An Intriguing Combination of God Game and Turn-Based Strategy.Genre: Turn Based Single & Co-Op Player Strategy God GameDeveloped and Published by: Arcen GamesPlatform: Windows, MacOSX and LinuxBusiness Model: Base Game + Expansion DLCCopy Gifted by a Friend Overall Gameplay ThoughtsSkyward Collapse is a combination of turn-based strategy and god game elements. Where your goal is to keep two factions in a balanced war while building up the continent they exist on. If one side takes out the other, it's game over. The trick to accomplishing balance is that you have no direct control over the faction's actions, there are independent factions and cataclysmic events that can change the landscape. You don’t have direct control over the units in the game but you can influence each faction and their actions. Each turn you can create land tiles, military/resource buildings and semi-direct the flow of the game. While you might think ""just turtle/don’t build units and you’ll achieve easy balance"", well, Skyward Collapse won't let you. You have to achieve certain point goals every X turns or you'll fail the game. And you only get points through units/buildings being destroyed. Expect units and buildings to die. A lot. You’ll need to keep producing more buildings and units for each side to kill. Keeping this balanced is exceptionally tricky, especially when chaotic forces intervene. Just so you know, you do have some direct actions you can take such as smiting buildings or putting down a way point that the faction may or may not respond to. So you’re not completely helpless. Learning CurveThe game has a fairly difficult learning curve to it, though it’s not TOO dense. There is a tutorial which can introduce you into the game and give you a good idea of what’s what. But you’ll have to figure out several tech trees, which buildings are important and what units are most effective towards your goals. Additionally, each faction has a distinctive personality with their strengths and weaknesses to understand. The UI is great with displaying information but the amount of information can be overwhelming at times. The game itself can be chaotic with the neutral factions spawning their units and Woes creating widely variable situations (think plagues or earthquakes splitting the lands). There is a LOT of content in this game and learning it will take a decent amount of time. You’ll be playing a few maps to really get your head around it. PC Settings & MultiplayerV-Sync, resolutions, audio sliders and mouse options (edge-scrolling, speed, etc) are here. There isn’t any important settings missing. Skyward Collapse is very stable, having no visible bugs or crashing problems. The Cooperative aspect in this game is ok but it feels a bit bare-boned. All your friend(s) can do is be a creator and try to keep things in balance with you. The soundtrack has a mellow piano and guitar setup, keeping you relaxed even in the most intense/frustrating situations you'll often find yourself in. While it isn't the most distinctive of the soundtracks Pablo Vega has made, it works very well for this game. Additionally, you have a lot of options to change how easy or difficult the game can be. You can increase how Woe's (special events) impact the game, how stringent the score requirement per round will be and how many turns you must survive in order to succeed. Final ThoughtsSkyward Sword is one of Arcen's more intriguing and, in my opinion, well executed experiments. The combination of god game & turn based strategy works very well. I really enjoyed building up cities and seeing armies fighting it out while I watched from above. The flow of the game will swing one way to the next as events happen, really giving me that “one more turn” craving. While not having direct control made me feel a bit passive or understandably frustrated when things go horribly wrong, it’s still a lot of fun. You should also pick up the DLC for the complete experience as it gives you another mechanic to win the game and the Japanese faction to really spices things up. Skyward Collapse is a definite recommendation from me. Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

												I really like this game for it's somehow chaotic gameplay which makes it unique in the strategy genre. It is turn based and best comparable to a very complex board game. This is also how it is presented.You as a player have limited and mostly indirect control over what happens. There are many random variables. But the offered possibility space of what to do to react on the events is strikingly huge. Every time I start a new round I find something new to try out.It has its lengthy parts and I think the 60 rounds variant is much more enjoyable than the standard of 90 rounds per match.I think the suspense in this game is great. For the first 90% of the game you have to do careful adjustments to keep your civilizations alive. But when it becomes obvious that you are about to win it's up to you to wreak as much havoc as possible. As you only get points for destroyed buildings and units. This is immensely satisfying.			"

												Probably one of the more strict-definition ""God"" games out there, in that you're the kind of deity who a) exists and b) does what he can for his people but c) can't order them to do jack♥♥♥♥♥♥because Free Will.That said? This is a fantastic concept and I actually love it. You manage a pair of nations (and I believe a third with the recent DLC?) turn by turn, with equal moves apiece, reshaping the world and controlling the resources of each side. Afterwards, every living player from those factions makes their moves, and you hope you've done enough to keep them both safe (from roaming bandits, one another, and horrible curses known as Woes). The game's not so easily solved, though, due to the random factors that'll shake things up. Tiles appear after every turn to fill in gaps in the floating world you manage, and again, bandits/Woes.I don't know how long I'll stick with this after finishing a few games? But it's totally a fantastic title and the recent overhaul patch makes me wonder if more tweaks like that might hook me further. I would love for this to be the birth of a new strategy niche.			"

												I really like the idea of playing two factions against each other and having to make sure that neither one of them wipes the other one out, but something about it didn't completely click with me. As with most Arcen games, I'm glad I tried it and played through an entire session of it from start to finish, because it's interesting and not the kind of thing you usually see, but I don't think this will be one of the ones I'll end up going back to repeatedly for weeks/months/years.

												Have you known a Grandparent or Aunt/Uncle who's house you've been to so many times you can't count.  When you're forced to visit them you end up playing board games alone in their cluttered back room. You always find yourself bored. Even though the room is cluttered your relative never takes the time to show you anything they have. When you ask they just shrug you off. Then one day, they pass on, and the family jumps in and starts dividing all the stuff they had in their house and you learn they had a lot of cool stuff. Actually there was a lot to learn and explore, but the place was so cluttered, and your relative never explained much of what they collected. That's the best way I can describe Skyward Collapse. The single tutorial level gives you a limited/basic understanding of what it's trying to accomplish then sets you out into the world to play god. You find yourself with 2 civilizations, with slightly varied dependencies, different unit types with their own pros and cons, a cluttered interface, and you have to play them both at the same time and keep them from killing each other while they attempt to kill each other. IMO a tutorial that perhaps took a few levels to complete would have helped this game out a lot. There's no hand holding here and usually I don't like that type of design, but in Skyward Collapse it could have been a refreshing boost in understanding the complex systems in place here. Also, the building icons are cluttered. Yes, they are divided up into categories, but I still found myself lost a lot of the time. The dependencies between buildings aren't very well explained and I kept backtracking to understand what I did wrong. I played the tutorial level about 5 times. There's just not enough clean design or helpful tutorials to get the average player involved. I'm also, not a fan of playing against myself. Well, balancing against myself really. You have to build civilizations that will ultimately destroy each other, but you need to build them in ways they complement their destructive potentials into an almost deadlock.   That does sound like a great idea, but honestly it's just a bad execution. I really think this game would have benefited from a little TLC on the GUI and a few extra tutorial levels that would walk you through certain aspects one at a time. The way Skyward Collapse is presented you end up feeling like you're playing a board game, alone, in your Grandmothers' clutter back room.			"

												Skyward Collapse is a game that requires some dedication and time investment to really learn it. You have to forgive the fact that there is no animation at all - characters slide around the world like pieces on a board game. And I'm going to say right up front to buy this game with the Nihon no Mura expansion. It's only a little extra for it, and you won't want to be without the Super Smite ability that comes with it.As a god-like being, you command two factions of human civilization, which can be either Greek, Norse, or (with the expansion) Japanese. Each has unique skills, monsters, and gods whose powers can be used against one another by building up their towns and earning supplies.Here's the catch: you're on both teams. You can't allow one to completely destroy the other. And you can't just not let them fight, because you need to earn points to make score requirements every so many rounds. So, you have to find ways to keep them balanced - if one side starts overwhelming the other, you'll have to concoct strategies to even the odds. This can get quite hectic, especially considering all the random elements the game tosses at you - such as the woes that create game-changing conditions, the rogue bandits that pop up every so often, and what to do if a character attains such high stats that they become practically unstoppable.Once you get the hang of it, you will likely never be in any real danger of losing. But the game is fully-customizable. You can change any number of elements to make it as hard or as easy as you'd like. Going for the achievements is a good way to learn the game's rules and mechanics and to give you concrete goals to shoot for.Rating: 3.5/5			"

												I really wanted to like this game, but in the end I saw what many others ended up seeing. While the game sounds great, it falls utterly short. This is a game that should have been sent back to the drawing board like Hellraid was. Why? Because it's BORING.In Skyward Collapse you get to play as the ultimate ruler of everything. You build cities for two opposing sides, trying to protect them from themselves as well as bandits and natural disasters. You can keep your world thriving by consistently making new cities, consistently placing down gods or special units to turn the balance towards a losing side to re-instate ""balance"", which is the key in this game. Then you watch your actions have effects as you hit ""end turn"". And then you do it again, and again, and again, and again. No variety, no excitement. Just the same strategies again. Place some buildings, end turn. Place special units. End turn. Etc. The game was honesty better on paper than it is in-game.I give it a 3/10. Now it's not buggy in any way, so that's a pro, but that's all it really has going for it. It's too boring, and games are suppoed to be fun. This doesn't fit the bill, avoid it, save your money.			"

There is a lot happening even in the simple tutorial and I feel like the tutorial did not do it's job proprely to explain how deep and complex this game is. I gave up a bit less than 2 hours in because I didn't quite fully understood what I was doing(and that is really frustrating in a strategy game) Imagine playing monopoly and the only thing your friend (the tutorial) taught you about this game is the dice rolling system and that you move according to the space on that said die.

												Was enjoyable for a couple games.  Don't expect this one to hold you several hundred hours, but if you can deal with that, it's a unique premise worth playing around with.  Higher difficulties are actually much easier and more enjoyable as there's more bandits to deal with and units level quickly.  My first game after the tutorial was on the second hardest setting and there were several close moments, but I was never really in danger of outright losing.My main problem with the game was the interface.  It's very rudimentary.  When you have multiple towns, not being able to see which of your military bases have had their supports destroyed (and are thus aren't producing units) was the most annoying bit.  It doesn't help that destroyed buildings don't say what they were.  Being able to plan out both sides at the same time, and flipping back and forth, would've been nice as it's hard to remember who has what and who needs what.The scoring system is a bit obnoxious, but does add a nice little twist so you're not just making perfect towns that don't do anything.Overall, I came away rather impressed with the concept, but in no way craving another game.  Execution isn't horrible or great; things work well enough to get the point across, but not well enough to provide a ton of depth.			"

												I am sad to see this game get such negative reviews, because I liked it. The idea is to keep 2 civilizations balanced as they go to war with each other, and prevent each civilization from destroying the other, for as long as possible. The civs have unique units, like minotaurs and such, and you can build Military buildings and infastructure in one side if its in danger. But be careful! the military infastructure might tip the scales, but then the other side will be in danger. I remember this as a very fun game. Not sure why its getting so much negativity.			"

												Skyward Collapse is a strange little game. And to be honest, far from little. It is a turn based strategy game in a mythical setting, where ancient greek and norse fight a never ending war. A war that threatens creation itself. You are the Creator in charge of this world and it is your duty to ensure that this war never reaches that point of doom, while at the same time keeping creation ""interesting"".Each turn you have a build face for each of the two factions, allowing you to place buildings, summon mythical creatures such as minotaurs, create mountains or even nudge the gods to do your bidding. Death and destruction increases your score but too much of it and a faction runs the danger of getting wiped out and you would lose the game. And as if the constant warmongering of the two sides wasn't enough, bandits raid everyone equally and calamities (like floods, draughts, serial killers or tartarus spitting the dead back into the land of the living) will spicen things up.This game is well worth checking out for everyone who enjoys turn based strategy and would like to try something different. And as an added bonus, the devs are extremly communicative on their forum.			"

												Skyward Collapse is a turn based game, where you try to build and balance both the red and blue empire.It's areally fun game, but you have to make sure not to unbalance one of both sides. (an item that gives a unit a 100x attack & health bonus is kinda overpowered, especially when combined with other bonuses. But the item that makes minotaurs invulnerable, and gives both sides a couple of them is a real city-wrecker too)You do not control the units in this game, they have a ""free will"". Thus you can only guide the empires, but not fully control them. You build their cities and landscapes. But the actual moving and fighting is up to them. Once you get to the Age of Gods, and each side has over a hundred units, you realise free will is quite handy ;)Overall, this game is relly worth buying. It's great fun to see how it plays out between Red and Blue.			"

												Look there are a lot of nice details to this game. However between akward controls and poor graphics, it just is totally not worth the effort you have to put into it, just to play. I'd like to se the designers future efforts though. They had the right idea, just a bad execution of it.			"

												This is a very unique game, combining automatic turn based combat with godlike with city manager, it is hard to place this in any particular catagory. The game itself is nice, although there are some features that are not so likeable. The game itself feels like a board game, and could easily be played as a board game, which is a great thing if you like board games! (Note, I am the founder of the Tabletop RPG Gamers League, so you could say I like board games!) Anyway, enough said for now, let us proceed to the pros and cons list.Pros-Literally A Board! It feels and looks like a board game! Moving tiles around, characters, stat cards, and so forth, it just is a cool concept! Anyway, this isn't a pro for all people, so let us continue.Audio/Music, the music is great and doesn't get old. The sound effects are so-so, but the sounds definitely fit the game so I am happy with them.Gameplay, the gameplay is very cool. You are a godlike being who manages different cities, trying to promote both peace and war at the same time. Although you can't have a ""Endless"" game, the gameplay is doesn't need an ""Endless"" mode in order to be good. You get to change the entire world if you like, from the tiles to the bandits to the empires themselves, change literally everything with a simple click or two.Combat, the combat is entirely automatic. The empires will build armies for you. The empires will send their armies to die for you. All you have to do is sit back and watch, and sometimes scold an empire that gets to powerful (By scold, I mean brutally smite off the map).Cons-Combat, but combat was also a pro? Well, for some people the fact that you can't interact with the characters/pieces/armies directly is somewhat disappointing. Personally, I like the way that they did this, but to each there own I guess.Multiplayer, the multiplayer isn't really there yet, it doesn't really advance the gameplay any by having more people playing it. It just complicates things, but even so, that is also part of the fun of it I guess. Personally, I don't like how they did the multiplayer, but oh well.Conclusion-I definitely recommend this game. It literally feels like I am playing a board game! It is also very fun to play this game local hotseat, having each person control one nation, nation vs. nation! Although the game wasn't developed for this kind of gameplay, it is definitely fun to do no less. If I had to say a way that they could improve this game, it would be to recreate the multiplayer aspect of it by having a more nation vs. nation set up like I described above. It would be more like a Age of Empires feel and would give the game something unique to get more people to play/buy it.May your adventures be many and always end in reward!-Donoknight, Founder of Tabletop RPG Gamers League			"

												Skyward Collapse is a very unusual game. An odd duck of sorts. You control or rather help both oppoosing factions. You are striving for balance, but balance will be impossible to maintain. All your helpful nudges and interventions will get out of control and tip the scale towards either one faction - initially - or complete and utter chaotic powercreep (when you devastate the landscape, unleash minor gods, mythic creatures, wonders and miracles to ""balance"" whatever imbalance has crept in, trying to delay the inevitable).Motto: ""You are your own worst enemy. Every single one of your problems was caused by you and every solution is a future disaster in the making.""It is a turn-based god game for people who can lose every game (because they all end in disaster). In the end, it becomes a score-hunt or a story-driven experience depending on what kind of player you are.The UI is minimalistic, I guess, but perfectly sufficient. The game could do better in guiding and explaining things to you (at least I found myself drawn to google after a few games).I can recommend the (rather cheap) expansion pack, but it will neither make nor break the game for you. If you do like the base game, go get it. If you don't, the expansion won't help. So check out the basic game and if you love it like I do, then get the expansion.My hourly stats are incorrect, I have played this game quite a bit longer. There is a lot of replayability to challenge yourself ever more (last longer, or more chaos/upheavel). There are also quite few options and game modes to vary the experience.What kind of gamer will like this? Probably a patient, somewhat puzzle-game appreciatative strategy gamer who cares more about clever mechanics than winning big (or just the spectacular). You will have to rethink your strategy every game and go back to the drawing board to the improve. There is a lot of depth here, but you'll have to think to get there. The game does not hand it to you or guide you along to better strategies.			"

												Another elegant, bizarre genre/mechanics mashup from Arcen. It's a 4x highscore strategy game...sort of. It's pretty easy to cruise through lower difficult levels, but once you turn it up to hard or higher, you will be constantly scrambling to both (1) get each side to kill and destroy as much of the other side's units and buildings as possible while (2) not letting anyone get totally wiped out. The basic early-game strategies you employ will involve instigating two competing armageddons against each civilization's strongholds, which will be followed by armageddons on your armageddons. Available map space for new strongholds will quickly be oustripped by how much of it is covered in unrecoverable ruins, adding a hard limit on exactly how much infrastructure you can destroy before literally running out of space to build destroyable infrastructure on. High level play is madcap and insane as you race against the clock to meet score requirements without completely ruining everything on the map. In other words, it's sort of like a strategic Jenga? You will be constantly trying to work out the metagame that you're playing against yourself, and then putting out fires that you yourself ignited with even bigger fires. Fires upon fires swallowing up oxygen, with the only real solution being to add more chaos to the mix and hope that you can deal with the aftermath later.Coop is also great fun, particularly with beer.

												I am super sad to see all these negative reveiws. I can understand why some may not enjoy this, and I'll try to cover those through my groggy head. So, forgive my miss spells and other nonesense. But I speak from my heart and mind none the less! So, I love this game for many reasons. Maybe some small, stupidly funny text from the developers as you try to leave the game and such. But that's just me I guess. Or could be? I'm easy to entertain. I think that this game is an amazing strategy game to some degree at least. It's in depth, has plenty of content, and can, if you actually know what to do, move on pretty fast. It just takes time to learn. And like everything, you need to hit it with a good attitude. If you go into this, expecting the worse, or allowing yourself to be overwhelmed, of course you'll hate it. But if you go in with optimism, and allow yourself to lose a few games for the sake of science and experimentation, you may just learn a few things and start winning. A basic game starts with 2 cities in which you build up. Starting out with both of them equally is what I do. Maybe, give each town a basic ranged and melee unit to start out. And then to maximize the death and destruction without total annihilation, I'll try to build a mountain range to block the path into a choke point, covering key locations with outposts and cerberus' as to prevent enemy advance whilest building up a bigger force. But sadly, you may find yourself running out of time and needing more points. So one could perhaps... Spawn a labyrinth. And maybe... Spawn minotaurs for each faction each turn? That are... Temporarily invulnerable? and... Randomly spawned! Sure! That'll cause chaos. And now you find, after 25 sturggling turns, you've destroyed some cities and find yourself with one overpowered nation. So in a panic, you close off the last red city and spam mythological units, but wait, you don't have the resources! Oh no!! So you start to expand, but find the other side to powerful and find that you're too late to try and go for a less... Murder filled victory. What now? Well, that's for you to decide. Perhaps you let all hell loose and spawn an armageddon if you can. Or just♥♥♥♥♥♥around till you learn a few things, who knows. Maybe the bandits will save you.I personally don't know if that made sense, but I felt it showed the craziness of this game. The idea that so much can happen in one game, how fast it can progress and that only those who don't know what to do have long, grooling games. I for one like to play this game fast passed, and therefor, don't get so far all the time. But it can be fun to play god over two races bent on destroying each other, watching their attack plans unfold and fail as you secretly aid their enemy while just as well giving the attacker a new seige factory while yet again at the same time unleashing a great mythological beast against their newest town. All for you to rack up points in a hilariously devilsh game. Maybe you don't want to kill your followers so fast and violently... You can go for a culture victory. Build peaceful towns on the ruins of others and amass culture to build great arcs which symbolize your world's success and beauty. All of this and so, so much more can be found in this game. Each game feels knew and each game has a new story to be told.On to multiplayer. Download Evolve and you can easily project a LAN server across the states or provinces or which ever! That's Evolvehq.com (The motto is ""Stop playing with yourself!"") While I have yet to try multiplayer, I can imagine it's great. Don't quote me there though.Sorry to be rambling so much, but please try this game or watch some videos and imagine a great god strategty game in which you try to control two raging armies in which want nothing more than death for the other and glory under you. It's a perfect strategy game and isn't so much chess against yourself as it is altering another 2 players' chess game. As if you were choosing where the tiles were (because you do) and what units are available and how often they are (because you do!!) and what player gets what benefits. Because you do. Lastly, thank you for reading, and if you have any questions at all, or want to play this with me, please please contact me at any time! Take a look, and rate this for yourself. Every game deserves a glimpse for yourself. And then, criticize this yourself. Have a good one,Waka			"

												Zero out of four. Firstly, one should check out other games from this developer! Some of their other games are truly valuable creations. Skyward Collapse, however, is a perfectly horrible experience. Oh, to even now think on it! Well, this game has its share of systems: building/unit dependencies, plentiful resource types, terrain values, terraforming, the player has ""god"" powers. Through all of this, the player is to pass through a number of turns while having the two factions still alive, meaning one faction doesn't completely die from the other or from the bandit units that pop up. Gah, anyway, I don't know what parts of the game are supposed to be meaningful. The only non-painful part coming to mind is placing buildings on the grid. I'm at a loss for words to make an ending of this, just do not buy this game. If you have it already, you can get some easy achievements before rightly discarding it forever.			"

												There are many good elements to this game. The concept is interesting, the units and buildings are varied, at least by function. I'm generally quite forgiving when it comes to unpolished games, especially if there is enough on offer to balance out the bad. I could almost recommend this, but not quite, because underneath its rough exterior is a good game, but I don't think anyone I know would be as forgiving.Where it suffers is lack of polish. The buildings tend to look similar and blend into each other, so you never really know what is going on at a glance.The action phase jumps around a lot, and seems so pointless you simply end it most of the time so you don't have to put up with it.And to top it off, the interface has a very inconsistent feel.

It has a ""one-more-turn"" gameplay that kinda pulls you in, and an very interesting concept.It's a intriguing challenge building up the two factions while trying to avoid one becoming too strong. But as the game progresses, it just starts to feel more like a chore. You keep nudging here and there, on a game-bord that becomes more and more chaotic as woes and god-actions come in to play. Combined with the basic graphics, it's just kinda hard to tell what's going on at times.In the end, when I feel like I'm finishing the last turns not because it's fun, but rather to just finish the game, it's not really a game I'd recommend.

												3/10The description for this game makes it sound like populous meets an old civ game or something... It plays more like an old version of civ made for people who like to hotseat to play against themselves AND use cheats. Over half of the 'god-like' powers you have do nothing but add resources. This might be a 5 or even 6/10 for the rigth person..... but not me....Might be more of a 4/10 than 3 considering my expectations of the game were SO wrong. lol. Still, despite the good coding/lack of bugs, (making me want to give some good score/recommend) I just couldn't get any fun out of this. :\ and can't recommend.Pros:- No Bugs (not that I came across)- Has working options/settings- Has proper tooltips- Limited TutorialCons:- No Campaign- No real-time elements- No Editor- Different races have same buildings to make, so that the whole point of 'balancing' in the game FOR MOST OF THE GAME becomes not so much a case of balancing between rival factions as balancing between 2 of the same faction. You can 'deliberately' do things bad/different and not play to your best, but it just makes it even more like a boring simulation/replay than any kind of actual game.Points of Interest: (Could be pros or cons really)- Unique Menu Interface (IMO looks messy and don't like it)- Graphics are 'Dated' "

												PROS- Pretty original, and there are so few games that try to be different these days CONS- Needs more balance and more races / civs- Wish the main mechanic would rely on a gameplay element instead of simply scoreREVIEWFirst, I have to say this is a much better game than might be guessed at from the screenshots and video.The main idea is that instead of incarnating a civilization and fighting others, you take a more neutral stance, watching over 2 civilizations and even if you still build things for them you are mainly fighting unbalance, as you are trying to make the civs as big as possible without having any of them annihilate the other.Up to that point, great. The concept is interesting, and playing it (at leat for a while) is fun. I can recommend the game at this point if you like strategy.That being said, this is one of these games where as you play you get so many ideas and suggestions on how it can be improved. For instance, your main motivation to make civs as big as possible is that you have a score quota to reach or else you lose. While this is necessary, or else the game would have no challenge, other systems could be imagined to replace the score. For instance, why would you not be a god that feeds on war and conflict and gets more powerful the bigger the conflict is? That would let you gain / unlock more and more powers to have more options to balance the game, creating a gameplay loop that pushes you to make the conflict bigger (and thus more challenging) to gain the power to control it, and so on. Further it can open the field to creating other challenges to add variety to the game instead of just watching numbers on a score.The game also needs balance and variety. Only 2 civilizations are not enough, they have to add more. And balance is not yet there, you won't be dropping some mythical creatures or some powers (at least for a while) because they are too much of a curve to deal with. If they add more civs, balance the units, and plug something more interesting than the score system, this can become one of the best Civilization / God games strategy series out there.			"

												A rather unique game that plays like a 4X strategy mixed with shades of Populous. You play the role of a Creator who is tasked with bringing balance to the world populated by two factions, the Norse and the Greeks. As Creator, you have the ability to shape the world as you see fit by adding lakes, fields, etc, to an ever changing landscape, and to help the two factions prosper to greatness.When military buildings are built, they create units, and these men will move on their own to the other faction to destroy them. Your ultimate goal as the Creator is to make sure these two sides don't destroy the other completely, and no, you can't win simply by never giving the factions military based buildings, for bandits will randomly spawn in the world, and they will start attacking the cities if you don't have a military force.However, balance isn't one sided. In order to create balance in the first place, you must also encourage war and destruction so you have to let them duke it out and destroy some buildings or two while you watch from above and see how things go. However, if one side starts dominating the other, you must step in and bring in the balance. Does the Norse have too many infantry and are now laying waste to the world? Drop a Minotaur at their feet and watch them get themselves wasted by a bad♥♥♥♥♥bull. You could also drop some mountains and/or lakes in their path to halt their progress. Did I say minotaur? Each faction has their own mythological monsters that you can plop anywhere on the field (as long as you have the necessary resources) that can tip the balance if things are going to pot. Each monster has their own set of skills, and be careful when you use them because that monster might start going out of control and you'd have a new set of problems to deal with. In addition to monsters, there's also Gods that appear after a while with their own set of skills, along with various items that can do things like letting both sides be able to fly, or killing all human units on the map to get some breathing room.  There's also various Woes that pop up after a set amount of turns that can really cause havoc, such as a total map change or dropping bandits near the cities.As mentioned before, Skyward Collapse is an unique twist on the strategy genre, and it's much harder than it sounds to balance the playing field so that you must let each side cause enough havoc to get the scores, yet also having to keep them in check to prevent total destruction and a game over. Easier difficulties aren't so bad, but harder difficulties will really test your ability.Skyward Collapse resembles a board game, which I'm sure is what the devs strived for. The graphics are nicely detailed, especially the various units and mythlogical creatures. There isn't much animation to speak of, but that's not much of a negative considering the whole board game look, and the fact it's not very important for the genre. When you start having over forty units moving on their own, the last thing you'd want would be to have them all animated. The music, which I think is just one track, is great.Everytime you win a game, you unlock a new building to give the game more depth/options, athough if you are the impatient type, there is a cheat you can use that gives them all at the start.There's also co-op multiplayer for up to 8 players although I haven't tried it. Any strategy fan should try out this game. This is the first game I've ever played from Arcen Games, and if this is the sort of stuff they usually make, then they're doing just fine. The only thing that really matters in a strategy game is the gameplay, and it certainly delivers. "

												This game is very loosely based on settlers of catan/civilization1-5. It was an interesting play. One MAJOR shortcoming is to play multiplayer you need someones direct IP to play. Thats a huge security flaw. You can play on your local LAN, but that doesnt help if you want to play with a friend across the country.			"

												Every Arcen Games game brings a unique experience to the table, and Skywarad collapse is no exception. I've found some people erroneously comparing it to Civilization. This games deosn't pretend to be some kind of Civ5 clone. If what you want is a Civ-like game, you are barking up the wrong tree. This game isn't about building your empire and conquering the others. SC is about building two factions, make them fight each other and the third neutral faction. None of the two factions can be destroyed or you'll lose the game. The result is a fun challenging fast-paced experience. The graphics are simple, but beautifully drawn and very functional. This games is totally recommended to anyone looking for a new game experience.			"

												Great game and very original. Easy to learn but really hard to master at higher difficulties.If you are a strategy-game addicted, it's a must.Edit: Just nominated this game for ""The 'I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award' Award"" so lets improve this review a little bit.It's a great innovative take on strategy games (and that is saying something after at least 25 years of development in the genre!). It does have it flaws, but I really enjoyed playing it.The game is about managing two rival factions, ensuring they fight eachother - however, you must bring BALANCE to the battle and avoiding that one of them gets wiped, which becomes increasingly difficult as the turns goes on.It does have a boardgame feeling to it when you expand the world with new tiles [looking at you, Carcassone] but have the automation that only video games can bring to you.All in all, a great game for everyone - there are multiple handcaps settings. So no matter how hardcore or casual you are, you'll be able to enjoy a few sessions.			"

												Made by the same group that did AI War, this is also a game that draws heavily from other genras but ends up being its own. Skyward Collapse has you controling 2 diffrent factions and building them up in pretty normal turn based base building, with various buildings required to build other buildings and units. You however only build the buildings, you don't control the units, the ai does that. The goal is to have the bases fight each other without actually destroying one another. A high score is what you are shooting for. What makes the game complicated and not boring is the addition of score requirements per ""age (30 turns), random encounters that have crazy powerful effects (called woes), and bandit forces. The tutorial and demo don't do the game justice, as it is only once you get on normal difficulty and past turn 30 tha things get crazy...and hard. Very fun, especialy if you like challenging strategy games.			"

												At first: You can't judge this game if you haven't played at least 5 hours or so.It's just so complexed as much can't understand, its like kinda 5% Civilization seriesand 95% professional chess. A very complex and hardsolid chess.The game is about strong balance of powers inbetween. You must overlook every turn twice before you continue and even if you overlookedyour turns twice hundred times - there's an events that crush every your beginning or help 1/all nations.Units just walk randomly and its okay, just imagine they got ♥♥♥♥ed up commanders and just walk their wayto their own enemy target.So i've started nice deck with some hills and forests, two nations (greeks and norses). After some turns i've managed the map as i see it, placed a lot of mountains and lakes to make tons of routes impassable. Everything was okay, some units from both factions were killing eachother and some bandits. Then one freaky peltast became little bit overpowered, he came into the town and started crushing everything. I've summoned valkyr to help things up, BUT THIS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ KILLED EVERYTHING IN THE TOWN AND I WAS LIKE OMAGAID KILL HIM SOMEBODY. I've used my godess ability and she summoned couple frozen giants, the giants killed that ♥♥♥♥ing peltast and gone killing everything on their way! All the bandits and all the greeks were killed. I've tried to fix it up with Ares' spear and that summoned more bandits so they kill giants (also used x100 health to the bandits so they could stand giants) and didn't notice the event coming and after 3 turns there was like 30 bandits with x100 health and was killing everything on their way and overconquered 4 cities of each nation. Meanwhile on the another corner of the deck there was a cool norse guy of 4th level that was pwning everything toe-to-toe.... 15 turns later there was a freaking mess of norse superheroes fighting greek superheroes overwhelmed with tons of superbandits and some giant turtles. Everything was okay but then i did the mistake summoning lots of minotaurs (as i thought they'll balance it a little). This time map was just overplaced with ruins and there was almost no place to build. BANG Earth collapse. Every mountain is gone and there's tons of marshes. Somehow i've managed to kill every living on the map (thanks to the norse godguy). And soon after this freaking mess started over again but thanks i've finished it in a few turns.So if you look for some strategy that will take you in for hours and you like to think things up - thats the game you're looking for. If you can stand the boring tutorial though.It is awesome game but very narrow targeted.And i've really liked soundtrack. I recommend you think 10 times before getting this game as its just not for everybody/5btw the game introduce comic is that hillarious that just worth buying the game.			"

A strategy god game in which you learn about homeostasis by building up two factions at the same time and keeping their military strength equal.  Military is important because in order to progress in the game blood must be spilled to earn enough points to keep going.'Skyward Collapse' offers many unique and divergent design ideas that make it worth checking out what when right and wrong in the final product.  As a spoiler to what went wrong, the game starts incredibly slow and would benefit greatly from better feedback for the current state of the gameboard.			"

												I'm almost inclined to support ""Indie Game That Isn't Platformer, Puzzler, Roguelike, or Babby's First Dwarf Fortress"" on principle, and leave it at that.The Metacritic score for this one is slightly misleading - no ""Super Major Automatic 75% Rating For Any Game That Doesn't Make Our Computer Explode"" sites have reviewed it, and two of the sites that HAVE reviewed it actually utilize the 0-50% portion of the scale (as opposed to the ""Anything Under 70% Is Terrible"" approach taken by more idiotic publications). I'm inclined to agree with the non-insufferably-prissy parts of the GameCritics review: It could use some polish here and there, but the fundamentals are innovative and interesting. It's not a perfect game by any stretch of the imagination, but it's firmly in the 70-85% range.Parts of this game are a bit rough (for instance, siege units have a range longer than the default zoom, so you either have to manually zoom out to see what they're attacking or manually edge-scroll during the brief window of time available - the camera should really track the projectile), and the resource system borders on needlessly-intricate (do we really need ten different resources and corresponding ""finished goods"" buildings?), but all in all I think the underlying mechanics (which can be crudely summarized as ""Populous, but you control both sides and the goal is to stalemate"" - a very clever way to sidestep the issue of AI programming) are interesting enough that if you're at-all into strategy / tactical games, this deserves a pickup - especially at the bargain-bin price!

												I like the idea behind Skyward Collapse. You're a diety and you have to get your population to work and survive while competing against each other. It's just that last part where the game fails misserably!Normally when you have a strategy game where two (or more) factions compete against each other, you play one and the other(s) are p[layed by the computer AI. But sadly, this game doesn't have any AI. Instead you play solo or on a hotseat when your're playing locally.Then the multi-player part, where the game fails misserably as well. You either have to give it a server IP to connect to, or it searches on the LAN for other players. WTF? We're on Steam and it should use Steam to find other players!			"

Posted: January 5, 2015
												This game is fascinating, and given that a full game can be completed in less than 4 hours, any fan of 4x tbs or god games should at least give it a try. I won't bother explaining the mechanics, but in a nutshell it's a god game with all the strategy of civ but without the endless micromanagement. Possibly more strategic even, because there are virtually no unknown elements and you won't get screwed by not being close to a resource you need. After just one play, I can see myself going back multiple times tweaking the difficulty settings to try and beat my high score. I think there is just enough randomness to keep things interesting for a while, and I haven't even tried the expansion yet which adds another faction and an intriguing culture system.My biggest con is that the whole thing does sometimes feel extremely ""gamey"" at times. The whole setup is quite a bit contrived and there's no reason in game that I should lose because the two civs didn't hurt each other enough other than ""you didn't get enough points and that's the way the game works."" Of course, if you aren't a hardcore minmaxer you can always play sandbox and just see what happens, and I can actually see this being a lot of fun. My first game did drag a bit at the end but I think it's just because I got bored and unleashed a bunch of god powers I probably shouldn't have which filled the screen with way too many monsters to keep track of and I could no longer build anything because they would instantaneously destroy it. I still had a blast though and I'm sure once I get a better grip of the strategy I'll figure out how to not turn the game into watching dozens of valkyries and trolls duke it out with Zeus and an army of minotaurs, even though it was pretty sweet.I don't think this is a game I'll play every day, but I could definitely see going back to it a few times a month on a Saturday afternoon for a long time, and hopefully Arcen will continue to produce expansions, though I don't think they're really necessary. In short, even full price there's no reason for a turn-based strategy fan not to get this. Even if it's not your thing, I promise you'll get an experience different from anything else you've played and the tutorial is decent enough that the learning curve is very short, so it won't be a waste of an afternoon.One more thing, it has been said that the two factions (Norse and Greek) are almost exactly the same but I can tell you that this is false. They have the same buildings but they produce different units from those buildings and play very differently. Greeks have stronger soldiers overall as well as some cool stuff like the Trojan Horse which is fragile but one hit kills any building and a god that makes all basic resource buildings free. The Norse have stronger monsters and have some craziness themselves like a power that every turn creates a stronger clone of every unit on the map and a mortar which is extremely devastating against buildings but has a 33% chance of exploding every time it is fired. Both factions' monsters are completely different and lend to very different strategies and both factions have different ways of countering each other. You can also choose to have a mirror match of Greek v. Greek or Norse v. Norse if you want to and the expansion adds a third faction (Japanese) which I hear is stronger than either of the other two and requires caution to make sure it does not get too powerful. Wow that turned out way longer than I thought it would. tl;dr of the last paragraph: Greeks and Norse play differently and both have very cool unique abilities.			"

												TL;DR - basically it feels like playing a boardgame against yourself and it is really boringI really wanted to like this game.  I really like the way it sets up and how you build things and gather resources, as well as the concept of adding more tiles to the edge of the board.  However, the overall concept is just awful.  Basically, you aren't trying to win, you are trying to get the 2 factions to be equal to each other.  Which, while it may sound interesting, ultimately results in extremely boring gameplay.  This game would have so much potential if you could just pick a side and play as it and try to beat the other faction.  But you are not able to do this.  After the very beginning of the game, it becomes unplayably boring.  I don't think I've ever actually been able to keep playing to the end.  Like I said really cool idea at first, but then the god and balance perspective just ruins it.  Would not recommend to anyone 3/10.			"

												The best things I can say for this game are that it's quirky and interesting, and I didn't run into any crashes.  At the end of the day, however, it's a rather asinine romp Is highly structured at first, and then quickly devolves into pure madness.  Although I did not play it to such a degree that I can succinctly say that it is unstrategic, later abilities delve into risk-reward territory so hard that luck or map limitation exploitation are your main tools for survival.While I want to like a game where a butchery is as difficult to establish as the summoning of an nigh-unstoppable goddess, my experience was that they simply didn't do the math.

It's a challenge I've never faced in a game before. It's all about balance, a theme which is not often addressed in games. The music feels a bit off - like they just grabbed a few random tracks they liked and threw them in there. The pacing is pretty slow, but there are options to speed it up a bit. Overall, I'm enjoying this one so far, and it was worth getting.			"

												I really don't get the point of this game. It's like you're supposed to be fighting yourself, and you're supposed to keep yourself from winning. That's about as interesting as trying to play chess with yourself. While the game provides all kinds of choices for you, the graphics look pretty nice, and the UI is decent, it doesn't provide you with interestingchoices or present you with interesting game problems to solve. Just as if you were playing chess with yourself, there wouldn't be much sense of accomplishment to winning since you could just intentionally play badly against yourself. Yay, you win, sort of like being in some kindergarten class where everyone gets a prize and everyone's a winner except this is supposed to be for adults.In summary, it's just plain boring and the core idea doesn't make any sense. I think the developer was too focused on graphics, UI, and game intracacy without realizing that it's finding the solution to interesting problems that makes games worth playing.			"

												I'll be honest, this is not a genre I usually like, so I'm a bit biased.  Still, I have played several of these world/empire-building resource management games, and there are some I've liked better than others.  Unfortunately, this is not one of the better ones. The most off-putting putting part for me was the bland graphics.  I did not like the mix of isometric land tiles and flat 2D sprites.  It felt like a bunch of bitmaps moving over each other, drawn by two different people.  Some of the menus were a little confusing for me, though they might be more intuitive for people who play this type of game more often.  The graphics and interface aren't terrible, but everything just seems so dull.  The whole game could have used a bit of polish.It does one creative thing - you control two warring factions, and the object isn't to have one beat the other, but to keep both sides balanced.  It's a nice twist, but unfortunately it doesn't make the game much more interesting. But again, this isn't my type of game, so take my review with a grain of salt.  If you're into this kind of game, read a few more reviews before you make up your mind.  But if you're like me, and only enjoy the best standouts of this genre, you'll probably be as underwhelmed as I was. "

Ultimitly it tries to be a strategy game with sprawling empires and concuring civilivations.I do love the mythology they have in the game.However I would not recomemd this game because you, as the player, are some form of an overseer and therefore lack alot of control over the units and citys that are needed to play a strategy game.I would recomend buying Sid Meier's Civilization V Gods and Kings over this game. Get the Gold edition when it is on sale, love it. It is a great game that will eat up so much of your time.			"

												Seemed like an interesting concept, but it turned out to be incredibly repetitive and dull. I very quickly found myself not caring what happened to either side or even paying much attention to what was going on during the battle phase. It was like I was laying down tract housing in SimCity, except the inhabitants killed each other and torched their neighborhoods while I was spamming the next row of buildings for them to burn down. To advertise that the player is supposed to ""encourage"" war is misleading - the sides war no matter what (and rather ineptly at that). Your godly goal is simply to lay down more tract housing so you can rack up sufficient points off their carnage. I suppose that if there was some actual *graphical* carnage or gore, it might be interesting ... but these units just blink out of existence when they die, so even their fighting is boring too.I'm not sure who this game will appeal to, so I don't recommend it at any price.

Emphasis is on allowing conflict between two nations to generate a score, but to manage the conflict creatively through god-like interactions.  Many creative options possible during gameplay to achieve that end.  Biggest annoyance is the GUI is a bit undeveloped, although professional looking. Hopefully a patch will make it easier to play (or maybe there are some menu hotkeys I haven't discovered yet).   The DLC is good as well.			"

												Definitely a unique take on the God Game/Strategy genre. Focus on balance instead of wiping out an opposing force. Playing both sides with the goal of keeping both sides from getting too powerful is tricky. Rescuing a game from the brink is satisfying for sure.			"

												Maintaining balance is never easy, and I guess the same goes for making a game about it. Not controlling units directly, but only being able to vaguely determine which unit is built when certainly is appealing. My first approach was to build pretty much exactly the same buildings on each side, which worked decently until an event kept killing random units of one side, then bandits appeared to mess up the balance even further. The world seeming to work actively against you keeps the game challenging to some extent. The aforementioned lack of control leads to one issue, though. Especially in the mid- to endgame phase, you have tons of units on the map. Bandits, red, blue, all happily beating each other up. Sadly, all you can do at this point is watching, and turns are 10-20% building/doing stuff and 80-90% just watching the game play itself, which I feel is kind of a missed chance, although it fits well within the concept (on that note, thanks for allowing to speed up the movement). Each side gets random Gods each round, and the randomised events keep the rounds different, forcing you to adapt quickly.I'd still recommend it for the interesting twist on the well-trodden concept of strategy games, but it's probably not a game you'll end up giving up your social life for. If you like to make elaborate plans and lead your forces to crushing victories, this game might not be for you.			"

												Peaceful game to pass the time. It's a nice concept being able to control both teams and having to create balance/order between the two factions. The first few starting rounds can be a bit dull setting everything up, but once the teams start fighting each other it can drain a few hours quite easily. This game is odd, in the sense that you are unable to control the characters on the board. The game focuses on creating buildings to provide resources and infantries which are generated each turn. You control the entire landscape too, by placing mountains or rivers to slow down assaults on an opposing faction. It's a nice concept, and could be improved in a few places, but overall the game is worth checking out (especially if you can get it cheap, there were a few bundles not long ago -- which is where i got it). The soundtrack is great, relaxing. Graphics are nicely drawn. Animations on the characters would be a bonus, but not neccesary.I'd give it 7/10.			"

												I'm a big fan of turn-based strategy games and god games, so I expected to find something to like here. The basic idea is a sort of Settlers / Populous hybrid where you're playing both sides off against each other, with a bandit faction present to prevent turtling. Unfortunately there's a poor-get-poorer issue with the game, where you score points by losing buildings, but each building is a requirement for another. Once you have about half the points needed to win a level, you are usually left unable to generate any more military units. There's an alternate victory condition of turning wrecked buildings into little villages to generate culture, but it's undocumented (i.e. the game doesn't tell you how to win this way).			"

												Very interesting concept, playing the Creator and keeping balance between two sides in order to win. I personally like this 8-bitesque graphics, but it would definitely be more appealing to the wider audience if the graphics were more up to date. Nevertheless, it promisses a lot of fun.Greeks vs Vikings... Who will win?			"

												the difficulty in this game comes from 1 free will, and 2 you. Why? Because you are ballanceing 2 different factions that want to kill each outer and while you are attempting to ballance they you want them both to have massive armys and many settlements but you dont want one side overpowering the other you get one turn on each side every round each round consists of your 2 turns then the 2 factions turns.

												Right.  Like everyone before me has said, it's a god game, sort of.  Here's the idea: You're the creator, you create your world as you see fit.  Everything requires a resource, even the resources.  So you manage that, but as it would seem, humans are just general @$$hats and want to kill each other.  You have to stop that, a little, it is entertainment for you afterall.  And when the tides need balancing you get demi-gods and gods.  Sounds great right?  In theory it is, but the game is flawed.  Here's why:1.  You win by scoring, you lose by dying, by not meeting the score criteria or succumbing to the woes.  This is the major flaw.  ( I recommend this game because what i think is a flaw will me someone else's attraction.)  Why is this a flaw?  Each age lasts thirty turns, each age also has a score criteria.  To advance you have to meet that criteria.  On the easy settings it's a paltry 1120 pts for the 1st age, by turn turn 90 it was well over 110k.  The barbarians dont appear until turn 20 or so.  Their tokens upon death are only worth 40 pts, their fortress, 150.  Bottom line, this becomes a game of Red Vs. Blue, which is against your mandate.  If you let one wipe out the other, you lose.2.  I was hoping to have control of the soldiers, you know, tell them where to go and when, kind of like...a strategy game.  Yeah not happening.  The minute they have a path, they're gone.3.  It becomes more about where to drop new land tokens, then any real strategy.  Which is annoying.4.  The AI, it acts like it wants you to have control.  Otherwise, its just dumb.  Literally dumb.  It needs major balancing overhauls as well.The game started to shine in age 2, which is when you get your 1st demi god.  You start dropping tokens and it starts to feel like a struggle.  By age 3, the shine started to dull as scoring becomes simple.  Simply use your god, and spam your tokens like crazy.  Eventually you kill a demi-god and score a major 40k.  Now, i'm not much of a multiplayer gamer.  I have a select few i game with, and none are interested in this one.  It seems the game would truly shine on a multiplayer setup, but i can't say for sure.  PC resources are minor,  every home should have a rig with at least Win XP sp2, and 2 gig ram.  Bottom line: Its flawed, but cheap and good for an hour here and there.  Don't let the developer be the deciding factor, otherwise, you are gonna hate.age: 8+score: 5/10			"

												It pains me to write this review, as I was very excited to play this and was lured in by the concept - it reminded me of the ""god creator"" control seen in games like Reus and the Black & White series.Honestly, if you like god control games, feel free to give this game a try, but only if it is on sale (or in a bundle) for $0.99. It is currently $4.99, and I do not recommend buying it at that price (I try my best not to mention prices if the gameplay makes up for it, but that is not the case here).The aesthetics are decent, there is a fair amount of detail in the land and building tiles. The backdrop surrounding the game board is okay, however, the unit models are mediocre at best (the art style seriously made me think of flash or IOS games). The music is pretty good, but does not carry the rest of the game's weaker points.The controls are easy to pick up and the tutorial holds your hand through the entire process (there is a lot of reading during the beginning), however, the game can be challenging if you do not understand resource micromanagement and linking your resources/buildings in order to produce units (if you play strategy games, you should be fine). The learning curve is moderate to challenging - once the real game starts, midway through the session bandits will spawn (getting progressively stronger). Your goal in this game is to survive for x rounds, maintaining a balance by building and using god powers for two factions - red and blue. When there is a tipping of power, you must do things to reach equilibrium like destroying a critical building, spending more building points on the losing side, or even summoning a god-tier unit to help out. You cannot directly control unit production or unit movement, however, you can indirectly influence this through god powers and careful building micromanaging (ex: if you want to ensure your barracks is only making a certain unit, do not build the extra required builldings for the other units {like a Well of Fletcher}) The concept is extremely interesting, however, the execution is lacking a good deal. The art style is very, very weak and seems a lot like a flash game you would play on Kongregate (there are many fantastic games on Kongregate) or a game app available for your iPhone (or android). I have played games all my life and do not care so much for graphics (I enjoy indie games as much as I do AAA ones, especially if the gameplay outshines the visuals, but again, there is nothing about SC that really kept me coming back for more.If this does not bother you, then you might be able to enjoy the game. I give my games a lot of time to grow on me, but I just couldn't stay with this game for too long - nothing about it (except the concept) kept me engaged or excited about it. As a casual time filler, you could probably play this game for a short amount of time since you can play at 8x normal speed (or even skip the action phase completely).Try Skyward Collapse if you are really, really interested and can overlook the weakpoints mentioned above.Do not recommend.
