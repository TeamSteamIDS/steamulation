												As a botanist and a gamer, Reach for the Sun makes me feel both sad and embarassed. It's not a fun game; it's not a good learning tool; and the lessons that it does teach are often wrong. Yet, somehow, this game has won multiple awards, and the fact of those awards really does make me sad. To give this game an award is to suggest that this is the best we can do. That suggestion is disrespectful to science, because science has huge potential for fun (e.g. Kerbal Space Program). It's also disrespectful to gamers, and to our proven ability to create great games.The most obvious problem is that the gameplay is all about clicking - even in strategy mode, it's all about the clicking. A much bigger problem is that, as a player, you have very little agency. You can't just grow your plant in whatever way you like. Instead, each plant has a predetermined fully-grown shape, a shape that was fixed by the developers at compile time. When you add new parts to a plant, you're really just unlocking bits of that predetermined shape. This means that the game is much more about memorization than it is about botany or tactics. To be successful, you need to learn the shape of the fully-grown plant, and then figure out the series of choices that will allow you to most quickly unlock all of the parts of your plant.As a botanist, I teach that plants must adapt themselves to their environment by making choices about how they will grow. If a seed lands in an unfortunate place, it can't simply pick itself up and go somewhere else, but must instead grow where it lies. For example, a bush on a rocky cliff may grow short and squat to protect itself from cold and wind; while a bush in a shady glade may grow tall and slim to try and reach above its neighbors, and grab a bigger share of sunlight. Thus, the idea that each species of plant has a fixed shape (an idea implicitly taught by this game) is false and misleading.Another big flaw in the game is the lack of differentiation among species. While there are several different species in this game, from a gameplay standpoint, they're pretty much the same. As a gamer, I find this boring. As a botanist, I find it offensive. The joy and beauty in life and biology come from from the huge variety of shapes, colors, and behaviors that are present in nature. To teach otherwise, as this game does, is a terrible lie.If you're looking for a bit of variety in your procrastination, something to give you a break from Peggle or Candy Crush, then you may find a bit of enjoyment in this game. If you're looking for something with replay value or educational value, you should look elsewhere.			"

												This game does a decent job, on an extremely basic level, at showing how plants function. The goal is to grow the plant to its complete size and harvest all of the seeds before the growing season is over.Overall, the plants are very similar in that they have predefined growth points. Sometimes you get the option to grow a flower instead of a node, but not often. The only thing that really differs between the plants other than the looks, seed production, and some other basic things is that each one generates and requires varying amount of resources to create more roots, notes, leaves, flowers, and fruit.What is not very obvious at first is that this is less about learning about the plants and more of a resource-harvesting clicker game. In order to gain any of the resources to keep growing your plants, you have to click on each part that glows. If you don't click as soon as the glow appears, the amount you can gather goes down and will eventually be lost. As your plant gets larger, the clicking turns into a frenzy. Meanwhile, you're also trying to grow more by clicking on the growth points.Once you have a flower, not only do you have to tell the flower to create pollen, but you have to manually drag a bee to the flower. This wastes valuable time that can be used to click for more resources. Before the garden is fully upgraded, you also have to worry about clicking on pests, pulling off blighted leaves, and warming up frost-bitten leaves.Even with all of the clicking requirements, I was able to obtain all of the achievements and fully grow the prickly pear within 2 hours. I haven't played it in Strategy mode, but the growth model is the same. I can't really see any replay value. There is plenty of room for improvement, such as more types of plants, freeform growth instead of pre-defined points, sandbox mode (no season timer, etc), and more realism.I'm recommending it because it was a pleasant little game that is a bit different from the few in its class. Due to the lack of replay and the really short playtime, my recommendation is only if it's on sale. I bought this as part of a weeklong deal at 75% off ($1.24). My general rule for no-replay casual games is $1/hr. The sale puts it in that realm.---For more... My Reviews || My casual gaming...  Group | Curator Page "

												A cute little simulation game. I wouldn't pay the full price ($10), but I believe I made an okay deal when I got it for $5 on sale. The game doesn't offer too much gameplay time (aka replay value is pretty low, at least until they release more type of plants and maybe more extra stuff, if they ever do), but again - for $5 it's pretty much a fair deal. It's definitely not worth any more than that, though.			"

												This is the second game I've played from this developer (I went in reverse order) and I am greatly satisfied with the experience. Growing up, I was taught in a strict school that focused on learning vast quantities (in my opinion) rather than deep understanding of a less content. As a result, my science background was never really developed as much as it could have been. After playing this game, I've come to the conclusion that this would have been a great way to teach young students on some very (very) basic concepts on a plant's growth. I'd imagine it would have been a worthwhile afternoon that would leave a longer-lasting impression compared to a mechanical way of doing things back at home (I lived in the SE Asian region).TL;DR: The game is very basic but it's a fun and impressionable medium.

												Interesting game. The concept is what got me interested but at the end of the day, it felt like a click fest with no discernable goal or end game to achieve.Why am I trying to grow individual flowers? Is it for the seeds? So that next season I can plant one more flower? If they added some scale to this game, like, every year you have a few more flowers to take care of simultaneously, and then eventually you're tending a garden or something, it might have held my interest. Beyond that, all I did was click click click click click click click click click to get a flower grown and harvest my seeds. Kind of one dimensional I guess...Cool concept, needs more end game. Thanks for teaching me about plants.			"

												On surface level the concept seems very interesting. For once, instead of killing monsters and shooting people, you get to grow a flower and spread new life! With multiple different flowers and an upgrade system you're bound to have many hours of fun here, right?Well, sadly no. There doesn't seem to be any way to really strategize the growing of your flowers, since there's actually only one right way to grow all the flowers, which there are four visually different ones, but which play identically. Reach for the Sun really feels like a simple flash game made as a proof-of-concept or something similar. Play time is somewhere under an hour after which you have gained everything and done everything.A shame really. With extended gameplay and more interesting mechanics the game could potentially be a unique little flower, but currently it is just over-priced run-of-the-mill flash game you could find on any website.

												A small educational game about plants that sadly lacks depth and becomes a manic click-fest just to gather your resources in time. Not quite sure how I would improve the game but its gameplay could need a fair bit of tweaking. The dev do seem fairly active so the game can still be very much improved.Very simplistic achievements that mostly are tied to upgrades and growing each plant in an optimal way.Time to 100%: 2-3 hours			"

												A clickfest that has you reveling in satisfaction. The game consist of clicking different sections of your plant to collect resources, using your spare time to grow and increase the rate at which you can collect resources. Budding flowers or fruit and ultimately collecting seeds before winter stops you. The life of a plant is an intense one and I have a new understanding for green life. The gamplay lasts about 3 hours before you complete the main. Replay value imo is low. Don't let that discourage you from the beautiful game that is Reach for the Sun. 8/10			"

There might be a reason, why some seeds are duds!The game is disappointing in several ways.It's quite slow, even on high end systems. The graphics are moderate, it makes sense to play it in a window. And it's a veritable clickfest.I bought the game because I am a hobby botanist and love to raise exotic plants. The harder the challenge seems the more delighted I will be, if I am successful. But(!), this game has had good ideas and is innovative. It still isn't going to keep it's high pretensions.And there is another thing that is quite anoying, it is over way too fast. Ok, given  it costs only 5 bucks, but even for five bucks a game that is that short is quite expensive. It has some good stylish artwork, and good soundtrack, ok - but the rest - well you could expect more of course. This is one of those games, that is causing strife - should I give it a recomendation or should I just say no to it? Beyond the basics, this game isn't more than a procrastination help - ok, it's a resource management simulation, but beyond that it's not ""the perfect"" waste of time. It's of course an ""educational"" game, but again, this is superficial education - a good idea would be to have different environments, different soils, and some more plants that those five. Furthermore, it would have been a great idea to give the plants more than just some bugs... there are a lot more things that can give a plant brown leaves, and yes - to most of those issues a praying mantis would probably be ... not very helpful.If they (the devs) should ever mind to make a sequel, they should probably keep in mind that there are also people would love a more complex game.Sorry, to not give this game a recomendation - but it's far less the game I expected.

												This is one of the educational games that you barely encounter, but it's still a game. In this game you grow a plant and your goal is to grow as many fruits as possible before winter arrives. You choose what parts to grow. There are some nasty bugs who you got to shoo off and there also is blight.Now for the real deal. This game isn't that good actually. The player has little power over what the plant will grow up to be like. There isn't much strategy, you just get enough resources and then grow a part and then repeat. And gathering resources is based on your clicking speed. This all makes the game feel a bit boring. Maybe you can get an hour out of it (I may or may not have idled most of the time I've played it) and after that you'll find out it's boring. Would be a lot more awesome if you determine what the plant will be like.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												I've finished this game, so I feel it deserves a review. It has a lot of good points, but overall, I'm afraid I'm not going to recommend it. On the positive, the graphics are lovely and the concept is good. It has a nice sound track and is very relaxing -- it is great to have a game that has a calm, positive, non-destructive theme. Although the gameplay is simple, it is not off putting. The ""normal"" mode is a bit of a click-fest, but the ""strategy"" mode solves that and makes it playable. What the game lacks though is depth and challenge. There are only five plants (sunflower, toad lily, lilac, squash and prickly pear) and having more would be better. The upgrades are also somewhat limited. And the ""hard"" plants are still straighforward to play-and-complete, without requiring too much thought. As a result, it is pretty quick to get through all of it. A few other problems exist (no full-screen mode, difficult to get to the almanac, etc.) and although it talks about plant biology, it does go into much detail with it. If you like a peacful, simple game then maybe, but otherwise the lack of depth lets it down. So, not recommended, but it was a close call.			"

												Reach for the sun is a fairly short but fairly relaxing game. It is not the sort you play to get psyched, excited, to feel the rush of blood one would get from winning in PvP or getting a head shot; it is the sort of game you would enjoy at a zen garden, during a short break, or just before going to bed to wind down.If I have to criticize, I would say that ""Reach for the Sun"" lacks development. The game have potentials but the developers failed to bring out it's shine; there are five different kinds of plant and that's all there is to it, and the gameplay is the same for all five of them. The game might benefit a bit more interesting and longlasting if there are a dozen or more plant, which is where the developers should spent their time on; but instread, the devlopers spend a sizeable chunck of their time on the in game Almanac and putting a voiceover like it's a audio book. Which is the one feature that I literally never use because the game already have a comprehensive tutorial.However, for those who enjoys relaxing, light puzzle games, I'd still recommend giving this game a shot. This game could have gone further but for five dollar it's definitely money well spent.Score: 7/10			"

But don't let such simplicity fool you, there are several extremely attractive plant types to choose from, and if you play your cards right, you can make each plant seed up to four times!

												Well Im torn on whether to recommend this game or not.  It only takes 2 hours or so to complete the main game and unlock all the acheviements.  So I would not recommend spending much on the game.  It is however, fairly interesting to play.  There are two modes.  ""Cliassic""  mode which I didnt like as its a simple clickfest as you franticly click to gather resources to continue building your plant.  Then there is a ""strategy"" mode, which is esentially a turn based game.  I enjoyed this mode much more.  In this mode you plan each turn and spend your available resources all while trying to grow your plant enough to produce seeds to gain points to spend on new plants and upgrades.Overall I do recommend this game, just know it will only take a couple hours to complete and try to grab it at a discount like I did.

This game is a decent pastime for those interested in plants and looking for a simple game to play just to relax: after all there's not much choice for plant themed games on Steam (the only other option being the more complex Crazy Plant Shop as far as I know).I could also see this being very good if you want your children to learn basic information about plants and getting them interested in gardening: the game is very easy to pick up and younger audiences'd have no problems with it.

												It is a short game, but with nice mechanics - there is a 'strategy' mode and an 'action' mode, the first is turned based, the last one is rts like and requires quite some timed cliking to collect the resources. It is fresh and smooth, nice to play. Obvioulsy, it is not going to allow for long hours of gameplay like heavy strategy games - but if you have a couple of hours and are interested in picking a quick to play nice little 'strat' game, it is well worth the time.

												Gameplay - You ""play as"" a plant aiming to reproduce, and while this does sound interesting, it can devolve into a bit of a clickfest, especially with classic mode. That being said, classic mode was by far the more exciting of the two and I found myself concentrating and getting quite hurried, especially towards the end of the growing season! However, both modes are pretty easy and i beat the whole game in about 2 hours. The powerups unfortunately do not do much and actually remove some of the more interesting parts of gameplay.Visuals - Fairlly pretty! But for the simplicity, they need a pretty beefed up computer to run smoothly, and I didnt notice much difference between low and ultra, apart from the speed. The flowers look lovely, almost as a painting, but you dont really see them growing as such, just parts such as stems suddenly extend from a node.Sound - AMAZING. Really lovely relaxing music that I felt was almost taking me away to a meadow - compliments the game perfectly and is great to relax with.Replay value - UMMMMMM... I beat the game yesterday for the second time - this was the second time I played the game since I bought it about a year ago. It's a decent game to come back to now and again when you're in the mood, but for £4, it does seem a little much for such little replayability.VERDICT: If you want a relaxing game that won't task you too much, this is probably a fairly good game for you. I wouldn't buy it again for £4, but that being said, I did tend to play it during exam revision so maybe theres a bit of relaxtion potential there. Overall I'd give it a 6/10, mainly because of the price and replay value, but I do recommend it overall. Don't just dive in and buy it though, have a thought, and if this game is for you, go for it!			"

												This review must be posted. The trailer really got me. I'm a big fan of learning things through gaming, but this is far from complete. This is like the most basic stuff every kid gets exposed to in grade school or junior high and that's all there is to it, just a cover page. The idea is definitely great, but this game is just not worth the money right now. Not even worth being on a phone app. Let's be real, it's a click fest because it's not teaching you anything you don't already know and there's no need to think about whether you're clicking for the right reason or not because all you need to do is just click and you'll advance. That's all that mattered, advancing to the next stage. That's what a game is about. This would probably be a lot better if it was like a puzzle, where you'd actually need to think about what you're doing and the outcome. This game just turned my brain off after the tutorial. I would be all for this if it's worth the money, but seriously people, do not waste your money on this! Unless you've never seen a PLANT before...that's not possible...right? That's not even a valid reason to buy this anyway.Gameplay is not even worth going past the tutorial. The tutorial itself is the whole game basically. After that, it's like whack a mole, clicking on anything and everything whenever you can. The game uses ""seeds"" as currency to get access to other plants' seeds and upgrades. You start with 1 seed which lets you buy the sunflower seed and start the game, which I don't see the point in this step. Sunflower is also the only plant you can do the tutorial on, which they always prompt you about if you decide to play sunflower again. Tutorial is pretty easy to understand. There's 3 resources, Water, Nutrient, and Starch. You get water and nutrient from clicking on the roots when they glow, and starch from leaves when they glow. Starch always costs water and sometimes nutrient in order to be acquired due to photosynthesis. Expanding the flower requires all resources in increasing amounts. Goal of the game is to get flowers and pollenate it to acquire the ""fruits"" for their seeds. There are 4 different plants, 3 of them can self pollenate and only 1 requires male and female flowers. Gameplay for all 4 plants are exactly the same, just keep clicking.They do try to make it challenging, in an unchallenging way. There's 1 bug that flies around and land on a predetermined leaf and will suck on all 3 of your resources for 1 point per second until you click on it and it will just fall...Then there's a worm that would dig to a predetermined root and suck on your resources also for 1 point per second until you click on it and it will just wither away. Otherwise they will move to another leaf or root and do the same thing again, but nothing else changes, like it doesn't actually eat off the leaf or root. There's also a butterfly that flies around sometimes and lands on the ground and do nothing...If you click on it, it will fly away, but it doesn't contribute anything, not even help pollinate! There's environmental effects such as blight on leaves, where the leaves have dark spots rendering it useless, then you'll have to click and pull that leaf off and you'll be able to grow a new one to replace it. There's cold snap, in which the leaves are starting to freeze but that's no biggie, just click on the affected leaf and hold until the little flashlight warms it back up. There's really nothing to hold you back from completing your goal before the time is up. Speaking of time, the game runs from Spring to Winter starting with Februrary or March to November or December. Each month lasts for 1 minute for a total of 10 minutes. 4 different plants, 10 minutes each, done within an hour MAX. This is an expensive game for less than an hour of gameplay.They do have upgrades, which are suppose to make things easier, as if it's not easy enough without it. There's the Mulch which pretty much cancels out environmental damage to the plant, the blight and cold snap so you don't even need to deal with it. There's the Water pail, which gives you a lot more water AND nutrient per click on roots. There's the Fertilizer which is suppose to provide more nutrient, but it didn't have any effect if any since it's actually in the Water pail upgrade. They probably missed that. Then there's the Preying Mantis, which takes away the need to look out for bugs and worms. Basically makes your clicks more efficient and focus better on clicking... Once you've obtained all the seeds and upgrades, there's really no point in getting any more seeds. And the fact that they have a time stamp on how fast you complete each plant just makes this even more obvious as a click fest. How strategically fast can you click through this level? Oh and if you ever decide you open this game again and choose ""New Game"", it resets everything as in a whole new game. Yep, as if it's your first time all over again. Talk about replay value.They always have the equation for photosynthesis on the top of the screen, which doesn't contribute to anything at all, other than letting you know which part of the photosynthesis process is going on whenever you acquire a resource. This game is really incomplete as a learning game. Take my word for it everyone, this is not a game that's worth money at the moment. Not even the $5 sale which I thought was a deal. Little did I know. It needs a lot more information to be educating anybody about plants.*EDIT* 02/02/2014Checked out the new patch to see if it's worth any more time, it's still not worth it.The new strategy mode is a good direction, takes away the mindless clicking. BUT! That's basically all it does, covering up the click fest. On the left side of the screen, it tells you the cost of all the possible upgrades if you were able to access them. As in upgrading a stem would cost this much, leaf would cost this much, pollen would cost this much, etc. The bottom right has a ""next turn"" button which also shows the amount of resources you would obtain in the next turn. Bottom left still have the amount of resources on hand. Pretty easy, straight forward, nothing new here guys, as in nothing to learn about a plant. Oh, I almost forgot, they have this new ""bee"" pollinator, which I find even more annoying than what they had before. Every time you get the pollen, a bee will always show up on the top left corner, and then you'll have to drag that bee to the flower. If I was a 10 year old that didn't know better, I would think in the real world, I'll have to find a bee and drag it to a flower in order to pollinate it. There's no big improvement from what I played last time. If anything, it's not improving on what the game is suppose to be about, but just what it's not.Sure, they added a new plant, but what about it? What's the origin of the plant? Where is it indigenous to? What's the binomial name? What makes it special/unique/interesting that I would want to learn about it? Is it used to make anything other than just being a flower? I mean, there's a lot more to ask if someone wants to learn, but if you want to teach through a game, it better have more informative interactions because every plant is the same old story: click, click, click. Whether it's classic mode or strategy mode or even a different plant, they're all the same in this game.			"

												Reach For The Sun is beautiful. An absoloute botanical delight, and will bring bright smiles to any faces. Children of all ages take note; this game is based on the real science of actual botany! As your plants grow using the power of our sun, your mind grows with the power of science! There is a tutorial voice-over giving the basics of the Plantae kingdom's energy cycle, growth and development, and realistic game mechanics reinforces the lesson. This has the effect of burning the subject of plant biology into the synapses populating your temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex.SCIENCE!That's enough of that. Let's mention the gameplay.Classic mode is a real time (okay, accelerated real time) strategy plant-growth simulation. It is quite a clickfest, and is pretty punishing. It is something of a puzzle, but not so much in terms of pattern-matching and pathfinding--more of a numbers game. Players must remember the cost of each piece of plant anotomy at each stage of growth, while simultaneously collecting three resources (water, nutrients, & starch). Extra achievements are awarded for growing textbook plant morphologies, called a ""Deluxe"" plant, for each variety of seed. While you must continually work to keep your plant alive, it is not so difficult as to pose a frustrating challenge, merely a tiring one. The punishing aspects come in the form of worms which steal water (click on them to drive them away), bugs which eat leaves (click on them to squash them), blighted leaves, frozen leaves, pollinating flowers which require bees to be dragged to them. All of this requires much clicking and dragging.With inexperience, your plant will survive. With practice, it will flourish heartily enough to fruit generously. This gives you  precious points! When you get tired of Classic mode's frantic clicking, you can switch to the far more cerebral Strategy mode. Straegy mode is where Reach For The Sun really comes alive, and grows on you. It's clear much thought has gone into creating a game where players can enjoy a well-balanced experience of challenge, numerically managing their plant's resources into fruit (seed) yields to end each level. It's not a walk in the park, but you can stop and smell the roses. Each plant's own soundtrack encourages growth apace, to the tune of both peaceful and stirring music for each season of the year (mostly stringed instruments, which fits very well). The animations of leaves and flowers unfurling, of roots coiling their way through the soil are delightfully visually appealing. Bugs, bees, worms, and butterflies are present in all their splendour with their own entomogical and zooloigcal game mechanics. Reach For The Sun is wonderful game for all budding gardeners (har-hah! 'punintentional'), an experience absolutely everyone can be overjoyed by.PS: SCIENCE!!!			"

												""Learning Games That Shine"". That is what the developers say about themselves. And with this game they put forward an excellent example of how this would look. This small game is a little gem where every step seems to be well thought. Even the music is completely in sync with what you try to achieve.The object is simple enough, grow a plant from seedling to full grown, flower-bearing beauty as soon as possible. This can be done through two modes, classic and strategy.If classic mode you'll need to 'collect' nutrients and water through the plants roots and starch through its leaves. With these building stones you can grow more roots, leaves, stems and eventually the flowers. Watch out for bugs! They will kill your plant. After you've grown the flower it is time to attract the bees so they can pollinate your flowers and grow seeds.The seeds are used to get more plants and upgrades.In Strategy mode you have all the time in the world to finish the plant, but a limited source of nutrients.The only downside to this game is it's length. You can 'finish' the game in about two hours and then there is not much to go back too. So in conclusion I wholeheartedly recommend this game especially if this game is on sale.			"

There's very little planning, or ability to grow your plant in any creative way... absolutely a waste of money, which I wouldn't even recomend for kids.

												A simple and charming game about growing flowers. There isn't very much to this game, you just keep clicking on roots and leaves for resources and then spend them on growing your flower bigger. It has a very charming aesthetic both musically and visually. Do not this game unless you are especially curious about it, because there really isn't much to it.			"

												It's more like a game about teaching you a small bit about botany and gardening with a lot of clicking to help grow the plant you're trying to raise. Upgrades are a bit of a game ruiner since almost every obstacle that could hinder you from achievieng a better ""score"" are practically gone once you purchase them.I was really expecting to see a lot more than just 5 plants in this game but unfortunately that wasn't the case. The game was far too small for what it may have been.			"

												Very interesting premise for a game....Very badly done. Took longer to download than to grow every seed to a 4 star flower.Some calculations are not explained visibly, such as the +/- for adding a leaf, does not demonstrate leaf over heads (-2 nutes).Little details like that leave the user wondering if their maths are wrong.as it stands this game is worth £2 or less in my humble opinion.I would have paid £30+ if this game gave me a better and clearer understanding of plant mechanics.I definatly think the creative mind behind this program could earn a small fortune (an honest one, considering the depth or lack of in this software) by making use of indoor vs outdoor growing, light types, air pruning technology. it should teach us about field capacity and when defoliation is useful to allow a plant with limited light to ripen fruit/flowers properly.MORE!

												It's a very simple and fast game. With the new update, it got waaaaay better. The Strategy Mode is a nice twist. The harder plants got...harder, which is nice. I like the idea of the bees, but I wish they would spawn in different spots on the scenery. Keep in mind that it's very short. In less than 3h I had bought all seeds and upgrades and had all the achievements before the last update. I got it on sale, so I think it was worth it.			"

												I feel the bullet points and key features of this game area a bit misleading.  I was under the impression that this would be more like a strategy game maybe even a turn-based game.  Unfortunately it's a click-fest.  You have to click on your roots, click on your leaves, click on bugs, click, click, click to do everything and you are under a pretty tight time-limit.  I was hoping for something I could sit with my daughter and maybe teach her about how plants work.  Unfortunately there's not really any chance to reflect on what is going on since you have to click from one thing to the next.  The visuals and production values are pretty good, and she does enjoy seeing the flower grow and bloom.			"

												Unfortunately, I can't recommend this game because it doesn't properly support widescreen/scaling options, or provide enough user controls to allow the correct settings for the game to be set.   You're stuck with running in windowed mode.  Amusingly, and with a fertiliser truck worth of hubris, the developer describes the game as being ""graphically intense"".     This is particular relevant for Igob, the time travelling caveman from 12,832BC.   Should he travel forward in time with his trusty 486DX with onboard graphics, he may well pay attention to this warning, if he could read.   Igob will consult tree and stone.I will say that despite the technical issues and limitations of the game, it's an original and educational premise which pleasantly draws the individual into the science of plant biology.   This is actually quite a good idea.  Even the gameplay was interesting enough, if it wasn't for the fact it was running in a tiny window on my 4K monitor.Should the developer invest a little effort into modernising the game so it runs properly on a PC from this century, it could be quite a recommendable game for, well, homeschooling parents or something.   That's really the only thing letting it down.			"

												Played for about two hours (offline mode is the only way I can play most of my games, steam doesn't track it for some reason) and ended up beating all levels in both classic and strategy mode, getting all achievements in the process. While it was fun while it lasted it lacks replay value (as there are only one-two ways to build each plant) and is fairly easy. For children it might not be too bad, I just wish it allowed for a little more experimentation with the plants.			"

 ]Not quite reaching the Sun What a fun little game. It's far from what I'd wish for it to be, but it was nice non the less. I'll explain.So, you gather and spend resources and grow your flowers, science-style. That part is awesome. I absolutely love science and education mixed into games, but they are far and few between. I believe it's because it's a very difficult thing to achieve.Here you have two modes ""Classic"" and ""Strategy"". Classic is real-time as you fight against winters approach. It was very stressful! I never had time to look at the numbers and enjoy the science, i was manically pressing roots and leaves and dragging bees.But thankfully you had ""Strategy"" mode, which is turn-based and makes you plan ahead to grow your flower as best as possible in X amount of turns. Still, it didn't pose much of a challenge, at least on the easier flowers. But for me this strategic approach would be the one to go.What I'd love from a game like this was a much much slower approach. One where time wasn't really a factor apart from slowly closing in on game over. I'd love for it to have more of an ""incremental-game"" feel to it. Where i could enjoy the music and atmosphere and plan ahead and watch the progression and read up on the science as the sun slowly bathed my leaves.So, I'm afraid this wasn't quite what i hoped for. I love the idea and the science-mix, but I'd like more science, much more relaxing gameplay and a lot longer playthroughs.It would do good to learn from f.ex. ""Eufloria"". But perhaps they didn't wish to go in that direction.I find it desperately hard to choose whether or not i recommend this game. I'd like to promote it because of it's idea, but the finish wasn't up to my personal hopes and standards, which makes it really hard to know what you'd like.As a review of a game, costing money I'm afraid I'm going to have to give it a thumbs down. But it's cheap and if you're intrigued and like the gameplay I’ve described, go for it.			"

												The game looked promising, and as a fan of well made educational games I was really interested in it. The visuals look nice, and the UI is simple yet effective. But the game lacks depth, and doesn't teach you many of the things you can tell about plants (for example there's no day/night cycle to include the night behaviour of flora). Also the number of plants you can grow is a disappointing 4, and all of them give little to no possibility to actually chooce how you want to grow the plant (was it too much work to draw flowers, leaves and stems for all of the non-root nodes?). Also I'm annoyed that the game begins as windowed, it could start full screen like most of the games. All in all I can only say, that I've seen way better, free educational flash games out there, and that even the sale price of about 5euros is a lot to pay for this game.			"

												While interesting and lightly educational. This time/resource management game is completable within about an hour. For the current $5 price that's just past my value marker. It does have replayability but the game is restricted to four levels. At this level of investment I would assume a minimum of 12 plants to play around with.Overall the gameplay is solid for the limited levels available but it just seems too short and an expansion would make this a must buy.

												Really good game. The only problem was that i beat it in about 2 hours. I think they need to add more plants once you have beat the first five; and they should add upgrades that you have to gradually upgrade. For example, There could be like five stages for each upgrade, and each stage would be more affective then the rest; but each stage would be more affective. They should also make it to where you can survive the winter; and to where if you grow fruits over the winter they spread into more plants so you can grow a garden. I hope the makers of this game take my advice into concideration. Hope this helps.			"

												I think this would be a great game to give to kids to teach them about photosynthesis and how plants grow. It has some variety of plants and some balancing of resources involved with two modes, a turn-based strategy mode and a live-action classic mode.However, the game is somewhat linear and simple and can be mastered in just a few hours of play. It can get repetitive and doesn't have much in the way of content.As a possibly more fun way to learn about plant life, I give it a thumbs up. As a game... I'd probably give it a thumbs down. It isn't worth playing or paying for as a game.			"

												NOTE: For review with screenshots, please visit http://microfloppy.net/2014/07/11/reach-for-the-sun/I have spend this Friday evening playing Reach for the Sun. I usually like simulators and calm, “cosy” games so I thought that Reach of the Sun might suit me. And yes, I got some entertainment out of it but unfortunately not more than that. You can tell that the game is made to educate and that a skilled gamer is not the target audience. After two hours I had played through the game in its entirety and had nothing left to try.The main purpose of the game is to teach the player about photosynthesis, pollination, and what the different parts of the plant are used for. They have succeeded well in that perspective. Besides that, Reach for the Sun has a pleaseant appearance, a smooth gameplay and nice ambient music. There are also two modes: Classic; where you click your way to resources as fast as you can, and Strategy; which is turn based and thus works better for the players who need more time to read, think, and plan.Worth to mention is that the game only has support for English in case you are considering buying it for a younger gamer.The conclusion? Nothing for me, but maybe for younger players.3/10 carbohydrates "

												Pros : this fun biologically themed resource management game From Filament is an excellent educational tool for giving students an idea of how resources influence the growth of living things, exclusively plants in this game, though some principles would be transferrable to animals in a learning/ teaching context and even in a metaphorical sense to business and enterprise. It is also appropriate as a basic starting point for discussing agricultural economics with its currency of seeds gained from successful pollinations used to buy advances in plant care to improve yields on later crops. There are two modes, one is real time Classic mode and the other turn based Strategy mode. Both provide fun educational play at faster or slower paces as the player chooses. It has pleasant horticulturally paced music and appealing graphics which successfully replicate some of the beauty of living growing plants. I am glad to see this kind of game being made because creatures like ourselves learn best when we are having fun. If learning can be made into a game we all benefit and if games teach beneficial things likewise.Cons: the user interface is perfectly OK and works without any software bugs but in terms of pure gaming technicalities there are minor issues with mouse ergonomics in the Classic real time mode interface which restrict the pace of gameplay and can be frustrating. Even so it is quite possible to achieve the game goals with patience but I will detail the issues for this review. Specifically the info popups and animations for game goal achievements frequently interfere with mouse clicks used to direct gameplay in real time because they are opaque to mouse clicks so they get in the way. Also the mouse pointer graphical tooltips are a little slow to appear creating control lag and they also appear to shift the mouse pointer location marginally or delay its movement under user direction, enough to move it off target making clicking on a target an unnecessarily difficult and delayed process which is unfortunate given that the realtime game is played within fairly tight time constraints. This reduces the fluidity of gameplay which is an important aesthetic for the entertainment market and ultimately reduces the range of its appeal which could otherwise be more extensive as a zen timewaster for frugiform tech enthusiasts. Additional examples, grabbing bees for pollinating is a tricky process because some of the time they appear to be ungrabbable and the effectiveness of making a grab seems unpredictable making it a hit and miss process entirely due to the vicisstudes of the interface. In addition there is no way to prevent the presentation of certain tutorial systems which don't need to be seen twice eg the strategy mode info overlay and the sunflower tutorial mode dialogue, but these can be dismissed so are not showstoppers just minor inconveniences. With that said I thoroughly enjoyed unlocking my Deluxe Toad Lily achievement and if you enjoy games and plants you cant go wrong at this price so I recommend this game for educational purposes and botanical, horti- and agri- cultural geeks.

												NOTE: For review with screenshots, please visit http://microfloppy.net/2014/07/11/reach-for-the-sun/I have spend this Friday evening playing Reach for the Sun. I usually like simulators and calm, “cosy” games so I thought that Reach of the Sun might suit me. And yes, I got some entertainment out of it but unfortunately not more than that. You can tell that the game is made to educate and that a skilled gamer is not the target audience. After two hours I had played through the game in its entirety and had nothing left to try.The main purpose of the game is to teach the player about photosynthesis, pollination, and what the different parts of the plant are used for. They have succeeded well in that perspective. Besides that, Reach for the Sun has a pleaseant appearance, a smooth gameplay and nice ambient music. There are also two modes: Classic; where you click your way to resources as fast as you can, and Strategy; which is turn based and thus works better for the players who need more time to read, think, and plan.Worth to mention is that the game only has support for English in case you are considering buying it for a younger gamer.The conclusion? Nothing for me, but maybe for younger players.3/10 carbohydrates "

												I bought this game because I enjoy biology and thought it would delve into the complexities of a growing living organism and use the surrounding resources to grow and reproduce in a life cycle.God how wrong was I... This game (if you can call it a game) should only be played if you're an infant satisfied with clicking and clicking and clicking, while you collect water and do some more clickings to get some SEEDS. Woow good job, you got seeds, which is the ""currency"". Don't think you can even lose or win, you just collect seeds each time you painfully play (erm, click) a level through.			"

												Reach for the Sun is a educational game that stimulates the life of a plant; gathering water, nutrients and sunlight to grow new parts, so you can take in even more resources, so you can eventullay grow a flower and produce seeds that will germinate in the spring. There is no challenge whatsoever in either classical or stragetic mode, but it's still a fun and relaxing experience, and I found a great deal of satisfaction to see my plant grow and thrive. The music is fantastic, and I sometimes booted up the game just to listen to it's excellence. There is also a good variety of plants, from sunflowers to lilacs to cactuses, although I was a little dissapointed that there weren't more to choose from once you unlocked the inital five wildflowers. All in all, if you're looking for a casual, relaxing experience with pretty visuals and great music, this game is for you.			"

												Reach for the Sun is sort of a weird little niche.  It's educational and fun and at first glance would be perfect for kids.  However it ends up being a bit to fast-paced for kids to keep up.  For $5 it isn't a bad buy at all, but the limited content and the fact that it isn't quite kid-friendly makes it something that not everyone will enjoy.  It's also frustrating to deal with the small bugs - like clicking over and over on a root or leaf and getting no response.			"

												It's fun for a few minutes, but I beat it in about two hours. No replayablility. Once you're done, you're done. Also it just seems like a sloppy port of a flash game. Can't adjust graphics options, no option to save progress in multiple files, and in fullscreen it looks grainy. It purports to teach you about plants, but it doesn't really do that with any great effect or in any detail. It's fun for a time kiler, but ten dollars is too much to ask.			"

												This is a solid game, its what you expect out of a plant growth game. Overall, it is a simple concept and honestly, the game is a little too easy. It could also use more levels with different challenges, like maybe including the effects of fire or growing plants in different environments outside of a garden. The science geek inside of me loves the concept, it just seems like more time could have gone into creating more replayability and more of a challenge. That being said, I enjoyed my time playing the game, and would continue to play if any updates were to be released.			"
