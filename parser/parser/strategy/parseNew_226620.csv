												""Normally, with puzzle games, if it seems too hard then you're generally just doing it wrong. With Desktop Dungeons, it's just too hard."" — Kakie, Corsual Live ViewerI have a confession to make. I'm not proud of it, but I haven't finished Desktop Dungeons. I strive to complete all of the games I review prior to writing, but in this case the cross was too great to bear.My failure came not through lack of trying — I tried for many, many hours — but from an overwhelming level of difficulty. Not the bad kind of difficulty, where cheap opponents consistently barrage you until you die hurling an overpriced controller against the nearest wall, but the good kind of difficulty, that will see you thinking — really thinking — about every move you make, every time you make it, lest your adventure come to a inconveniently early end.Fortunately, I appreciate a challenge. Hell, I crave it. But in the end, it turned out that there was more to accomplish, collect and unlock in this roguelike dungeon crawler than I could ever hope to discover in just 2 weeks, and so, I began my review in advance.WITHOUT FURTHER ADO...I first saw Desktop Dungeons while watching MANvsGAME; Danny Baranowsky and Grant Kirkhope, who composed the soundtrack, were there alongside one of the core developers, Danny Day. They discussed many of the basic game concepts; the randomly generated dungeons and roguelike nature, spell-casting warriors, the coming mobile release, the difference between a harpsichord and clavinet and the origins of Granny Kirkanowsky. Listening in, amidst the constant laughter, I quickly learned that DD has something of a cult following that grew around an alpha build released to the public years back and available free today, which led to it winning the IGF Award Winning for Game Design. Immediately, I downloaded it to take a look.IN THE BEGINNINGThe alpha turned out to be a crude version of the one MAN was playing. It looked very different — the hand-drawn art wasn't present, instead offering a more traditional pixel art style, and the entire progression mechanic was missing, so choosing a dungeon was as simple as selecting a race, class and difficulty.Though I was watching MAN play a clearly superior version, I still felt entirely engaged playing the alpha due to the 'roguelike' nature of the gameplay. Every dungeon was different, and though my imminent demise was almost always a single click away, the ability to head straight back in, new knowledge in hand, to a completely new dungeon, maintained my interest throughout the entire night. That's when I made my purchase, gained access to the browser-operated (sans-soundtrack) beta and began to compare.NEW IS ALWAYS BETTERAfter a brief serving of story and a short tutorial explaining the basics I was directed to my very own kingdom, a world map of sorts, comprised mostly of open space and human inhabited houses. After completing a dungeon, more buildings appeared.  An elven habitat, a mage tower, a church...I quickly realised that the original 'choose race, choose class, choose difficulty' menu featured in the alpha had been replaced here with progressive RPG elements via the kingdom, including a huge host of quests, and that unlike the alpha, races and classes here required an unlock before they could be used. The game continued forward, revealing multiple new features. Gold could be collected from dungeons and kept afterward, and then used to purchase preparation items that could be used in future dungeon attempts, or saved to unlock new buildings in the kingdom.Eventually, I was introduced to the tavern, which served as a hub allowing access to multiple dungeon types. It was here that the largest difference between the alpha and beta made their appearance — there's more than one dungeon type in the full version. A lot more.DON'T♥♥♥♥♥♥OFF THE DEITIESThat's when things started getting tough, and it was at about that time that the full Steam release arrived, this one complete with Granny K's masterpiece soundtrack. I was happy to learn that the progress I'd made in the beta was saved, and too, that even though I could now play the full release on Steam, I could continue to do so from my browser if I chose. Everything is saved online, so portable gaming is a legitimate option. A good thing, too, as Desktop Dungeons lends itself perfectly to quick gaming when you've only got 10 minutes to spare. Come on mobile version...Where was I... oh, right. It's hard. Even the normal dungeons are hard. And the hard dungeons are a lot f@&ing harder. God only knows if there are even harder dungeons around the bend, but if there are, you'll likely need God's help to complete them. Well, at least one of the Gods, anyway.Yes, yes... I know. Terrible segway, yada-yada. Gods are the key to victory in many of the dungeons, yet they're also a leading cause of death. The decision to adopt a deity is usually a hard one — on the one hand, they offer amazing buffs and bonuses that are generally the key to victory, on the other, they'll restrict you in various ways, punishing you severely for whatever they deem misconduct — though mastering their ways is essential.THIS IS THE GAME THAT NEV-ER ENDSThat's where the other 'game mode' really helps: Puzzles. After unlocking the Explorer's Guild building in your kingdom you'll have access to a series of puzzles - dungeons that aren't generated randomly, but instead, have a single specific solution that you must discover in order to succeed. They double as great ways to learn more information about the various items, weapons, spells, deities and conversion materials on offer, and though not everyone will need them, they're highly advised if you're having difficulty completing certain quests or dungeons.And that's everything I know. Almost. I know that of the nine classes I've unlocked there are another nine to go. I know that of the four races I've unlocked there are another... actually I don't know how many more there are. One, at least. I found him once — a Halfling trapped in a dungeon within a dungeon who nicked my last potion— but failed and haven't seen him since. That's a lot of the fun in Desktop Dungeons; every dungeon is different, and you never know what you're going to get. If you like The Binding of Isaac, or Spelunky, or more appropriately, Rogue Legacy, which offers a similar style of 'progressive roguelike' gameplay, then there's a great chance you'll love Desktop Dungeons, too. It's as hard as the others — perhaps even harder in its own way — but if you're not one to shy from a challenge then there's a lot to enjoy.			"

												I met the Devs at GamesCom 2014. Around noon on Friday they sat me down in front of a PC and had me try the game - apparently I did well (I looked at the goblin before attacking it and noticed it had first strike). After a merry but short romp through the introduction dungeon, which ended with a green blob of slime eating my poor adventurer, I went on to explore the rest of the Indie Megabooth. Friday night though, before I went to sleep, I knew there was a bit of unfinished business: I bought the game, and not just because the developers are great guys (but that too).The game delivers what it promisses: bite sized adventures you can play during a break. The other day I had 15 minutes to spare: 10 of those were used by a berserker clearing a swamp of monsters.It may look like a simple game, but it has a suprising amound of depth, with many abilities, items and other things that lead to multiple ways to tackle dungeons and may have you adapting your strategy based on what you encounter.And there is a lot to encounter. Just when you think you have seen all the races, seen all the classes, you find one more. Then you check the journal and see just how much you haven't seen yet (I found it more fun not to check how much I am missing so as not to spoil the pleasure of finding something new).But how do you play? Simple: you select a dungeon to explore and write an adventuring permit. The permit is the ""character creation"" process of that dungeon. For example it could say: To [dungeon name], For Generic Adventuring, Race: Human, Class: Warrior, Equipment: starting adventurer's kit. Then you would play the dungeon with a simple lvl 1 human warrior.As the game progresses you unlock more races, classes and can provide better starting equipment and other bonuses, making each run unique.So what are you waiting for? Your kingdom needs you! Oh, you need a permit? To: Unnamed Desktop Dungeon Kingdom, For: Kingdom Administration, Race: Human, Class: Gamer. There you go, your permit to play the game.And yes, the alpha version is available for free to try out :)			"

												I guess I was expecting more RPG and less Strategy because this game seemed to me to be too difficult to be fun.It starts out easy, you have to clear single-screen 'dungeons' that are tough but defeatable.  By the time I had finished the tutorials (and even some of those I had to cheat and look for solutions on youtube) that was the end of any successful dungeon clearing that I was able to do.Game in a nutshell is: The playfield is dark except where your character begins.  You always begin at level 1 but can choose your race/class and optionally pay some ingame gold for starting equipment (example: a shield that reduces all damage by 2).  You are placed on the screen and have to move around uncovering the darkened squares and ultimately defeat the level 10 boss of the dungeon.   Sounds fun right?The only way to heal yourself and your mana (used for skills found as you explore the dungeon) are potions or uncovering darkened dungeon squares.  Both are in limited supply.  The 'casual' rating of this game is true in the time required to play sense, but if you don't exploit every single weakness of every enemy, and if you don't kill higher level enemies for the bonus exp (which is harder than it sounds, again, very limited healing) you have no chance of killing the level 10 boss monster.Because every move counted so much, and because ultimately it takes a lot of moves to clear a dungeon, I found myself getting frustrated at how incapable I found myself of clearing a dungeon.  I'd get to level 8 or 9 and simply not be able to kill enough enemies at that point without dying, to get to level 10 or have enough of a stockpile of potions for the final boss of each dungeon.   So, instead of surely dying to the higher level boss, I would exit the dungeon, able to keep whatever gold I found in there and selling off the potions for 50-60 gold, take away 10-15 it costs for the items you bring with you.  At that point I was looking at minimum 500 gold upgrades to unlock anything more fun about the game, and I decided to uninstall and give up on the game because there was no other difficulty setting.If that kinda game sounds fun more power to you but I was looking for a much more casual game, as in not an intense experience.  I wanted to shut my brain off for a bit but this took all of my concentration and was, for me, not a fun game to play in hindsight.			"

												It's Minesweeper with a theme.  A nearly perfectly executed puzzle game which captures in an abstract way the dungeon crawling roguelikes which have sprung up like kobolds in the indie market.  You can finish a dungeon in five minutes if you're the impatient sort or if like me you like to mull over optimal moves, a board might take  fifteen minutes or so.  There is a light and humorous background story to give the puzzles a campaign-like structure but War and Peace it ain't.  Which isn't a problem at all as this is the type of game which you'll load up when you have some random time to kill.  You will unlock various ways to customize each dungeon, such as starting equipment, races, classes, gods, etc.  The graphics are cute, the gameplay is tight, the music is not annoying.  If you like puzzle games and think you would enjoy a deconstruction of a dungeon roguelike, then buy this game.  It is practically flawless.			"

												If you're reading this, you're either wondering whether you should get this game, or you already own it but like to froth at the mouth as you experience opinions that don't match your own.  I understand.Desktop Dungeons is a somewhat randomized puzzle game cleverly disguised as a roguelite rpg.  It's also incredibly brutal.  That aside (or possibly because of it), I found the game enjoyable in that ""bring out your inner masochistic rage junkie"" kinda way.  A single mistake can cost you the level, & sometimes you don't find out until 10 minutes later.  One time my mouse was on the fritz & occassionally registered two clicks from one press.  It rendered this game unplayable.  However, overall it was a positive entertainment experience, in that I preferred it over staring at a wall.So why is this review in the ""not recommended"" section?  I don't find the quality of entertainment worth the price tag.  There are plenty of other games out there that can offer a similar playstyle, are more immersive, have greater replayability, & cost a fraction of what I paid for Desktop Dungeons.  While this is a decently good game, it's not $15-good.  Its inflated cost is also reflected in its soundtrack- an arbitrary $10 for something that many games include for free.  Wait for a sale, preferably at least 30% off, hopefully more.			"

												At first, I didn't enjoy this game. It seemed fairly random, simple, and frustrating. About 10 or so hours in, I started to understand how the game actually works. Then, things started to click. The game ultimately, is a puzzle game, and a very unforgiving, but rewarding one. Utilize your blackspace effectively, monsters are a resource, leveling up is a resource not to be wasted. Having to kill 1 Level 10 boss seemed daunting, but when you think you've finally learned how to do it, they then throw 2 Level 10 bosses at you! How the hell am I supposed to beat that? But guess what? I did it. I was thinking, sweet, I know how to play this game. Then, the next set of dungeons appear. Defeat 3 Level 10 bosses. No way, impossible. how the hell do you do that? An hour later, the first of those dungeons falls. The next thing I know, I have to kill 10 of these bosses? IMPOSSIBLE, and do it 3 times with 3 different classes?Every time you think you've learned what to do, the game surprises and challenges you to do 1 better. The quest system does get a bit grindy at times, and I have mixed feelings about the lockering system, but this is a great game that's not often on sale, but if you enjoy puzzle games, this will definitely fit the bill.

												I see why people like this game I really do but this game isn't for me. That being said Steam asks if I would recommend this game to people, my answer is yes but not to everyone. See the game has plenty of replay value as evidenced by a whole bunch of other reviewers putting in much more time than I did. However if you're like me and enjoy more traditional rpgs then this game isn't for you. The graphics are standard roguelike graphics with chracter pieces not sprites added in. The music is very catchy and fun. This game can be like an extremely quick and complex version of D&D or an even more complex and long game similar to D&D. This game is well made while being easy on the surface it takes a bit to master it. If I were basing this review off of my experience alone I'd give it a 6/10 just because it isn't my kind of game. However seeing the game from a reviewers standpoint and looking at how the athstetics and gameplay contribute to the game as a whole I give it an 8.75/10 it's the type of game that demands patience and persistance. If you have the time invest into this baby, lord knows she desereves it... But I'm not the type of gamer that's ready for that type of commitment sorry Desktop Dungeons but I think you should see other gamers.			"

												A very interesting game that can be very difficult, but yet still enjoyable. From the screens and videos I wasn't sure this was a game I'd like, but I'm glad I tried it. The difficulty is like FTL's, you get pummeled and you just want to keep trying until you succeed. There's quite a bit of diversity in the game with a ton of race-class options. Beyond the varying difficulty dungeon runs, there are additional challenges and quests. To top it all off, you get to build a little city for succeeding in your adventures, opening up even more options.Dungeons seem to take 10-30 minutes to run, so you can play for short periods of time or long.

												Desktop Dungeons is exactly the type of indy game i like.It starts simple enough with one dungeon and your lonely weak guard, but offers great complexity and variety.Add to this the humour, which takes a stab at every rpg cliche, and the nearly unending replayability, DD makes the ideal mix of puzzle/strategy/rpg hybrid. It also offers the possibility to just do a quick game and play one dungeon at a time, but can suck you as easily in and you can waste some hours with the ""just the next quest"" addiction.The only thing i am missing would be a possibility to reuse your heroes, maybe in an advanced style, but that would beat the game mechanics..

												A strategy rpg game where you explore random dungeons. Each time you enter a dungeon, the layout is different. The boss is fixed depending on the level you go in. A really neat thing is, even if you die, the stats of your character are listed at the end of the level.I actually found this game hard due to it being very strategy dependent. For example, your level being very high can actually make the boss of a dungeon very hard, depending on which character class you play as. Add into this random weapons and magic on each dungeon, and a random god that gives you blessings depending on your spells and such, and you got a challenging rpg dungeon crawler.Recommended just for it's difficulty playing it to give you a challenge.

												Talk about unlimited content! You can still find new things to do in the game even after 500 hours. Desktop Dungeons is about as close to a real roguelike as you're going to get on Steam, and doing a damn fine job at it. Procedural map generation, turn-based combat, tile grids and permadeath are all present. Punishingly difficult, but really rewarding as well. Makes hours just fly by.			"

												Desktop Dungeons is a turn based roguelike with a little bit of a difference; each run in a dungeon takes about five minutes to come to conclusion. You are free to roam around the dungeon as much as you want, enemies will only attack you if you attack them first, giving you the freedom to work out your strategy however you prefer. Graphics are the usual 2d style which we are seeing so much of these days, but the sprites are nicely designed with some well-known characters thrown in there such as Super Meat Boy. The UI can be a little daunting to begin with but you see all of the information you require within one click. Each of the individual levels are randomly generated; this adds to the replayability of the game as no dungeon will ever be the same; I believe each dungeon has its own set ""theme"" but what is included in the dungeon and how its laid out is completely random. The difficulty is something to be said for though, it is very easy to learn how to play, but very difficult to master, you will die, ALOT in Desktop Dungeons, they even tell you that at the very beginning of the game; it is to be expected. It takes a lot of thought out planning and preparation to work your way through most of the dungeons even straight after the tutorial you are thrown straight in at the deep end. The game length can vary, I have been playing for about five hours and I still haven’t managed to get past the fifth dungeon, there are tons of content available, class challenges, random dungeon runs, extra tutorial lessons for different spells and many more. I have seen some people with over a hundred hours put into Desktop Dungeon. One of the extra plus points I've found is that a potato can run this game, meaning you can stick it on any machine, maybe even your work machine, and load it up on breaks to sneak in fifteen minutes here and there; as it's not resourcefully demanding. Desktop Dungeons is certainly worth your time, and boy will it suck up your time as it is highly addictive.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												I was wary of this.  I played a ton of alpha, even after I had unlocked everything and finished all the levels.  It was a lot of fun, and I appreciated the minimalism of the game.  I paid for the advance copy something like three years ago, played the game, then stopped and sort of put it behind me for a while.Then, just a couple weeks ago, I saw that it was released on steam.  While I thought about looking up my copy of it, minutes later I received a message saying because I paid in advance I got a steam key!So, I cracked it open.  And for a brief minute, I was shocked.  This isn't the blocky spreadsheet I remember!  Where did all these graphics come from?  Why are these characters saying things?  A town?  I miss my grid of things!Of course I got over that quick.  What I wasn't sure about is what changes there would be, and after playing about 10 hours of the game, I am excited to say that I think they've put an amount of polish on top that has made the game even more nuanced, more complex and overall, well, more.The base aspects of the game are the same.  You are in a dungeon with monsters levels 1-10.  Killing them nets XP, but killing monsters of a higher level than you gets you exceptionally more experience.  And you will need to kill higher level monsters, because otherwise you are unlikely to level high enough to kill the boss.  Lucky for you, the monsters are pretty lacksadaisical and tend to just stand around in the same spot, and won't strike unless you strike first.It also has a clever mechanic where revealing tiles in the dungeon is the prime method of regaining life and mana (aside from leveling, which refills all your life and mana). The monsters also refill their life, though, so you can't just take anything out by regaining your life over and over.It sounds simple, but when you count class skills, items, gods and so many other factors, there is just so much to this game.  And the random generation of levels makes every game, even of just random games, a thrill and a different experience.  And I love the way they build level by level as you experience more and more - the learning curve here is a big improvement on the original which pretty much threw you right into the fray and you had to guess what would be hard or easy.  Frankly, that never bothered me because a game like this that lets you take your time, you learn in your own way, but I appreciate what they've done here.  It opens up pretty fast anyway, and I think your particular sense of play can lead you towards certain classes as the most fun or interesting.So basically.  I'd recommend this.  A lot.			"

												I am someone who loves the more challenging and strategic games out there such as FTL and the Banner Saga. Even though Desktop Dungeons are both these things, I am going to tell you why you should not purchase this game (even at sale). Desktop Dungeons is a game that exhibits a little of roguelike quality into a strategy game that is mainly about killing the boss for each ""dungeon."" You start off with availability to one class and one race and slowly progess by upgrading your town to obtain more classes/races/items/bonuses/etc.. The progression in Desktop Dungeons is fine. The game never forces you to use the same class or race at any prolonged period of time. Because of this, the game is entertaing for a couple of hours as you discover all the ways to utilize your classes/races abilities to give you the best shot at defeating the boss at the end. However, for me, the fun stopped pretty quickly after you unlock the grunt of the different loadouts you can have when entering a dungeon. The reason why it stopped being fun was because in order to beat the level you have to use the bonuses that each race/class has effectively. Thus, when you use a class/race you never deviate from the approach that gives that class/race its edge. Therefore, after you unlock the basic classes, it feels as though there not much deviance from the game to keep the dungeon runs refreshing. The Last couple of hours I played consisted of me logging on to play a dungeon run or two, and then logging off because I felt bored. Since I have stopped playing this game though, I did not experience what the rest of the game had to offer. It is possible that the runs got more interesting, but to me it was not worth the time to go through it, or the money i spent to buy it (while it was on sale). Before I end this review, I do want to share some positive aspects of the game because there were good implements of the game that kept me interested for awhile.-Game has a sense of humor and keeps the game in a light mood even though it is difficult.-There are puzzles in the game which put you in a situation in which there is one method that will make you successful.      -If you want to be tested to the limits, these are great-The game explains everything very well and there was nothing that terribly confused me when playing-Game does take good planning to be successful. You cannot simply just click everything to death.Overall I would have to give the game a 6.5/10. I encourage you to look at the other reviews for there are things that I left out about the game. Also, make sure to watch the video on the store page, for that is what the general gameplay of the game looks like. Lastly, just make an informed decision before you hastily bought it like I had. "

												Desktop Dungeons has honestly got to be one of the best games of its kind, in my opinion.

												I think the main reason I didn't really like Desktop Dungeons is that it is not at all what I expected. I thought this game was going to be a rogue-like dungeon-crawler rpg, but after a few hours of play I realized that the game simply isn't this at all. It is actually an rpg skin over top of a resource optimization puzzle game. The dungeons aren't really about battles, equipment, or spells (though all these things are in the game), they are about whether you can exploit the idiosynchrasies of the game mechanics to squeeze a few extra xp out of the dungeon so that you can ultimately beat the boss.Let me explain: There's a limited (and small) number of enemies in each dungeon, as well as a limited amount of gold and healing. You start at level 1. The boss is at level 10. You've got to level your character up and accumulate stuff to have any chance against the boss. But here's the rub: if you simply kill the enemies in order from lowest level to highest, you don't stand much chance. You need to take advantage of the battle mechanics to kill higher level monsters than you really should be able to in sneaky, gamey ways. Then, you'll get bonus experience and reach a higher level faster. Hence, the whole game becomes a puzzle of how you can squeeze all the resources out of a limited supply. This kind of puzzle is just not what I signed up for, and I found playing this way to be very effective but very tedious and dull.If you are looking for a puzzle game combined with rpg elements, you might like this. Otherwise, I'd skip it.			"

												Desktop Dungeons is an entertaining indie game that combines a variety of aspects from RPG, strategy, and puzzle games.  As the ruler of a kingdom, you construct buildings and recruit heroes to do your bidding for you.  The buildings themselves offer unique perks to improve the efficiency of your kingdom while you take control of a hero as you send them out into the further reaches of your lands on quests.Each quest that you undertake is an entire adventure in itself.  Your hero starts at level 1 and you are capable of leveling them all the way to level 10 during the course of the map.  Each level drastically improves the capabilities of your character and there are plenty of beneficial boosts and magical items to find along the way.Your buildings, on the other hand, offer options such as crafting magical gear, unlocking one of the many unique classes, adding additional boosts and content to encounter on your adventures, and even new races - all of which have their own stats that significantly alter the playstyle of -every- class.The quests themselves are turn-based and give you all the time you need to execute the strategy of your choice.  You'll have to manage your health, mana, and experience as you try to maximize your gains and minimize your losses.  The game is unforgiving, though, very rewarding when you successfully pull off a dungeon and drag home a mountain of treasure.I recommend this game to fans of turn-based RPGs, fantasy worlds, and strategy/puzzle gamers.  I found it to be far more enjoyable than I was expecting.  If you're on the fence, give it a try!			"

												A pleasurable timesink! The 1,000th hour playing this game feels just as joyful as the first. At the surface, it looks like the marriage between a roguelike retro dungeon-crawler and a casual kingdom manager strategy game; though if you have the patience to dig deeper, you'll come to appreciate its unique balance and variety. Great for quick casual games, though there are also some multi-stage quest dungeons later on that can challenge even those who are apt at strategy games!			"

												I played the original alpha freeware version of DD years and years ago, and I loved it. The strategy and careful planning, combined with many choices in which the player must weigh opportunity costs, appealed to me as someone who enjoys both puzzle games and roguelikes. This market version, however, is a bit disappointing.Almost immediately I noticed that the quick and seamless gameplay of the original has been replaced with lots of flashy graphics and animations, most of which are far too long and prevent input until they have finished playing. While these animations are relatively short, the slowness becomes noticeable the longer you play. Those little microseconds add up. Yes, this is a turn-based game in which you cafrefully think through your decisions, but let's be honest-- the first 2/3 of every session is pretty much blasting through the weak monsters or exploring in hopes of finding the right item with the RNG. The real magic of the original was in the last 1/3, when things start to get tense and you really have to plan ahead. So it's frustrating when this version forces you to slow down at the part that deserves to be sped through.  These slow animations carry over to the menus as well, and it's  exacerbated by the dull, mediocre banter which tries too hard to be funny, and which takes forever to skip.And of course, there are tutorial levels you can't skip. Really? Really?? This is 2014 and you are still making unskippable tutorial levels?Perhaps the newest feature of this version is the introduction of the gold-to-buy-buildings (which then unlock new heroes or give small upgrades) system. There was absolutely zero reason to add this, because they do the exact same thing as simply completing the challenges in the original alpha. At least in the alpha, you didn't have to click through twelve haphazardly scattered menus-- once you beat the dungeon, the next level or hero was unlocked automatically. Seriously, why even add this?The artwork is polished, but the style is just ugly. There is really nothing redeeming about it. While the alpha had simple, easily distinguishable 16-bit pixel graphics, this version tries way too hard to be detailed. It's like staring into those gross Ren & Stimpy  or Spongebob Squarepants closeups for hours on end! No one wants to do that. The music is also unmemorable-- it sounds like generic stock medieval fantasy music, versus the ominous, synthy fanfare of the original; it says a lot when a 5 second introductory song is more appealing than an entire soundtrack. Lastly, I want to talk about how QCF Design has trolled other indie developers. Back when DD was still in development, League of Epic Heroes, a game by a single dev on iOS, got a cease and desist and was threatened with a lawsuit for ""copying"" the gameplay concept. At the time, LoEH was actually superior to both the DD alpha and the beta. The main developer of DD complained about intellectual property, but honestly, who hasn't copied game concepts before? Every action RPG since Diablo has been a rip-off of it, but we understand that they are still original in their own right. League of Epic Heroes had a unique inventory system, original graphics and assets, and only borrowed the gameplay of DD. The developer said it was unfair that someone else was releasing a Desktop Dungeons-like game on iOS before he could, but that's what you get for taking four years to finish something! Now there is still no iOS port of DD, and of course, there are two Android games which are like DD but very conspicuously, they have not been removed-- sounds to me like the dev just wanted to cut out the competition. So: A release that is actually worse than the original, and an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ developer who can't handle market competition. If you want a fun, puzzle dungeon crawler, save yourself the money and go get the original freeware version of this instead.			"

												Extremely addictive Rogue-like randomly generated dungeon crawler that, at heart, is a strategic puzzle game. It implements the unique mechanic of exploration as regeneration, meaning that the unexplored areas of a map are a finite resource that must be used wisely. Lots of race and class combinations and many dungeons and challenges make for endless replayability. As of this review, I have played over 60 hours and I still feel like I have a lot to learn and that I am improving.Great retro art style and soundtrack/effects combined with the fantasy genre make for a great atmosphere. But be warned, this game is not for everyone - the difficulty level ramps up to the point that it really requires the gamer to do further research via forums and wiki articles for the best strategies, as the tutorials are slightly lacking. You will die - a lot. Thankfully most levels only last an average of 15 minutes. If you feel like you can go no further in the level, you can leave the dungeon and take all the goodies you have found with you.If you are a fan of games that require some nerdy research (like terraria, crusader kings 2, blood bowl) I would definitely seek this one out. Watch some of the Let's Plays on Youtube to get a feel for the game. Due to the difficulty, when I actually pass a tough level the feeling can only be described as or.gas.mic. Maybe the closest feeling would be beating a really hard super meat boy level. By the way, I have rarely felt as though the randomization was unfair. In 95% of cases, the map is definitely beatable as long as you have a very strong grasp on the strategy involved for each class and race, as well as the best way to approach bosses. I have played levels I deemed impossible, only to completely change my strategic thinking and end up beating the level with nearly every single attempt.Is the game worth the price tag? I'd say yes given the hours played. As a bonus, you can actually play this game on the desktop dungeons website (without using steam) by making an account with them and linking it to steam. It saves the game into a cloud and transfers it over to steam. Once I discovered this feature I have been able to play at work on the sly (like I said, I love this game). If you know a friend who owns this game, ask them to set up an account at the website and you can try out the game before purchasing!			"

												I'm kind of torn on this game.  It's obviously well done and gets great reviews.  That said, I don't enjoy it very much.  I was looking for a game that could I could play quickly on the go or as in between other games and based on the reviews, this seemed to be it.  I've played around 15 hours now, and just don't enjoy it that much.  If you like rogue-like puzzlers then it's probably a good game for you.  For me, it just lacks that balance between depth of gameplay and casual mental involvement.  If you approach this game casually, you'll almost certainly never win (other then the few introductory games); and if you approach it to  win, then it's certainly neither casual.I also found the depth of gameplay everyone talks about to be a bit lacking.  After getting frustrated, unable to beat even the first ""normal"" dungeons, I read a couple of the brief introductory help guides on the community page.  Yes, there are some nuances around skills and abilities, but once you get the ""always kill monsters higher level than yourself"", that's about 90% of what you need to understand and succeed in this game.Is there skill involved in this game?  Absolutely.  Is it well done?  Yes.  Could it be a nice, quick diversion or an entire Friday night's gaming session?  Totally.  Is it for me - no.  I feel bad giving this game a thumbs down, and it feels like I'm totally mission something, but for me it just isn't there.  I am compelled to play it from time to time - but unfortunately just in that compulsive ""gotta get the next upgrade"" kind of way, not the good ""OMG I can't wait to play Desktop Dungeons"" kins of way.

												Damn hard. That's what Desktop Dungeons is. Even the easiest dungeons take many tries to finish. This game mixes basic RPG elements with roguelike quests/levels. If you die while trying to complete a quest you have to start all over again. Now, many of the battles (at least in the beginning) can be finished within minutes, provided you know exactly what to do. Completing quests earns you money to unlock and upgrade new classes, and of course, this will unlock new quests for you. All of this should make the game a little easier.But the game might just be a bit too hard because I couldn't even complete 3 quests. And while I still had a good time playing it (mainly because of the short levels) I think the game isn't always well balanced. It requires dedication and effort, -two characteristics I actually possess- but if you have the feeling that you aren't making any progress it's time to quit.Still, a very good and fun game, once and if it clicks, but beware of the difficulty (spikes).[Rating: 72/100]			"

												There are a lot of neat aspects to this game but what killed it for me is how often you know you have lost before you have lost.  The dungeons are largely an order-of-operations puzzle (so-to-speak) and if you get the order wrong, or some other minor thing wrong, you literally cannot win.  The worst thing is when you're down to the last monsters and you know that you cannot beat them because you have done something wrong several actions ago.  In what I have played it didn't seem like there was a lot of strategic adaptability, very unforgiving.			"

The game has an achievement for 100h playtime, which I will probably get with normal playtime and without getting burned out on the game. You feel smarter after every beaten dungeon and after every little intended ""exploit"" in the mechanics you find. It gets harder really fast and it takes a while before you understand all of the games concepts and figure out how to play each of the countless classes. I still have not even unlocked all classes, maps and buildings in the game.You might think $15 is too much for how the game looks, but the content is worth it so much.			"

												Desktop Dungeons is an extremely addictive roguelike strategy game where each randomly generated dungeon is, essentially, a puzzle to be solved. It is easy to pick up and play but there is also a great deal to learn and lots of game mechanics to master. The short length of each dungeon run means that it is a great game to dip in and out of but you can also play for longer periods of time. There is a longer-term aspect to the game as you unlock new options such as races, classes, challenges and quests.Different dungeons along with the various race and class choices provide new challenges and the player is often required to update or alter their strategic thinking in order to be successful. This keeps the game fresh and engaging.Desktop Dungeons has a lot of different race and class combinations plus many different types of dungeons and challenges. There is a high level of replay value and it is a game that you could easily play for hundreds of hours.I feel that it is a really well made game. The soundtrack, in particular, is excellent. There is also lots of replayability here. I feel that Desktop Dungeons offers excellent value for money and it is well worth picking up if you enjoy this style of game.  "

												This is a puzzle game. There's no role playing and no significant strategy involved.  Every level is a variation of the same puzzle. The dungeon consists of one tiled screen that's dark. Your character always start at level 1 and must beat a high level dungeon boss. The puzzle is how to level up your character, with limited resources, high enough to beat the boss. Sounds interesting, but there's only one way to do it: beat monsters with higher level than your character. You have a selection of spells, traits and tricks for this goal, and once you figure it out you just have to repeat it. I found the way this plays to be anti-intuitive and contrived.  It's not a terrible game but I can't recommend it.			"

												I started playing the free version of the game and finally got the steam version. That was a really good choice. My advice: Try the free version, it'll show you the very core of the game. If you like it get the full version.Pros:- Problems to solve strategically: Essentially every dungeon is different and you can solve it in many different ways. But, one or two mistakes and you're done. This is the rogue-like aspect of the game. In the start you'll feel very lost but as soon as you play you'll start using the deep mechanics of the game in your advantage.- Progression and goals to be achieved. Development of your kingdom and uncovering different races, classes, items, etc. through the campaign mode. This is the hook of the game, the RPG aspect, and the way it's done is fantastic.- Huge replayability. The amount of combinations is just enormous. It's always the same idea: get in the dungeon, kill the boss/es and get out, but the amount of combinations of classes, races, deities, items, layout of the dungeon, level of difficulty of the dungeon, badges achievable, etc make every run different than the previous one.- Daily dungeon.- Complex and difficult. This game is all about thinking, the puzzle element is about 70% of the game. I you don't like staring at the screen for a couple of minutes checking your best option then you probably won't like the game. Difficult dungeons take about 20-30 min and you need to be focus all the time.- Good difficulty curve and very good tutorials.Cons:- Can't think of any. Overall this is an extremely well done game (once you play for a while you'll notice this in the little details). Very original and unique in its way. But remember to try the free version first, this is not a game for everyone.			"

At least a different dozen other classes that play very uniquely from all of eachother, since you need to be able to effectively use their abilities to their max capabilities in order to tackle the more difficult dungeons.There are many hundreds of hours worth of replayability and gameplay in this package due to the extreme variety of challenges.

												A couple years in development, Desktop Dungeons has finally gone gold, and is a ton of fun to play. It's a unique mix of a light roguelike with a puzzler, and definitely exercises your strategy gland (that's a thing, right?). Each level is pretty short, ~10 minutes, so it's good in both short and long bursts. Tons of unlockables, immense replayability and staying power, light kingdom building aspects and lots of strategic depth add up to make this one a winner. The developers continue to improve upon it as well, which is always a good sign. The free ""alpha"" version on their website is basically the precursor to this game, but the basic gameplay mechanics are there. (Note: I take no responsibility  for any headaches resulting from the optional puzzle levels or challenges.)			"

												I played a ton of Desktop Dungeons back in college, when it was a freeware game. It had everything I loved most about roguelikes - the balance between short-term tactics and long-term strategy, resource management, and replayability. Then it put all that into a puzzle sort of format that made it easy to learn and quick to play whenever I had some time between classes. Best of all, it was designed such the RNG had little influence on your outcome. Your victories, and your failures, were your own.This release maintains the solid gameplay and tight balance of the original, while adding a metric ton of content. There are so many dungeons, monsters, races, classes, gods, and so on now that even I'm overwhelmed. Fortunately, it's meted out to you in a very mobile-game sort of way, which in any other game I'd find distasteful. If anything, I'd say the pace of content unlocking is almost too fast. I'm unlocking way more things than I can try even once. Desktop Dungeons is well worth your money and time. After watching the gameplay videos I wasn't convinced they had done enough to turn this freeware classic into a $15 product, but now that I've played it (for 6 hours straight, glued to my chair) I can confidently recommend it.

The puzzle elements force the game mechanics to be stringent to the point where making a single mistake will ruin your attempt to finish a stage, and the roguelike elements randomize everything to the point where you can't really plan ahead and you seemingly just have to hope for a good roll of the stage you're playing so you can even consider finishing it in the first place.

												first of all, this game is hard. But once you understand the mechanics a bit, it's alot of fun. I started playing this and I couldn't finish the first level without a lot of luck. Later on I saw that there were some ""puzzle"" levels, which had tutorial ""puzzels"". After these levels i learned some tricks and realized that you don't have to kill every enemy in a level, just the boss. However even after these levels i still get confused and fail quite often. I would recommend this game for players who seek a small game that they could play, but it will need some time to figure out how to play the game properly. But if you can play it somewhat decent, you can show off quite a bit. My tip will be to try and explain how you completed a level to someone who doesn't play the game, then look at their reactions and smile at them.			"

												If you've never played Desktop Dungeons, play the Free Alpha. It's very accessible and very fun.If you like the alpha, you will *probably* love the retail version, but there are so many caveats that I find it very hard to recommend.1) There are a lot more items in the retail version of desktop dungeons, most of them feel rather balanced and fun to use.    BUT unlocking these are barred behind dungeon completion quests and silver challenges, neither of which usually highlight the best aspects of Desktop Dungeons2) Some of the dungeons are like mini-adventures or have very unique quirks that make them feel very different from other ones, and very challenging in their own way. The Alpha would have LOVED to have dungeons half as interesting.   BUT the quests you are usually given and guided toward involve going to the most boring dungeons. Example: Namtar's Lair involves striking down a reanimating necromancer six times while carrying his corpse further and further down the Underworld, while you both become weaker the farther you descend. This dungeon is dope as hell, but there's no quests for it. Den of Danger is the resident baby dungeon and encourages you to replay it at least 11 times successfully (I think, AT LEAST 9). Verdict: This game is really fun and has a lot of content; however, the way you're encouraged to play to unlock things is not really the best showcase of the game. If you enjoy it and stick with it, there's a ton of fun you can have.			"

But it will compel your attention for much longer than that... not because the game demands your attention, but because you want to give it your attention.Even after about twenty hours of play, there is still much for me to learn and unravel about this game.

												What can I say? I really loved the style of artwork portrayed in this game. This game initally starts off very addicted and emerssive. But that only lasted for an extremely short amount of time, leaving me unfulfilled and extremely unsatisfied with my purchase. It's not the gameplay or the game mechanics fault this time as to why it got old fast. This time the culprit was the difficulty. After the inital first few dungeons and extreme enjoyment, the game throws you in a hell hole of a metaphoric toxic goo and pretty much tells you to learn how to swim through it without dying. The tutorials they ""offer"" (using the word ""offer"" very loosely) are not very great tutorials. Instead, to them, the tutorials are basicly just slimmed down dungeons with specific situations with only one SPECIFIC way out to complete with no instructions whatsoever. This makes it impossible to progress further into the game, which stunts the enjoyment to a grinding halt. This COULD HAVE been forgiven if they decided to put a difficulty mode choice option somewhere in the game but that exists just as much as their tutorial instructions do. I would have never paid 15 dollars for this game, had I known that the replay value (do to difficulty) was shorter than a first round knockout match between Mike Tyson and some random crackhead midget. This game is worth maybe about 2 dollars at this point. In my opinion, if the developers were to atleast put in a difficulty option, the gameplay value and price value would rise tremendously. And that's just putting a band-aid on a large cut that needs surgery. That wouldn't REALLY solve the problem here. I DO love a challenge. But I would like to be given a competent tutorial so that I can actually enjoy the game as it was intended to be, which is ""difficult"", NOT impossible.This part here is specifically to the developers:You have a game with a mass amount of potential but you guys need to put more effort into this game. It's not just about making it more aesthetically pleasing from your free game version. You need to step up to the plate and make this game more user friendly. We need a way better tutorial system because the tutorial system in it now is horrible. And I'm putting it as nicely as I can without allowing my affability make me cringe too much.In conclusion:I only hope that I can enjoy this game and be able to recommend it in the future. I really do.			"

												A really great game with tons of replayability, you won't find a better value game.  The game is humerous, can be tense, is highly strategic, turn based but can be played relatively quickly.  One of my favorite games.			"

												I've played this game for 16 hours, the first 10 of which were a blast...very addictive and fun.But unfortunately I must echo what others have said.  The game gets confusing/hard/tricky at a certain point and even after reading hints and tip online I couldn't make any progress.Ultimately, very frustrating as it's such a great game idea and well done.I've been hoping they will ""patch"" it and provide a fix for everyone but I'm not holding my breath.So, even at 50% off I would pass on this game.

												Very disappointed with this game and have no idea why it is largely getting good reviews. It claims to be a roguelike like but apart from the presentation it is simply an incredibly boring, repetitive, unforgiving puzzle game.While the game is based in a dungeon, the enemies never actually attack you unless you attack them. They just sit there! You do nothing more than walk around the dungeon picking which enemies to attack and which to leave till later. The only way you die is when you've run out of options and basically have to commit suicide.The art style is grotesque and is reminicent of the hideous zoomed in images of something gross from Ren and Stimpy. If you try to run the game beyond its native tiny windowed resolution its looks even worse... somehowI'm pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off I paid for this game, and I got it on special. Don't make the same mistake I did and play a real roguelike instead. Oh and the interface sucks balls.  "

												This is not a roguelike. It's a clever puzzle game disguised as an RPG. While it has potential, it falls short in that single mistakes, or just a badly placed bad guy on a random map level can cause you to lose the whole map, regardless of what else you do. The Good   - This is a truly hard game. If you like hard puzzles, this gives it in spades.  - The artwork and voice work is nice.  The Bad  - This game is frustrating when you lose making no mistakes. That's fine in real life a game shouldn't have unwinnable situations unless it's the Kobayashi Maru.   - Despite having multiple characters, playing gets grindy really quickly. You either get a good random map or a bad one.   - You lose your character and money spent each round. You level up by buying houses which allow you to buy add-ons.   - All these taken together give the game a pay to win type of feel like many casual games, but isn't one. I wanted to like this game, but after playing I found myself both bored and frustrated. For some people this is going to be a good game, for those looking for a rogue-like, dungeon crawl, this is not that.			"

												This is one of the most well made games i have encountered. If you like roguelites, this is just supreme. I would like to say some things about the 2 major points the other reviews are mentioning:- Very difficult. Yes this game is hard, but only until you master it. Afterwards is just a walk in the park.- Casual 20mins runs isn't true. Well, this actually very true. The difference is compared to other games, that for that 20mins the game demands your true attention, as usually, there is no room for errors.And of course the positives: Low price, a LOT of content, beatiful art, excellent gameplay, can be played in small 20mins periods at a time.

												I have played this game for years - even way back when the graphics were much poorer/different quality. I really like the game, but honestly it is just too difficult (and check out the games I own - I do not shy away from difficult games). I have spent many hours playing this, but could never figure out how to get 'good at it'. I cannot recommend a purchase unless you try the free version (the oldschool one) and really like that.			"

												This is a brutal puzzle game wrapped in a Dungeon Hack theme.  Since combat is almost entirely non random, you need to CAREFULLY pick your fights to space out injuries, healing, and leveling up.  This is a brain burner.Oh, to make it more painful.  The natural way to heal or gain mana back is to explore the map, so you will use up the map over time as well.  It's hard, very hard, to win.			"

												Brilliant game, best described as a mix of dungeon crawling and puzzling. Its basically about ""solving"" small dungeons, not bigger than screen size, by succesfully optimzing the game mechanics (rules, spells, character abilities, environment). And as simple as that sounds: dont plan every of your moves carefully, and you will fail. Be prepared for a tough mental challenge if you choose to play this game, in which the depth has no limits...Concerning the graphics, dont let you fool by its simpleness- there is an AMAZING amount of content behind it: a lenghty campaign, random generated dungeons, optional puzzles, tutorials, achievements, (upgradeable) buildings, unlocks (races, classes), quests...I played for 30 hours now, am still discovering new ways to optimize my play, and still have tons of stuff to do!On the negative side, the game suffers from a lack of final polish (refinemen and comfort):Some descriptions and tooltips are lacking, few are even wrong, which leads to several bad experiences and losses, until you have learned the game properly. Be prepared to play all tutorials and use the Wiki in order to really understand this game.Additionaly, the balance is lacking, and thats the only really bad thing i could say about this game. Some monsters and gods are (in relation) stronger than others, and since dungeons are randomly generated, frustration is a part of this game. It goes as far, that some challenges and dungeons are not always beatable, as a certain constellation is necessary to succeed, and thats the point where it hurts.In the end, some will love this game, while others will hate it.Patient people with a preference for mentally demanding, turn based games will find hundreds of hours of enjoyment in this game, while the casual and/or action gamer might get frustrated by the learning curve, the slow pace and/or the randomness.For me, this was one of the best purchases ive ever done!!!

												Oh, my ... what have I done? I bought this game and thought, well - easy pie. And now I am addicted into this game and can't get loose from it, playing scenario after scenario, after dungeon only to sit there late at night and just get the next unlockable item, content, whatever... Totally lunatic you say? Probably so, but this game has some addictive contents - and I swear, it hasn't anything to do with fungi growing in the dungeons or creeper vines that grow wine bottles. This game is fun, plain and easy, it is fun from the start, when you learn the mechanics of the game up to solving riddles or to enlarge your realm. I still haven't played it through and I have spent hour after hour in this game. I could lament about what I missed out because of this game, but I won't it was all that I needed at that time. The learning curve of this game is adorable, it's giving enough good opportunities for old and new players.Please, continue this game, developer, create more content... Larger Guilds, more classes... more monsters, more stuff... need, need, need... *overload*If you like games with procedural design and a high replayability, you have reached here a memorable experience. It has a large, flashing ""Buy me!"" sign, and this is quite correct.			"

												Fun, simple, straightforward. Good time killer. Not a game with extreme depth, and not for everyone, but it delivers exactly what it claims: it's an oldschool desktop style game that reminds me in ways of ""Yoda Stories"" or ""Chip's Challenge"" but with more of a tactical side.RNG can make some scenarios very hard to complete. Played it while I was sick and enjoyed it, but probably wouldn't take any time out of a full day to play it. That said, I can be hard to please. If you're not sure about this game, I believe there is a free version out there to try. If you're looking for something really straightforward to kill time with, this game is for you.			"

												I acutally wouldn't consider this game a roguelike. While it does have the trappings of one, such as leveling, equipment, classes, gods, etc. it plays more like a puzzle game. You enter a one-screen (sometimes with a basement) dungoen with one or more bosses hiding in it. Your objective is to kill all the bosses. However, you will have to level up your character enough in order to be able to stand a chance against the boss. You do this by defeating lesser enemies in a logical order, using your class and racial abilities. Enemies don't move, so you have plenty of freedom to think out your moves. Strangely enough, you gain HP and mana by exploring the dark areas of the screen, so you'll have to manage this resource carefully.Overall, this game fits the bill for those who like puzzles, but also enjoy random elements and roguelikes or rpgs. Don't expect an exploration-based experience, though.			"

												I have played this game for many hours before being on Steam.If you've ever played a roguelike Role Playing Game(RPG) you'll know they are amazing time sinks.  Indeed, most RPGs are time sinks.  Desktop Dungeons takes the basics of RPGs and condenses them into one screen full of adventure.  These play out as puzzles as much as an RPG.  You can be done and dusted with a dungeon in only a few minutes, yet they are full of the usual RPG elements.  Potions, gold, shops, stat bonuses, gods, monsters and level ups.  Your goal in each fixed dungeon is to kill one or two level 10 boss monsters.Difficulty in Desktop Dungeons is one of the highlights.  Each map and element provides a serious challenge to get to the end result of killing the level 10 boss monster.  It is not at all uncommon to fail.  You have to balance exploration so much so that it can feel like minesweeper.  You have tough choices to make and the key to this being such a great game is that your choices actually matter.  That makes the dungeons memorable and fun.Another nice thing about Desktop Dungeons is the way it ties the dungeons together.  As you complete the basic dungeons you unlock lots more content.

												Desktop Dungeons is a great game that fittingly belongs on the desktop although at first glance may look like it is better suited to playing it on a portable device. Dungeons generally take 10-20 minutes to complete (or fail) but the base mechanics are addicting enough that I did not find myself saying 'just one more', sessions ended only while glancing at the clock and being surprised enough to force myself to stop. This is a surprisingly deep experience for a somewhat simplified dungeon crawler. Not only are the layouts different each time you start a dungeon (even the same one multiple times) but there is quite a bit outside of these in building up your kingdom and unlocking classes and races. The dungeon mechanics themselves are for the most part pretty standard - move, attack, kill, level up, repeat. The twist here is that as you explore, newly discovered tiles refill your (and any damaged enemy) health and mana bars. The impact of this was lost on me at the lower levels, but as you progress you will find it is impossible to explore the map and plan all your moves ahead of time. There are some abilities that help mitigate this but for the most part, each step is a resource not to be wasted and a wrong turn can mean the difference between leveling up or running out of options seven levels later while fighting the boss.Here lies the first of my two main issues with the game. I have had dungeons where the first half of my exploration resulted in dead ends or creatures far above my level 1 hero you always start as. This can be frustrating as it means you lose out on health/mana regen later on when those tiles could have been useful. I readily acknowledge that this is very much part of the game and there is strategy here above what my compulsion for exploration allows, but it can be hard not to feel that such runs are pointless to pursue.My other issue with Desktop Dungeons has nothing to do with gameplay - the writing takes me completely out of the experience. The game world seems steeped in lore and interesting hero / creature design, yet all the dialogue is extremely casual and self-referential well beyond the tongue-in-cheek point. It's too bad, and is one of those situations where a flaw is almost made worse by the amount of potential it has. I would have preferred the tone to get more serious as I realized how deep the experience could be, and not the other way around. That may be personal opinion, but I really feel as if it is an area of missed opportunity in an otherwise enjoyable and lasting experience.Overall, I would highly recommend Desktop Dungeons to anyone looking for a game that satisfies in a way games like Binding of Isaac or even Spelunky does, where it doesn't matter if you play 5 or 50 games a session and can come back the next day and still find fresh gameplay waiting. The excellency of the procedural generation (which is greatly designed, no randomness here is used as a crutch) is exciting in its balance of interesting and clever levels, and even though the difficulty gets quite high early on you will most likely be able to find fun with it no matter your skill level.---Desktop Dungeons---+ Addicting base mechanics+ Deep experience tied to player skill progression- Some runs can be a letdown at the very start- Writing direction is not for me at allIt is my opinion that you should buy Desktop Dungeons anytime it is $12.50 or less!

												Desktop Dungeons: Strongly RecommendDesktop Dungeons started as a freeware game and was polished into a classic. Also its by a bunch of South African Dev's so wave that flag (if the pell names didn't give it away).Games like DD, Minecraft & Spelunky both start as Freeware games and in an open collaborative sense and then are developed with the community while the creator retains a strong personality and sense of ownership.This leads to game which are strong from a pure design, ludology, point of view. Yet at the same time the character and aesthetic retain a strong individuality which is a welcome change from bland studio fair which has been mushed together like game design pap smooth and even in flavour. ﻿			"

You will want to come back and give that dungeon that massacred you another shot, and doing so is very easy (as soon as you've gotten past the slightly-too-long tutorial section). Essentially, you pick your race, type and starting equipment, and then off you go. There is a lot of hidden depth in this game and it can easily suck up hours of your time. The price is right for the amount of content available, and I can heartily recommend Desktop Dungeons. Just be prepared to die. Lots and lots and lots.			"

It's a great game to play in a 10 minute break and thanks to the village based meta-game aspects you are always working towards unlocking something new that adds further variety to the already copious amount of content.As an added bonus you can link your steam version of the game to their servers and even play in a browser and pick up exactly where you left off and vice versa.

												Highly recommended!  This is a great bite-sized puzzler with an rpg/roguelike theme.  It is math and planning intensive, especially as you dig deeper in the game.  For me, a single round can take anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour depending on the challenge I'm tackling.  This game is very polished and held my attention again and again throughout its Beta and now in release, even in a Steam library of hundreds of games.  I always feel like I can get through one more level, earn one more item, or unlock one more badge with another round.  It has the best addictive game qualities combined with the need for a serious strategy and strong tactics to be successful.  Again, if this description sounds even vaguely appealing to you, I would give it a try!  You won't regret it.			"

												As someone who went into Desktop Dungeons never knowing what Rogue-like game ever played like, I was a little worried at that it wouldn't be my sort of game. After just on around 40 hours of game time now, I can say that this game is incredibly addictive and fun thanks to its smart progression, incredibly polished systems and charming art/music combo. It's described as a game you can play during coffee breaks, but I'm personally taking around 40mins to 1 hour to finish a dungeon properly as it can sometimes take some brain-raking and planning to overcome the obstacles in front of you. What does work really well for quick burst though are devilishly challenging puzzle challenges. These double as advanced tutorials and are almost a must for anyone wanting to really know what the game may expect of you.All in all, a really challenging but incredibly rewarding experience so far. Nothing better than feeling stuck on a dungeon having a solution swirl itself into fruition, leading to that immensely satisfying ""aha!"" moment. My favortite part for sure.Highly recommended! Great game!			"

												Do you love roguelikes? Do you like puzzle games? Then this game is totally for you. Desktop Dungeons combines both roguelike elements and the puzzle genre to create an immensely captivating and addictive game. As the game is heavily influenced by roguelikes, then you'll already know that the game will be extremely hard. You'll certainly crave that ""... just one more dungeon"" while you totally ignore that you should've be in bed several hours ago.Yes, the price might put some people off, but you'll certainly receive days (or even weeks) of challenging and fun puzzles. You'll be engulfed in the game way more than you'd admit.If you're a fan of games like Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, ToME v4, Brogue, NetHack, ADOM, Cataclysm: DDA, DoomRL and so on, then I'd heartily recommend this game.If you're still undecided about purchasing the game, then you can check out the free alpha build. It's old and outdated, but you'll get the basic premiss of the game.Grab it here (PC/MAC): http://www.desktopdungeons.net/media/ "

												honestly, i unexpectedly liked.It's a roguelike game with progression elements - you need to develop and upgrade your Kingdom.Game basics are pretty easy, but cleaning dungeons still reqiure some strategies/tactics, not just slashing everything on your way. Though it's roguelike style game, punishment for failing dungeons not so harsh and game sessions are quite short, so failed dungeons can be quick to repeat.Not annoying music. Gameplay is addictive(like most games in this sub genre)Funny humor(parody on classic high fantasy and IRL reference). Lol example

												I remember playing and enjoying the earlier version of this game while at work a couple of years ago (2011), and  it's nice to see that the paid version has built out the features nicely without losing sight of the original design. Don't be fooled by the cutesy artwork either - under the brightly colored hood lies an engine made of pure unadulterated mathematics. Do you fight the stronger enemy while you are lower level, earning extra xp you may need later? Or would that fight require you to eat into your valuable potion supply? The answer is right in front of your eyes, 95% of the time, it's up to you to figure out the optimal path if you can. Or, have a calculator handy.I'm not joking about the math either. This game is like a combination of Soduko, Minesweeper and the popular roguelike Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (I mean this in the best possible way). That's isn't to say that the rpg theme is painted on. On the contrary there is a satisfying asymettry to both the challenges you face in terms of levels and bosses, and also to the way the various classes and loadouts need to be deployed in order to surmount those challenges. The number of abilities and potential interactions, combined with a high degree of randomization, means that things stay interesting and fresh.Expect a game to last anywhere from 5 or 10 minutes from the early levels/challenges and upwards to an hour when attempting to successfully navigate some of the later dungeons, where a single miscalculation or wrong move can snatch sudden defeat from the jaws of victory. The logic and mechanics are incredibly tight (using unexplored space as a kind of resource is a genius mechanic IMO), and the fact that you now to get to build out your own kingdom as your acquire resources just adds another element of fun.Awesome game! I can't wait to see what happens next with the franchise.			"

												This game has so much potentially to really be amazing.  I WANT it to be amazing.  The fundamental flaw is that it is simply too difficult for the casual (and in my instance, hardcore) gamer and you often waste time trying to beat a level that is straight up unbeatable.  Thanks to random generations, you can find you have shot yourself in the foot many turns ago when approaching the boss and there is nothing you can do but quit for a measely 25g or so trying to climb your way to the next 1000g upgrade.  I do understand it is a roguelike and the purpose is to die often but the agony of defeat and the time you just wasted zaps the fun right out of the game.  Unless you really want a difficult challenge and are ok with losing because you made a mistake 15 minutes ago on a 20 minute level, then by all means pick this up.  If you want to constantly be calculating moderate to heavy math every turn as if you are playing sudoku and chess simultaenously, pick this up.  If you want to relax and have fun, move on to something else.			"

												Got this game many, many years ago when it was a simple grid based romp.Was really excited to see a bigger, campaign based version come out on steam .. that was .. until I played it ..All the fun is gone.It's buried in items and rules and this and that and uugh .. Permadeath is fine, but game after game of random impossibleness that is not even fun to grind through. When a simple game requires a tutorial, you know you've probably not bought something simple.I don't mind a more indepth experience, but I really just wanted a fun quick time waster, not an annoying grind after grind after grind .. plus I keep forgetting what all the things do between sessions so it all becomes an unfun blob of yuck.I'm glad a lot of people like the game, hats off to the devs for giving lotsa people the game they wanted.But for me, it's just a frustration that's leaning towards an uninstall.

												You start each dungeon/puzzle at level 1 and have to fight your way through monsters until you can fight toe to toe with the boss. Despite being ""puzzle-ish"" there are a lot of different ways to beat a specific dungeon, even if it does not seem like it the first time you play. Fighting a monster takes away health and mana, though you can replenish it by exploring. However, just make sure to consider in which direction you want to explore the dungeon, as the precious tiles run out faster than you think. There are also a lot of different items that you can unlock, which will help you to smack those monsters around. And to spice it up, you have also 9 gods to choose from. Each one will alter your play style, as they reward and punish(!) various actions. One god is easy to learn, but tough to master, but to use more than one and know when to worship which god will take time, but will give such a huge reward!In addition, there are some fixed dungeons included, which only allow for one single execution of steps to beat the challenge. They are very smartly designed and will teach you the mechanics of the game (if you are observant). Very well done!10/10 Definitely recommend			"

												This is a very well thought out game if you like complex mechanics that require advance planning at every stage. The game play is nice and balanced, once you get the hang of it's unique mechanics for healing and mana regen. That said I like a dungeon crawl game where exploration is not a game mechanic, so while I like the game for my tastes is's not ""fun"" when idly killing time, which is the metric I am rating on. So this can be taken as a positive review of the game being that it's well done, with a negative recommendation.			"

Other than that it's a great game and I hope they come out with more DLC.At times this game can be lots of fun. But the poor documentation and very uneven difficulty progression ultimately make it an exercise in frustration rather than fun.After playing about 20 hours, and struggling with the game I hit a wall where I couldn't progress any further.

												One of my favorites but I feel this a very tough game to rate. I cannot think of any other like it and it succeeds on so many levels that I am blown away by the amount of time and energy it must have taken to create this. That being said many of my friends would (and have) toss this aside very quickly. The best comparison I can think of for this game would be chess, crosswords, or suduko not because this game operates by the same level or rules but because of the amount of mental energy required to play well (or poorly but with maximum effort in my case).On a high note this game does an excellent job of rewarding progress. Even nearly 80 hours into the game I am still unlocking new aspects every couple hours. The high difficulty factor and this make every finished map lead to both a sigh of relief and quick inhale of anticipation as to what might be next. There are not too many titles you can find that can or will provide this.The game is a puzzle/roguelike/rpg with a steeeeep learning curve. It goes from fairly easy, to somewhat challenging to difficult to ""okay quit smacking me in the balls"" tough in a span of about 2 hours or playtime each at which point the challenge continues to escalate as you progress through each map after. I personally enjoy the challenge but I think this is a balancing issue that is likely to turn away alot of people before they really get into the game. This is a shame because of the amazing amount of possiblities and strategies you can and will need to master to get through it. I have to grudgengliny give it a slight knock for this.The only other major criticism I have is that the tutorial is a bit limited. In a game that gives you such progression the mechanics of many of the aspects are not clearly explained. There are puzzles that come with many of the unlocks that are obviously suppose to help out with this. Unfortunately they are pretty limited (and freakin hard as hell themselves) and do not provide you with much help. This can add on to the frustration level pretty damn quick.The graphics are obviously not the draw here but the cartoony and light-hearteness of the game provide a nice counterpoint to the toughness factor. All in all if you own or play mostly titles that contain the tags ""board games, tcg, puzzles, strategy, tactical"" there is a really good chance this is a gonna be one of your favorites. If your looking for something light-hearted and dislike high difficulty you are likely better off walking the other way.  Objectively I rate his high for orignality and length of content as well as awe-inspiring game design and detract slightly for the poorly explained mechanics and balancing issues.7/10bump this to 9/10 if your a fan of puzzles and high challenge...

												Overview:Though Desktop Dungeons does have a high learning curve, it is still an addictive and well-designed puzzle roguelike that will keep you coming back for more to defeat its nastier challenges.  As you defeat dungeons and complete challenges, your kingdom will grow, unlocking more races, gods, classes, and items to choose from or find in the dungeon.  The story might not be the best, but the writing is hilarious and should easily keep you entertained, on top of the deep and interesting gameplay.Gameplay:Like I said, everything is a resource, including gold, level-ups (they fully heal you, in addition to giving extra stats), items you don't use, and even exploration!  This is the source of the puzzle nature of the game, as maximizing the utility of your resources to defeat higher-level monsters is essential for defeating the harder difficulties.  Every dungeon has one or more level 10 bosses, who must be defeated to win.  These bosses are appropriately epic, sporting significantly higher stats than the other dungeon inhabitants, so much of the challenge comes from getting to the point where you can take them on.Desktop Dungeons includes a large variety of dungeons and challenges of varying difficulties that will keep you coming back for more.  In true roguelike spirit, all dungeons are randomized each time you attempt them.  While the normal dungeons may just feature a set of monsters and a level 10 boss, the hard and vicious dungeons all have their own gameplay gimmicks which make them feel unique, like separate challenges.  In addition to the standard dungeons, there are also a large number of challenges and puzzles to complete to improve your skills and unlock items.  I can't say I enjoyed the puzzles as much as the challenges and dungeons, but the puzzles are completely optional.As you complete those dungeons, you will obtain gold which can be used to improve your kingdom, unlocking new classes, races, and preparations for dungeons.  These preparations can be used to aid future dungeon runs in certain strategic ways.  For example, you can guarantee that you start with a fireball, a useful preparation for the sorcerer.  By doing so, however, you give up the ability to increase your stats through a different preparation.  These preparations provide a good amount of strategy to a run through carefully planning which ones you will need to defeat a certain dungeon.  They also cost gold, which can be daunting for new players.  However, preparations are never actually required to clear a dungeon, and one preparation even massively increases the gold that you receive from clearing a dungeon successfully.Music:Desktop Dungeons has a pretty good thematic soundtrack by the same person who composed the soudtrack for Super Meat Boy.  There are over 20 tracks, many just to set a nice atmosphere for a given dungeon.  I personally still haven't gotten tired of the music, and I've played well over 100 hours of the game, another testament to how fun and addictive this game is!Graphics:The graphics have a nice, distinctive style, and are pretty good for a roguelike.  However, the gameplay is what makes Desktop Dungeons good, not the graphics.Conclusion:Desktop Dungeons is one of my favorite games, with nearly unlimited replayability and deep strategy.  Most of the negative reviews here focus on the difficult gameplay.  If you want a sense of about how difficult the normal-hard dungeons are here, check out the award-winning alpha version, which is available for free online.  Personally, I think that the difficulty is one of the best aspects of the game.  If you're like me, finally beating a difficult dungeon with a certain class or restriction, is an extremely rewarding experience.  But if you expect a path to beat the game without learning the strategy, you will be disappointed.  The game could be better at teaching you that strategy, but there are guides out there if you get stuck.			"

You can't just go about killing anyone you see in any order or you'll soon find out you'll be totally outmatched by the dungeon boss.

												This is quite possibly one of my favorite puzzle games of all time.   At first it seems rather simple - your goal is to take a level one character and find a way to kill the level 10 boss at the end of the map.  The challenge comes in how you do it - the amount of XP and healing items are limited, so every step counts.As you progress through the quests, (which are nothing more than fixed starting criteria) you'll unlock new items, characters, classes, and gods to help (or hurt) your progress through each map.If you're looking for a well-paced evolving challenge, I highly recommend this game.

												If you've ever enjoyed a good challenge, Desktop Dungeons has got it for you. The replayability you get from the cost of this game is ridiculous. There's always something new to try, three more ways to die. The best part is that unlike a lot of action games, your death is slow and painful through turnbased combat. Fun!			"

												This is quite possibly one of my favorite puzzle games of all time.   At first it seems rather simple - your goal is to take a level one character and find a way to kill the level 10 boss at the end of the map.  The challenge comes in how you do it - the amount of XP and healing items are limited, so every step counts.As you progress through the quests, (which are nothing more than fixed starting criteria) you'll unlock new items, characters, classes, and gods to help (or hurt) your progress through each map.If you're looking for a well-paced evolving challenge, I highly recommend this game.

												A challenging, but likable and quite complex rogue-like dungeon crawler with village building and quick missions well suited for coffee break activity.At first the dungeon quests seem simple enough, but after the tutorials they reveal their dastardly nature. You can't just go about killing anyone you see in any order or you'll soon find out you'll be totally outmatched by the dungeon boss. You must plan your advance and maximize your xp in a chess-like manner to even have a chance of winning. Frustrating at first, very rewarding when you get the handle of it.			"

												Overview:Though Desktop Dungeons does have a high learning curve, it is still an addictive and well-designed puzzle roguelike that will keep you coming back for more to defeat its nastier challenges.  As you defeat dungeons and complete challenges, your kingdom will grow, unlocking more races, gods, classes, and items to choose from or find in the dungeon.  The story might not be the best, but the writing is hilarious and should easily keep you entertained, on top of the deep and interesting gameplay.Gameplay:Like I said, everything is a resource, including gold, level-ups (they fully heal you, in addition to giving extra stats), items you don't use, and even exploration!  This is the source of the puzzle nature of the game, as maximizing the utility of your resources to defeat higher-level monsters is essential for defeating the harder difficulties.  Every dungeon has one or more level 10 bosses, who must be defeated to win.  These bosses are appropriately epic, sporting significantly higher stats than the other dungeon inhabitants, so much of the challenge comes from getting to the point where you can take them on.Desktop Dungeons includes a large variety of dungeons and challenges of varying difficulties that will keep you coming back for more.  In true roguelike spirit, all dungeons are randomized each time you attempt them.  While the normal dungeons may just feature a set of monsters and a level 10 boss, the hard and vicious dungeons all have their own gameplay gimmicks which make them feel unique, like separate challenges.  In addition to the standard dungeons, there are also a large number of challenges and puzzles to complete to improve your skills and unlock items.  I can't say I enjoyed the puzzles as much as the challenges and dungeons, but the puzzles are completely optional.As you complete those dungeons, you will obtain gold which can be used to improve your kingdom, unlocking new classes, races, and preparations for dungeons.  These preparations can be used to aid future dungeon runs in certain strategic ways.  For example, you can guarantee that you start with a fireball, a useful preparation for the sorcerer.  By doing so, however, you give up the ability to increase your stats through a different preparation.  These preparations provide a good amount of strategy to a run through carefully planning which ones you will need to defeat a certain dungeon.  They also cost gold, which can be daunting for new players.  However, preparations are never actually required to clear a dungeon, and one preparation even massively increases the gold that you receive from clearing a dungeon successfully.Music:Desktop Dungeons has a pretty good thematic soundtrack by the same person who composed the soudtrack for Super Meat Boy.  There are over 20 tracks, many just to set a nice atmosphere for a given dungeon.  I personally still haven't gotten tired of the music, and I've played well over 100 hours of the game, another testament to how fun and addictive this game is!Graphics:The graphics have a nice, distinctive style, and are pretty good for a roguelike.  However, the gameplay is what makes Desktop Dungeons good, not the graphics.Conclusion:Desktop Dungeons is one of my favorite games, with nearly unlimited replayability and deep strategy.  Most of the negative reviews here focus on the difficult gameplay.  If you want a sense of about how difficult the normal-hard dungeons are here, check out the award-winning alpha version, which is available for free online.  Personally, I think that the difficulty is one of the best aspects of the game.  If you're like me, finally beating a difficult dungeon with a certain class or restriction, is an extremely rewarding experience.  But if you expect a path to beat the game without learning the strategy, you will be disappointed.  The game could be better at teaching you that strategy, but there are guides out there if you get stuck.			"

												It's an addictive little game... I intended to play for maybe 20 minutes, just to get my feet wet, and now it's hours later.Desktop Dungeons is a combination dungeon crawl + city building game. The storyline is simple, but you're not here for the storyline; you're here to kill beasties. And there are beasties aplenty available. Each dungeon is randomly generated, so there should be nearly infinite replayability even when you reach the upper echelons of the game.Definitely recommend this as a time killer.			"

												This game is hard. Brutally hard and almost completely unforgiving of your mistakes. If you are looking for a nice little time wasting dungeon crawl, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a puzzle game that will push you to eke out every advantage from the resources you have available, then welcome to heaven. Succeeding in this game, as in any puzzle, absolutely requires an understanding of the rules and mechanics you are dealing with.  You wont lose to RNG here, you will lose because you made a mistake, and getting better at this game requires thinking about what you could have done differently after each loss.  "

												For some reason, i find this game HARD.Not sure if its because it is more a Puzzle game, than an RPG. (both names hold up though)basic dungeon crawling turn based grid RPG, where you try to become high enough level to defeat the boss on each quest.Each quest takes about 10 minutes or so to complete, so jump in and out play for the time deprived individual is valued.Roguelike, and city building to enhance your next playthroughs is how it is handled from quest to questit is quite a nice game, just more towards casual gamers i feel.

												Marginal thumbs down.  Desktop Dungeons is a decent rogue-like game with puzzle elements.  My main issue that it is a timesink.  It is alright that a game makes you die a lot, but this game give you nothing on death.  Even when you win, the player has to go through dozens of level just to unlock minor upgrades.  Worse, once upgraded, nothing much happens since the game adjusts to your leveling.I wish that the progession was less like a slog, since the gameplay hits a sweet spot.			"

												A simple yet amazing game. I mainly bought the game to allow me to relax from my day by playing a game for a few minutes and this expectation the game completely fulfills. Due to its challenging and random dungeons it is always fun to play it for 15 minutes to 30 minutes. I have also managed to be hooked on it for several hours as it does not get boring. Due to the random generated dungeons and upgradeable buildings you always have an aim and trying out new combinations of race and class is always interesting. I also really liked the mixture of strategy and luck, which makes this game unpredictable as well as mentally challenging. The puzzle levels which are also more or less randomly generated set very strategic stages, which you can spend easily a few hours on to crack one. The humour offered in this game is also a great comic relief. When you are close to a breakdown because you simply cannot beat the dungeon a funny fact about the monster is always a  welcoming change. Overall I totally recommend this game. The price of 12 pounds is absolutely acceptable as it is an easily replayable game, which I will certainly spend more hours on than I have already done.			"

												While ostensibly a roguelike RPG, each dungeon is basically one or two levels, so it's ideal for short gaming sessions. The main thing that makes this one interesting is that combat is basically deterministic; you can predict the outcome of each fight pretty accurately, you don't have to worry about getting screwed by the RNG at a critical point. The thing is, this may not sound like a big difference, but  it completely changes the flavor of the game. Instead of an RPG, it ends up being more of a puzzle game, where the objective is to figure out how to maximize XP gained and minimize the waste of health and mana, by deciding where  to go and what to fight next. Adds a sort of minesweeper aspect to the roguelike gameplay.			"

												I am at 15 hours played and still have not played every map, not even close. Not to speak of the huge amount of puzzles and challenges I have barely touched. The game has an achievement for 100h playtime, which I will probably get with normal playtime and without getting burned out on the game. You feel smarter after every beaten dungeon and after every little intended ""exploit"" in the mechanics you find. It gets harder really fast and it takes a while before you understand all of the games concepts and figure out how to play each of the countless classes. I still have not even unlocked all classes, maps and buildings in the game.You might think $15 is too much for how the game looks, but the content is worth it so much.			"

You're constantly unlocking new races, classes, dungeons, and items, which leads to TONS of replayability and variety.On top of that are tons of incredibly interesting mechanics - expolring Fog of War is how you regain health/mana, making it a critical resource, and how you manage your 6 inventory slots is crucial.Anyone who even remotely likes roguelikes should get this game - it's absolutely incredible.

												Rogue-Likes and Rouge-Like-Likes alike all tend to feel alike. Generally in these genres, you hack and slash your way to death with nothing left to really prove except for the knowledge that comes with drinking a suspicious looking potion and losing all your health to a single swig. You take these tips with a grain of salt as the variability to your death changes with each play-through...Although I use the term ""play-through"" lightly since you never actually get through some of the more hardcore rogue-likes without hours and hours of dedication to understanding the game's many quirks and traps. Desktop Dungeons feels like a solid blend of Rogue-Like and Puzzle with a welcome sense of progression as you earn gold and unlock new classes and races along the way. All of that mixed with the ability to spend 10-20 minutes on a single session is also entirely welcome. The puzzle-like aspect of the game is a great mix to the genre. Instead of spending your time focusing on surviving until your next death, you know exactly what you need to do: kill all of the enemies. The helpful levels that appear next to the enemy names allow you to expect what's coming whether its a victory or a disappointing failure. Rogue-Likes are always known for their randomized nature with their random levels and random encounters; Desktop Dungeons has these to an extent but when you're level 5 and you're about to swing your sword at a level 9, you know you're not making a sound decision. The screen also turns red when your next move is fatal, which helps quite a bit as well. The progression in the game also allows for a sense of accomplishment. No longer do you feel that sense of loss when you lose everything you worked so hard to get. Each ""dungeon"" is its own instance and if you know you're about to fail you can easily just retire and keep all your money (the items you acquire get sold for more money) which can then be spent on upgrading classes, races and even buying gear to aid you on the next quest you go on. Along with multiple locations, there's plenty of different quests and challenges you can attack. Each class has its own set of challenges that give you bonus money and there are also general challenges that give you more gold just by doing things like spending a certain amount of gold or piety during a quest. This game is certainly recommended if you enjoy the difficulty in Rogue-Likes but like to spend a casual amount of time slowly increasing your stats, or in this case, your kingdom.			"

												Desktop Dungeons draws inspiration from roguelikes, but is at its heart a giant math puzzle. In each match it is up to you to explore the dungeon carefully, attempting to defeat the strongest foes you can without dying because you get bonus xp for defeating monsters that are higher level than you. Each round starts you back at level 1 with your chosen race and class, and it is up to you to become strong enough to take on the boss of the dungeon without running out of health and dying first. It is a very addictive and fun game, and I completely finished the original version (a freeware game you can google up), unlocking every class and race. This version is a pretty massive update that adds a lot of new features, a new soundtrack by Danny B, the guy behind Super Meatboy's soundtrack, and a complete graphical overhaul.			"

												Best game ever. Think Dark Souls, with more capra.More seriously, Desktop Dungeons is essentially a math puzzle with a lot (emphasis on ""lot"") of mechanics interplaying, leading sometimes to awesome victories or terrible defeats. While dungeons run may be sometimes unsolvable -there is randomness in some aspects of the setup after all- achieving victory exploiting all the ressources available to you can be exhilarating. If you ever wondered what could happen if a developper had a neat puzzle idea and spent 3 years figuring out how to exploit each and every inches of its inginuity, instead of leaving that work to the players, this is what would happen. Word of warning : having Steam listing the game under ""casual"" reads like trolling. Expect to spend an hour per run once you hit the hard and vicious dungeons.I loved the freeware version, and cannot see me stopping playing the complete one anytime soon. If you love maths, this is the game for you!			"

												I came across this game while looking for more traditional roguelikes and thought I'd give it a chance. Let's just say the 'puzzle roguelike' is quite additctive. Several times now I have given up in a fit of vexxation after a fifth failed run only to come back a week or two later and dump an evening into it.It really does grab the stop-think-act protocol that make roguelikes so enjoybale....except this game takes it to a new level. And somehow it does this with each individual run being a small one level dungeon that you can play quite quickly - there is very little lost from each myriad death.Probably the best aspect is the slow unlocking of various races, classes and gear by completing quests and spending the loot from successful runs. Every day I play I might unlock a new class or find some nifty trinket in a dungeon that I shove into my 'locker' for future runs.  Each combination of race and class opens up a new way to look at leveling up and new strategies to kill the endboss.			"

												This is an absolutely great little game. The writing is cute and humorous, the music is fun and the gameplay itself is a combination of puzzle, mini-dungeon crawler and roguelike. It doesn't take itself too seriously but there is a lot of hidden depth in a seemingly simple idea. The addition of a daily dungeon and weekly reward gives more incentive to someone trying to build up their kingdom and there is always something to do.The final sets of main quests are incredibly challenging but it's so very satisfying to finish one of them. One last thing I'll say that I really like about the game is that, aside from making silly mistakes or a situation of bad luck (both will happen sometimes), death feels like a learning experience. You now know what *not* to do. And each little dungeon dive is a short trip so its great when you want to play something but don't have a lot of time.I have played this game a lot, not sure how long since I tend to leave DD up for hours while doing other things, come back, play a dungeon, and tab out again. I'd say 100 hours at the least, probably a lot more.			"

Be prepare to think, to calculate moves and bonuses, to forget about time spent in the game, all that with a factor of error bringing you to neglect your sleep time.Throw away your fancy next-gen GPU and go kill some goats.

												Stupendously fun game that is essentially a modern day Minesweeper infused with the most potent distillation of role playing mechanics!  You play the wise administrator to a budding town that is pestered by the hardships that accompany being located in the very center of a dense labyrinth of dungeons.  You must hire dungeon-invading heroes of unrestricted race/class combination, outfit them as you can afford and send them into harms way in service of the kingdom!Your first order of administrative business is recruiting a weakling, level one hero, because all of the powerful heroes retire immediately as just reward for surviving a dungeon.  This requires making decisions on which buildings to initially construct with your limited resources.  Your choices determine what race/class combinations you can choose to send into the nearby dungeons, and with what items or services you can furnish them.  Assuming your coffers can afford such bonuses.  Each building you construct provides its own set of bonuses and a unique item selection that can be upgraded.Actual dungeon gameplay consists of moving your chosen hero around a tile-based grid which is covered in the fog of war.  Under each square of fog exists either a monster (level 1-10), an item (or a place to purchase one), an altar dedicated to a specific god, a stat boost, some treasure, or a staircase to a sub-dungeon.  Sub-dungeons offer mini challenges with their own rewards, boost/items enhance your hero's stats or give them new abilities, gods alter your playstyle by forbidding certain actions while rewarding others, and monsters are what you will be primarily hunting for.Apart from scenarios and puzzles, your objective will always be to kill the boss monster, who is always level 10.  In order to slay such a beast you need to equip yourself, and gain levels by finding and eliminating all of the other monsters in the dungeon.  However, they fight back!  Monsters will NEVER initiate attack with you, but they will retaliate when you strike.  After each fight you will need to recoup by exploring the fog of war.  Each square revealed from the fog will replenish your health/mana, but also the health of any unpoisoned enemies.  Once the fog is gone, though, your only means of healing for additional fights are potions or appealing to your chosen god.  Fail to take out the boss before you've expended all of your available resources and you have to retire in shame, with the entire venture possibly a net loss after the cost of preparations.Both the meta-game of kingdom administration, and the individual dungeon dives are very enjoyable.  Spending your limited gold feels critically strategic and there are many possible strategies given the available combinations of race/class/equipment/deity which lead to some very satisfying combos.  Every dungeon is a challenge, and by the end of 10-20 minutes you may actually feel kind of attached to your valiant hero that you will never see again.My only real complaint with the game is that the puzzles are too difficult.  I played about eight of them and each one had a VERY specific solution that had to be performed EXACTLY with no substantial deviations in a chain that can be up to fifty actions in length!  One mistake at any point in that chain and you need to start over.  Some people may enjoy the mental gymnastics necessary to plot out every possible way your hero can move across the board, finding at which points to use which abilities/itemsY and finding the sole solution from a myriad of possibilities - but I didn't.  Thankfully, the puzzles are optional and if you skip them the only thing you'll miss out on is a relatively small sum of gold and some items you could just as easily unlock from doing any of the quests.  Had the game penalized me for not playing the puzzles it would have been a dealbreaker, but mercifully this is not the case.  Far more enjoyable than the puzzles are the scenarios in which you play a themed, semi-random dungeon that has an objective that may be something other than killing a boss.  Some of these scenarios feature unique classes specifically for the story, and can be humorous if you read the notes, signs and story. Also, the game uses a cloud sync independent of Steam which allows you to log into an account from any platform (including web) and continue playing!  Overall I'm very impressed with this game and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys casual role playing condensed into 20 minute play sessions, fans of Minesweeper or strategy, or anyone who enjoys mind-numbingly difficult puzzles!

												Made this purchase on a whim and so far I'm glad I did.  Initially, I wasn't really impressed with this game due to the fact that I'm normally a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥.  After playing a few rounds and getting my feet wet just a little, I'm finding this title very addictive and not wanting to put it down.  Reminds me of some older titles that I played way back in the day.  If you catch this at a low price, you're not going to go wrong with it!			"

It has a simple framework, but allows for a significant amount of complex, strategic gameplay.Give this game a try!  You won't be dissapointed.			"

												I remember being in awe of the game innovation. Your enemies are numbered between lvls 1-10. You start as a level 1 and have to fight them.Each one is worth xp, the higher the kill - the higher the xp.Weapons, spells and strategy are needed to eliminate them. Starts simple, develops complexity as you go.Your health and mana regenerate from exploring the darkness.You unlock new races, gods and classes with quests and gold.The game structure has solid early, mid and late game content.The difficulty ramps up as you go - the wikipage and forum have solid tips and guides.Graphics and movement are neat.Mouse and keyboard with shortcut keys.I have spent hundreds of hours playing Desktop Dungeons.It's definately worth playing!

												SHORT VERSION: Do you like highly-difficult thought-based games? If so, get this game.LONG VERSION: Despite the developer's claim that ""reviewers have trouble with genres"", the core genre is simple: At heart, Desktop Dungeons is a strategy game. Success requires careful management of limitted resources. There are plenty of RPG elements in the game, but RPGs are typically centered more on their story, which, lets face it, isn't exactly this game's strong point.Each dungeon has a simple goal: Defeat the boss(es). This is, of course, easier said than done.As mentioned, fulfilling that goal will require very careful management of your resources. Obvious resources are health and mana, but there's also item slots (you can only carry so much stuff), blankspace (exploring unexplored parts of the dungeon regenerates health and mana, but re-exploring already explored parts does not), conversion points (turn items into something else), levels and experience (levelling up fully restores health and mana, which is highly abusable), gold (for buying stuff!), and piety (too complex to explain here). In addition, your class (as well as many other factors) helps define just how efficiently you can use these resources. For example, wizards use less mana for the same bang, monks regen double health from blankspace, and fighters gain experience much faster. Mastery of the game will come from a thorough knowledge of its mechanics, intelligent use of resources, and at times, a bit of luck.It's worth mentioning that this game is HARD. The learning curve is very steep. While you are guided through the basics via tutorial, the rest of the mechanics will need to be figured out on your own. Do not expect to win every time. (However, also notably, this difficulty rarely stems from randomness issues; a highly skilled player should lose in only the worst random situations)This game is also humorous. In fact, it's rarely NOT humorous.			"

												If you remember Desktop Adventures from way back (I think there was an Indianna Jones one and maybe Star Wars one) this is very similar in concept. A rogue-like that takes about, on average, 10 or 15 minutes to play. The difference between this and most roguelikes is that you are not the character / adventurer. You're a town mayor, and you just guide adventurers to the nearby monster infested dungeons and have them bring back loot. Or die trying. Highly recommended. Really fun and quick game for people who are generally too busy to play games but still want a little something something every now and then. Also there is a web version and I believe you can tie it into the PC version for saves although I am not 100% sure of that and the steam verson may not tie to the web version's cloud save. I believe you can get a key to the web ver via the steam buy, pretty sure that's how I got this unless it was a bundle. Or something. Who knows. Game is a little steeply priced, so maybe wait and get it when the next Steam sale has it.			"

												I've made a terrible mistake.Desktop Dungeons is a great puzzle/roguelike thingy. Really more puzzle than roguelike.I won't  explain the mechanics, a there is a free, older version of the game you can try (I'll leave the googling to you) and if you like the premise the newer and improved version is really worth it.The mechanics are really simple and it only takes a few minutes to get the basics and start having fun.Then, you will suffer.This games gets very hard and very addicting, and it does so very fast. The simple mechanics show how deep and complex they actually are, and leave space to a cumulative expertise gained through a lot of horrible deaths.But as I said, it's addicting and fun and it will really have you coming back for more puzzling dungeoneering each time.

												I played this way back in it's alpha state.  Back then I thought it'd be worth the money.  I cannot even fathom how many hours I spent playing it those years ago.  This, is beautiful.  The music is wondrous, the 'storyline' aspect is amusing, humourous.  The gameplay is straight forward, some say it is hard and difficult.  My brother said ""F*** this game! It's harder than Dark Souls!""  I'd say, find an old copy of the alpha version, give it a shot if you want to decide whether to buy.  Definitely worth it to me.			"

												This game is perhaps me new favorite. The high difficulty is incredibly satisfying to overcome. Each class, race, and skill is interestingly different and fun to learn to use. The game is basically a puzzle game with entirely randomized elements. Solving each dungeon level is hard, fun, and satisfying and takes suprisingly little time. A good time killer game between doing other things. So so so many unlocks, so much content for a short game that could've been much less and still been good.			"

												This is an excellent puzzle game.  It's really a puzzle game more than it is anything else.   I'm going to recommend this game with on big caveat attached.  With all its frills, and new graphics, this version isn't all that much better than the FREE version currently available online. Actually the free version is much more pure and streamlined version of this game.  The original is even better in some ways.  All of the extra stuff in the steam version of this are mostly just bloat.  All the ""outside the dungeon"" town building interface is really poor compared to the version slick a brilliant puzzle game that you are trying to access from the town.  Also it takes quite a while to unlock everything.  I have nearly 30 hours clocked and still have not unlocked all 9 basic classes.  Having to run 2-6 dungeons just to get the 2000 gold for an unlock seems grindy and is something the original free version lacks.  So what is improved over the free version?  The graphics are greatly enhanced.  The Deity system is better handled although they are a bit too powerful in the sense that using the deities is often key to conquering higher end maps.   The biggest upgrade is the amount of new diversity added to the maps.  There are just more scenarios and variations applied in each new challenge.  If you enjoyed the original desktop dungeons, this one takes what was there and adds to variety 100 fold.  With puzzles, challenges, interesting bosses, 2ndary rooms, and much more. So yeah its good stuff, but I feel it's a little odd that some of the simple purity of the original gets a bit bogged down in some unnecessary bloat in its steam version.  And they should patch in reduced town upgrade prices.			"

												A bit clunky and buggy (Only runs natively at 800X600 though you can expand it, occasionally loses contact with my keyboard so hotkeys stop working) and still very similar to the free version of Desktop Dungeons, but still a really good game. Think of it more like a puzzle game than a dungeon crawler or a roguelike. Doing a ""Dungeon"" will take you around 5-10 minutes most likely and a large part of the enjoyment comes from the trickling in of new features and the feeling that you got away with something when you solve a tricky dungeon.Maybe a bit pricy, but good game.

The biggest upgrade is the amount of new diversity added to the maps.  There are just more scenarios and variations applied in each new challenge.  If you enjoyed the original desktop dungeons, this one takes what was there and adds to variety 100 fold.  With puzzles, challenges, interesting bosses, 2ndary rooms, and much more. So yeah its good stuff, but I feel it's a little odd that some of the simple purity of the original gets a bit bogged down in some unnecessary bloat in its steam version.  And they should patch in reduced town upgrade prices.			"

												What a fantastic game, I don't see myself getting bored with this any time soon.The gameplay is truly excellent, a puzzle game at its core.Numerous classes and races requiring totally new approaches keeps the game continually fresh.Great variety of spells, items, monsters, and special dungeon areas add to the depth and intrigue.Some of the challenge levels are like brain teasers, I am loving the difficulty.The typical levels aren't so bad, but still require considerable thought.This game lends itself well to short sessions if needed.The price isn't cheap, but for fans of roguelikes it's so worth it.Throw it on your wish list and buy it when it's cheap.This game is about a billion times better than ""knights of pen and paper +1""			"

												Well, I tried the Alpha version at their website when trying to decide if I was buying it and i got stucked with it for hours. Then I buy the game and it's so freaking better. All that you expect from a roguelike game with fun and beautiful graphics, complex dungeons that will make you think a lot on how to proceed many different classes and races and a fantastic way to improve your city. And it has goats! If you love roguelikes, don't doubt and get it! :D			"

												Boardgamers, this one's for you! Have you ever gotten murdered on turn two in Dungeonquest? You have a level three monster at rank one in the dungeon in Thunderstone Advance and you draw four regulars and two torches and realize that going to the dungeon is folly and remaining in the Village means that big nasty is going to raid? Welcome to Desktop Dungeons!  It seems to me at least that the developers of this game were at least partly inspired by these two punishing but eminently fun boardgames. A few reviews here with 90 plus hours have rated it a thumbs down and mostly because of the random difficulty. But intrepid adventurers, these poor folk just don't have the wisdom to understand that a large part of the charm is retelling/rethinking about the hilarious ways you got your face punched.How can you NOT love a game in which you have to defend your fledgling kingdom's petting zoo! And let's face it, killing a banker is at least a metaphorical high. [Official disclaimer: I do not advocate the actual killing of non-pixel bankers].There are fun references to Lord of the Rings, Super Meat Boy [copyright infringement: likely as it states in the game], Monty Python, and who knows what else!If you are looking for a grimdark ""serious"" dungeon crawler then look elsewhere. But, if you love the feeling of overcoming the dreaded bankers, goats, and other nefarious creatures and can accept that most of the time you will get pwned and can laugh about it, get this game!

												TLDR: This is not really a dungeon-crawler... it's an RPG MATHS PUZZLE GAMEI realised the following things when I started unlocking their 'puzzles' which are basically advanced tutorials that don't do any hand holding.Everyone keeps going on about how awesome this game is, I like it too, but it's not what' you would normally expect froma  dungeon crawler, please let me explain.... forewarned is forearmed....1st, This is not really a dungeon-crawler... it's a PUZZLE GAME It uses a lot of maths type puzzles - you need to figure out how many minions to kill so that you can level up, and how to do it efficiently... killing higher level baddies gains you an exp bonus, but you need to do it as much as possible so you don't lose XP from minions that are now ""lower""... you need to snowball your XP. Levelling up gives you 100%health and mana, and you have to exploit this all game so that you don't use too many potions.... you'll need them for the boss in the level.2nd, because it's only 10 minutes, things have to be simplified. You move around on a checkerboard style tabletop. revealing a tile (standing next to it = gaining visibility of the next tile) will restore some health and mana.3rd, this is not a 10 minute game. You can play a dungeon in 10 minutes, sure, so you can play in 10 minute sessions, this can be a positive... but ""just one more, it's only 10 minutes"" will quickly translate into hours of game play.4th This is a Rogue LITE - it does have a progression system where you can unlock new classes, abilities, etc between runs, in a similar way to Rogue Legacy. [A true rogue-like features permadeath where you lose everything and start again at level 1.]For those that like this game, it's addictive. Look at people's play times, the ones that have reviewed this. there are some who have 15-30h, then there are those with 80-120 hours, and the odd one over 200h - that's about the point where you beat the game, from my understanding / reading on the wiki.Do I recommend this game? That's such a hard one. Yes, If you know what you're getting into when you buy it, but the Store description is deceptive, and doesn't really explain just how this game works, and I was dissapointed about that, I wanted more 'hack n slash', and less 'calculating the next 7 steps to level up without using that mana pot' So for me, Although the game itself seems solid, I do like it, and I will play it some more, but I already know I won't clock it if it requires 200h it's a No. "

												While Desktop Dungeons appears to be a rogue-like, it doesn't fit my definition. The dungeons aren't randomly generated which makes it much more linear and predictable. If this is what you're looking for - more of a fantasy combat  puzzle game - look into it. The price at $15 is a bit on the high end.			"

												I love Desktop Dungeons. I've gotten pretty far in the game (129 hours) and now clearing a level is a rare thing and usually comes down to a single hit, with nothing left, on the last boss. Each move takes a little thought, with efficiency being foremost in mind. The randomness of glyphs, shop contents, and sometimes even who the bosses are add a level of depth and replayability most games can't touch.Easily one of my favorites.			"

												This game is HARD, harder then Darksouls, It's like someone merged 3 player chess into an RPG, there's literally no flexability, what i mean is that there is only ONE way to complete each dungeon, there are no alternative way's, if you spend to much health here, unknowling you've just wasted the past 20minutes by th time you reach the boss, there's no alternate options, and the early game choice's to make may seem hard at first, but then everytime you unlock something new, something stronger and you think the game just might get easier, it doesn't. This game is just f-you-c-k-!-n-g sh!t. Luckily someone sent this to me as a gift, i'm so glad i never payed for it, games like these need to have player flexibity, this game is just a thinktank do what the developer did or die and get F-you-c-k-e-d			"

												As an enormous fan of everything to do with roguelike games I was wary of this title for a long time. Other roguelike fans loved it, but it's not really a roguelike game, or is it? It is turn-based and grid based and top-down view but the monsters don't chase after you- you can fight them whenever you want when you have discovered them. Also the combat is deterministic not random, and the result is shown to you in advance! You'd think this would make it easy but it's not the case.Rather than listen to me waffle on, trying to describe how it works, you should watch a gameplay video of it and try the alpha version which is free. This is really a very good game and you shouldn't miss it if you think even slightly that it might be your sort of thing.			"

												While the game makes you think there's a good deal of variety in approaches (what with multiple races and classes), it all really boils down to figuring out how those races and classes make the most of the same hit-and-run tactics.  Ultimately, I wanted to give it more of a chance, but I felt like I was locked into a style of gameplay that I didn't enjoy, and that has ruined the experience for me.			"

												Desktop Dungeons is a rogue-like miniature RPG unlike anything else that could fit that description.  The game advertises that it operates primarily in 10-15 minute instances, which is appropriate, but not necessarily accurate, as the serious player will quickly discover that you will be well rewarded in later levels by careful consideration and chess-like strategizing.  The aim in each dungeon instance is to clear out the dungeon boss by leveling up, acquiring items, and making use of every possible resource at your disposal (including the unexplored areas of the dungeon: every new tile revealed restores health and mana) - which is deceptively easy in earlier stages, but will prove frustratingly difficult in later levels.  Think of it as much as a strategy/puzzle game as an RPG - and an excellent, if unorthodox, example of all these genres.  If you're on the fence try the alpha - available free at the developer's website - for a taste of what the game offers: the full release is both more accessible at first and more difficult at last, while providing more control over your circumstances at every step of the way.  Whether you are a casual gamer looking for a new fix, a hardcore gamer seeking new challenges of your wit and will, or simply a conoisseur of the quirky - I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												Desktop Dungeons is a puzzle game that takes elements from rogue and condenses it to a single screen experience. You pick a class, buy some starting items and venture forth into a randomly generated dungeon. Your ""hero"" always starts at level 1 and you have to find a way to make the best use of experience boosts, glyphs, items and gold to beat the boss (or bosses) of the level. If you're successful you bring back treasures that will help improve your kingdom and allow you to discover new dungeons and monsters.The goal is to use your resources to beat higher level monsters and get the experience boost you need to level up high enough to strike the boss. Uncovered tiles regenerate you and your foes, so waste as little as possible. Keep weak monsters around to strategically level up mid-fight and gain a full heal. There are lots of strategies and once you master them you can tackle any dungeon with any class. The mechanics are very deep and the advanced dungeons can take you one or two hours to beat them. Some later dungeons also abandon the idea of a single screen map and will offer two or more screens to play with, or challenge you with shifting walls. There's even a minotaur that chases you.I've been playing the game since beta and there's still more content for me to uncover. The newly added daily challenges adds new motivation to keep playing the game and the absolutely fantastic soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky has been a steady part of my music playlist since release. If you like puzzles and you like strategical fights then this game is a must buy.			"

												Had my eye on this one for awhile. I picked it up on the 2014 Holiday Steam Sale for 50% off (~$8 USD). I've been very satisfied with it and was a little gem among a lot of games that I picked up last year.Pros:+ solid tutorial+ fun and funny mini-questing/story line+ good aesthetics+ varied soundtrack with good music+ kingdom upgrade system adds meaning/progression+ challenging+ procedural generation = big replay value+ high satisfaction level when solving troublesome dungeons+ tons of gameplay/replay value+ great value on sale, good value for most at full price+ uniqueCons (not many so I am grasping at straws)- Not as casual of a game as advertised (you need a strong knowledge of the interactions between abilities/effects/statuses etc.)- Could have high frustration level for some- Perhaps too much puzzle and not enough dungeon crawler- Aesthetics may be confused with graphics making it undesirable tosome (yes, this game has bad graphics, but good aesthetics)I’d definitely recommend it if you like to think, strategize, and take your time to make a move in games. Great for people on the go, but perhaps I’m a bit slow/dumb, because the puzzles take me longer than 15 mins usually. "

												A deceivably challenging and difficult game to master under the guise of very simple gameplay and cutesy aesthetics. Do not let the way the game looks like deceive you, it's much more challenging than you'd think with its many challenges and quests holding many strong creatures, and even stronger bosses. This is a not a game for casual playing; while it does not require quick reflexes to win, it instead falls back on good ol' strategic thinking. Desktop Dungeons is unique in most ways, all of them good, and I highly reccommend any players who enjoy using their brain in many, many, many RPG combat situations.			"

												Nice puzzle game, in dungeon crawler RPG form. You start each dungeon at level 1, and the goal is to power up enough to kill the boss. But you have limited resources. You only heal by exploring unexplored tiles or leveling up (or chugging potions), and you only level up by killing things (which usually depletes health and/or mana). And monsters and items don't respawn or anything like that. So you have to be smart about how you go about killing things, and in what order, and so on.You can also unlock new classes and starter items and such to take into the various dungeons, and there are special challenge dungeons, and some tightly calibrated puzzle levels. It's pretty engaging overall. Made me late to class because I lost track of time.Also the music in the dungeons is pretty great. And the tutorial system is extremely well done. It throws you right into a dungeon that's designed to teach you how to play as you go, without any explicit instructions. And then once you complete it (or, I bet, if you die), it gives you the option to continue on to the rest of the game or to go into some actual hand-holding tutorial levels with explicit instruction.

												Initial Impression (1st day, 4/27/15): Very fun and addicting.  I read a massive amount of reviews before purchasing this game on a 50% off sale ($7.50), and the impression was difficult puzzle game.  This game was exactly what I expected and more (See playthru EP01 thru EP10 my first day).   8/10I'll be updating this review as I play.  So, reserving the right to change it :)I'm currently doing a playthru here:

												A really simple puzzle game that is really, really hard.Addicting and honestly a bit frustrating, but other than that there's really nothing to say other than if it looks interesting to you then take the dive- you won't be disappointed.But go into it expecting a puzzle game, not a roguelike. The ""levels"" are randomly generated and I suppose it plays like a roguelike, but don't be tricked- the way the game plays is definitely closer to being a puzzle/math game than swashbuckling around dungeons.8.5/10			"

												I've completely beaten the original Desktop Dungeons, which is a wonderful, wonderful free game. This new version is a complete b4stardization of the original.In the original, I could unlock new characters and races by completing certain challenges. Simple and clean.In this version, I have to purchase upgrades scattered across various parts of the town map and play levels over and over again to collect gold to unlock things. It's as tedious as playing a pay to win game with in-app purchases. Instead of being a puzzle/rouge-like game, it's now a repetitive RPG. The challenges are easy if I keep playing the same boring levels over and over again for gold. On the other hand, if I don't use gold, they're unfairly difficult. It's also lot more luck than the original game.What was a perfectly good game is now destroyed.			"

												An intresting mix of kingdom management sim, turn based strategy and RPG, Desktop Dungeons is a fun diversion. Designed around the concept of bite-sized game play, you can spend as little as a few minutes a day to hours if you wished. I have only one complaint and that is the whole cloud sync set up. Most steam games that offer cloud save support, bam, it's done, there's nothing you need to do about it. This game makes the entire process complicated and even after jumping through all of their hoops, still wouldn't work right. Give me a break.			"

												I've played this game on and off over the past 4-5 years since it was free on their website and I've loved every bit of it. It has a lot of wit, and is a great puzzle game if you love brutally dificult games. It's very involved and has a lot of elements that play many different roles which can make the game complicated, but all of the levels have a sort of ""easy win""...you just have to find it.Great for something to do for 10 minutes, to all day, depending on how much time you want to invest. you can pick it up and drop it at any time you want and it will feel like you never left even after years of not touching it.

												This review is mostly for people unfamiliar with Desktop Dungeons. If you played the free alpha, then you already know whether you like the game; this new version features many improvements, but it's still the same type of gameplay.Anyway, the second video (with the gnome wizard runthrough) does a decent job of showcasing game mechanics. Your goal is to explore a randomly-generated dungeon and ultimately to defeat a high-level boss monster. To beat the boss, you'll need to have leveled efficiently. This (usually) includes killing the highest-level monster that you can at any given time, since you get bonus XP for killing a monster whose level is higher than your own. That's pretty much the core of what makes Desktop Dungeons interesting: you're always trying to beat a tougher monster. The way you do this varies tremendously; there's a long list of things that can help or hurt you, and you have to deal with whichever ones happen to be in the dungeon you're exploring. It's this variation that keeps the game interesting hours later.Bottom line: I don't often write reviews. I like Desktop Dungeons enough that I felt I should take the time. I highly recommend this game.			"

												This game is way too hard. I'm a big fan of difficult games and tend to crank difficulty up to the max on most any game I play. I like ""painful"" games like Dark Souls. However... the difficulty in this game is just too high. It is heavily reliant on luck, and so when you lose you'll *know* you might have made it had you only been a tiny bit luckier. The ""Kingdom Building"" aspect sounds good but quickly becomes dull when you hit a wall with the difficulty and have to just keep playing the same levels over and over until you get lucky enough to win.

												Beware this is in no way a Rogue Like. They flat out lie about that.This is just a puzzle game.Cons.1. Game will trap you even if you play perfectly. Bad for a puzzle game.2. Game is UGLY, with almost no animations.3. Looks and plays like a tablet game.4. Bugs in UI keep sticking things that cover up a large part of play space.5. Bugs cause spells to not do the damage they claim, causing you to have to guess and then lose games.6. Uses undiscovered spaces as the main resource... and then randomly dumps mobs making you search most of the map to find mobs you can use to level up... which uses up all of your resources.TLDR, game is hard just to be hard. If you could win every map with perfect skill then it would be hard to be fun.ProsFrankly I cant think of any. The game has it's fans but I have no idea why.			"

At the momeny it's asking me to build a wizards tower but I  can't as I don't have enough gold.The only solution to this is to throw away hours of play time and delete my kingdom! Absolutely unaccepable!It's a real shame as I loved the free version of this and actually had it pre-ordered. Do not waste your money on this mess.			"

												EDIT (after another 100 - literally - hours.)Balance in gameplay is often a overlooked thing. Personally, i find the balancing (especially in RPG´s) to be the most important thing. The Final Fantasy Series (especially 8, X-2, XII) is AWFUL RPG´s, because they are so unbalanced. There is always broken mechanics.But this game. Everything is perfectly balanced. There is a solution for everything. Things that appear useless at first sight (like the glowing guardian) turns out to be immensely powerful when you learn how to use it.And then the final level. Dark Souls... i long thought this was impossible to beat. And i´m a pretty hardcore guy. I must have tried over 30 times... then i started discussing different strategies. Even then, i must have lost 20-25 times... but in the end. It was actually possible.How great of a balance aint that? At first glance, you´re like no way... but then, bit by bit... you understand that it is possible.I have over 130 hours of gameplay in this game. The amount of replay value, and the amount of game you get for the price... is absolutely mind boggling. This game has taken over my life more than any game before. Monster Hunter G. Dark Souls. Meat Boy. Ninja Gaiden. Pokemon. I have mastered them all... but none have absorbed me, and offered me so much joy as this game. Hats of to the developers. And thanks for everything. I love you,                                                A perfect game. I´ve heard some people think the price is to steep... they couldn´t be more wrong. This might be one of the most priceworthy games i´ve ever purchased. Damn it... i have already clocked 47 hours and i can´t stop playing. I need to be working on my thesis, but instead i´m playing this!In all seriousness though, for 13bucks, this is an AMAZING game. It´s so challening, but always fair. It´s incredible well balanced, the music is mesmerezing... the upgrades mechanics addictive. And the gameplay itself is really unlike anything i´ve seen before.Amazing game. 10/10. I haven´t had this much fun with a title since Dark Souls.(The end game is so interesting also... because you have to careful manage your economy)Perfect game.			"

												Like most adults who work for a living, I have very hard limits on what I am willing to spend on particular items. Take a bottle of wine, for example: I've found that there is no difference between a ten dollar bottle of wine and a thirty dollar bottle of wine. Anybody that tells you otherwise is trying to impress you. With wine, you get very little return on your investment past the 15-20 dollar price point. There's a reason that many sommeliers refuse to do blind tastings, and that reason being that sommeliers have all agreed to subscribe to the same groupthink that says X vintage and Y grapes grown in Z reason are superior, and none of this information would be available to them if they were prevented from looking at the label on the bottle. Have you ever met anyone who's a certified ""master sommelier""? They're truly insufferable people. The next time you meet one ask them a question about wine - any question, it doesn't matter how dumb, will send them into a desperate panic while they fumble to form an opinion, any opinion, about the matter in question. It doesn't matter what their answer is becuase they will be certain to couch it in arcane wine terms like ""tannins"" and ""finish"" and other completely subjective abstract concepts that you won't understand.Desktop Dungeons is like an overpriced bottle of wine. Sure, the label is fancy and the guy trying to sell it to you is telling you about how great it is, using words like ""replayability"" and other nonsense, but as soon as you taste it you realize ""hey, this tastes just like a $5 iphone game?""Just look at the screenshots. There's a reason that they only expect you to play this in ten minute bursts. $15 is just way, way, too much.			"

Posted: December 14, 2014
												Let me start by saying I have nothing against the concept of blending genres. It can work and if done properly it can create a game far greater than the sum of its parts. Desktop Dungeons, a game which attempts to combine a rogue-like dungeon crawl with a puzzle game, could definitely have worked, if only the elements it chose to borrow from those two genres were actually compatible with each other.Allow me to explain by way of example. As part of the puzzle aspect of the game, your hero only regenerates health and mana when exploring new areas, not when backtracking over old areas. Blind exploration is dicouraged, as doing so at full health means wasting precious healing. This forces you to think about where you want to go next instead of just going out willy nilly. I know it sounds like I'm praising the game and the truth is it could have been a good gameplay mechanic......IF you had any way of actually KNOWING where you should go next.Unexplored areas are always completely blacked out, and since the dungeons are randomly layed out every time you have no way of knowing where you should go next. The fighter class mitigates this somewhat by automatically revealing the location of enemies that are your level or lower, but that hardly helps out the OTHER classes and even with this, you still have no way of knowing where to find valuable power-ups, equippable items, or spells.The whole game is like that. In fact the greatest challenge in this game is not any enemy, but the game's own vague rules. I talked about this a little in my review of Windforge but it's even more true here: we really, really need to be given accurate, real information for a game like this to work.For example, there's a speed stat that determines who attacks first in combat, but you can't actually see what your speed stat is. You can see that some enemies have first strike, but even enemies that don't have first strike and which you would expect to go after you in the combat order - like warlocks and zombies - can often end up going first... sometimes. Other times they go second, and since you can't actually see your speed stat or the enemy's the whole thing just comes across as arbitrary.And that's why this game fails on both fronts. The puzzle aspects are too strictly demanding and the punishment for even one single misstep is too harsh, so the game fails as a rogue-like. At the same time, the rogue-like aspects add too much randomness and too much hidden information, so the game fails as a puzzle.The worst part is the game has no idea. It demands care, but then forces you to go out blindly, and then punishes you harshly for doing so. It tells you it's all your fault when you fail (and you will) with condescending messages and taunts, but really it's no one's fault because everything is entirely luck-based.Like I said, the idea of combining a rogue-like and a puzzle game is not entirely terrible. It could have worked, it just didn't in this case. Maybe some other game will come along and get it right. But this one ain't it.My Rating: [2] BADRead my original review here.[knightlyreviews.blogspot.com] "

												The game is relatively simple after you learn the strategy for each class. The dungeons aren't varied enough on their own to encourage replayability. The free version on the game maker's website lacks the unnecessary story and is more fun to play because of it. Ultimately the game is uneventful and bland. It's worth playing for maybe 30 minutes to an hour, any more than that is just repetitive.			"

												First time writing a review, but this game deserves it. Very engaging and can be tricky right from the start. The premise is simple, its a puzzle game that brings the rogue-like to its simplest level. It then expands upwards with a great deal of complexity to make a completely different game. If you get stuck early on, don't despair. Take a look at the beginners guide on its wiki site and you should be on your way.If you are a numbers guy/girl, you will love this game.			"

												I was skeptical but bought it anyway as I'm having to spend a lot of time off my feet at the moment, damn am I happy I went with it though!In short, for the Too Long Didn't Read, it's purely a strategy game and not for the faint hearted. For those who like a brainy challenge however this game is a must, it combines many elements of strategy with a tidy interface and no dithering about. It allows and even encourages you to plan far in advance and won't interfere with these plans - as a result however when it gets hard it really doesn't mess about.It takes a few games to get your head around it but it's very simple to pick up. The outcome of every move is predicted and even an entire fight is easy to plan beforehand with little indicators showing how many attacks it will take with the selected move to take down your opponent and how many he will need to take down you. In this way you can easily see for example that you each need three attacks so if you attack twice and then use a GETINDERE glyph to ensure your attack lands first you will win the encounter.It has found an interesting balance for exploring a dungeon. On one hand you want to find new glyphs and stat boosts but health and mana is regained by exploring so ideally you need to utilise that first, but otherwise it is not punished.Monsters only ever retaliate so braving the unknown is at practically zero risk. Just as long as you set right click to attack to avoid inadvertently killing yourself against a higher level monster.If I were to have any gripes it's the lack of direction the game gives you. Not so much the Minecraft sense in ""here's a world go amuse yourself"" but more in that it gives you TOO much to do. I currently have about 15 quests, several requiring multiple dungeon runs to complete. Completing one will often generate two more. But monetary rewards are good incentive to upgrade your kingdom to provide more options for starting a dungeon.Overall it's a beautiful game, a true challenge but not in the ""haha I instakilled you now do the last half hour again"" way. More like an elaborate chess game with increasingly complex challenges.			"

												This is a trully awesome game. But it requires a good mathematical and logical skills to be successful and actually have a fun.You HAVE to calculate your and enemy's damages, define which enemy you will just kill and which ones will be turned into stone to get XP bonus for the next victim.You should definetely finish ALL Tutorials, Puzzles and Starter Pack to see main nuances of this game. Otherwise you will be frustrated why you can't defeat the very first dungeons. Puzzles and Starter Pack will be available since you get a tavern into your Kingdom.Игра очень интересна. Это по сути сборник паззлов и задач.Игра требует определенных математических и логических навыков, поскольку требуется прикидывать сможет ли герой убить данного врага или нет и стот это вообще делать сейчас или вообще.Также абсолютно необходимо проходить Туториалы и сборники Задач. Последние находятся в таверне и доступны с момента ее постройки. Без их прохождения вы не узнаете ньюансы использования глифов, местности и данного класса\рассы героя. Что в свою очередь приведет к невозможности пройти подземелье и как результат - разочарование в игре.			"

												This is quite possibly my favorite rogue-like OR puzzle game. The amount of choices you can make and how those choices affect your chance of success is truly awe-inspiring. As you traverse the game, you can see yourself improving as well as your character classes improving. In order to keep a challenge, they introduce new more difficult enemies as you reach new milestones. It is the kind of game you can lose hundreds of hours in (I know I have probably sank almost 150-200 hours into this one.) I have been playing this game for so long, and I am still not very far. I am just now starting to get to ""hard"" dungeons, so there is an incredible amount of replayability there.I've been playing this game since it was in its alpha form, back in 2011, and every now and then I still come back to sink in another 10-20 hours (not all at once). To me, it is the Skyrim of rogue-likes/puzzle games.			"

Presents a thoughtful game system, gives you a dozen or so character classes that each surgically break the game system in their own special way, and asks you to exploit the breakage to complete difficult challenges.I love it to death, and you should too.

												A very challenging puzzle, rogue-like, random generated, I-don't-even-know-what bundle of fun. Games are (theoretically) 10-20 minute dungeon crawls, and it's a real blast. Great if you like games like FTL or Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup and have a low-fi computer. (It even runs on my netbook!)			"

												Rogue-like dungeon crawler. Turn based fun. Surprisingly deep gameplay for what looks like a simple game. Each dungeon is only around 10 minutes long, so you don't have to sit there and grind all day long. At this point, I only have ~1 hour into it, but that is probably the equivalent of 5 different dungeon runs. The authors also have an excellent sense of humor, and clearly don't take themselves too seriously, which I like :)			"

												Great Rogue/Puzzle adventure!More Puzzle than roguelike but attention to detail at it's finest.  Mash strat, stat and items to overcome evil all the while managing your health, mana and survival.  Begins easy but comes on strong and really gives you that 'Atta Boy' feeling when you've completed a new level.  Many ingame achievements such as winning without use of healing or mana pots, using only physical or magical damage, won the round with each of the various classes, etc.I keeps you going that's for sure but the difficulty ramps up the farther you go and unlocking new classes, abilities and powers for your Mage, Thief, Fighter and Priest (to start) which should hold most of the 'genre' to a good long while.I had played the free version for awhile prior to the purchase of the retail so I'm hoping to get more time in it amongst the other dozen or so of things I need to get back too (lol, gamer ADD am right?!) but it's nice to play a round at lunch or while on an important conference call for work (note, please do not impact your work productivity on a game; that's foolish.. OR IS IT?) Regardless, love the idea, design and playability on this one and I hope you do too!~Icky "

												I have been playing this on a Linux Ubuntu 14.04 laptop plugged into the big living room TV.  It goes full screen no problem but the graphics are in 4:3 so it has the black borders on the side.  Some say the game has bad graphics and I am not sure why.  I have seen games with way more pixelation where everyone is talking about how great it is.  To me what matters is, are the graphics pleasing to look at? With this game, I say yes.  It has a nice overall look.It took me awhile to warm up to this, but I love this game.  It is a great turn based strategy gem.  It appears to be a RPG dungeon crawl but it is not.  Dungeons are solitary one floor puzzles.  Each time you start with a level one dude. The money  you earn lets you upgrade your town which gives you more dudes and starting buffs to choose from.  So it is RPG-ish but not much.  It is pretty challenging but totally doable.  Highly recommended.			"

												Simple in concept and easy to pick up (even for a 15 min break), but this game offers perhaps the most depth and challenge of any I've seen (and that's saying something!). Requires exceptional calculation and improvisation - a unique and challenging blend that may not be for those faint of heart. You will die - LOTS. But, if you're looking to test your limits in a puzzle-like dungeon crawl, you can't go wrong with Desktop Dungeons!I played the free version of this before picking this up on steam. While very similar in style, this offers a much better campaign, better learning curve, even greater challenges, awards, versatility, polish and so much more.Highly recommended for anyone with masochistic tendancies.

												I've been following this game since it was freeware and loving it all the way!  The game presents a very interesting take on rougelike / RPGs by adding unique leveling, healing, and skill elements which turn it in to a hybrid puzzle game.  The latest verison includes a lot of advancement and unique classes, skills, and upgrades.  It's certainly worth the pricetag just to explore it's unique take on the genre.  My only gripe with it is the graphical scaling; it just doesn't look as good as it should on higher resolution screens.			"

This is the kind of game you can shelf for a while and come back to play it for 10 - 30 mins and then shelf again.  The gameplay gets more complex the further you get, to the point that some dungeons might seem impossible to complete, but with the right items, god worship, and stratergy you can beat it. It is definitely isn't your typical rogue-like, but if you enjoy unique puzzles, don't mind a game that's a challenge, or love goats, then buy this game.  It is well worth the price.			"

												A while ago I played a lot of the earlier, lighter, version of Desktop Dungeons, and had a lot of fun doing so, but even playing that didn't prepare me for the fantastic game that DD has become with hard work and polish.Its essentially a rogue-like puzzler, with an overworld progression that doesn't get reset when you die, but you do have to replay the dungeon you were in when you succumbed to evil.Pace is very good, the game makes sure that you don't end up in an unwinnable situation unless you really, really try hard, and if you do, there's plenty of sidequest you can fall back on, and improve your town and unlock new items, races and classes to improve your chances.Theres even hand-crafted puzzles, that beside being fun and really challenging, teaches you advanced tricks and tips, which you can then use on your next quest into the dungeons around your settlement.Classes and races are varied and play very differently, and the quests are different enough that there aren't just one uber combination thats going to win every dungeon for you.Dungeon runs take somewhere around 15-20 minutes, some faster, some slower, but the game can be played at exactly the pace you like.Highly recommended!

Enter mini-dungeons to complete quests, unlock more classes, build up your town, gather new equipment, find new dungeons, strategize your efforts... and of course... die a lot!

												I've lost count of how many times I've told myself ""That's impossible"" playing this game. I've also lost count of how many times I've proven myself wrong. Desktop dungeons is an amazing puzzle/strategy game disguising itself as a dungeon crawler. It's a game for people who enjoy figuring out the minutia of the game's mechanics and using them to squeeze every little extra bonus you can out. As many other reviews have pointed out, it's a great distraction for over a lunch break or when you generally need to kill about 10-15 minutes. The semi-random nature of the dungeons can lead to some runs that are genuinely impossible, but I've rarely felt cheated by it because of the small time investment. Nearly 150 hours in, and having cleared over 90% of the game, and I can still say that there's still plenty of ""that's impossible"" left in this game.			"

Too many options and choices and you'd better hope you pick the right ones.Also becareful using he altars!!  I was geared up and poised to take down the boss, drank a mana potion and WHAM, diety stripped me of all my gear... so much work for nothing. "

												If you liked the original, you'll definitely like this one as well! Like the original, you need to complete dungeons in order to unlock new classes and races. More or less the same story here, but there are a lot more possibilities and I think also more control over what to unlock first. This is a great game to play over a short break. (Though some of the dungeons may take a while.)It is on special at the time of this reveiw. If it's on special, definitely definitely get it! If not, still get it.			"

												This is a brilliant game to play for a half hour before work, as a warmup to a more mentally challenging game, or to binge play for 10 hours with a 2 litre botttle of coke and a tub of celebrations. its got a good sense of humour and decent power balancing. I bought full price and would do so again, its a bargain if its on sale!!			"

												Desktop Dungeons is a good game for what it is. I played free variant for a long time, before picking up this  release.The released version adds more of everything, more monsters, spells, classes, quests, rewards ...This version also has upgraded graphic, making everything more charming.Game play is turn based, with monster being stationary (some bosses have blink spell, that moves them unless you counter it.). At the beginning dungeon has fog of war. You reveal parts of dungeon by moving to adjacent square. You want to be carefull how much of a dungeon you reveal, since each square you reveal, recovers some of you health and mana. This is the main way you will recover health and mana. This means that exploring too much too early can leave you unable to heal, later on. On the other hand each square you reveal can have beneficial items, that you might want. This makes unrevealed tiles in dungeon weary important resource.This is a quick game. Once you get used to controls and basic concepts, you can easily complete a dungeon/quest in 5 min. If it will take you longer it will be because you spend time thinking of best move.Game is also paced quite well, so at the beginning you only have access to one class and one race (human fighter.), but you quickly unlock more.With all that said, it is important to remember that this game is a filler game. It's meant to be played in short sessions.If you play it for hours, you will quickly become bored. But playing couple of dungeons every day, while waiting for whatever bigger game you are currently playing to patch itself, it is time well spent.			"

												I cannot recommend this game at this time.  It is -not- pick up and play as mentioned on the page, and dungeons can not be finished in 5-10 minutes unless you are an expert at the game and know all the strategies.  The fact I had to reference a strategy guide during the tutorials repeatedly was a big warning sign.As it stands I've barely made it past getting the banker, and I've spent the last four hours trying and failing to finish any dungeon at all.  The game is beyond difficult.  If you aren't willing to sit down and do some number crunching and brain math, don't waste your time.  This is not a casual, low-input game you can fluff through.  I'm going to try sticking it out a bit, see if maybe something clicks and the game gets easier, but it's getting lower and lower on my priority list and will probably end up in my 'waste of time and money' list.It's a shame, because I enjoyed the premise, and it certainly seemed cool on the surface.  I just didn't realize I was in for Dark Souls the Puzzle Game minus the part where keeping your nose to the grindstone eventually results in progress. "

												Roguelike game have always been one of my fav this game is no exception. Desktop Dungeons is pretty a good one at least when you play it for the first hour on ""easy level"" everything goes smooth and it's been a pleasure. Then after 2 hours the game starts to be rough.You have to think carefully before making a move or you could hardly beat any normal rank levels. constantly hit and run of a higher level monster, think which magic to keep and sacrifice is important and sometimes you need luck to beat one level. It's quite like the tutorial says:"" prepare to die a lot.""So overview this game is quite good but, like I said this one is difficult, but once you get used to it and can manage to get over most levels the game will become enjoyable.(probably you will devote lots time before make it through...)

												10 minutes or less? Yeah right... This is definitely NOT a RPG. This is a ressource management system. Not a game. A system. Because a game is supposed to be fun. After many hours, I realised I did NOT enjoy it.When you realise you can't beat the boss because you'r missing 1 HP, you don't learn from your mistakes, because next time it's gonna be completly different (random). You also realise you waisted your time from the begining because you either kill yourself in frustration or exit the dungeon with a few miserable gold pieces.This is nothing more than an elaborate software to learn basic math.Music is beautiful though. At least I still have the soundtrack. "

												Game would be much more fun if it wasn't impossible to win. You spend all this time setting up your strategy, carefully exploring for health and mana benefits, but in the end you get your♥♥♥♥♥♥kicked in by overpowered enemies of your own level, and you are nowhere near level 10. I know what the spells do and how to take advantage of special skills, potions and all of that jazz, but it never helps.You'll just be wasting your time with this game. It's not fun; it's work. Hard, fruitless work. Go ahead, buy and play the game. See if you can get any farther than I have.			"

It has copious amount's of jokes scattered all over the game (even the main enemies are a joke - Freaking Gots, C'mon! LOLz!). I've neglected it a few times because the first impression didn't capture my eye, but as Steam pushed and insisted I've decided to give it a go, and boy... was I wrong in ignoring it... oh yeah! I'd say if you see it on sale BUY FOR SURE! and if you like puzzles, RPG and sarcasm buy it Even if the price doubles! "

												Fun roguelike. The mix of beating maps with various different heroes and building up your town and heroes to get stronger works very well. There is no real story, but the individual dungerons each have a bit of story to them. Like most of these types of games, it starts easy but gets progressively harder. Also like most of these games, there came a point when it got too hard for me and I quit. Still recommend it for those who like a challenge.			"

												I really like the idea of this game, and I even like the game itself, for the most part, but I cannot recommend it.The learning curve is deceptively shallow until you pass the Easy dungeon. Then, it gets steep quickly.I haven't decided if the problem is the procedurally generated levels (meaning you can't figure out the right path and then execute it properly on the second run, if you didn't manage it the first time), or if the problem is the tricks you can use to beat things beyond your normal abilities (an expectation that once you've encountered an ability, you'll be able to put it in practice like a seasoned rules lawyer).Either way, the Normal dungeons are all too difficult for me, even after several runs at trying to solve them.The result, however, is this: far from being a fun and quirky game you can use to fill ten minutes for a break from your work, it becomes a frustrating problem that has players spending much longer than intended trying to beat a dungeon, any dungeon, before giving up in furstration.Great idea, lousy execution.

Every 5 minutes. Then you get adventurous and try specific character builds (full mana gnome warlord is hilariously cheesy, to name one) and eventually take on the vicious levels, which are well-designed gauntlets you need to really plan for. The devs did a great job on this one.			"

												I have been playing this on a Linux Ubuntu 14.04 laptop plugged into the big living room TV.  It goes full screen no problem but the graphics are in 4:3 so it has the black borders on the side.  Some say the game has bad graphics and I am not sure why.  I have seen games with way more pixelation where everyone is talking about how great it is.  To me what matters is, are the graphics pleasing to look at? With this game, I say yes.  It has a nice overall look.It took me awhile to warm up to this, but I love this game.  It is a great turn based strategy gem.  It appears to be a RPG dungeon crawl but it is not.  Dungeons are solitary one floor puzzles.  Each time you start with a level one dude. The money  you earn lets you upgrade your town which gives you more dudes and starting buffs to choose from.  So it is RPG-ish but not much.  It is pretty challenging but totally doable.  Highly recommended.			"

Requires exceptional calculation and improvisation - a unique and challenging blend that may not be for those faint of heart. You will die - LOTS. But, if you're looking to test your limits in a puzzle-like dungeon crawl, you can't go wrong with Desktop Dungeons!I played the free version of this before picking this up on steam. While very similar in style, this offers a much better campaign, better learning curve, even greater challenges, awards, versatility, polish and so much more.Highly recommended for anyone with masochistic tendancies.

												Should you play Desktop Dungeons?Desktop Dungeons is a rogue-like turn based RPG that plays out perfectly. Definitely a one-of a kind. Honestly, the game is fun, strategic and has received a lot of acclaim and approval from the gaming community. But getting past that, is it really a game you want to play? You start out as a Human Fighter trying to beat dungeons, steal their loot, all for the rightful mission of building your own cities. On the way, you meet fearsome monsters and plots that could end your city..Or fund your wealth. A lot of story-telling is involved, for example, you can even call forth the power of the ancient deities to aid you in your quest, or make a Pact with another to become more resilient. There are a lot of customization and combinations one can try to beat the levels. This game is definitely worth its price. If you doubt my words but still want to give this game a whirl, you can always wait for it to go on sale, then give it a try.Should you play Desktop Dungeons? Yes, you should definitely play it.			"

It's nice ot have something that you can take out and play for about ten to fifteen minutes while on the train.Do not buy if you're the kind of person who gets stupendously butt-hurt because you lose fairly often, then avoid this game.

												I cannot recommend this game at this time.  It is -not- pick up and play as mentioned on the page, and dungeons can not be finished in 5-10 minutes unless you are an expert at the game and know all the strategies.  The fact I had to reference a strategy guide during the tutorials repeatedly was a big warning sign.As it stands I've barely made it past getting the banker, and I've spent the last four hours trying and failing to finish any dungeon at all.  The game is beyond difficult.  If you aren't willing to sit down and do some number crunching and brain math, don't waste your time.  This is not a casual, low-input game you can fluff through.  I'm going to try sticking it out a bit, see if maybe something clicks and the game gets easier, but it's getting lower and lower on my priority list and will probably end up in my 'waste of time and money' list.It's a shame, because I enjoyed the premise, and it certainly seemed cool on the surface.  I just didn't realize I was in for Dark Souls the Puzzle Game minus the part where keeping your nose to the grindstone eventually results in progress. "

												Very addictive, clever and a lot of fun!But beware, this is NOT a rpg, this is a pure puzzle game!Your goal is to get as much xp as possible in the dungeon, which means fighting monsters which are higher lvl than you. If you succeed in taking down a high lvl monster you get bonus xp. If you pull that off enough times you will have high enough lvl at the end to take on the boss monster.+ nice gameplay concept+ a lot of variation, many classes that play differently, new gods, monsters appearing and so on...+ nice humor+ great extra puzzle mode			"

												Besides being an intruiging title with high amount of strategy required, it can be a bit more brutal than I feel  it should.I personally love the occasionally insane difficulty this game delivers, and it is something I enjoy in all games.If you think that you are not ready for an incredibly frustrating game like this, I disadvice you to directly buy this and instead try out the free alpha avaliable on their website first - it does have similar difficulty, but I must say that this later version exceeds it.This is not a game to be taken lightly.

												Desktop Dungeons is a good game for what it is. I played free variant for a long time, before picking up this  release.The released version adds more of everything, more monsters, spells, classes, quests, rewards ...This version also has upgraded graphic, making everything more charming.Game play is turn based, with monster being stationary (some bosses have blink spell, that moves them unless you counter it.). At the beginning dungeon has fog of war. You reveal parts of dungeon by moving to adjacent square. You want to be carefull how much of a dungeon you reveal, since each square you reveal, recovers some of you health and mana. This is the main way you will recover health and mana. This means that exploring too much too early can leave you unable to heal, later on. On the other hand each square you reveal can have beneficial items, that you might want. This makes unrevealed tiles in dungeon weary important resource.This is a quick game. Once you get used to controls and basic concepts, you can easily complete a dungeon/quest in 5 min. If it will take you longer it will be because you spend time thinking of best move.Game is also paced quite well, so at the beginning you only have access to one class and one race (human fighter.), but you quickly unlock more.With all that said, it is important to remember that this game is a filler game. It's meant to be played in short sessions.If you play it for hours, you will quickly become bored. But playing couple of dungeons every day, while waiting for whatever bigger game you are currently playing to patch itself, it is time well spent.			"

												10 minutes or less? Yeah right... This is definitely NOT a RPG. This is a ressource management system. Not a game. A system. Because a game is supposed to be fun. After many hours, I realised I did NOT enjoy it.When you realise you can't beat the boss because you'r missing 1 HP, you don't learn from your mistakes, because next time it's gonna be completly different (random). You also realise you waisted your time from the begining because you either kill yourself in frustration or exit the dungeon with a few miserable gold pieces.This is nothing more than an elaborate software to learn basic math.Music is beautiful though. At least I still have the soundtrack. "

												This is a trully awesome game. But it requires a good mathematical and logical skills to be successful and actually have a fun.You HAVE to calculate your and enemy's damages, define which enemy you will just kill and which ones will be turned into stone to get XP bonus for the next victim.You should definetely finish ALL Tutorials, Puzzles and Starter Pack to see main nuances of this game. Otherwise you will be frustrated why you can't defeat the very first dungeons. Puzzles and Starter Pack will be available since you get a tavern into your Kingdom.Игра очень интересна. Это по сути сборник паззлов и задач.Игра требует определенных математических и логических навыков, поскольку требуется прикидывать сможет ли герой убить данного врага или нет и стот это вообще делать сейчас или вообще.Также абсолютно необходимо проходить Туториалы и сборники Задач. Последние находятся в таверне и доступны с момента ее постройки. Без их прохождения вы не узнаете ньюансы использования глифов, местности и данного класса\рассы героя. Что в свою очередь приведет к невозможности пройти подземелье и как результат - разочарование в игре.			"

												This game is an amazing dungeon crawl.  Perfect for a short play or extended.  Don't be fooled, though, it does require an active mind to escape the later dungeons.  As more is unlocked to help, more is unlocked to hinder.  I've followed this game since it was in it's Alpha stage and am happy to state that the finished product is more than just a prettier version.  It possesses more depth and challenge than the original.  I will be sure to unleash the updated addiction upon my friends who fell prey to it in it's Alpha form.As far as gameplay goes, it is a turn based dungeon crawl in which, for the most part, you are the only character that moves.  It utilizes multiple character classes and races each with their own perks and disadvantages.			"

												I love this game!It IS hard. It IS unfair (sometimes at least). But that's not a problem - it's an asset. DD has a high replayability and you will have to do several stages and tasks again and again because of wrong class, race, equippment or just one false klick. But in fact that's the thrill: to master the game you have to play some perfect rounds, know all the tricks and skills and of course you need a bit of luck.That sounds less fun than it actualy is. You got to plan and think a lot, but winning a difficult level will outweigh that. The approximately 10-15 minutes of playtime for each stage (when you survive, otherwise playtime can be much shorter ;) ) are well balanced between a short break and not loosing to much time in case of failure.A nice fact is that you can play DD after buying on Steam not only via Steam, but also via the DD website. A nice amusement if you are not at home and on a PC without Steam and don't need download and install anything. That works for Windows RT tablets too.When playing via website please consider, that Steam acchievments will not be unlocked and it does not count to your playing time. Otherwise I would have several hours more.In the end a good occasionally game you should not take to serious. At any discount a must-buy if you like roguelikes and have a good frustration tolerance. ;)			"

The full game has a deep meta-game with town-building, quests and more, a whole new equipment system, a vast amount of content and variation in dungeons, fleshed out mechanics, balanced dieties and spells, new dungeon + challenge system, and a sweet soundtrack by Danny Baranowsky and Grant Kirkhope, which suplements the charming graphics.All in all, you will not be dissapointed in this game. It's not for everyone, but it's the best at what it does! At 44 hours played, I still have only just completed the final boss, which unlocks a whole new array of challenges to bring to the dungeon.

												Very charming puzzle game that involves pacing your progress as a character leveling up defeating monsters in a dungeon. Exploring the dungeon (uncovering tiles) is how you mainly restore health. Items, races and classes each have their strengths and weaknesses that change how to progress best. Taking on difficult monsters as early as possible quickly becomes required to defeat dungeons. Defeating dungeons earns you money to unlock more classes, races and items.

The game presents a very interesting take on rougelike / RPGs by adding unique leveling, healing, and skill elements which turn it in to a hybrid puzzle game.  The latest verison includes a lot of advancement and unique classes, skills, and upgrades.  It's certainly worth the pricetag just to explore it's unique take on the genre.

												A great game where you get your money's worth. I spent 33 hours on it and still haven't unlocked everything. It may seem difficult at first, but once you get the hang of using the mechanics to your advantage you will be clearing out dungeons in no-time. That doesn't mean the difficulty will rise though, the later levels bring in all sorts of gimmicks to make you think. However  there will be situations where a randomly generated dungeon will prove unsolveable.			"

												People call this a roguelike.  Despite appearances (quests, races, classes, spells, weapons, monsters, potions, etc), it's more like a puzzle game. It's a sequence of single-screen dungeon crawls, each with a different character, starting at level 1.  Dungeons are randomly generated, plus there are some semi-random quest dungeons and completely fixed puzzles.  The game rules are simple enough, but complex strategies emerge.  It's easy to learn and difficult to master, although I have to say mastery would be a little more attainable if there were better in-game documentation.  There is of course a wiki.One last warning: it is addictive.  As in: ""Holy crap, is it 4:00 tomorrow morning already?""-class addictive.  Highly recommended.			"

You can get a lot more game with better attention to graphics and UI detail than this in the $15 area.			"

												Desktop Dungeons is an interesting game and worth looking into, but it's not quite the 'roguelike-lite' that it advertises itself to be. Each dungeon is one level (occasionally with a sublevel with more treasure or more enemies) and your adventurer always starts fresh at level 1 at the beginning of the dungeon, so there's no characters that carry over from dungeon to dungeon. The most notable difference between this game and other roguelikes is that monsters in dungeons do not move and do not attack until you attack, which causes the game to become more of a puzzle game than a genuine roguelike- the challenge comes not from the monsters themselves but rather budgeting your resources and defeating the monsters in the correct way to give your hero as much power as they need to defeat the boss monster and defeat the dungeon.That's not saying Desktop Dungeons isn't entertaining or worth looking into, though. As far as being a sort of time-waster to play inbetween ordering a pizza or during a break at work or something, it fits perfectly since each dungeon could take at most 15 or 20 minutes to complete. The gameplay suits itself well to playing in short bursts rather than sitting down for long sessions and as such is a perfect fit for the busy gamer looking for a more intricate experience over Bejeweled or games on Facebook or something.That being said, I'm not entirely sure this game is worth the $15 price tag. Maybe wait for it to come on sale for $10 or less, then go ahead and make the dive.One final note: The soundtrack, made by Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie, Goldeneye, Perfect Dark) and Danny Baranowsky (Binding of Isaac, Super Meat Boy) is excellent and fits the game well. Makes the dungeon-crawling a lot more thematic and interesting than it would have been otherwise.			"

												Desktop Dungeons is a very peculiar game which plays like some kind of puzzle game.One half of the game you are buying upgrades in your town which will aid you in future adventures.And the other half is you adventuring into caves and dungeons to slay the biggest baddest baddie available and return with the loot.You are tossed out on a map which you explore square by square. Time standing still when you don't move.Which gives the idea that you're supposed to stop and think for every move you make.Resources are scarce, enemies aplenty. You have to decide which enemy to take down in which order and balance that with exploring and using potions and spells to your advantage.Even if it appears bite-sized it still a game where a single adventure could leave you scratching your head and doing a move every few minutes while you do something else entirely.I'd say definitely try this out if you want a more laid-back experience which rewards patience and decisionmaking!

												Part dungeon delving rogue-like, part puzzling strategic thinkery. Desktop Dungeons does something original with its influences and it it does it in bite-sized chunks that leave you either begging for more or screaming for mercy - right after you clean up the blood and gore left from your previous failed delve off the dungeon wall. It is ruthless in its difficulty, but patient in its desire to teach you to think out you every step - and you will be punished for failure. Succeed and you will be rewarded, for these dungeons are packed with wealth, just as this game is as stuffed with unlockables as a goblin is loot.  Desktop Dungeons does requires some math for success but it might trick you into enjoying it. The sucked me into pushing for just one more dungeon over and over again, but its punishing difficulty did mean I found failure more often than success.			"

												Desktop Dungeons is one of my favorite games.  The mix of roguelike and puzzle gameplay is extremely well-balanced to a satisfying difficulty combined with near-endless replayability.You control a hero exploring a randomly-generated dungeon, gathering powerups, equipment, and spells (glyphs).  The enemies are purely reactive: they only damage you in retaliation to your attacks.  This mechanic sets Desktop Dungeons apart from most roguelikes, and your ability to plan ahead results in gameplay comparable to a puzzle game.  Situations can become increasingly complex as you progress further and obtain more unlockables (such as the various gods you can worship in the dungeon).You (and the enemies) regenerate your health and mana through revealing unexplored tiles, allowing you to recharge between encounters.  Your resources are all finite, so you can't simply grind your way to victory.  Instead, careful play is needed to gain bonus XP from killing higher-level enemies without exhausting your ability to recover before you face the boss (or bosses).The skill ceiling is extremely high, and the more difficult scenarios are quite brutal.  When you first start playing even the easier ""Normal"" dungeons will provide a challenge.  You can tilt the odds in your favor by spending kingdom gold (essentially your winnings from successful runs) on preparations that should make your hero more effective.   I will note that the most difficult dungeons are unnecessary to complete the main storyline, but beating them unlocks powerful items as well as four monster races. Dungeons are reasonably short (my runs are roughly 10-40 minutes depending on the situation), but the game is extremely replayable.  The wide selection of classes, races, and items allows for a wide diversity of viable builds.  I have played over a hundred hours and completed the main storyline, but it will be quite some time before I feel that I have exhausted the postgame content.  The Enhanced Edition additionally introduces a 'Daily Dungeon' feature allowing you to compare your results to other players.			"

												This is a very good game. It's a rogue-lite dungeon crawler where you always know exactly how much damage you and the enemy will do, so you always know if hitting something will kill you. This leads to you running to and fro in the dungeon, preying on weak enemies, throwing everything you have at monsters two levels above you for an experience boost. I frequently find myself betraying one god, worshipping another, downing three potions, and killing the big boss to leave myself with a handful of health. Rogue-lite in this case means that you unlock new classes which give huge gameplay changes and new races which give different small buffs that occur only when you trash items.			"

												A simple little entertaining game.  It doesn't quite reach addictive status, but it's well worth the couple bucks it costs to play.  The simple gameplay makes it fast and fun while the random dungeons allow repetitive gaming enjoyable.  I love the style of graphics: cartoony and simple.  Throughout the game are little quests and achievements that actually add to the game.  The problem is some of the content is useless.  Most notably are the number of gods that have more negatives than positives when selecting them as your chosen deity.  Players do not have to chose a deity, but it doesn't make sense to have them in the game if they aren't going to be chosen.  Despite this minor annoyance, it's a great game to play.			"

												I really like the idea of this game, and I even like the game itself, for the most part, but I cannot recommend it.The learning curve is deceptively shallow until you pass the Easy dungeon. Then, it gets steep quickly.I haven't decided if the problem is the procedurally generated levels (meaning you can't figure out the right path and then execute it properly on the second run, if you didn't manage it the first time), or if the problem is the tricks you can use to beat things beyond your normal abilities (an expectation that once you've encountered an ability, you'll be able to put it in practice like a seasoned rules lawyer).Either way, the Normal dungeons are all too difficult for me, even after several runs at trying to solve them.The result, however, is this: far from being a fun and quirky game you can use to fill ten minutes for a break from your work, it becomes a frustrating problem that has players spending much longer than intended trying to beat a dungeon, any dungeon, before giving up in furstration.Great idea, lousy execution.

												The First time I ran into this game was years ago when it was a contender in the Independent Games Festival. I remember downloading other contest entries as well, but the alpha of this game was the one that really grabbed my attention. I spent hours upon hours playing the alpha and was really excited when I learned that they were making a full game out of it. I didn't buy the early access version, but I followed the development closely. When it finally was officially released I bought it immediately and boy was I surprised. I had expected a graphical overhaul and the extra features, but not to this extent! There was just so much more to unlock and do. The devs had upped everything to eleven. New monster types, afflictions, gods, character classes, races, secrets, challenge dungeons, tutorials, the list just goes on and on.The full release really pushed this game to new heights, at least for me. What had been a quick puzzle fix was now a fully fleshed out puzzle game with a mischievious art style and depth like never before + the ost by Danny Baranowsky and Grant Kirkhope is great!I highly recommend this fantastic game. The sheer amount of gameplay variation and replayability this game offers in such a tight package is nothing short of impressive.P.S. I realize this isn't really a full review, but more of a memoir of a Desktop Dungeonist.			"

												Desktop Dungeons has been in beta for a very long time now (well over a year or two!) since it's debut at the IGF in it's free form. Since then, the game has grown massive beyond the inital scope and idea, adding in a story, many new classes, races, monsters, and so much more. The gamepay, however, has remained largely the same: Explore a randomly generated dungeon, fight monsters, collect loot, and defeat the boss. But in true rogue-like fashion, your ability to accomplish this is left up to fate and skill. Each new area you explore has different rules and layouts, with features like gods to pledge your loyalty to or shops to buy needed equipment. You will curse at your computer, you might throw your keyboard and mouse across the room. But the game itself is rewarding when you finally get that perfect run together with that smooth combination of careful planning and a touch of luck, leaving you with a warm feeling and a craving for more. PIck this one up.			"

												Roguelike meets puzzles while city building and resource management get busy in the corner.  What seems simple at first reveals itself to be complex and layered.  Not to mention very difficult (seriously think dark souls hard).  However the difficulty adds an old school arcade one more go feel.  This game is more addictive than football manager.  If you are balking at 12 quid for it when there is a free version do not worry.  The paid version has so much more content than the free version (city building etc) and is much more refined and well balanced.  The years of refinement really do show when comparing the two versions.  One of the best and unique indie games around.  A must buy.10/10			"

												Desktop Dungeons is an interesting game and worth looking into, but it's not quite the 'roguelike-lite' that it advertises itself to be. Each dungeon is one level (occasionally with a sublevel with more treasure or more enemies) and your adventurer always starts fresh at level 1 at the beginning of the dungeon, so there's no characters that carry over from dungeon to dungeon. The most notable difference between this game and other roguelikes is that monsters in dungeons do not move and do not attack until you attack, which causes the game to become more of a puzzle game than a genuine roguelike- the challenge comes not from the monsters themselves but rather budgeting your resources and defeating the monsters in the correct way to give your hero as much power as they need to defeat the boss monster and defeat the dungeon.That's not saying Desktop Dungeons isn't entertaining or worth looking into, though. As far as being a sort of time-waster to play inbetween ordering a pizza or during a break at work or something, it fits perfectly since each dungeon could take at most 15 or 20 minutes to complete. The gameplay suits itself well to playing in short bursts rather than sitting down for long sessions and as such is a perfect fit for the busy gamer looking for a more intricate experience over Bejeweled or games on Facebook or something.That being said, I'm not entirely sure this game is worth the $15 price tag. Maybe wait for it to come on sale for $10 or less, then go ahead and make the dive.One final note: The soundtrack, made by Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie, Goldeneye, Perfect Dark) and Danny Baranowsky (Binding of Isaac, Super Meat Boy) is excellent and fits the game well. Makes the dungeon-crawling a lot more thematic and interesting than it would have been otherwise.			"

												Should you play Desktop Dungeons?Desktop Dungeons is a rogue-like turn based RPG that plays out perfectly. Definitely a one-of a kind. Honestly, the game is fun, strategic and has received a lot of acclaim and approval from the gaming community. But getting past that, is it really a game you want to play? You start out as a Human Fighter trying to beat dungeons, steal their loot, all for the rightful mission of building your own cities. On the way, you meet fearsome monsters and plots that could end your city..Or fund your wealth. A lot of story-telling is involved, for example, you can even call forth the power of the ancient deities to aid you in your quest, or make a Pact with another to become more resilient. There are a lot of customization and combinations one can try to beat the levels. This game is definitely worth its price. If you doubt my words but still want to give this game a whirl, you can always wait for it to go on sale, then give it a try.Should you play Desktop Dungeons? Yes, you should definitely play it.			"

												I've been playing Desktop Dungeons since the alpha, signed up during the beta, happily redeemed my key on Steam and have put in countless hours. It's genuinely one of the best puzzle games ever made - it has a roguelike sheen and borrows heavily from Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (which is my roguelike of choice anyways) but it follows a certain iterative structure, and builds into something that requires a lot of math, resource management, and long-term thinking with short-term heuristics on trying to figure out the best choice when you don't have all of the information in front of you. It's genuinely good, more than well worth the price point, and I'd suggest it to anybody who asked and try to push it on a few people who didn't either.Don't go in expecting a formal RPG - it does get hard, fast, but it's much much more forgiving than it seems, and while the learning curve is steep, it pulls you right up along it. I would only refrain from recommending it if you're looking for not even a more casual experience, but just something that doesn't require you to do a weird amount of math on the fly. Otherwise, it's a game that could happily belong in everyone's library.			"

												Desktop Dungeons is a very peculiar game which plays like some kind of puzzle game.One half of the game you are buying upgrades in your town which will aid you in future adventures.And the other half is you adventuring into caves and dungeons to slay the biggest baddest baddie available and return with the loot.You are tossed out on a map which you explore square by square. Time standing still when you don't move.Which gives the idea that you're supposed to stop and think for every move you make.Resources are scarce, enemies aplenty. You have to decide which enemy to take down in which order and balance that with exploring and using potions and spells to your advantage.Even if it appears bite-sized it still a game where a single adventure could leave you scratching your head and doing a move every few minutes while you do something else entirely.I'd say definitely try this out if you want a more laid-back experience which rewards patience and decisionmaking!

												Probably the smartest game I have played during the last couple of years.This game is a puzzle game, that present a different challenge at every run, due to the random generation of the dungeons (dungeons layout, monsters, available items, spells, gods,...), the selection of the race and class of the adventurer and the preparation you bring into the dungeon. Each setup play very differently and regarding the huge amount of content available in it, there is literally several hundreds hours of gameplay in it.What I like the most about it is that when you successfully finish a dungeon, you really feel like you have done a great achievement.The downside of the game is that it is really hard, and you need to invest time into learning how to play it and how the different system interacts.Highly recommended.

												This game is really awesome. It's is wonderfully addictive, simple to play and understand, but still requires a decent amount of thought to figure out the best course of action.It's a great way to casually kill some time.			"

												Excellent top-down RPG/Puzzle/Strategy Hybrid. At times infuriating or grindy, but solid and varied enough to have you coming back for more, and you always enter each dungeon at least feeling like you have a chance. Great humour, too!Bonus points for Crossplay with iOS/Android versions.			"

												The First time I ran into this game was years ago when it was a contender in the Independent Games Festival. I remember downloading other contest entries as well, but the alpha of this game was the one that really grabbed my attention. I spent hours upon hours playing the alpha and was really excited when I learned that they were making a full game out of it. I didn't buy the early access version, but I followed the development closely. When it finally was officially released I bought it immediately and boy was I surprised. I had expected a graphical overhaul and the extra features, but not to this extent! There was just so much more to unlock and do. The devs had upped everything to eleven. New monster types, afflictions, gods, character classes, races, secrets, challenge dungeons, tutorials, the list just goes on and on.The full release really pushed this game to new heights, at least for me. What had been a quick puzzle fix was now a fully fleshed out puzzle game with a mischievious art style and depth like never before + the ost by Danny Baranowsky and Grant Kirkhope is great!I highly recommend this fantastic game. The sheer amount of gameplay variation and replayability this game offers in such a tight package is nothing short of impressive.P.S. I realize this isn't really a full review, but more of a memoir of a Desktop Dungeonist.			"

												TLDR: If you're into logic/puzzles, math, and rogue-like elements, the games don't get more entertaining than this.  The Good: -The necessity to use different strategies and builds depending on the levels. There's no single strategy that will beat the game for you.-The difficulty is almost spot-on throughout the entire game. It's only easy in the beginning. By the end it's brutally hard, but you feel accomplished.-Fun in small spurts or for long periods of time.-There are a ton of upgrades that keep the game fresh.The Bad:-The more you lose on one level the harder it is to remain patient and play well (more of a personal flaw, but it applies greatly here).-The randomness of the ""boss"", glyph drops, enemies, etc. can break/ruin a run for you.  Takes some luck on harder levels.Verdict: If you can deal with feeling dumb as you try to figure out the best strategies and are patient enough to not blow a fuse as you repeat levels multiple times, the game is great.  The upgrades keep the game and strategies fresh and you feel great accomplishment as you make your way through the harder levels.  For the price they are asking, you get great value for your buck.  I'd give it a solid 9/10.			"

												Part dungeon delving rogue-like, part puzzling strategic thinkery. Desktop Dungeons does something original with its influences and it it does it in bite-sized chunks that leave you either begging for more or screaming for mercy - right after you clean up the blood and gore left from your previous failed delve off the dungeon wall. It is ruthless in its difficulty, but patient in its desire to teach you to think out you every step - and you will be punished for failure. Succeed and you will be rewarded, for these dungeons are packed with wealth, just as this game is as stuffed with unlockables as a goblin is loot.  Desktop Dungeons does requires some math for success but it might trick you into enjoying it. The sucked me into pushing for just one more dungeon over and over again, but its punishing difficulty did mean I found failure more often than success.			"

												Very high replayability. Slightly overpriced for the average gamer. A slight grind to unlock all areas and characters.This game rewards patience and good decision making. Have a plan and execute - or learn to adjust to the randomly generated dungeon. Either way, a worthwhile experience when the price is right.			"

												A roguelike distilled into a single puzzle-like screen. With all the filler removed, it's simply the most roguelike fun you can have in the least amount of time.It's also what Minesweeper would look like if it actually was lots of fun.			"

												This game is so underrated that it's ridiculous! I've always enjoyed roguelikes and roguelites and I was on the fence for this one for a long time because none of my friends had played it and wasn't super cheap (although it's definitely cheap for what you get). Well guess what? It's TOTALLY WORTH IT. And you know what bought me over, and will buy you over, too? Trying out the free alpha version still officially available on their website. This game is amazing!			"

												Desktop Dungeons is one of my favorite games.  The mix of roguelike and puzzle gameplay is extremely well-balanced to a satisfying difficulty combined with near-endless replayability.You control a hero exploring a randomly-generated dungeon, gathering powerups, equipment, and spells (glyphs).  The enemies are purely reactive: they only damage you in retaliation to your attacks.  This mechanic sets Desktop Dungeons apart from most roguelikes, and your ability to plan ahead results in gameplay comparable to a puzzle game.  Situations can become increasingly complex as you progress further and obtain more unlockables (such as the various gods you can worship in the dungeon).You (and the enemies) regenerate your health and mana through revealing unexplored tiles, allowing you to recharge between encounters.  Your resources are all finite, so you can't simply grind your way to victory.  Instead, careful play is needed to gain bonus XP from killing higher-level enemies without exhausting your ability to recover before you face the boss (or bosses).The skill ceiling is extremely high, and the more difficult scenarios are quite brutal.  When you first start playing even the easier ""Normal"" dungeons will provide a challenge.  You can tilt the odds in your favor by spending kingdom gold (essentially your winnings from successful runs) on preparations that should make your hero more effective.   I will note that the most difficult dungeons are unnecessary to complete the main storyline, but beating them unlocks powerful items as well as four monster races. Dungeons are reasonably short (my runs are roughly 10-40 minutes depending on the situation), but the game is extremely replayable.  The wide selection of classes, races, and items allows for a wide diversity of viable builds.  I have played over a hundred hours and completed the main storyline, but it will be quite some time before I feel that I have exhausted the postgame content.  The Enhanced Edition additionally introduces a 'Daily Dungeon' feature allowing you to compare your results to other players.			"

												Years ago, after mastering the alpha version i learned a much more appealing version will come out. Made me back it and getting a copy before and after it was officially released. Sadly my progress was lost, but nevertheless i had fun cracking it again. Very fun, great art, nice music puzzle math game worth spending hours in. .. wonder if its released on mobiles .. hmm			"

												Last version of this game I played was 2 years ago. It took .1 seconds to start up and you could finish a level in 10 minutes.No tutorial. No Kingdom bullcrap. Just the game. As simple as Minesweeper.The new stuff that has been added since then has degraded the replay value for me. I used to play it constantly.Would recommend if you can find one of the first versions and download that instead.Edit 11/25/2016Thank you dev. Thank you for putting up with my unknowledgable review and providing the old game for free even now. You are the best. Changed to Recommended.			"

												Ok, first, i didnt played -this- version very much as i wrote this review BUT i know the -FREEWARE- version and i played it very very long and very very much.Basicly, This ""Selling"" version from the classic Freeware Desktop Dungeons are the same. The grafics are improved, Some nice music in the background (which you normaly dont need if you just use your own wile you played the Freeware version...) and thats it.Insteed of play stuff free by finish things in the Freeware here you have to ""earn"" money in the dungeons and buy/upgrate your Units/Heros/Stuff. So its also basicly the same.So i whould say, if you liked the Freeware, you can get this version BUT...14 Euro? Just for some better grafics? I mean all the other stuff is pretty much the same, only the grafic looks better but 14 Euro???So i give it a ""YES"" voting coz it -IS- a good game but honestly, you should THINK twice about if you buy this version for 14 Euro OR stay in the Freeware version which are really really much the same. If its maybe 60% Off you make a good deal...			"
