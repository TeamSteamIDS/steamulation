												much like DG1, a simple but solid TD with good graphics, nothing special.negative vote for the abuse of the steam workshop for selling maps and having no support for free community maps built into the game interface. selling maps is ok, but controlling competition in favour of your own content simply sucks big time.http://www.dg2freemaps.com/ "

												I enjoyed the game but am giving this a negative review.  I played through the whole thing and had a good time, had to replay a couple levels to get the gold rating.  Finished. Nice. Now, let me goto the steam workshop for this game and download some player made maps so I can enjoy this game for quite a bit longer (ala Civ5).Wait? What? Player made maps are only available to be voted on WITHOUT PLAYING THEM? You cannot download them and can only vote on them and when they get enough votes then they will be made available via the Hidden Path Store for a couple of dollars.  WTF is up with that?I had no idea I was buying a microtransaction game, this is complete BS imho.  If the community makes the map then the map should be available to the community for nothing, stop charging for what others create for your game.I seriously doubt I will give this company any more of my money and I certainly will not be buying any expansion map packs.

												Thoroughly disappointing tower defense game. Buy DG1 instead - it's a much better game.This new version has a stupid story, a variety of useless support weapons (the resource one is always going to be the best) and difficulty so unsteady you'll wonder if it was ever tested. The last few levels of the campaign are a joke - you will never feel threatened, unlike in DG1. Some levels in the middle of the campaign are difficult but otherwise the game is a cakewalk that presents little challenge (again, compared to DG1), even if you are trying to ""max out"" every level. Also, there is workshop support but the place is barren. Clearly, this game never took off as I had hoped it would. So sad to see such an inferior sequel :(			"

												Defense Grid 2 Review beta:IF you like tower defense games buy it Defense Grid is a strategy game where you spend resources on building towers that destroy waves of incoming enemies. As you kill more enemies, your resources grow. It’s a combo of strategy and puzzle play, and because the game is balanced just right, there are a million different ways you can beat a level so your solution is truly your solution.This game is awesome the graphics is nice you can upgrade towers and more...The community is active and nice there are also lots of events and i like it.I do recommend for you to play this game.

												I have been putting off writing this review as I did really want to love DG2. What I've seen from reading other reviews is too many(I'm not saying all just TOO many) are corrupting their reviews due to their love of the first one both positive and negative.I will try to write this review without even mention DG1 or comparing them as I think it is best to review DG2 for it's own qualities.Okay so firstly, some of the good things.DG2 has a strong core (no pun intended).It does what TD's should do in a lot of ways. There is a large selection of tower types and a 'boost' tower which can be used for cheap maze creation. There is a selection of tower 'bonus' items that randomly drop after missions which can be applied to towers.There is a large variety of enemy types, with unique abilities from shields to foes that can disable your defenses and alot in between.The campaign is a decent length with a nice variety of levels and multiple gameplay types.Some of the things that grate on my nerves.The dialogue and voice acting unfortunately is terrible, it's actually annoying to the point where for the first time ever in a game I have disabled the voice audio.The story isn't great. Now I will quickly say a TD does NOT need a story to be good, but when it does attempt a story it must not be bad otherwise it drags the feel of the campaign down. The gameplay feels very repetitive, and it shouldn't but it's not holding my attention. I only finished the campaign to finish it. I was really trying to find something that made me say wow awesome I love this game, but I haven't yet.SummaryThis is a solid TD game, but unfortunately I cannot recommend it for what it does at it's current price.I do not regret buying it but I couldn't recommend it for a friend to spend their money on.This is not the definitive TD game as the store page claims. This is just another TD game though while it's good, it's not great enough to stick it's head above the pile.I would say worth picking up in a sale as it does do a lot well but as I said before, I wouldn't recommend to a friend, so I cannot recommend it here at it's current value.I will keep an eye on updates and occasionally jump back into the game. If I find something that changes my opinion I will update my review.			"

												This is a sequel done right. There's enough content here to provide new challenges to players who have mastered the original Defense Grid, but at the same time, this is still very much the same kind of game in all the right ways.At first glance, the new content seems only modest compared to what is familiar. Almost all the old tower types and enemies are back, but the handful of new types of each and subtle rebalancing of the existing towers mean that new strategies need to be developed.DG2 offers a plethora of choices as to how you play the game. From separate leaderboards that either allow or forbid juggling, difficulty levels from casual to very challenging, and even more game modes for each map than the first game, this takes what was until now the definitive tower defense game and makes it even better.There have been some substantial changes to the economy and scoring system which, while I feel personally make for a more challenging game, do substantially alter the challenge curve of the basic level type. Gone is the compound interest earned from penny pinching. Instead, score is accrued independently from income. Efficiency is still rewarded, as you score more for killing each alien while you have less invested in towers. But the income from killing each enemy is unaffected, and additional income is a steady tick rather than being dependent on the amount you have banked. All this means that you can't just develop an optimised strategy for the early waves, and then find yourself with a huge bankroll. Levels can be genuinely challenging from beginning to end, and not just for people looking for pure score optimisation. I know this may actually be a bit of a disappointment for some, as the old game could sometimes be great for some uncomplicated unwinding at the end of a rough day. That is still there, but you'll have to dial the game back to easy in order to find that kind of experience.I will say that I have yet to try the multiplayer modes, so I can't yet speak to that experience. But with that caveat aside, I wholeheartedly recommend DG2 to fans of the original and anyone even vaguely interested in the tower defence genre. If you're going to give these kinds of games a go, why not start off with the very best there is on offer?			"

												Good game, the reasons for the negtive review:1. Much easier than DG1.(Main storyline finished in under 15hrs playtime.)2. Lack of expansions or DLCs that continued the fun and story of DG1.3. Maps submitted on Steam Workshop have to be voted on just from screenshots.4. Community voted maps will then be SOLD to you!Recommend you buy DG1 for better value if you don't already own it.			"

												The original is my favorite tower defense game of all time. I have access to the beta and can tell you it's every bit as fun, but they've also added new mechanics. Defense boards that can change during play, and they're adding customization of your loadouts to expand upon the original. Choose from new commanders with different abilities, and tool your towers to develop them to your preferences.PS - Multiplayer co-op game modes too!			"

Defense Grid: The Awakening (DG1) set the gold standard for Tower Defence games on PC - it is arguably the King of TD! It ticked all the boxes with insane replayability, challenging score based gameplay & a big list of levels & modes. It was the perfect balance for many gamers with some clocking thousands of hours of play time. In all the years to follow, no Tower Defense game has toppled DG1 from its throne - but now there is a serious contender from Hidden Path's own stables.So, is DG2 the worthy successor to the crown?All the components that made DG1 are essentially in DG2 plus more! That means pretty much all the towers return, along with the Aliens. Similar number of campaign levels on offer & Fletcher returns with some new 'friends' to provide some raspberry comic relief. I got a bit lost with all the new AI voices & story twists but that is not super important for a TD game.It plays like it’s the same game with more detailed graphics & enhanced mechanics. Everything is a little more refined, that includes a few more modes to challenge, medals for all difficulty levels, extra power-up & commander upgrade options & some dynamic 'moveable' maps. These newer elements add more tactical & strategic options to your arsenal.Online has got a lot of attention with Multiplayer being added. This was like playing a whole different game! My favourite mode is DG Fighter. In this you face off against a competitor, each of you has your own map in which each kill you make spawns an alien on their map in the location you killed it. Games were hectic, intense and generally close with the ability to counter each other's defenses in real-time. It is excellent fun! There is also a full co-op mode where you share the same map squares & resources, which actually wasn't as much fun as I hoped it would be. For that, you really need a good understanding with your partner & not playing with random matchmaking people.The third mode was a bit of a hybrid, with players being allocated set squares on the same map, defending the same cores but competing for kills. It was all a bit confusing for many I think on how to best play this mode which limited its appeal. Finding players was a bit inconsistent, but it was well designed to allow you to play single player while you wait in the multiplayer queue. What was not-so-well designed was managing with dropouts. I experienced a lot of defeated players who would rather drop the game than suffer a loss - this will also mean the end your game too & prevent you from recording a high score or achieving a medal. Frustrated me to no end! It would have also been nice to browse a list of active games to join.Another welcome addition is the level editor for community created levels! This will really add to DG2's longevity, although, I was disappointed to see the Steam Workshop is only used to submit for paid maps. Might be a technical limitation with Steam & there is an external community run site[www.dg2freemaps.com] to get free maps, but having it all integrated in Steam would have been really nice. Both paid & free maps to encourage the community to keep on playing & exploring content. At time of writing this, there is only 4 official paid maps available via Hidden Path store, but close to 20 or more via the external site. On a more positive note, I really liked the introduction of the Boost Tower. This tower acts as a simple block on an empty square, but it also provide a tower built on it greater line of sight & power-up options that enhance the tower; like revealing stealth units or score/damage boosts. These power-ups also make the Command Tower from the original game redundant (hence no longer in DG2). There is a command structure on each map though which provides level modifications for purchase. These raise or move sections of the maps to give more building options and better defenses. They add variety to each play though, but felt they were a bit under-utilised. After several runs at a level you often find you don't use them anymore.There are some other differences that set DG2 apart from its predecessor. On a minor point, there are no flying aliens (I always found them a distraction so I don't mind they are gone!) & on a larger point there is a new scoring system. Now, I need to take a moment to explain this further as it is a deciding factor that does change the feel of the game.DG1 scoring system was time based; this meant the longer you can keep the aliens in the map, the more interest on your resources you got & a higher score. This was somewhat flawed in design as it encouraged players to 'juggle' aliens on the map as long as possible & do things like sell towers for extra interest near the end of the level. In DG2, the scoring system is efficiency based; this means when you kill an alien you get a set score for the alien plus a bonus based on the amount of resources. No more increasing interest over time, but there is a periodic drip of supplies you get at key waves. The result puts the importance back on killing aliens & making sure they don’t escape with a core. You can still juggle to improve efficiency but the length of time is no longer a factor. Although it is a more logical scoring system, for me it doesn't have the same tactile response (or feel) you get when you are doing well. In DG1, you could see by the resource score ticking faster & faster along with the combination of the effectiveness of your towers in real time to really feel how well you were doing - it felt precise in a weird way. In DG2, there is now an in-game real time graph which helps negate the lack of 'ticking', but I find it is still harder to judge just how much better you are doing. I think this is due to the very small window (zoomed in) graph you see & the relative impact (or lack of?) towers seem to make to your score/efficiency. It's different, but for me even though the old system was flawed it was simply more fun to play. The flaws gave DG its character & a unique style of play which now seems lost to a certain degree.DG2 wins on many fronts, but my conclusion is that DG1 retains the crown. If it were an Olympic 100 meter sprint, it would be a photo finish down to the milliseconds! If the old scoring system rules were available as an alternative play mode I think there would be a new king! DG2 is still a fantastic game despite my preference for the old scoring system, that's really deserved of every strategist & tower defence fan's game collection.Update 2015: The old scoring system is back!! Players now have the choice between the new and old scoring systems. This is great!! Many thanks to Hidden Path for continuing to improve this awesome game.If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations! "

												Defense Grid is a tower defense game. You have to spend resources on building towers that destroy waves of incoming aliens who want to attack your base. With killing enemies also your resources grow to build more.Pro:+ good graphic, great details+ different towers with different abilities to choose+ you can tool your towers to develop them to your preferences+ defense boards can change while you are playing (also the way of the enemies)+ active community and developers+ good support+ multiplayer & coop+ achievementsContra:The original price (22,99€) is a bit too high for a tower defense game. Also because there are still so many free to play TD games for computer on the internet and apps for smartphones / iphones available.Stability: I have read some posts about game crashing, so maybe you should check if the game is working on your computer if you are interessted in this game. As I can tell you I HAD NO CRASHES! I play with WIN8 and started to play this game last week (current date: 28th July 2014). "

YouTube™ Video: Defense Grid 2 Review - Worth a Buy? 

			Views: 37,894		

			Defense Grid 2 is it Worth a Buy? Defense Grid 2, DG2, is the highly-anticipated sequel to Hidden Path Entertainment’s 2008 Defense Grid: The Awakening.		

I also suspect the game is actually easier than DG1 as I don't have too many problems racking up gold medals and I don't remember getting them as easily in DG1.Storywise, it was a nice continuation and I thought the levels were well designed. Boost towers and the tower improvements you can earn via good performance are also pretty nice and add more strategies and ways of mixing towers up.The grahics are prettier than DG1http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=347547384Overall, brilliant game well worth the modest cost and I hope they introduce lots of good DLC as they did with DG1, although I'm less sanguine about this new store as purchasing single disjointed and unreleated maps doesn't do it for me. But we'll see.			"

												Core game play is much like the original DG with some additional interesting twists.   The graphics are improved of course, but the storyline didn't seem very compelling or particularly motivating.  Some things about the design choices are puzzling:   Reading paragraphs of text between episodes?   Rotating the view in only 90 degrees units at a time with a key?   What century is this?The increased complexity of the main menu & campaign selection screens seem unnecessary and distracting.Multiplayer is a great addition.   The orignal DG was one of my favorite games. DG2 is a fine game with lots of options, but doesn't seem to capture the same level of magic as the original.			"

												I never played Defense Grid 1 but I do tend to enjoy unique tower defense games. That said I didn't like this one.Pros:Tower effects are pretty well made I guessThat's itCons:Simplistic enemy design. The aliens have 2 that look like gorillas and the rest just look like land fish, they don't have much detail to them and some are so small it's hard to see any detail.Forced coop, the game says coop and it does, in fact, HAVE coop. That said it's basically just single player with 2 people. You share resources both have access to all towers, the only benefit to having another person is a second use of the special ability and possibly bringing towers with different upgrades. I honestly afk'd to take a shower while my friend beat the map we were on himself because sometimes it's a hinderence to have the other player, like when you go to place a tower and they use up just enough resources that you can't do it, or they remove your towers because they don't know why you placed it there. It was a pretty poorly thought out system.Tower upgrades unlock at random, my friend and I played every map together, but sometimes one of us would get an upgrade and the other wouldn't, or we'd both get upgrades but they were different, one of my first upgrades was for a tower we didn't unlock untill 2 levels later.The special abilities suck, once you gain access to the one that gives you resources there's no reason to bring the others ever. They all have a 5 min cooldown so the resource one is the only one that feels like it helps that much because it helps buy/upgrade towers. Compared to that a laser that kills maybe 10 enemies, or a beam to boost nearby towers for maybe 30 seconds is garbage.No easy way to find information, I wanted to find out what kind of upgrades I could hope to get for the towers but I can't find it online let alone in game. The games difficulty varies alot but part of the difficulty comes from them not explaining things (At least for us as we've never played the first game and maybe they explain it there). For example the alien discriptions seems to indicate a weakness enemies have but there's no way to find it. The towers uses aren't explained when they're first introduced unless they're obvious like the slow tower, so you have to place them to figure out what use they may have. The space ship that lands on the the core and releases enemies half way through the map wasn't explained either and caused our only loss.I tend to like tower defense that let you build mazes and alter the enemy path, but only about half the maps in this let you do that. The rest have you placing turrets on the side of the roads which is much less interesting.The dialog sucks, it's almost painful to listen to since it seems so awkward, so I turned off subtitles and lowered voice volume and event frequency to minimum so I never even know they're there. The fact the AI's pretty much just chit chat as you're trying to set up your defense means you probably won't pay much attention to it, or if you do it'll be more of a distraction than any game enhancement.The game gives you no time to see the map before you start the waves, I can understand not being able to build towers till the waves start but because we had to start building immediately there were often platforms we didn't notice till the level was almost finished. It's just something that screws you the first time you play but is made worse by the fact the game has absolutely zero replay value.The towers themselves are a mixed bag too, the laser turret for example is pretty much useless in our builds, it has the same damage as an inferno turret has slightly better range but is only single target which makes it much worse for us, it's line of sight issues also make it a pretty poor choice. The missle turret again wasn't explained at all so I didn't realized that it starts with almost no damage at it's first tier but upgrades it's damage very well. The concussion turret does good damage but fires insanely slow making it's first tier pretty useless too, also it fires at random and sometimes just feels like it spends too much time dropping grenade things on nearby turrets instead of on the enemy path. Some times the tower upgrades will make a pretty much useless turret a decent choice like acid bullets for the gun turret (Otherwise the gun turret is just good for cheap damage in the start of the game.) or can give turrets more use like having the concussion turret destroy shields, but other upgrades are just worthless like having the gun turret with it's weak damage target higher health enemies when it's much better suited to picking off the weak enemies.There's no way, aside from the ability, to aid in resource gain, it's really slow and makes it so you spend most of your time hovering over the build/upgrade buttons waiting for the last few points to tick in so you can push it. Though even with the lack of money to build things we were finding that the game was ending with us not even utilizing half the board on some levels so it feels like you don't have enough resource AND you don't have much use for it. It's pretty odd.All in all the game was pretty disappointing, and unlike most games which can easily make things better with friends this coop is forced and it means even playing with another person it'll be pretty easy to find playing this boring. It has no replayability as none of the levels are exciting enough to justify trying to do them better than you did the first time. Lastly the score system must be for some people who like watching a number go up because I couldn't care less if I even made it to bronze.			"

It's about more of the same with more annoying (not good) map design and a really uninteresting story this time around.   I gold medal'ed everything I could in #1, but I can't even be bothered to finish the campaign mode of #2.   It's hard to put a finger on exactly what's missing in it; some sort of simplicity or charisma has been lost in the iteration.			"

All you can do is vote on community created maps, and if they get enough votes a map appears in the in-game store for sale at $0.99. You cannot download them and play them for free.Currently there are 11 maps for sale for $0.99 each.This is horrible :(			"

Crap, are you kidding me? I can make my OWN levels? Giddy up....- Lot's more!Dislikes:- CRASHES. It's beta - hope they fix it. Been providing my dump logs.- I miss the ability to see the bad guys health bar like DG1. Trying to mouse over and click to see health is annoying and time consuming. (7/24/14 - found out the ""/"" key controls the health bar!)- I'd like the ability to turn on/off certain graphic special affects instead of the ""Fast Performance - High Quality"" selection.Looks like Hidden Path hit gold again with DG2 - just clean up the graphic options and stop the crashes.Nice job guys!

												I was a huge fan of the first Defence Grid, and for a while I worked hard to maintain my position as one of the top players on the ranking tables.  Unfortunately, the guys who made it did such a shoddy job that the rankings were rendered worthless almost instantly as it was so brazenly easy to cheat, thus undoing everyone's hard work.Unfortunately, the same level of bad design and poor decisions is apparent in the sequel, though this time, what rankles is the interface and ""the feel"" of the game.  Controls are far more clunky than first time round, with far too much consideration being given to controllers over mouse and keyboard, and the graphics, whilst more detailed, somehow manage to look worse than the first game.  A few additions have been made to the game, including boost blocks for your towers to stand on and alternative commanders that can loan additional powers to either you or your towers, but it all feels tacked on and lacklustre, while the main game seems forgotten.Maps are poorly designed and only really have one way of being handled, so the entire system of repetitive play to discover the optimal mazes and paths is rendered moot.All in all, I just cannot recommend it.  You might find some fun here, but if you were hoping for a fixed version of Defence Grid, look elsewhere.			"

												If you have never played Defense Grid 1 this game is not bad. If you have then you will be dissapointed.The scoring in the new game just doesn't let you get involved with the game, when I say scoring I mean resource generation as that is different from the score.The game is far too easy to beat, and I'm affraid it leaves me flat. If I could get new maps for DG1 I would rather go back and play that again.I have worked through every level and option on hard and found myself getting bored for the level to be over. Hard should be hard!Keeps crashing my Nvidia graphics card, and feels like you are playing the beta rather than the final game.			"

												I just loaded up the original game to make sure I wasn't going mad... The original is fantastic, I got a lot of joy out of it.DG2 on the other hand is absymal:* Graphics - Surely the plan was for them to be better than the original? Subjective maybe, but they arn't in my opinion* Lagging/frame rate - This game hasn't been optimized... I wouldn't be surprised if this is improved upon in the future but not at time of full release* Story - I didn't mind General Fletcher so much in the first game, but now he's got his friends with him they get on your nerves pretty quickly.* Interface - unnecessarily confusing and cluttered.If you've never played DG:Awakening - buy it! It's a great game. If you have and you liked it, and feel this will be as good - it's not, at least not in it's current state.Seriously, I can't see anything that has been imprvoed upon - the towers look rubbish compared to the originals, the boosts are a boring addition... I wish they took the original engine, added some new towers and aliens, some new maps - I'd have happily paid for it. Why reinvent the wheel - and make it a bit more square?4/10			"

												The game is OK. But it is no where near to live up to Defense Grid: The Awakening. - Campaign is way to easy.- Community made maps are sold to you.- Completing multiplayer achievements is nearly impossible to complete, as the built in multiplayer queue system never finds you another player. I dont know if it is buggy, or nobody else is queuing. Ive played this game around 20 hours, and I was done with the campaign after 3-4 hours. Now I after 20 hours, I am almost completely done with the game. DG: The Awakening I have played 150 hours + and still missing 2 achivements. It puts it in perspective how little this game has to offer compared to its prequel.			"

												Missing a lot of the charm and interesting design from the first one. The levels aren't as creative and the game is designed around using items equipped to your towers to have any chance at winning on the higher difficulties due to the stat bumping of enemies.They also changed how high scores work but didn't bother to list it in game. The UI is a mixed bag with information either missing or hidden compared to the first game.Upsides are a lot of different challenges per map and steamworks integration for new maps.  But it's a step down everywhere else compared to the first one which was one of the best TD games on the market.			"

												Did you like the original Defense Grid?  Well, have more of the same, only tweaked and given a big ol' graphics overhaul (not that the original wasn't pretty)  and a bunch of little features that at best are nothing but fun, and at worst can be ignored.  The writing and voice acting is still there so plenty of delightful exposition about raspberries.Perhaps the best new feature is that levels are no longer static.  Almost every level can be ""edited"" in pre-determined ways by clicking on the command ship and paying a few resources to add sections to the map.  Some sections add new areas to maze the aliens, others add new build locations to cover previously vulnerable areas.  Of course, after adding this feature it is never really mentioned in the story line so you have to figure out the feature even exists on your own.Air enemies/flight lanes were taken out, but they didn't really add anything to the game since a single level 3 missile tower would trivialize any flight path it could reach.  So now the Missile Tower is a long-range single-target bombardment tower (with the Meteor adding AOE/DOT bombardment).The only feature I don't wholly like is the tower upgrade system.  You can slot upgrades into your towers, upgrades which have some interesting effects (scatter shot to give AOE on gun towers, slow lasers, etc.).  The real problem is that the upgrades are randomly gifted after every completed mission (story or not) with no control over what you get.  This is exacerbated by the fact that almost every upgrade has multiple levels.  So you can be ""find"" level 1 shield busting concussion bombs, or you can find level 3 despite not having any previous versions of the item.  the only redeeming feature of the ""drop"" system is that it won't give you items you already have, or have a higher level of.Over all, and despite the brain-dead drop system, this game is over all a massive improvement and great sequal for the original Defnse Grid.  Don't let my winging about the drop system turn you off of a great purchase.			"

												Defense Grid 2 improves so much on the original, it's amazing. I'll start off with the sole negative and that is the game sorely needs a ""mute"" button so you don't have to listen to the AI's. I'm OK with listening to them the 1st, 2nd or even 3rd time, but when I'm banging my head against the proverbial wall, I finally just gave up & put my headphones on my desk instead of listening to them while I'm trying Level 12 incursion for the 14th time. Now that I have THAT out of the way, this game is just simply unbelievably awesome. Some people will say ""why on earth would I want to pay $24 for a TD game?""This game has so much variety, it extends the gameplay 20x over a simple playthrough. While it does this through game variants like frozen core, or grinder and a handful of others, it has several different difficulties ranging from easy, normal, hard & elite. Then compound that with competitive, or competitive sell and I don't even want to do the math to say how many different ways you can play this game.Then you have the entirely new tower upgrade system which will give you another 10-30 different powers PER TOWER to enhance tower abilities. These tower upgrades drop every time you complete a round and really change the landscape, literally. Where gun towers are uniformly weak on the first few levels, after you've completed the game, you're going to have some unreal deadly gun towers with abilities like ignore shields, or shield busters. Likewise with laser, target strongest enemy is a huge boost to not only survival but score as well. Each of these tower upgrades come in levels, so the first level might not seem that big but when you've got an Inferno that lights everything on fire & anything they in turn touch will cause others to get lit with 20% damage, you know you've got something special.This skill enhancement can make a level that was really tough the first time around, something really enjoyable the 2nd time around as you're able to contemplate entirely new strategies for how to employ an array of towers. As you get the score boost ability, thinking of how to soften everything up so that they fall into your kill zone (where you want 2 or even 3 score boost towers as their sphere of influence is rather small) to maximize your score can change with every iteration as you get new gun upgrades or obtain new special AI abilities. Because score is tied to resources, if you can avoid using one of the special weapons to kill things, you can employ the resource generator to give you even more resources to maximize score. Yes, you heard me, special weapons. Where before in DG1 you had the laser that you could employ, in DG2 you have about 8 special weapons (one for each AI in the campaign) so you can pick and choose and see which one fits your play-style. The ability to use your WASD keys to move around & look at things from different angles is a nice touch. As is the toggle ""F"" to fast forward (in DG1, you had to hold that sucker down all the time). I'm really looking forward to the creativity of people who create & sell levels using the free DG Architect. This will extend the game for a long time. Want some new variety? Visit the store! While I think the current pricing is a bit steep at $1.99 per level (I think $0.99 would be better), remember, you're not just buying one new level, you're buying about 20 with all the variants listed above. This game is phenomenal. I'll be putting a lot more hours into this! Highly and I mean Highly recommended.			"

												If you haven't played the original Defense Grid, then I strongly suggest you buy that game to see if you like the format, before purchasing the more expensive DG2. For the first time in a long time, I’m delighted to say that a developer has managed to bring out a sequel to an excellent game that is actually better than the original! They have improved just about everything, yet kept all the great aspects of the original. The graphics are noticeably better, they have added lots of nice statistics and data, there is even a running display showing how you are performing against your friends! Buy it now! It's great! Worth every penny! Very highly recommended.If you buy now and register the game here - CLICK ME![www.hiddenpath.com] ( requires your email ) , then you also recieve a key for a bonus DLC!!			"

												I was really excited when I heard DG2 was finally being released. I could not get enough of the original and enjoyed the core game and all the add-ons as well. I loved the gameplay, graphics, story and voiceovers. The new version falls short in every category. Why the developer chose to rebuild the game from the ground up is beyond me. The most disappointing aspect is the cheesy Candy Crush graphics. The graphics in the original were clean and crisp. You could make out the details of the aliens even when you were zoomed out – and they looked cool. Not so with DG2. Unless you are zoomed all the way in you can’t see much of the aliens outside of their healthbar. What is there is translucent and muddy. And the colors…..yuck. The towers looks like cheap plastic toys. The animation is cartoonish at best. I miss the cool looking meteor trails in the original not to mention the meteors themselves you could see when you zoomed in. Whether you zoom in or out, the graphics are a bitter disappointment.The gameplay is decent enough, although choppy and sluggish at times. I don’t know that I will make it to the end. If I do it will be because I have yet to see all of the new towers and overhead weapons. But if you like the original game for the graphics you will be disappointed. I can’t recommend this game compared to the original, at least not at this price. If you can get if for $5 them maybe. "

												*sigh*This is one of the most depressing reviews that I ever had to make. I was a huge fan of the original Defense Grid... but this is just awful. Only thing I can give praise is the voice acting, but the lines they have to read are bad too (which kind of defeats their use in the first place). Graphics look good on pictures, but I found myself to be surrounded by clutter and ""noise"". Nothing was as clear as it should be and all the little bits and pieces designed are... well are just completely swallowed by the environment. Story is a joke and I dont understand how it can be so bad, as most tower defense games dont have any story. Ah yes... the infamous ""workshop marketplace"". I felt I was being conned when I went there to look for maps after I finished the story. UI is absolutely awful... it not only looks bad, but it is so cluncky. Running this thing on two monitors makes the game go haywire (at least for me).			"

												Not as great as the first game but far more stable. In an attempt to gussy up the game, developers added a ton of menu options that get in the way of enjoying the game. If they had simply kept the same menu style as the first game everything would of have been fine. New commander options, removal of the command tower, nerfing of meteor tower range, no flying attach ships, too much has been removed. Play the first game, either on Steam or 360, buy this only if you are a die hard fan of the original.			"

												So let me preface this review with the following: I like tower defense games. I LOVE great tower defense games, but I generally like tower defense games. They are great to play while you eat food, download music, or generally aren't in a mood to be hardcore.With that said, I cannot recomment DG2 to tower defense likers or lovers. The price for the game is entirely too high, and the range of tower types and the interactions between towers are too few. I played Starcraft 1 custom maps with more depth than DG2. And I paid less for Starcraft 1. Crap.I'll be honest, I expected a pretty high quality TD for what DG2 charges. The story mode is cool and all, but for about 8-10 hours of gameplay (no speedup either), it really doesn't justify the price.Again, to re-iterate, the towers in this game have no cool interactions. There are no tower A buffs tower B effects, there are no 2 of this tower type adjacent to each other gets a neat bonus, and there is really no reason to buy this game. It has but the most basic of tower types (shoot fast, low damage OR shoot slow, high damage... whee), and the temporal tower is the ONLY effect tower, with an almighty and predictable slow effect.I will note that each tower has some special abilities you can unlock and add to them. However, from the ~ 2/4 I unlocked on each tower, they tend to be ""Deal more damage to shielded enemies"", or ""Target Priority: Strongest"". They could at least have made it ""Target Priority: Smartest"", so it would at least be usable.Save the money, go buy yourself WC3: TFT or SC2, and just play custom mapped tower defense there. Save your money. (When this is on steam sale, buy it for no more 5.99)			"

												As a tower defense fan, but not necessarily a person who goes out of their way looking for a specific game, I was rather surprised when I stumbled across DG2. Having said that, I'm glad I have. This review is taking a look at the game as it is, since I hadn't heard of Defense Grid until now and I have spent approximately 40 minutes in game at the time of writing.Here are a few things I picked up on which I are of reasonable quality for tower defense games:- Pathing. Yes I know that most tower defense games include pathing for strategy but this always ticks a huge box for me. Something else which was a pleasant surprise was that one of the beta levels initially started with a smaller map and it grew. I'm not sure whether or not this is new but it certainly changed the way I could think (as the initial area was tiny).- Towers. Look, with tower defense games you're always going to be seeing the same things, but that's okay. There's always going to be how each game balances towers in terms of cost and effectiveness. I like the towers presented in DG2, however I do believe they seem a little bit stale in regards to how similar they all appear.- Buff towers (I already forgot what they're called so I'm going to call them this). I'm sure most/all tower defense games have a tower that perform some sort of powerup to towers around it, but the way DG2 does this actually adds yet more strategy. The way DG2 does it, is that your buff tower is the cheapest tower you can build. Why might you ask? Well that's because initially it acts as an obstructor, something that can help you build your path. After you have enough resource for the tower you want to powerup, you place it on top of the buff tower and you can pay an extra 200 resource to improve the tower that's on top. Personally speaking, it's a nice touch and allows you to build more natural paths, rather than a cluster of towers next to eachother.- Health (Cores). Nice touch with how the enemies have to take all your cores, however the fact they also have to walk back makes this relatively easy (at least on story/open/normal. I haven't had time to look at other modes yet which I'm sure are going to be a blast. Then again this is probably just me nitpicking at stuff I haven't had a proper look at), but I digress. I like how different enemies can carry a certain amount of cores (although so far without paying too much attention only the big guys carry more than 1). I certainly think this is an interesting thing and hopefully there's the possibility of an enemy that can carry a lot of cores!- Enemies. I thought the enemies at the start were fairly standard (fast enemies, grouped enemies, large/slow/painintheass), however upon right clicking upon one (that's how you view their stats) I noticed the abstract text went more into detail about their movement, with one type of enemy being slower around corners. I found this interesting because again it makes you think about optimal pathing.So my conclusion is this. It's a great game for what's already available and it has the potential to be something amazing for the tower defense genre. Whilst graphics aren't necessarily important for tower defense games, DG2 looks pretty, although I do wish it had anti-aliasing support. For a beta it works well, and if you go in expecting something more polished than a beta release, then you'll be disappointed, however if you can look past that and see the potential then this one is certainly a keeper and one you'll enjoy when the full release comes around.

												First: DG2 has different game modes - that's the only reason. But after playing some, DG2 did wrong what DG1 did right.I am a DG(1) player since the beginning, I also ranked very high in DG1 scores and with this said - I chose the path to (score) competition in DG. My review of DG2 is mostly based on the following setting: competition, hard.Pros: + many game modes+ towers seem balancedCons:- intransparent scoring- to much abusive potential on any other mode than ""competition""- simple, imbalanced alien waves- no replay valueNeutral:- many different configuration tweaks for towers- different ""orbital lasers""- boost tower boostsRanking:The best option to generate score is the dulling doing of ""gather aliens"", ""herd"" them by building and selling towers and use the orbital resource laser. In normal game mode, there is no reward for an excelent tower placement! The score is given for abusing the whole game principle. Of course there is a ""competition"" mode, in which selling tower is prohibited and this exploid isn't possible. So yes, you can play the game on a competetive level, but there aren't much others doing the same. The ranking in competition - hard counts areound 50 people at all; for comparisson, normal - normal there are round about 18k+.With the new scoring and the new game modes, DG2 has become a casual gamers game. There are a lot of upgrades, some choices in the starting setup and a waste amount of game modes. So in conclusion, it is more of a ""DG1s"" except the changed scoring. Waves:Many levels staring with regulat swarm aliens and the only difficult is, to kill the few ""big ones"".Within the waves there will be some fast or very tough enemies - even if your defense line worked highly efficient till this time, you'll have to adapt it only for these some aliens! It is doable without a doubt, but at least for me it feels just a bit anyoing.Conclusion:At least for me, there is no motivation in game modes beside ""competition"". I miss a gamemode with the extras but without the ability to sell towers. So it is DG1 with the lack of the (score relevant) orbital laser.Also I dislike the scoring system. The scoring system of DG1 added a strategic depht, which DG2 hasn't. (As I could see in the forums, some didn't got the whole effect of the DG1 scoring system - these are mostly the ones which like the new one in DG2)Price:As I am writing this review, the price is 22.99€ - even if I paid more for the alpha, I can't reccomend this price tag. For better value get DG1 with the expansion packs. I think that somewhat <11€ would reflect the value of this game - because it is such an eye candy for a TD game.			"

												DG1 proved to be the absolute top of TD games; In DG2, by the looks of the beta, it is likely that they will do it again.  Gameplay is really the key to this game. The flow will be different (in some ways) to DG1, But the feel and the basic gameplay will still be there.  There are a large number of additions and enhancements.  But you can take or leave those. the game is the thing, and that looks to be as good, if slightly different, to the first.  If I were asked, ""is it worth the money?"" the answer has got to be ""Yes, absolutely!"". You will get DG1 for free with the pre-order (not sure about after that) which in itself is incredible value.  I think I paid $5 on a steam sale, and have racked up 600 hrs on this game just in casual play.If you are into strategy at all, (and maybe don't get free time in chuncks much larger than 30-45 mins - being a parent will do that to you), then this is the game for you.  It is really brilliant, challenging, yet not overwhelming, with a decent learning curve, and interesting yet not intrusive story.  You can play a level in 20 mins (or less sometimes) or you can stick with it for hours. It is a fun game you can lose yourself in quite easily.  A definite thumbs up and a must buy if you dont already have it!			"

												I liked the first Defense Grid but this one was a let down.  Controls are a bit funky, all mouse  movement moves the camera with your selector locked in the middle of the screen which was a bit odd and annoying.  The look and feel of the game just didn't do it for me.  It seemed a bit more toony and the turrets didn't look as cool to me.  Where's the unF of the old cannon?			"

Defense Grid 2: Good ol' fashioned tower defenseGreat game for those who like traditional tower defense games. Good variety of towers and a decent progression of maps to play through. Paid tower upgrades during the maps are fairly well balanced and the weapons are pretty satisfying at taking out the enemies. Unfortunately, not a great varieity of enemies, and the challenges get repetitive pretty quickly. The system of weapon upgrades is also somewhat unclear, and tower increases seem to come at random times, which can be frsutrating when reaching the last chapters and needing real fire power. Overall a great choice for those who want some old fashioned tower defense action and really aren't interested in much of a story or a deep dive in weapon vs. alilen strategy. "

												Where to start with Defense Grid 2 except ""OMG""? This game is so intense and filled with so much new mechanics I had to replay entirely the first Defense Grid just to measure the improvement (true story).~ Spoiler alert : a few tips and tricks are listed at the end of the evaluationThe first Defense Grid featured specialized towers and one deadly strike from the heavens. The second opus features almost the same towers, with a twist: you now can build them on top of Boost towers, and activate a special effect on them: Disrupt shields, Overcharge towers or Boost score - your choice.On top of that, you'll meet new AI on each mission, and pick one of them to support your efforts. Each AI provides you with an advantage that can be triggered and requires some time to be ready again: the classical strike from above, more resources to spend, overcharging a group of towers... - your choice again.And if you think that would be enough, think again. Not only the towers can be upgraded from level 1 (green) to level 3 (red); but you now can tweak each of them with nice improvements like: revealing hidden enemies, damaging over time, focusing on the biggest enemy ... - your choice !To keep the pressure on, the clock of each mission starts without waiting for you to analyse the layout. So you'll have to think fast and fail a lot before you nail the level and reach higher scores. Luckily, you can go back to the previous checkpoint and readjust your strategy (there are more checkpoints so you don't feel like being forced to restart entirely a level).~ And now some tips and tricks (don't read them until you hit a wall of difficulty)First, the levels can have the same entry / exit point; or a different entry and exit points. Some maps have multiple entries and exit points and can be tricky!Second, the levels can be roads surrounded by tower locations, or made of large chunks for concrete where you'll have to build a path to channel the aliens.Even if it is possible to fill a level with level 1 towers and still win, ultimately, you'll want to concentrate devastation on carefully selected spots where the aliens will walk multiple times. So, what are the best / worst towers in the game ? On my own, I mostly play using Concussion, Temporal, Laser, Machinegun and Cannon. Sometimes Missile. The Concussion is so powerful you'll eventually forget the Inferno, the Tesla and the Meteor. It's a shame but you're not here to concede anything.Next questions are: where should you place the towers, how should you combine them, and what are the best boost to give them. Here are my suggestions.First, in each level, locate the entry & exit points. Then assess if you can change the path of not. If you cannot change the path, locate where you have bottlenecks and paths that can be targeted twice (or more) with a single tower. Usually, the Core Center is one of them.Once you've located or created these bottlenecks, decide where are the best spots to concentrate damage. Sometimes it's at the very beginning of the level, sometimes close to the Core Center, sometimes somewhere else.Then:- Build a Concussion (on a boost if you can channel the aliens, or benefit from back-and-forth; and on land if you cannot change the path) then at least a second one close to the first so you can combine the effects). A good boost is Overcharge or Score Boost if you aim for the top of the Ladder :)- Right after the Concussion, build a Laser that will continue to burn the aliens. A good boost is Overcharge - unless these are far from the Temporal so Disrupt is a better choice (laser don't go through shields)- Build a Temporal close to the Concussion towers to slow down the fastest aliens and nicely melt the other ones. A good boost is Disrupt, to remove those nasty shields. (And when I say "" melt"" I literally mean ""melt"").- Build Machinegun(s) near the ""entry"" of your Concussion / Temporal / Laser combination. A good boost is Overcharge unless there aren't close to a Temporal with Disrupt ; then Disrupt is a better choice.- Build Cannon(s) to cover either or both the entry and exit of your Concussion / Temporal / Laser combination. A good boost is Overcharge.- Make sure Cannon(s) or Machinegun(s) are protecting the Core Center. A temporal can help too.- Build Missile(s) to cover the Core Center, Kill zones and especially exits - you don't want one remaining alien on the brink of death getting away with your precious cores :) No sir, you don't!About the ""tweaks"" in the towers, here you enter the realm of preferences. Usually I use ""Focus on biggest target"" on Machinegun, Cannon, Laser and Missile since the Concussion will usually get rid of the tiny swarms. On Temporal I try to boost the slowing down effect. On the Concussion I try to raise the damage.But once you're acquainted will the levels, feel free to experiment! You may choose to tweak you towers to slows down the aliens as much as possible, or to damage them overtime, or pierce their shields. (Now this game sounds like your regular ARPG, doesn'it it?)Have fun!			"

												This game has bugs all over the place.  Being a kickstarter and having played the first one and enjoyed it I am extremely disapointed.  The idea on the second one has some pros; however the lack of descriptions on map selection, multiplayer and single player continual booting from the game due to disconnect (not disconnecting at all) has left me an angry gamer, not a happy gamer with a new game.  Take this back to beta and testing and release it when it is actually ready.			"

												It’s amazing to think that it’s been six years since Hidden Path released the acclaimed Defense Grid: The Awakening, often cited as one of the defining tower defense games. For the sequel, Hidden Path took to Kickstarter and with overwhelming support the game became a reality. And the reality is that Defense Grid 2 is just as good as the original, totally nailing the strategic and addictive elements that are so crucial for any tower defense game. Unfortunately, the reality is also that Defense Grid 2 is basically identical to its predecessor which is definitely mildly disappointing.If you ever played a tower defense game, you’ll be right at home here. If not, the short but clear tutorial will get you up to speed. Basically, you have to defend your base and stop aliens taking your cores by building towers with various abilities. For example, Inferno towers set groups of aliens aflame at close range, Temporal towers slow them down whereas Missile towers deal massive damage at long range. All tower types serve a specific purpose and you will make good use of them all in order to defend each map. Just like the towers, the aliens as well come in different forms. Some are large and slow, some are small but fast, some have stealth, others regenerate or spawn other aliens. Naturally, enemy variety is crucial in order to ensure each tower type is useful. Sometimes the paths the aliens take will be set, other times you will have the option to block certain routes carving out the longest and most winding path you possibly can in order to ensure maximum tower usage. The map design is nothing short of fantastic walking a fine line between intentional design and player experimentation.Defense Grid 2 looks and sounds great. Each tower is distinct and easily recognizable which becomes extremely important in later rounds. Sometimes you’ll have a bit of time to just observe the glorious carnage unfold before you. Most of the time, however, you will be scrambling to make important but quick decisions. Every wave will pose a different threat and you don’t have much time to assess what is the best move. You also have limited resources which you earn as you clear each wave. This is where Defense Grid 2 truly shines. It seems so effortless and yet so many tower defense games fail on this tactical level. It’s truly a fast-paced, action-packed strategy game.By far the worst aspect of the game is the storytelling. The original was light on narrative, you only had a single AI advisor which had something to say from time to time about the current happenings. This time, you have six or seven badly written and acted AIs who love to yammer on about whatever is going on and even beyond that. It quickly gets really annoying and detracts from the overall experience.Even though I am a bit disappointed by the lack of new towers and new ideas and the awful, intrusive storytelling, the truth is that Defense Grid 2 is a very good game and an easy recommendation to anyone who is remotely interested in tower defense games.7 OUT OF 10 (GOOD)			"

												I did my best to like this game. For 5 bucks its worth it. However it kept crashing on me when i rewinding 5 or more waves. I kept rewinding and crashing my gameplay for 2 hours. So if its only sale buy it. Otherwise NO. you are better off trying the first game because the first game offered more maps, cheaper price, required some thinking, monsters and towers maybe lower graphical quality but very defined characteristics( DG2 everything sort of blends into together).What I hate?-Game does not include ingame statistic like in DG1. How many monsters of that type you killed, total damage, speical used, etc. -You can either buy modded player made maps(9-12 last time i checked), or you can go to an unoffical website which i refuse to use when the company could of incorporated Free map content created by users on the Steam Workshop. How it currently works is people vote on your work, then it gets sold on the store. They should of at least split the community of modders who want to make money and modders who want to share for free... ON Steam Workshop.- New scoring system doesn't make sense. I have created the exact same build and I still can't figure it out and Alternating Build order. I did it on Map 3 Suspension with very few build choices/placement.- Rewind crashes at times, at the very least I remember the confirmed crash for Mission 10 Breach, Super Grinder Mode - (Open Type)What I like? - Graphics are a little better. Lowest setting to Highest looks alike though, even with me being on 1920 x 1080 resolution - Old scoring system/ resource earning from DG1 exist. - No more flying units- You can backup and rewind 1 wave at a timeSystem Spec The CPU/OS/HDD means i tried all possible combinationsCPU: FX-9590/ FX 6300 GPU: GTX 770 4gbOS: Window 8.1/ Win 10RAM G Skills 1333 2x4gbMotherboard: Asus Crosshair V Formula-ZH100i Installed on both an Samsung Evo 840 120gb SSD/ Western Digital Blue 1 TB HDD and yet still crashed			"

												Great basis of a game. Very solid tower defense. However...Steam workshop, you must pay for maps singularly. From what ive read so far, if i wanted to bring out a free map for dg2, it would not be possible. Like skyrim, people are being forced to pay to use the steam workshop.Big no, no.People should always have a choice.Another bad point of the game, if you do not like grinding, stay away. 108 hours in i only have about 3 quarters of the tower upgrades. Which makes the game tedious, if you want to play competitively score wise. Simply put, you cannot play on the hardest difficulty without these tower upgrades.Imo, if its on sale buy it. Otherwise stick to dg1 for the time being. The game also runs rather bad considering the graphics.But it is still a solid tower defense otherwise.72/100Edit: Thankfully, there is a site now which you can go to upload your own or download other peoples custom maps.

												DG2 or Defense Grid 2 is a Tower defense game where you defend power cores from a herd, army, horde and flood of aliens of all kinds, using towers of all kinds, each with their own use and abilities.Okay it's not anything new if all you look at is all that, but this game hasm ore content than any of the online flash games you can play for free.It's got a storymode, those same missions have up to 9 different different mode, and there's about 6 chapters, each with 4 each, so there's about 24 different levels.Don't forget how there's cooperative multiplayer, normal multiplayer which acts like a versus mode, and... that's as much as I've found out, having spent all 5 hours on the story mode.the game's music is something I've never once got tired of, and the dialogue always entertains me.I usually always hate getting into a series at the 2nd game or even later, as i have no idea what is what or who is who, however after 12 missions, I can easily say for a fact that I love the series and i love the characters and I find it easy to get invested into the game.Inbetween missions, there's dialogue which seems to be talking about something different than what is going on in the story, however, 12 missions in (and having a creative mind helps) I can't help but feel as if it's talking about the Power Cores you protect.I don't want to spoil too much so lets get on with the reviews other bits. The graphics and appearances of things in the game are rather nice to look at, and the game doesn't lag a single bit, even if every tower spot is filled with towers and literally the whole screen is just almost nothing but towers.The gameplay however is awesome, with alot of other Tower Defense games in mind.Upgrading towers is simple and straightforward, and no single tower is the be-all or end-all to any map. You can even use a single tower for most maps and beat it.The game is very simple in difficulty aswell. Easy is actually Easy, Normal is what Normal usually should be, Hard is actualy hard, and Elite is as hard as any after-Hard difficulty.The camera is controlled by the mouse, with the cursor locked at the center, and the cursor on any in-game menu before the end level screen is locked to go up or down a certain amount, preventing you from accidentally clicking elsewhere.Honestly I love this game, I just simply love it.Overrall, I give this game a 9/10, It's jsut nothing but a pleasure to play. If you like strategy, tower defense or wave-based games then pick this up.The only things I don't like, is how the menu of modes don't display medals which are earned, though that may be how I've only played on Easy, and thye only appear on the menu itself on Normal. The game also doesn't have a pause feature, though I imagine that might detract from the game somehow.			"

												Hey!I have only 36 minutes on D♥♥♥♥nd am already writing review. I wish I had read negative ones before buying (I only did positive ones) and even if i did, truth be told, I wouldn't believe them. Screenshots look amazing and DG1 was amazing - so - how can it be bad?Well, truth is, all the negative posters are right. Game is a huge dissapointment.I am a fan of DG1 and simply LOVE it and there isn't a negative thing I can say about it; I particularly love the interest and scoring system and I try to be top 1% on all missions. So from tactical / strategic point, I am ""demanding costumer"".Now to DG2:- menus and GUI are plain horrible (try it and see it)- resources raise at 10/tick, regardless if you have 0 or 5000 - what's up with interest and its tactical value? (here I have to say, maybe i haven't played long enough to get to that point and it is in game later on, but not at beginning (it was in DG1))- graphics: its really ugly. Screenshots were beautiful, game itself is not. It makes you believe screenshots are art-concepts and not from within actual game, cuz those few colorful pixels moving around on your screen are far from what screenshots advertise. Further, the game itself feels ""wrong"". I don't know how to explain better, but movement of towers building, of towers upgrading is just ""cheap"". DG1 had it done superbly, each upgrade of tower took exactly the same amount of time and you knew exactly when it will collapse and come back up as stronger version. I don't doubt that timing-wise here it's the same, but the way it is animated? It feels cheap and wrong.Having said that I played 3 missions, scored 3 golden medals and what I am still wondering about (after I closed the game as I had enough of dissapointment) is - how I could NOT get them, since i killed all aliens and kept all cores. Where is the difference between my score and score of other players if all aliens are killed, game lasted same duration (all waves) and we got same amount of ""resource ticks"". Where does the difference appear?And even positive posters wrote about stupid secondary tower abilities upgrade system and getting mk2 type abilities over mk1 in total random fashion.All in all what I grasped in 36 minutes of playing is that this game appears to be colorful cluster♥♥♥♥ of pixels made for 10 years olds who get sick of repetitive stuff and challenges in 10 minutes, having lots of extra abilities compared to dg1 (secondary tower abilities, colorful-yet-ugly tower animations and circles and generals to help with) and it has absolutely none of old DG1 charm.I'm going back to DG1...

Balanced adjustment to strategy with the use of boost towers4.) New worlds to explore and defend from alien hordesAdd in multiplayer, different orbital strike methods, and updated graphics, and you've got a brand new opportunity to get your tower defense on.I'm looking forward to game time when the fully-polished complete version of the game comes out.  Just like the old Defense Grid, DG2 promises to be a solid and balanced casual tower defense game.			"

												After completing the first defense grid, I could not wait to see what they had in store with the second installment.The buildup throughout the game is well balanced and keeps your attention towards the game and its progress locked in.The game is perfect at it difficulty levels, however as an old Warcraft tower defense lover, once you find the pattern in the game, it becomes rather easy.None the less challenging, and fun for hours. After completing the whole campaign, the additional missions per map make these maps more challenging, and address to level of difficulty to the game to what it should be.I believe the game is well prices, and definitely worst the hours and excitement it offers.

												Rewiev based on beta version. The original Defense grid is still one of the best (if not THE BEST) tower defense games, leaving all the Flash wannabees in dust. Judging from the beta, Defense grid 2 so far looks like excellent sequel and successor to the throne. All the core elements are in place - hordes of aliens trying to steal your power cores, familiar defense towers and some new ones, great voice actor (raspberries!) and varied landscapes to defend. Completely new is the possibility to shape the playing field by optionally adding or moving certain segments of terrain which gives us new options to route the aliens, create the perfect killing zones and will result in more varied personal strategies. Graphics are excellent and improved to today's standards but some beta players (including me) feel they are a bit too colourful and shiny and overwhelming at times. Developers have responded to the feedback on beta forums and we'll see if there is a change or an option for a more ""realistic"" look.I'm very much looking forward to the final release of D♥♥♥♥nd I recommend to all tower defence lovers to put this game on their wishlist!

A Paladin's Steam Review: Defense Grid 2. A Disappointing Sequel On Multiple Levels.Genre: Single Player & Multiplayer Narrative Driven Tower Defense. Developed and Published by: Hidden Path Games & 505 GamesPlatform: Windows, MacOSX and LinuxBusiness Model: Base Game + Community Created Levels Sold in DG2's Store. One of the Backers of their Kickstarter PreambleI was one of the original backers on Kickstarter and gave $20 to help get this game published. I did this because Defense Grid The Awakening had been one of my favorite tower defense games and the developers had a solid track record of games up till then. Unfortunately, the Kickstarter was fraught with funding problems and the game we have gotten since is, in my opinion, a pale shadow of what this series used to be. So, let’s talk about Defense Grid 2.Story ThoughtsThe main campaign story…..ergh….well, let’s talk about it. One: The humor is based on the AIs saying whacky things, but it gets tiresome as the campaign goes on. It’s not that well written, especially when you have the next problem. Two, its got way too many characters. Listening to so many AIs chatter on as you try to setup towers can multiply how tiresome the bad dialogue gets. Three: It’s trying to have a serious story undertone while all this “wackiness” is going on. Which causes the game to fail at pulling both tones off. Fourth and final: the voice acting is cringe-worthy. You’ll recognize at least a few of the voice-actors if you have watched certain sci-fi series in the past five years. Their performances range from barely adequate to cringe-worthy overacting, despite General Fletcher from the original game still bringing his a-game. PC OptimizationOne of the biggest aggravations I had with this game the entire time is the optimization. It’s awful. It’ll drop to 50-55FPS with just a few aliens on the screen. Add in a lot of special effects from the towers and a whole horde of aliens and it will tank down to 20-30FPS. I thought I even noticed it go to 10FPS at some points. That is simply unacceptable for any game to have that poor a performance level, even if we ignore how ludicrous it is for a tower defense game to lag this badly. The performance doesn't improve even if you set the game to its lowest quality. The game’s FPS drops just as hard regardless. I did contact the devs about the problem but they never got back to me. I’m not happy about that lack of communication. (At the time of this review, I have a quad-core CPU and a Nvidia 660ti. My computer should NOT be the problem here.)PC Settings and UIThe graphic settings menu is worse than the game’s optimization. All you will find is a quality slider, resolution options and V-Sync, that’s all it has. Not having tweakable settings really bothers me. Anti-Aliasing is completely missing and so is Anisotropic Filtering by the looks of it. Both of which would have really made the game look better. I have no idea how it could have shipped without even AA in the quality slider. At least the audio settings menu is very competent, with plenty of sliders to let you change the level of music, effects, and how often the AI will talk. (I would set the frequency to its lowest.) Even the keys can be rebound on keyboard and mouse and controllers. So, to see such a lacking graphics option menu is really bizarre because everything else you would need/want is here. There are a multitude of subtle bugs such as the Temporal Tower not slowing aliens or dots not affecting aliens but nothing game breaking as far as I encountered. I’ll give the game some credit, it gives you a lot more information up front and in-game with line graphs and heat-mapping to show how and what you’re doing. The UI at least feels more functional in most cases, even if I dislike how the menus are handled. GraphicsBut there is one thing that really gets me and that’s how indistinct all the towers and aliens are. The animations are incredibly simple, the towers are difficult to tell apart and the sound assets are really weak. Gone is the epic rain of fire(s) from your meteor towers, the loud report of the cannon towers blasting aliens away and the mini-explosions from concussion towers. Instead, all you can hear is bullets from gun towers, the occasional laser being spat out and that’s about it. All of which looks & sounds really unimpressive. Sure, you can hear the rest of the towers if you really strain your hearing, but that’s not the point. It lacks distinctness. All the towers just melt together to disappointing results. Then there’s the tower upgrades, I hate the new system which has you building towers on platforms and then selecting an anti-shield upgrade, a power upgrade or a score-increase upgrade. It feels overly complicated and unnecessary compared to how DG1 handled it with the command tower. The alien designs are much worse and have the same basic problems as the towers do. They have less character and feel indistinct as you slaughter 1,000s of them per level. You only notice the different speeds each one moves at. For a game on a new engine, this leaves a lot to be desired. Individual Level DesignI’m not inspired by the level design at display here. Graphically, they are just ok. A few of the levels they showed off at PAX and other big public events were the best they had. Only one or two others were a bit different from the norm, Checks and Balances, which comes really late in the campaign, has a unique gauntlet run with six different lanes to stop. Another is Split Decision that has you defending two core stations, though the difficulty spike in this level is unreal. I was really hoping they would go all the way with this new feature they had announced a long while ago that has different parts of the level opening up as the level progressed. I had hoped this would require us to change tactics on the fly but it really doesn't. Its relegated to a few levels and doesn't really do much more than extend the maze you've built up. But here's my main issue. Each level feels aimed at having only one way of accomplishing it and you have to stick to that one goal, otherwise you'll fail. Workshop Anti-SupportWorkshop support for this game is abysmal. Basically, level makers have to get their maps upvoted by the community and then approved by Hidden Path Entertainment to be sold. Yes, that's right. Sold. Sold on the in-game store. While they say that royalty will be paid out to the level makers, I have to wonder how much. It's little wonder that this game only has 16 items at the moment. The way that the Workshop support currently works strikes me as greedy. There hasn't been any DLC made for the game yet but why bother when you can just sell what other people make. It's....disgusting. Final ThoughtsThe more I play Defense Grid 2, the more I loathe everything about it. Getting through the main campaign of around 10 hours was a chore unto itself. I got to the point that I set it to easy just so I could see the ending, which wasn’t worth it. I didn’t try multiplayer, I didn’t try the different modes for each level, I didn’t give Steam Workshop a go, I didn’t do anything besides the main campaign because by the time I finished the main campaign, I was done. I wasn't having any more fun. I do not recommend DG2. As a long time player of Defense Grid, there is a sheer lack of enjoyment to be had in this sequel.Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]Read My Review of Defense Grid: The Awakening "

												The DG series gets the two important elements of tower defense right: game balance & snappy UI.  A balanced TD game requires the player to think the type, order, timing, and the location of tower placement rather than just following formulas.  Finding the correct answer to the puzzle provided by the map is the fun part.  This means each tower must be unique and have its own role, which DG does well.  The crystal stealing and retrieval system adds more depth as usual, since you need to think about the order of the towers on the way back.All this is wasted with a clumsy UI where it's easy to make mistakes or it takes time to perform actions.  DG utilizes mouse and keyboard shortcuts  (both can be used for camera pan) and intuitive indictars to show what's going on at all times.  It doesn't beat Defender's Quest's unit key assignments but it's the best out of 3D TD games I've ever played.  Being able to rewind a botched level without cost saves time so it works well as a casual game to play during a limited amount o ftime, instead of forcing players to replay the whole level.  (So many TD games these day take 20 minutes to go through a level, only to fail at the last wave)DG2 has more content, refinment, and expandability compared to DG1, so it's definitely worth it for DG1 fans, or for those that want a solid TD game and haven't played DG1.  If you've played DG1 and didn't like it, then DG2 won't make you happy either.  For those who like ""RPG elements"" (aka leveling and loot), I'd recommend Defender's Quest and Prime World Defenders.			"

The New Gold Standard In Tower DefenseDefense Grid 1 was, for all intents and purposes the best tower defense game ever made. DG2 is a sequel that builds upon it's predecessor in every way. Hidden Path entertainment knocked it out of the park with the first title, providing high intensity action, a beautiful, devastated alien world to play in, a great difficulty curve that let you learn the intricacies of the gameplay, yet still kicked your butt if you weren't careful, and best of all, wrapped that up in (what for the genre was almost enitrely new) a well thought out and compelling story.DG2 has a raft of new fetures, including a new scoring system, new towers, new tower modifications and upgrades, an expanded range of spcial weapons, new challenge modes, dynamic maps that can entirely shift your strategy in the middle of a game, new alien menaces to fight, a comprehensive statistics system with global leaderboards, Steam Workshop Modding support for new maps, and even competitive and co-operative multiplayer.If you like the tower defense genre at all, Get DG2. you will not be dissapointed one bit.

												I was a little worried playing the Alpha then Beta. The game had many issues. When DG2 was finally released, all my concerns evaporated. What a fantastic and totally fun game. It will take months to get gold in all levels, modes and skills sets. The art work if fantastic, the story fun and makes you laugh. The game play is challenging but not too hard. I love everything about this game. Thanks Hidden Path for another great game.p.s.  Can't wait for Windborne to be updated with new content.			"

												I played a lot of Defense Grid 1 on my 360, so when my friend told me he had a beta key for the second one on steam I was a bit excited. I played the first few levels, it was alright but I do not see how it's enough of an improvment over the first one to warrant $25 dollars. I would pick this game up for $5 or $10 dollars, but $25 is insane. Also this game is pretty damn difficult even on normal, which isn't necessarily a bad thing just keep that in mind.To buy this game for $25 you must either be a Tower Defense fanatic, somewhat rich or a fool.Keep playing the first one, wait for this to go on 75%- sale.

I'm a person that hops from tower defense game to tower defense game (Defense Grid, Plants .vs. Zombies, Anomaly, Sanctum TD) and this game follows the trend of successfully building upon a genre that became stale very quickly. There is a lot to look forward to from this title.			"

												This is a worthy successor to the first game. The game mechanics were already solid, so rather than changing them the developer added more depth to them.You can now build a booster tower platform on the ground, on which you can place the real tower. This booster can act like a cheap wall when you don't put anything on top of it. With a tower, the booster can be upgraded to increase the tower's damage, to disrupt shields and show cloaked enemies, or to increase how many points you get from enemies killed next to it.The orbital laser is now a power granted by your AI general. You can pick from a number of different generals to change the power to something else, such as boosting the effectiveness of your towers or getting extra resources.In the ""You monster"" DLC of the first game, GlaDOS would occasionally change something about the level, such as raising or lowering sections. In DG2 you can buy/order some of these changes from your command tower. Getting access to an extra tower in a critical location can turn the game for you.The difficulty ramps up over the course of the campaign. In the first 6 levels I was able to get a gold medal on normal difficulty without putting any real effort into it. Build a strong defense, then the last 3-5 waves don't build anything to rake in the points needed to get a gold medal. At no point were my cores in danger of getting stolen.Then I got to level 7, where there were two independent lanes to defend. It was brutal. The first 13 waves were reasonably easy to do without losing cores. Then I lost my first core. Rewind a few levels, try a different strategy. The cores remained safe. Then around level 18 the boss monsters started coming in, and group cloakers, and group shielders. In the end I managed to keep all my cores by rewinding whenever I lost one, but it took two hours and only netted a silver medal. Next up was level 8 and it was just as challenging, and once again I had to settle for silver.This game offers a very good challenge if you don't want to settle for anything less than gold.			"

												This game is amazingly good and improves upon Defense Grid 1 in pretty much every way. If you loved DG1 you will without a doubt enjoy the hell out of this game. However if the original defense grid did nothing for you, you likely would want to pass on this one. I know I will get a good 50 hours or so at least pouring over all of the challenges and harder levels of missions. I have yet to try multiplayer as the lack of a server browser is kind of a turn off but it seems easy enough to play with a friend, just not exactly easy to play with strangers with this xbox like matchmaking. Speaking of xbox this game does have a bit of console qualities but never so much so that it detracts seriously from the game. Also be sure to enable/force anti aliasing in your graphics settings outside of the game as this game lacks any AA options (and can look jaggy because of it unless forced)   PROS:  -Excellent, highly addictive gameplay that rewards creative thinking and allows good replayablity.  -Tons of modes and ways to play each map (20 included in the main campaign) -3 types of multiplayer modes for each map -Plays and feels exactly like Defense Grid should, feels familiar instantly but with the added depth and upgrade options the first game lacked.  -Far more varied locations and map types than DG1, also some really amazing maps here that will be instant classics.  CONS: -Somewhat homogenized tower and alien design. The towers especially lack the grittiness of the originals.  -Sounds are at times lacking punch, especially the cannon sound which was far better in DG1 -Monetized steam workshop (?) -Totally incoherent background noise for a story. What are these 4 robots talking about again, I have no clue.			"

												Defense Grid 2 is a traditional tower defense game and the sequel to the excellent Defense Grid: The Awakening.The Great:- This series is the pinnacle of the tower defense genre, and this game continues that and expands upon it- Level design is outstanding to provide just the right amount of difficulty and reward- New elements added including the missile tower are nice improvements and increase the overall satisfaction of the game- New RPG elements are added to towers to tailor your playstyle- Multiple different types of alternative challenges are provided so that there is incredibile replayability- Steam workshop support to increase longevity of the gameThe Good:- The game looks and runs very well- The game only marginally improves on the first game (but the first game was great)The Bad:- The story is more or less standard, but there are too many characters that don't add anything- The story dialogue bits happen after you complete a level and more often than not you quickly skip to the next level without thinking and miss parts of the story- The first Defense Grid had a limited amount of clever humor that did not overstay its welcome.  This game tries too hard to make dialogue funny that really isn't- Some small bugsConclusion:The Defense Grid series remains the definitive tower defense experience, and Defense Grid 2 - while mostly iterative - only extends and enhances that lead.  I highly recommend the game for anyone interested at all in the tower defense genre			"

												I've 100's of hours of gameplay logged on DG-1, it's a great game, and was really looking forward to DG2, but I'm pretty much done with DG-2 after 19 hours. (I wish there was a ""maybe"" option)It's hard to put my finger on why it's just not as much fun (subjectively) or doesn't have the same longevity.The developers have added a lot to the sequel. You have the same familiar gameplay and towers, but now you have boost towers which give added abilities to the towers built on them. In addition to the orbital cannon of the original, you can now choose other powers from the space station. Instead of one general AI, you now have multiple AI's vying for your attention and telling the story as you play through the campaign. The number of challenges per map has increased and there are hundreds of challenges. You can see the high scores of people on your friends list who have played the game and can try to beat their scores. The developer has really added a lot of content to the sequel while still keeping things familiar to those who have played the original.I know this sounds silly, but perhaps there was too much added. You get lost in a sea of menu's and sub-menu's which take a while to figure out. Multiple AI's mean multiple voice actors and some were great and some were terrible. The AI's tell the story in the present while you are playing the campaign, and the background to the story is told via text between levels, but I just didn't find the story interesting. There was a lot of DLC, some free, for the first game, but there's almost none for this game. The game talks about using the steam workshop, but you can't download user created content from the workshop, you can only vote on maps you can't play, and those with the most votes might be added in a DLC pack in the future. The game promises to send you a steam code for DLC map if you register for the newsletter. I did three times and still no code. Again, it's hard to put my finger on why DG1 was much better because it's subjective, but DG2 just seems to be missing it's soul. The humor of the first game is gone. The relationship with the AI in DG1 is gone. They are lost in a sea of voices trying to tell a sci-fi story that doesn't add much to the game.It's not terrible, but I miss the simplicity and character interaction of the original. If you haven't played DG1, buy it. DG2 is a solid TD game and probably worth even full price, but lacks the staying power of the original ....			"

												This really is one of the penultimate tower defense games. I played the daylights out of the first one, getting gold medals in all but 5 or 6 of the ""extra"" missions and putting way more than 125 hours into it. At first I wasn't too heavily into this game. It's different in its own right yet it has a similar theme. The addition of boost towers, boosted abilities and tower modifiers adds a different element to the game that I allowed myself to become overwhelmed with (min/max theorycrafting). At first I let it take away from the game but then I realized that while these augments made aspects of the game easier, they weren't required. I am on the last round of missions and the game has really grown on me. I appreciate its simplicity and yet the depth of options and replay value. It's a game I can sit down and play a single map or I can play for hours if I choose. Most of the levels are well designed and have enough vareity that I can tackle the alien problems in different ways. There is some easy levels and there are some brutal levels giving me a vareity of play experiences from the joyful to the ultra frustrated (and then elated when you figure it out). If you like TD games, this is a no-brainer. These guys know how to make a solid TD game.			"

												I haven't played the first Defense Grid so i won't compare between the two.I had a trip down memory lane playing this game. I used to play those small silly tower defense flash games on sites like Newgrounds when i was a kid. This game takes this to a whole new level and i think it is awesome!There's enough towers to choose from and a lot of aliens. It's pretty too, graphics are great. There is also a lot of different modes to try out like limited towers or a fixed amount of money to name a few.The story was quite entertaining, i liked the voice acting. However it ended rather abruptly, but that might just be me who expected a more dramatic ending or something in that manner. But whatever, i didn't really expect a story at all to be honest, so good job!So long story short, i had a blast and i will recommend this game for people who like Tower Defense games based out of my own personal opinion.

												As a tower defense geek im off course some bias, but i´ll try to give an objective view.For those of you that loved the prequel, well you dont even have to read. You can just buy this new iteration of Defense Grid 2.For those who want some more information; heres my (although little) review.With the obvious graphic update, this game gives a new update to the concept that were made in the prequel. The gameplay and feel of the game is all in all the same as the predecesser. And thats a good thing. Because many developers would build up its sequel in so way that it easily differate from its prequel. But here; the developers has made a clear choice in keeping it so close to the original as possible.Now, off course, the concept here is pure tower defence. And how much can you differ from it without becoming something else. Well, this game has certain new features that will make it fun for us tower defense geeks.More choices for every tower, whereby you now can choose certain skills for them as the game goes on. You can now also use more then the original shot from outer space, you have several different ""shots"" with various powers to choose from.Overallt this is a great contribution, although some would say its probably more like a Defense Grid 1,5, due to its visual update. But with its better balance and pure gameplay, makes this a great game for mostly anybody.Add to this, the new feature of multiplayer. Either Coop or play against, you can now play with your friends, by sharing the level. This along side with all the different modes make this game a great contribution to the Tower Defence genre.All in all, a must buy if you like strategy/tower defence :D			"

""Fans of the genre will enjoy""… If you enjoy tower defense games, you'll probably enjoy this one. It has a good variety of towers and enemy types, and the levels allow for a wide variety of strategies.

												It is a good tower defense game to spend some time, but honestly there are others far cheaper and better than this one. This game seemed to be main focused on extending the jogability of the ones who played the DG1, it is more like an expansion.The campaing had an interesting history, but it did not develop well. The fact that from the begining I could choose any mission on the whole campaing was bad too, as it did not gave the sensation of evolution. After about 4 levels you have unlocke all towers in the game and besides some really small upgrades (+10% damage, see invisible, etc) there is nothing to improve, and again there is no feeling of achieving something.In all this seems to be a game for fans of DG1 that wanted a multiplayer and editor mode experience, and not a game on its own. I would definetly recomend others.			"

												A major downgrade from DG1 in terms of depth.They cut the resource interest system and put in it's place a purely by wave reward so you're encouraged to spam towers.There's very little alien variety, all of which look exactly the same, it's seriously hard to discern them outside of the next wave panelThere's very little change in strategy in different maps, just place a bunch of AoE towers in a funnel with a temporal and you can complete most levels like this.Complete removal of flying waves/aliens.The developers are also trying to sell you any community-made content, all of the workshop content is locked until approval by the devs to be sold in the game.If you want a great tower defense game, wait for a sale and pick up DG1 and its DLC, it is superior in every way to this game except for the graphics.

												Don't bother buying this game until the heat crash issue on AMD gfx cards is fixed. There will be a public update with precisely that happy news soon, I am sureedit: oh, it's not just AMD cards, also 7xx nVidia ones. And maps meant to be handed out to backers and testers are not arriving. And when you try to add community ones, the game install corrupts.So now I feel I have license to move on to the subjective. The graphical load has increased, but at all settings the game looks worse. The towers look worse. The interest rebalance removed depth but added accessibility to the game. The menu interfaces feel like a console port, totally bizarre and unnecessary. Presumably this is appended with ""2"" because of an engine overhaul and loads of backend work and a rebalance? I can't tell. I'd've bought more dg1 maps happily. I'm tempted to believe that what has actually happened hasn't even been as positive as that -- presumably to cater to the features that will make them more money, HPE have created a mess of a backend.

The polish is sub par at best. For example when you select a unit, they allow you to move the mouse cursor up and down but not side to side. This is pure laziness on the side of the developer.

												This game is decent but feels incomplete. For someone that never got to play the original the story doesn't really make sense. There is no recap or refresher as to what happened in the first game but if all you care about is the killing then...well you don't care. Furthering the story issues the dialog pacing is terrible. Voice acting is decent and the writing fair, it's just lines aren't triggered fluently and often times the story dialog takes place at terrible times leaving you missing things or unless you adjust the volumes the sounds of hundreds dying drowns things out.Various other things also don't feel fully fleshed out like tower info and upgrade details. Rules about vertical planes and how it affects a given towers range and ability to fight are not explained. Line of sight issues, some times the specials you get from commanders do not work other than to show the visuals, play the sounds and incur the cool down, but the actual effect is no where to be found.My primary complaint is the aforementioned feeling this is only half a game. It's incredibly short and while fun it feels less compelling than some online / free flash tower defenses. If this game was $12 I'd say grab it but I don't quite feel it's worth the $25. This isn't to spark some large debate over development / production efforts against asking price but rather I think the game could have been presented in a much simpler way that would have required less development cost and time, less system resources for potential buyers, and an over all better experience. Next time maybe they could consider leaving out gimmicks like the zoom. There is nothing great looking about anything and zooming in doesn't help with anything. In fact it makes things very difficult. If you want amazing looking you play games like Crysis. The 3D modeling and effort put into this game just seems like a waste when they could have made something just as fun as a 2D top down game and spent their time and effort on $25 worth of game rather than bland 3D modeling.In addition to the very short nature of this game I thought the level builder and community map making would give it more value and replay-ability but sadly with far too many games these days there is a catch. Basically this game is another micro transaction ♥♥♥♥♥. Community maps must be purchased meaning the replay value that might have given its price some worth is more like a lure to soak you for more cash. Frankly this makes me really mad. I thought I was buying a game, not a platform for them to sell me more♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's like paying to have some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ salesman come into your home and try to tempt you to buy more♥♥♥♥♥♥all day. I get it, companies need to recoup costs, pay bills and their employees need to eat, but this has become a massive (and dishonest) practice in gaming these days. We used to buy triple A titles for say $60 but now you pay $60 and then they nickle and dime you until that $60 game is $300. Sure Defense Grid is $25ish, but to get more than a few hours play you have to start shelling out $2 a level with no real limit to how much you could end up spending. They also know psychologically it's easy to get someone to dump $2 300 times over a few months than to say upfront the game costs $250 or something else equally insane.Frankly my initial impression overlooked the story problems and I had fun until I realized nothing really made sense, there are still lots of problems, the game is incredibly short and the real dirty trick is they made the game off the backs of the fans, then they monetized the efforts of the fans creations for themselves too!

												I really enjoyed the original Defense Grid, but this one is really lacking...something.  I cant quite describe it.  I was disappointed that the towers are essentially the same.  I dont care for the art style of the towers this time around either.  I had hoped for some more variety in the missions/towers.  Not recommended.			"

												DG1 is a masterpiece.So of course it wasn't easy for DG2 to come after that. It's in all ways inferior to its ancestor, especially visually, which is quite surprising, but it's still a good game and it offers a nice ride with a bunch of levels.Try to get it during a sale, though ; at full price (~US$25), it feels too pricey if you already played & bought DG1 and all its DLC (like me ;-) ).

												Missing the charm of the original and makes the narrative misstep of shoe-horning a catchphrase into a major plot point. Graphics feel like a step backwards and the level design is uninspired, especially following the chaotic fun of the You Monster campaign. DG2 introduces a plethora of new options, but the difficulty level is uneven and mostly too easy. Like lesser tower defense games, you can apply the same general strategy to nearly every map. If you haven't played many tower defense games, you can do worse than buy this game. But if you loved the original, you'll probably feel this sequel has fallen flat. "

												*** BETA REVIEW ***While this game doesn't seem anywhere near ready for prime time, the right elements are there to build upon. Compared to the first Defense Grid, the graphics currenlty seem clunky, off center in places, and the towers seem unbalanced - some nowhere near the cost it takes to implement them. The AI is buggy (I could get all the aliens to spin in the same spot on 14- green towers only - even though they had a clear path), the game crashes, and the smooth, polished feel of the first DG is not currently present. Having said all that, it is BETA, and you takes your chances. While I can't imagine the developers fixing everything by Sep 23, the potential for a great game is there. So, given the binary choice between Yes and No for recommendation, I lean towards yes based on the developer's past success. But the real answer is, Wait And See...*** FINAL GAME ***Ignore every concern or reservation I had in the Beta and BUY THIS GAME!!! Now well polished and complete, Hidden Path delivered on every count. Like the first Defense Grid, this one is an absolute addiction!			"

												Defense grid 2 does everything defense grid 1 did (only more so) except free maps.  That's RIGHT all the maps submitted  to the steam work shop are paid only you have to go to this external sight http://www.dg2freemaps.com/category/forever-free-maps/  to get free maps.  Due to this disturbing choice DG2 loses nearly all the replay value of it predecessor because even the modes are the same. This shouldn't be shocking as this is the studio/publisher who made payday 2 an unbearable cash grab 505 games. **In short if you don't have DG1 get it instead.  If you really like DG1 get 2 at deep discount.			"

												Marred by the same problem as the first Defense Grid: The difficulty is a rollercoaster. It alternates between stupid easy and stupid hard, usually based on map type. Some maps lets you build a tower maze, others don't. Some let you have a second crack at enemies as they try to escape with cores, others put their exit somewhere else. Some give you one avenue of attacks, others give you 2-4 enemy routes to defend against. And how difficult a given map is is entirely based on that.The even more frustrating part is enemies don't seem consistent. Some maps start with a horde of weak enemies that die instantly. One map later just 2 or 3 of what appear to be the same enemies will rush through your defense unphased. Could be different enemies, but most of them look the same in this game. The artist chose coherent enemy aesthetics over making distinct enemy types easily recognizable. Their movement patterns are the most distinct thing about them and most enemies adhere to just 3 types of movement: The normal walking speed, the crawling speed, and the rusher.Even within the same map, difficulty randomly jumps. Some waves are easy, some are nearly impossible. You'll go half the game not letting a single enemy by then get a wave of shielded aliens that run right past your Tesla (shield-destroying) Towers without blinking even if you have 4 fully upgrades, damage-boosted of the Tesla Towers specifically for peeling shielded aliens of their shields at the start of the enemy path.Like the first game, DG2 survives on one thing: Tower Defense is a dead genre. There is no competition. If you really crave a TD game better than a poor flash clone it'll be worth the money. But not by much.			"

												The game is alright, it's no DG1. The normal difficulty on campaign is too easy for my taste. And I really don't care for the little cheap-shot waves they throw at you  in the later levels, that you can only kill with a well-timed orbital laser. Many of the towers feel utterly useless. I can use tesla, temporal, concussion, meteor, and the occasional cannon to beat every level, and it doesn't take many at all. Some of the towers, it is hard to see what upgrade they are on, overcharged green towers look a lot like yellow ones. Elaborate planning isn't required for this game, which is a shame because the levels allow for a lot of tower expansion and none is needed.			"

												What is Defense Grid 2?Genre: tower defenseSetting: futuristic science fiction world gets attacked by aliensDifficulty: depends on difficulty level - everything from 2/10 to 10/10Length: 10 hours for a single campaign walkthrough, plus a lot more if interested in multiplayer and additional contentMode: singleplayer campaign and game modes, multiplayer The positive aspects:- Content monster! 20 campaign levels plus eight game modes plus a lot of additional DLC and community-made content make this game a long-time experience- easy to learn, well-timed introduction of new towers and their abilities- fair, but challenging difficulty levels- different defense towers with upgrades and special abilitiesThe negative aspects:- superficial story- texts are very very very small (by the means of it) and thus hard to read- towers and enemies could have had even more diversity Result (and summary for those who have no time reading):Defense Grid 2 is a real must-have when it comes to tower defense games. Don't hesitate to buy it, even at full price it is worth every penny (or cent, or whatever currency you pay with)!			"

												I'll be honest. The Turret defense games that exist are generally a steaming pile of crap. This is an exception. It differs from the traditional ""Towers can be put here"" by giving you basically an entire blank field to build them. You can adjust tower height. Customize tower specialties. Customize your ultimate ability. Customize colors. Everything about the game takes the faults of the genera and puts it onto a new light and a new stage.An awesome game, especially those who are fans of the original defense grid.

On Normal difficulty, I felt it was paced appropriately to allow the player to make changes to defense to account for early mistakes. One of the levels had a whole section rise out of the water and it was fun to reroute the enemy forces into it and rethink your strategy. It's looking to be another great title from this solid and reliable team.			"

												My reccommendation here is reluctant. Defense Grid 2 is certainly an improvement on Defense Grid, and it brings a lot of fun things to the table. However, There are significant issues plaguing the game on all fronts.Bugs render the game nearly unplayable in certain points. On a particular mission I found that building too many of one type of tower caused the game to crash consistently. Also, setting different resolutions using the launcher causes the game to behave strangely in different ways.The voice acting and writing is hammy and unbelievable. When you had the one robot talking to you in the first game, it was pleasant and even kind of funny: he set the mood really well. Suddenly, in Defense Grid 2 there are multiple AIs all interacting with each other in strange ways, and it's never really explained where they all come from. Their interaction makes the obviously forced and childishly-written dialog painful to the ears. Kudos to the game for making them unavailable when they're indisposed in the story though.The difficulties aren't calculated very well. Defense Grid was kind of hard! This game is pretty easy even when playing on hard difficulty. Honestly, the difficulty was what gave Defense Grid replay value, and after completing just the story mode in 2 I'm starting to get bored. All this aside, the game is very pretty. It's graphically superior to it's predecessor and the levels are designed really well. The addition of the different superweapons, command shuttle allowing you to spend resources to modify the placement environment, and the modified towers and gameplay are all very well implemented. All of the changes are simultaneously intuitive and graceful.			"

												Played the original game to death, and was worried reading some reviews that this wasn't going to be as much fun or in some way fundamentally flawed. In my opinion though, it is a worthy sequel - essentially the same old balance and mix of towers and aliens pretty much that made DG1 work so well, but with a few neat twists and upgrades to make the experienced DG player think. All seems highly polished, and absolutely loving the Steam Friend performance trackers as well. The only small negative I'd note is that the towers all look a bit too much the same this time round, but that really is a very minor point that doesn't affect the new enhanced gameplay. Most telling I think, is that I don't think I'd ever go back to DG1 now, which is high praise indeed from me. And I think I will also be playing *this* one to death. :)			"

												I love DG1. The only thing i wished for was more maps, probably some new towers.Then DG2 was announced and i was waiting for. Now i like it. Gameplay is fun and there are a lot of user maps now. Great.What i dislike: DG2 is suffering at the usual ""it's made for consoles too"" graphics (like so much other games using such a annoying graphics engine made for pc AND consoles). graphics are kinda ""hissing"" / ""noising"" (can't describe it better), even if AA and stuff are enabled. I really hate this at D♥♥♥♥nd it feels like being in old times a lot of years ago, when AA and AF wasn't available.Compared with DG1, this ""pixel flickering"" is ruining fun at D♥♥♥♥ bit. Also the UI (before maps are starting) is pretty clumsy, compared to DG1.But: If you can deal with issues like this, you will like DG2 too. Well, at least as long you don't expect new stuff like new towers or similar.If you like to create maps for DG2, you will love the map editor. ;) "

												Defense Grid 2 is more Defense Grid and that is by no means bad. Don't look for a huge leap in design or gameplay but appreciate that it's simply more of a good thing.The special powers add a bit to the game but most of the time in the heat of levels you'll forget about them anyway. The biggest problem with the game is that the easiest way to win is to stick to quality over quantity and pretty much all missions can be completed with the first three or four towers. Recommendation for the game taking what people loved about Defense Grid 2 and giving us more but a warning that this really is just more Defense Grid.			"

												A very weak thumbs-up, but a thumbs-up nonetheless.Defense Grid: The Awakening is probably the best standalone tower defense game ever made, so this sequel had huge shoes to fill. After a long saga of development including a failed Kickstarter campaign, the final result is something that improves upon the formula in some ways, but in other ways just made things much too confusing both for casual players and dedicated players alike. DG1's most memorable and perfect aspect was probably its scoring system. It was very simple: killing aliens awards resources, but you earn compound interest on your stored resources every few seconds, and your money basically becomes your score. Therefore, the tiniest change in strategy, especially at the beginning of the map, could result in an exponentially bigger score thanks to the accumulated compound interest. Despite its simplicity, aiming for high scores or even surviving the more difficult challenges was a ridiculously deep and complex experience, and hugely satisfying. In DG2, they scrapped this system altogether in favor of something more confusing that the game doesn't even take the time to explain. You don't earn compound interest anymore. Instead, you earn 10 free resources every few seconds, in addition to a fixed amount of resources after killing a wave of enemies. You earn points every time you kill an enemy, with (an arbitrary amount of) points awarded if you have more resources, and (an arbitrary amount of) less points awarded if you spent more money on towers. But it's needlessly confusing and the fandom is still not too sure how exactly it works and why playing more efficiently sometimes seems to result in a lower score. Plus, thanks to the orbital laser strike now awarding points, it's now possible to abuse the scoring system using some of the game's features, taking the game's focus away from tower placement and maze design.DG1's storytelling was minimalist, yet effective: at the beginning of each map, Fletcher would recite some lines which both characterized himself, hinted at the backstory, and explained the new game mechanics all at once. It was honestly compelling. In DG2, they threw about 6 AIs (and one human) together in the same room, and made them all drunk. At the beginning and end of every mission they spend upwards of five minutes rambling about desperately unfunny nonsense and leading up to a single, painfully predictable plot twist on the last level (the alien rune text even gives it away almost immediately!) The mission briefings can all be summarized as follows: ""BLAH BLAH BLAH I LOVE THE MOOOOON!"" ""I know this sounds weird, but we really need to have a talk about raspberries."" ""Wow, isn't it weird how corrupted and single-minded we're all becoming? I wonder what's causing it?"" ""LOOK OUT, ALIENS INCOMING!"" Needless to say, many people turn off the narration, and I don't blame them. At least the in-game banter is a bit more varied and interesting than in DG1, where Fletcher would whine about his cores every few seconds. Now they just sing the praises of boost towers.Boost towers are the only real new tower introduced in DG2, aside from the missile tower which now acts as a homing shot against ground units, due to flying mobs being completely removed. Boost towers act as a raised platform on which you can build any other tower type.  I started out thinking boost towers were annoying, but they really grew on me after a few missions: they allow cheap creation of mazes while saving gun choices for later, as well as allowing one of three special effects to a tower. There are also many new kinds of aliens, which is a welcome and expected addition.In DG1, each mission had about 10 extra modes, ranging from 99-wave challenges to 10-tower limit challenges. Getting a high score on a leaderboard was a hardcore task requiring some annoying skills like juggling, but you also had the choice of fixed-path maps or challenges with disabled interest, meaning you could choose a map or a mode where you don't have to juggle if you don't want to. Simple, elegant, straightforward.In DG2, they went with the ""Everything and the kitchen sink"" method of game balance. Not only do they have about 10 different game modes per map, but four difficulty levels, loadout perks for your towers, choice of about 7 effects for the orbital laser, and a ""competitive"" setting which disables loadout perks, and another one which disables selling of towers. That's a lot of options. But it makes it difficult to determine what modes and settings you *should* be using, especially if you intend to join the competetive scene, verses what modes you'll just be wasting your time with. It seems like the designers said ""it's too much work to balance the game, here's hundreds of play modes per level, go balance the game yourself."" Options are great, but this is confusing and overwhelming, especially since the actual gameplay itself -- the design and pacing of the enemy waves -- seems a bit rushed and not so well thought-out.DG2 is beautiful. The graphics are a great improvement to the original game, and the in-game HUD is amazing, even showing a miniature score ticker so you can measure your performance against previous attempts in real time. However, the main menu is a disastrous and confusing pile of options that's non-intuitive and designed primarily for a controller. Plus all the options reset themselves whenever you choose a new game mode, making it a bit frustrating and intimidating just to start a game the way you want. More than once I've selected the wrong mode or the wrong difficulty, just because changing some options will change other options without telling you.D♥♥♥♥dds a some truly interesting co-op and competitive multiplayer, including modes with shared and separate scores and resource pools. However, the checkpoint and fast-forward features are unavailable during co-op, meaning that playing a Grinder mission with a friend will literally take an hour.Speaking of the fast-forward feature, it was broken in DG1 -- using it at any time could alter fate, as it created fuzzy and non-deterministic estimations of future events. Meteor towers randomly wouldn't strike their targets, temporal towers wouldn't pulse at the same time, and towers in general would choose to target different enemies than before. Hoping this was fixed in DG2? It's not. In fact, it got worse.DG1 had a staggering number of DLC and map packs to play. Six campaigns in total, including the original campaign, and a Portal cross-over. DG2 has nothing. Sure, you can make and share your own maps with the community, but it doesn't use Steam workshop. Instead, you have to download them from third-party sites, and some even cost money. Um... what? I actually thought that it was against Steam's terms of service for a game to redirect you to a third-party site for paid DLC where you can't use your Steam Wallet funds. Isn't this why EA got Dragon Age II and some of its other games kicked off of Steam?Overall, despite its many steps in the wrong direction, DG2 is worthy of playing for any fan of DG1, especially if you were really hungering for online co-op. Good graphics, good maps, good new features and ideas. Just don't go into it expecting the best Tower Defense experience ever, or something that can replace its predecessor. Instead, try to see it for what it is: a complement to the original game, something like one final glorious expansion set to Defense Grid: The Awakening, and remember that you can always return to the original game whenever you want.

												If you’re unfamiliar with Defense Grid, its biggest hook in the tower defense world is one that can be explained fairly easily. As you play, certain stages have levels with open grids on them for tower placement. The creeps, those are the aliens trying to steal your cores and take them back, will alter their paths based on your tower placement.So, there’s a strategy in placing towers in specific spots rather than just plopping each gun down and upgrading to win. Now, I don’t think Defense Grid was the first to do this, but I do think it does it exceptionally well. Each level that has these open layouts is much more interesting and challenging than others, and command centers on the levels will let you annex new regions in order to push out the length of the creeps’ path.You’re not only playing with your budget in order to come up with the best defense power, but you’re trying to lay out towers and boost blocks (basically, a tower upgrade spot that brings better stats to your big guns later in each level) so that you can do the most damage on creeps during their runs.What’s frustrating about this game is that it’s impossible to have a planning phase. The levels start without you saying so, so you won’t be able to look at the map and decide which path is best before you start laying towers. Especially in the later game, the creeps move too fast and are far too strong for you to sit around and plan tower placement. I found this tough to contend with, especially since I’m the type of player who can’t play through tower defense games without getting perfect scores.I like the dynamic paths and forcing creep behavior, I just wish the game would give me an option to pause and look at the map before it steals all my cores and causes me to lose.  That’s probably just the perfectionist in me, though. "

												Recommended only if you picked the bones of DG1 clean (and its dlcs) .. and even then make sure you get this on sale. Then you won't feel too bad a week or so later when you're bored of it.This could have been the Portal 2 of TDs but the pacing and atmosphere of the first gets replaced with farce as a bunch of stupid new AIs run around drunk.TD wise, barely a sequel, it's basically DG1 for consoles (obligatory ♥♥♥♥♥♥ UI, Vsync defaults to 60hz). A few extra tweaks to the SAME DG1 towers, that may appeal to hard core min maxers but you would have to be autistically obsessed tbh. Oh well.			"

												I kickstarted this game, and played it the first day in alpha.  The game had an enormous stuttering problem on my medium-high spec PC.  The game freezes for a good quarter of a second every single second, making it basically unplayable. I reported this on the very first day.Fast forward two years later, and nothing has changed.  The stuttering is still horrible on that PC.About a month ago, I upgraded to an ultra-high spec PC, using all the top gaming hardware available at the time:* Intel i7 6700K, 4.4Ghz OC* NVidia GTX 980 TI* 32GB Rametc.I tried out Defense Grid 2, and it still freakin' stutters.  The stuttering only lasts about 1/10th of a second now, making the game playable, but it still happens every damn second.  I couldn't stand to play more than one level.If they still haven't fixed the issue after all this time, they never will.EDIT: It looks like instead of fixing this debilitating issue, they were busy adding microtransactions.  Wow.  I will never buy (and certainly never kickstart) another game from Hidden Path Entertainment.EDIT 2: Finally tried out the multiplayer with a friend (despite the stuttering still existing).  Looks like the game's highly-touted ""multiplayer campaign"" is actually just single-player with two cursors.  It's ridiculously boring.  Did they not test this at all?			"

												Best TD title is back and hitting hard! I must say I had my doubts, before I saw it in action on my own screen. If you have or haven't experienced DG1, this is a must buy. Many things have changed for better or worse, but still more coud've been done. Graphics are pretty much the same, but explosions got a major bloom/flare treatment that would make J.Lo burn her A cup. Script and specially voice acting are top notch and often absolutely hilarious.There are plenty of levels to explore, replay value with multiple game modes and difficulties. By the looks of it, we'll be getting more levels in near future made by community and developers. I just hate the fact that they ask money for average designs already. Only real problem that I complain is a dodgy difficulty. It is showing it's ugly face very clearly on competitive mode. There you won't be able to use AI bonus/tower perk tricks and even on normal you will run into a wall of W.T.F moments, a lot.Once you are getting used to a single player content, there is an option for challenging multiplay, either co-op or against. Shame that there is no option for speeding up the game (co-op 24.9.14), so combat often feels like watching a paint dry. If you're playing with a random player, shared resources mean that a person with a faster metabolism steam rolls.DG2 has a lot of shells for a boomstick. Even that we are getting near perfection, I would've hoped for a little more tuning before release. Thinking about some sort of rpg elements and programmable towers? Those darn towers sometimes just shoot the wrong targets! Anyway, to me this is worth every penny and if you purchased DG2 in beta you got a pile of extra stuff. That nice little copy of DG1 to give to your friend, -50% ticket for Windborne (which looks really promising) and more. Hidden Path Entertainment, you have done it!9,5/10Money value: Insert your coins here!p.s. Some of the leaderboards seem to be infected by cheaters...			"

												DG1 was one of the best tower defense games of all time.  DG2 is a worthy follow-up to that game.  DG2 does, of course, have better graphics.  All of the maps are well designed and extremely fun.  And, like DG1, this game has plenty of alternate play modes, such as Frozen Core, Out Of Bullets, SuperGrinder, etc.  This installment also introduces Boost towers that can give second row towers better line-of-sight, and which also amp up your towers with added abilities like extra damage, enemy shield disruption, etc.  However, DG2 seemed a lot easier to me.  I mean, I can play SuperGrinder on ""Elite"" difficulty setting and still get a gold medal on the level without breaking much of a sweat.  Also, there isn't as many maps that come with the game, so the game felt shorter to me than DG1.  Still, overall, it's a phenomenally good game just like its predecessor.  Highly recommended.			"

While it's fun and the new options (various boosts, etc.), there are too few levels and - man - can't those AI's ever shut up?  I finally just turned the volume to zero.I finished all the levels in a few hours, then went back and finished them on grinder and super grinder. Not much of a challenge. The original DG had much better diversity in levels. Overall it's fun. I made the mistake of purchasing the premium edition (or whatever they call it), expecting more levels. Nope. A cheesy Flash novella that I eventually found annoying and quit. I want a game that's fun to play, challenging and engaging. Not someone trying to be the next Heinlein.

												If you are a fan of Tower Defense games, DG2 is a perfectly fine example of the genre, and certainly worth playing.  That being said, this is not a game you are likely to fall in love with.(Note: unlike most reviewers, I never played the first Defense Grid; in other words, I'll just be reviewing this game as it stands, not as it compares to another game.)DG2 is a pretty standard tower defense game, and a reasonably well done one at that.  There is an interesting variety of towers, enemies, and maps.  Different maps can be defeated in different ways.  It does a good job of ramping up the difficulty slowly, and introducing new towers and enemy types in a way that new players don't feel overwhelmed.  In other words, it's just about everything that you'd say you want in a tower defense game.  The campaign has an okay plot--at times it was amusing, and I was intrigued at first, though the ending was a bit abrupt.  With 20 maps in the campaign, it's a reasonable length--a bit on the short side, perhaps, but not bad.That being said, while it does nothing wrong, it doesn't particularly shine in any given area either.  It's average or slightly above average tower defense game in basically every respect.  The most original thing here is the fact that you can control enemy pathing on certain maps with your tower placement; a fine addition, but only a few of the maps really take advantage of that feature.

												""DG2"" is an excellent successor to ""Defense Grid."" The game balance has been changed to reward educated experimentation over ""trial-error-rollback-repeat,"" and it also feels like each map can be done well in more than one way. The continuous resource accumulation helps to eliminate some of the more punishing aspects of the first game. With tower-currency flowing in steadily, it's much more possible to recover from mistakes.""Defense Grid 2"" certainly feels more expansive than its predecessor, with a larger number of tower pads to build on and a much more viable long-range game. I would even go so far as to say that a major key to the experience is getting strong use out of missile and meteor towers: You'll definitely want their ability to keep delivering damage over a large surface area.The game's pacing has also been tweaked. ""Defense Grid"" sometimes felt ponderous, even if that ponderousness was also coupled with desperation. ""DG2,"" on the other hand, seems to manage to keep events rolling at a nice clip without constantly overwhelming the player.What it all amounts to is a smartly balanced experience that keeps the player returning. It's amazing to look up at the time counter and realize that a 20+ minute map has just flown by. The banter between the various AI personalities is also done very well, and flavors the action nicely with humor, drama, and a really good bit of mystery. Hidden Path has definitely crafted another gem.			"

												As being a hugh fan of DG, I had to buy the second one too.The game has improved in many ways. The graphics are good and the new path display is very helpful in planning your towers. I also like the points display at the top right, where you can see how well you are doing for points. (That's if you are in the highscore gathering league, which I think is the most exciting thing about DG)Overall the game feels similar to the first one. I am sure the campaign will be great, since the Devs have done a great job with the first game and it's DLCs.I don't like the new music that much and would really like to see/hear the old music again. Maybe that could be as an option under the sound options?The tower design is good, although I would like to have them a little more different and easier to seperate. Once the map is more busy, it's a little difficult the identy what is what!Summary: If you liked the first game, you will definately like this one too! Can't wait to have the full game available and play the campaign!!! "

												What's not to like?  Defense Grid was one of the best Tower Defense games I've ever played; DG2 doesn't stray far from a proven formula, but adds a number of interesting tweaks like levels that grow and morph, platforms to raise towers up on for improved LOS (but they block shorter towers now), and a greatly improved UI for effects on targets and towers.

												If you are a fan of Tower Defense games, DG2 is a perfectly fine example of the genre, and certainly worth playing.  That being said, this is not a game you are likely to fall in love with.(Note: unlike most reviewers, I never played the first Defense Grid; in other words, I'll just be reviewing this game as it stands, not as it compares to another game.)DG2 is a pretty standard tower defense game, and a reasonably well done one at that.  There is an interesting variety of towers, enemies, and maps.  Different maps can be defeated in different ways.  It does a good job of ramping up the difficulty slowly, and introducing new towers and enemy types in a way that new players don't feel overwhelmed.  In other words, it's just about everything that you'd say you want in a tower defense game.  The campaign has an okay plot--at times it was amusing, and I was intrigued at first, though the ending was a bit abrupt.  With 20 maps in the campaign, it's a reasonable length--a bit on the short side, perhaps, but not bad.That being said, while it does nothing wrong, it doesn't particularly shine in any given area either.  It's average or slightly above average tower defense game in basically every respect.  The most original thing here is the fact that you can control enemy pathing on certain maps with your tower placement; a fine addition, but only a few of the maps really take advantage of that feature.  Otherwise, I've seen this all before; occasionally done better, often done worse, but I could never quite shake the ""been there, done that"" feeling.If you like the genre, by all means play DG2.

												Defense Grid 2 is a Tower Defense video game.I think this is a video game you NEED to have if you like the Genre.It's haves some much better graphic part if you look to part 1.Part 2 haves more online options and now you can play with friends. Part one whas pure a single player video game.You have many towers as upgrades as most tower defense games.Everystage you can tweak it for extra challange options so replaying a stage is allways more fun.Part 1 whas a good game... and part 2 is much better... you won't see this everytime.In short great game.. a lot of hours of fun defending the cores.I give this game a 9/10 score.

												DG2 is another great game put out 505 Games. I will say that it is very much like DG the original, but that necessarily doesn't mean it's a bad thing. As T. Bert from the Jimmy Carter administration eloquently put it, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”. This quote embodies DG2. Which is the reason that DG2 it is sensibly priced at $24.99 (without Steam sales). D♥♥♥♥t its core is an expansion pack, but with a much desired and needed multiplayer to retain its replay ability factor. If you are unsure about buying DG2, buy the first one. However, if you have friends that own the second one, buy second one so you can play together; plain and simple.			"

For me the game is mostly more of the same, which is fine and I mostly enjoyed the game.Unfortunately, for me the balance was off. The first approximately ten missions were quite easy, then suddenly the difficulty ramped up too quickly. Also, the difficulty of each mission was poorly balanced - I often stuggled to defeat the first few waves of aliens, but always by around the middle of each mission, it became no challenge at all.

												In a few words:This is the best small developer (see: indie) tower defense game out there.  There is always a debate in some communities if this game is ""better"" than the DG1.  For my money, DG2 is a fantastic game with more modes and better options than DG1.If you aren't familiar with the Defense Grid 1 there is nothing wrong with picking up this one and then going back and playing DG1.  DG2 just feels more complete as a game.In a few more words:This is a tower defense game.  You, as the player (or commander as they call it) build various mechanisms (aka towers) to stop aliens from stealing your resources.  If you lose all your resources, game over.Each map typically has aliens march along predetermined paths in their never ceasing quest to steal your energy cores.  Along this path are build points in which the player erects towers of various designs (missiles, guns, lasers, etc) to eliminate the aliens and move on to the next map.The goal is almost always to destroy all the aliens but the player is challenged to not only win, but build effciently in order to boost their score.  Towers can be upgraded and the player is awarded with bonuses and upgrades at various points in the game.There are multiple modes outside of the main story campaign.  They typically involve some type of special challenge or limitation.  The bottom line:This is a great game and its a nice way to kill time when you are bored with more traditional strategy games.  I highly recommend it for tower defense fans and first timers who are interested in something a little different.Final Grade: B+			"

												Beta Review:Defense Grid 2 is a very enjoyable tower defense game, with nice visuals and solid gameplay, based on the two levels available in the Beta, it shows the potential of the finished complete game.If you enjoyed DG1 you will probably like this new version with much improved visuals and the familiar gameplay.The question is whether it's worth the $25/€23 price tag, that unfortunately is hard to say from just playing the beta, it will very much depend on the ammount of content and game play time it will provide when finished, but the best bet is to wait for a review of the completed version; nontheless for fans of DG1 and those that want access to the Beta right now, it might be worth it, just don't expect too much from the Beta at this early stage.

												I waited excitedly for DG2! I  have over 300 hours in DG1; and I loved it - i'm not therefore averse to TD games or DG itself.  I'm afraid to say that I am going with those less satisfied with the game.  If you like and want more of the same a-la DG1 good for you - buy this.  If you want something inovative and genre-moving then move along.  Genre-moving this is not.  Better graphics and a slightly tweaked DG1 it is.  Not recommended, even if you're a die hard TD fan - and by God I am.PC gamer say it's ""glorious"" Really? No.  It's average; after DG1 this is no better.Other gaming mags say it's marvellous - no - it's not - it's merely average.  Really - it's not worth upgrading from DG1.Once you've bought it, because others say it's great, do come back and re-read this review.......I told you so ;D			"

((Recommended, but quite a reserved one.  And only if you really enjoyed DG1 and go in to this with lowered expectations))Defense Grid 2 shows a number of changes, but only a couple of those changes were for the better.The Good:+ It's still a good Tower Defense game.  (Just not a great one any more).+ Graphics and the rotatable view.+ Fly-overs showing overview of mission map.+ Ability to show the path the aliens will take.The Eh:~ A GRAPH of my score during gameplay?  OK.  Why?~ Mission medal awarded solely on mission score; regardless of # of cores lost.~ Boost Towers?  Needless complication / addition to game...~ ""Normal"" difficulty seems easier than DG1.  Either I'm MUCH better than I was when I played DG1, but I received GOLD on every mission with only have to restart or go to an earlier checkpoint on a couple missions in the campaign.  In DG1, um, I am proud of the few gold medals I did earn in my first play through.~ Large size of some maps, changes the 'feel of the game'.~ Why all the different types of orbital lasers now?~ ""Heat Map"" of where you caused the most dmg to aliens.  OK, it's ""pretty"" but you already know where you cause the most dmg.The Bad:- The Radar in DG1 showing the upcoming alien types I liked SO MUCH better than what they did in DG2.- Voice Acting.  OMG.  Voice acting is not just bad, it's truly awful!  The returning voice of General Fletcher is good, Cai's delivery was OK (until the dialog turned cringe-worthy), but the rest were terrible regardless of the dialog.- The post-mission banter/story by the voice actors / AI's (and even DURING a mission) is horrible.- The complete gibberish at the start of a level shown by alien/encrypted text giving another viewpoint of the story.  Just nonsense.- More confusing game menus and pre-mission tower configurations/upgrades, given no explanation.- Missile Towers remain, but no flying aliens in DG2??- Level design is not as varied as DG1.  Larger maps, but generally 1 way in, and 1 way out.- Rank removed from mission summary?  I loved that feature of DG1!  Though you can browse the leaderboard to (slowly) determine your rank after a mission, you have to go looking for it.Summary:Defense Grid 2 while still enjoyable, is not nearly so much so as DG1.  Quite a let down.  7.5 out of 10.			"

												Horrible game. Got it for Multiplayer. It *MIGHT* be viable for single player gameplay but its multiplayer is the worst piece of crap I have Ever experienced. It's obvious that this game was designed for single player and added in multiplayer as an after thought. Not only after a story multiplayer mission does it not continue the story, your only two options are to exit and recreate a lobby to select the Next mission or go back to select the Next Mission Anyway rather than the typical ""Continue"" type mechanic. What the hell type of thinking is this?There's no reason to play Multiplayer. None. Nothing. You share resources in multiplayer. They are Completely shared. It turns into two different people creating something together to one person directing where things go and the 2nd player sitting along for the ride. It is Ridiculous. The towers are horrible and boring. The first three are a standard machine gun tower, an inferno AoE one, and a cannon that trumps all in damage regardless of AoE or single target.The UI itself is horrible, there's no sort of obvious hotkey system which makes you Repeatedly go into your setting just to look them up. The tutorial is basic at best and gives you almost no information. Nothing about the heat map, etc. In multiplayer they STILL give you a Single Player tutorial regardless of your mode. For example the tooltips still pop up for the Fast Forward feature which is a Single Player only option. This is lazy game designing and should be marketed as a single player game. It *might* be decent in the single player aspect but I Still find the gameplay itself boring and horrendous. There was a CLEAR lack of effort in this god awful game and I strongly urge ANYONE looking to purchase this to rethink their decision. With quality like this you're Much better off investing in a different game or saving your money.			"

Having not played the original I approached this as just another tower defense game and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. It's a good looking game with some great map design, a nice variety of enemies and nice selection of towers and upgrade paths. I did find it was a bit system intensive and occassionally a bit buggy, and it could have maybe done with a little more time spent on the optimisation rather than graphics. I'm also not a huge fan of the plot (and find the necessity to include a storyline in a tower defense game a little superfluous if I'm honest), and the voice acting gets a little grating, but I can appreciate the developers attempt to tie each of the levels together and push you through the campaign.At it's current price of about £18 it may be one for just the die hard fans but as time goes on and more maps are created (and if the price drops a little) I definitely think its worth picking up whether you're a hardcore strategist after the highest score possible or you want something little more casual you can dip in and out of. I can certainly see myself returning and sinking hours into this game, trying to find the most efficient way of slaughtering hordes of alien scum.			"

												I've only played 2 levels so far and so far Defence Grid 2 is a poor shadow of the original. It's trite and formulaic to the extreeme, even on the second level I just ran the simulation in fast forward and upgraded all my towers and got a gold rating without having to expend any effort. I have suspicions there may be a good game in there but just playing the story mode on normal difficulty is not where it is. More play is warranted before a final judgement but if you want a straight up  sequel to DG1 you'll be disappointed from the get go.			"

												I played this game on my friend's XBox One and loved it - I was really excited to see it for cheap.Then I tried to play it on my Mac.  5 levels in and it gets so bogged down - even at medium quality on a 1024x768 window - that it's basically unplayable.If you have a Mac, don't get this.

												Not sure why all the hate. It feels like the first one, but with Boosters, funner, more over the top particle emitters and multiple characters that interact (I personally think the voice acting is great).Yes, it is def on the upper end of indie pricing, but still only 1/3 of a AAA price. Also 8 hours of gameplay? Nah, the individual levels are harder to beat than that - they are each like a full meal.Yes, the tower options are limited and I wish there were more, imaginative options over those in the previous game. But there is no question this is a terrific product. C'mon.(ps one of the neg reviewers said there is no speed up - yes there is, in fact there is also a jump-back to previous save points in this version. Just sayin).			"

												DG2. Finally!(Being a die-hard DG fan, I have been waiting a long time for thisfor this.Since I have only tried the early access version, having only two levels avaliable it was quickly over. But it did not disappoint. Only two where available for early access. And I want to play it a lot more).Anyway, playing the game is a familiar feeling for a DG fan. It looks the same, sounds the same and plays almost the same. There are a few new addons that potentially can completely change the flow of the map. Take the platform, that you build and then place a tower on it, adding height and range.This can change and extend the kill zone or giving a previous unusable spot a potential tower.Also the maps are no longer static. One level was transformed after about 30% of the waves had passed, adding a lot more room, and changed the layout and the entire planning of the map.Well, since it is still early access it's hard to say what the final product may be, but what I have tried I really like. they improved the game, carefully adding features that adds more interesting gameplay without hurting the things that made DG so good. You can still micromanage and OCD about the perfect route, and each map have many additional modes to play, adding tons of replay value.In short: Love it. I truly recommend it!			"

												If you plan on playing this game because it is labelled ""MAC compatible"" just go away. They used a VERY bad osx wrapper that makes the game mostly unplayable.Sure, ""use windows if u want to play lol"" but no. Mac is my workstation, and if i want to play a few games that CLAIM to be compatible in order to sell more copies, it SHOULD be compatible. And here, it's not the case.The game is maybe good on other platforms but if you are looking for a good strategy / TD game working on MAC, this just wont do it. Dont spend money on this, and ask for a refund.(oh and the support told me i didn't reach the computer specifications. Yeah sure, with a core i7, 16Go RAM, 512 graphic card on a high end iMac that runs the game smoothly under bootcamp. Right. Or you are too F*****G lazy to use a decent mac wrapper, and just used a third-party wrapper to sell more copies.)			"

												There is too much Tower Defense in the world.  It started with just two, but some idiot programmer left them alone in a room full of green M&Ms and thus was born an army of annoying little TD anklebiters.  Greatness languished as an extremely recessive gene in this motley genre of mostly half-baked look-alikes, biding its time until it could express itself in the Chosen One and light a path for forlorn strategy gamers the world over.That Chosen One was Defense Grid, the only AAA Tower Defense.  This game is a worthy heir to the Chosen One, carrying on a tradition of unlikely greatness.  Someday, the heir might even surpass the Chosen One.  Only time will tell.			"

												Fantastic. Better than the First and beyond all expectations. Every bar was raised this time around, from impressive 3D levels that really add to immersion and more voice acting and story. Granted You only play the story so much but there is a lot of character to the game. Easily worth 25 bucks. I'm not sure what to expect in terms of hours, but between the launch content and already at least 10+ maps from just light skimming of the forums, the community content seems to already be going and I expect many months of play.Good job. See you in DG3!			"

Playing with a friend is also fun.  Espically on difficult levels so that you can compare stategies.Flyers are gone from the game, but there is a new alien that will throw a cog into the works if you only build up yoru defenses around the begining of the level.Can't wait for new levels to come out.

												DG1 is the best tower defense game out there, hands down.  This doesn't quite live up to its predecessor unfortunately.The Bad:The UI / Menu system is horrendous (outside of the gameplay itself).  Too much going on and the ""continue"" buttons could be in the center of the screen on one menu, then lower right on the next, then the upper left.  It's also not easy to distinguish what should be grabbing your focus to continue on any given menu.The towers and monsters have lost a lot of their visual uniqueness.  I'm not sure if it's because the monsters are smaller (larger overall maps?) or what but most of the time you won't tell one monster from another.  I'm not sure what it is about the towers.  They are incredibly detailed when zoomed in but when zoomed out that detail kind of obscures what the tower is compared to different towers.The story is...not great.  Not sure why they needed to add a ton of new A.I. characters but for the most part I didn't feel they added anything (plus it was easy lose track of who was who).The good:It, for the most part, still plays like DG1 and is a fun tower defense game			"

												Defense Grid 2 is a typical Tower Defense game. The Gameplay is like Defense Grid The Awakening - anyone who has played that, will immediately feel at home.This time there are no flying aliens. While you're playing through the game, you unlock selectable perks for the towers (Laser slows target; Cannon does aoe damage in a 5 degree cone, Inferno does more single target damage etc). Additionally, towers can be built on boost blocks giving them special abilities (more damage; decloaking; increased score etc).The story is a bit too confusing - very quickly I was lost even at the quite simple question who of those bunch of voices is supposed to be an AI and who not. The Level intro texts donn't help much, because they seem to be telling a completely different story at first.In the top right corner you can see how you are doing in comparison to your friends during every step of the level.There are many modes for the levels that add quite some replayability.If you just want to play the levels once, you'll be done with this in ~12-15hours. There is also a level editor integrated.Thumbs up for TD :D			"

												Defense Grid: The Awakening was one of my favourite strategy games ever, if I dare say so. Opposite to many RTS and also Tower Defense games that come out today, it required thinking, strategical placement, spamming one tower rarely got you anywhere and if it did, the score would be far too low to compete with your friends, let alone the leaderboard. Add the flair of Raspberry-Fetishist Fletcher's voice, and it was one of the most fun games to play while still producing a challenge.DG2 had the difficult job of following that up. After playing through the campaign, I am happy to say that it does so flawlessly. The Story connects to the Add-On ""Containment"" and thanks to excellent voice acting lets you sympathize even with AIs. And for Fans of the first game, it has one of the biggest twists you can imagine.But where the game shines is gameplay. If you're new to Tower Defense games, play on lower difficulties, ease into it, learn placement and what tower to chose in what situation, about forming paths and defending the cores bit by bit, and if you fail, one button is enough for a return to the last checkpoint. It's the simplicity that helps. However, advanced TD gamers will find the harder difficulties a challenge, especially if you want to compete scorewise. It's a dance on a razors edge, one mistake early in the game can lead to total failure 20 minutes later. The new elements like the Boost tower (which is just a base that lets you control line of sight and boosts tower on top of it)  integrate perfectly with all the towers and aliens we know from Part 1. Most towers have been well redesigned, the only one I don't like is the cannon tower. The old Triple-Cannon which seemed like taken directly from a Battleship gave the tower a sense of might, as where the new one looks more like the pneumatic experiment of a sixth grader that shoots  shells by compressing air *cough* which is too bad because if well placed, it's an essential part of any strategy especially later in the game. I'm also not quite sure about the ""Recieve ressources in ticks rather than interest"" thing, holding off spending your cash until the last moment was an integral thing for competing for highscores, waiting a few seconds before placing a tower could mean the difference between just some score or an attack on the Top 10. Time will tell if the new system holds the same competitiveness.If you loved DG1, I can wholeheartedly suggest DG2 to you. You'll find everything you liked about the first part, overhauled and redesigned, with several new elements added that can create a new challenge you first have to develop a working strategy to (Took me some time to get the hang about dealing with the tower disabling alien even on lower difficulties), and of course we got Fletcher back who alone is worth this game. If you're new to Tower Defense, DG is the perfect brand to start, it won't overwhelm you directly, but you have to use your brain or the aliens will be out the door with all the cores before you figured out how to upgrade your towers.And for long term fun, there's DG Architect, the map creator, which is included. I'm very much looking forward to finding some of the challenges the Steam Community builds. And of course just kicking some more alien behind is always fun ;)			"

												Defense Grid 2 is a fine example of what a true sequel should be. It futher refines what was stareted in Defense Grid: The Awakening with updated textures and models. Like all decent sequels it then builds upon this by being bold and adding new features to futher enhance gameplay, making it fresh for those who are returning to the series. DG2, is a great game which continues to define the tower defense genre and continues to demonstrate why the Defense Grid serise is considered to be the Genre Codifier.			"

												Defense Grid 2 is a good tower defense game, but not the best. The best is still the first game, Defense Grid: The Awakening. If you've played the first game, they have basically improved the graphics and added/tweaked some things (not necessarily for the better). If you haven't played the first game, buy that instead. It's a much, much better game, with much higher replayability and a lot more levels.The main differences in DG2:- Instead of command towers you now have boost towers. They end up being a bit of a resource burden since not using a boost tower is always worse than using one and you can't go back and add one later. They are useful to cheaply control the path of aliens though.- Flying enemies have been removed, although missile towers remain and now fill the same role as meteor towers.- You can sometimes alter the terrain and create new build areas, although this feature wasn't explained and I didn't learn about it until almost finishing the game. It is not actually needed to succeed, so kind of pointless.- Towers now have passive upgrade items of different rarities, and at the start of a mission you can choose which one to have for each tower. You randomly unlock them after finishing a mission. They slightly alter the way towers behave, for example making lasers slow down foes, making guns pierce shields or making cannons damage multiple enemies. They come in different levels, so eventually you can have quite overpowered towers and these are needed for playing on higher difficulties.- There is now a level editor and people can sell their levels via Steam Workshop.- There are now some multiplayer modes, which I haven't tried yet so can't comment on, however the co-operative mode in which you share resources seems pointless. Considering you normally know where you want to put your towers, I'm not sure how having another player placing them would ever be helpful. Seems like it would only make things harder. The other multiplayer modes might be more worthwhile.- There are now alternatives to the orbital laser that you unlock as you go along. These are quite useful and suit different playstyles (e.g. slowing aliens, giving you some free resources).- Tower balance: from what I remember of the first game it has been tweaked somewhat. It's not so reliant on guns and cannons, while other towers like lasers and concussion are more valuable.- Scoring: they have changed how scoring works and the game also feels easier (I got gold on every mission very easily). The scoring seems more focused on killing aliens as fast as possible, whereas the first game involved more careful resource management to get big scores and you had to be more careful about when you built towers if you wanted to earn the most interest. The scoring seems much more variable now and less precise. However, a recent patch added the ability to play with the old scoring style. It also shows you your score on a graph while playing, with someone on your friend's list to compare with, which is a really nice feature.I found the campaign to be a bit short, the voice acting is very annoying and distracting and continues for too long after you finish a level, and the story is bad (although I guess in this kind of game that doesn't matter). But the game is also not challenging or compelling. Replaying levels in different modes is boring.Ultimately this is a fun game, but they have lost the perfect formula that made the first game so addictive and replayable. DG2's biggest fault is that it is not DG1.			"

These are quite useful and suit different playstyles (e.g. slowing aliens, giving you some free resources).- Tower balance: from what I remember of the first game it has been tweaked somewhat. It's not so reliant on guns and cannons, while other towers like lasers and concussion are more valuable.- Scoring: they have changed how scoring works and the game also feels easier (I got gold on every mission very easily). The scoring seems more focused on killing aliens as fast as possible, whereas the first game involved more careful resource management to get big scores and you had to be more careful about when you built towers if you wanted to earn the most interest. The scoring seems much more variable now and less precise. However, a recent patch added the ability to play with the old scoring style. It also shows you your score on a graph while playing, with someone on your friend's list to compare with, which is a really nice feature.I found the campaign to be a bit short, the voice acting is very annoying and distracting and continues for too long after you finish a level, and the story is bad (although I guess in this kind of game that doesn't matter). But the game is also not challenging or compelling. Replaying levels in different modes is boring.Ultimately this is a fun game, but they have lost the perfect formula that made the first game so addictive and replayable. DG2's biggest fault is that it is not DG1.			"

												This game is wonderful and addictive. My only complaint would be that the campaign is too short (I finished it in just a few hours) and the (slightly confusing) story is only told in voice over snippets (some cut scenes would have been nice). That said, it is a hell of a lot of fun and you can't really go wrong for less than 4 USD (thats the bargain, I got it for).Plus, there are additional levels and multiplayer modes for even more fun.

												well, so far i'm pretty happy with the game. being in beta it's missing a lot, but it's similar enough to DG1 with some added features that i'm confident the final product will be great. it took me a while to figure out what was bothering me about the game so far, then i realized that the voice of Fletcher hasn't been added yet! once i got past that i was able to let it go for the time being...so far, there's very limited menus let alone any real adjustable graphics or controls. i don't care for the way they light up the enemies' path in this one with arrows, but hopefully that's just part of the beta waiting to be upgraded.without control menus it took me a while to find and remember the buttons for the super laser, speed control, and the new feature that highlights your weapon damage intensities ala heat signature(which is a pretty cool feature.)also finally added is the ability to rotate the camera angle, which i don't find myself using often, but can be very advantagious  at times.the two maps included in the beta are a bit challenging and pretty well designed maps, with some good replay value.otherwise it's pretty much more of the same, which in the case of defense grid, isn't at all a bad thing.

												This sequel to Defense Grid feels very natural on a console controller. I noticed a complaint in another review which is true: the towers are hard to tell apart zoomed all the way out. I think the reason is that the farthest zoom level is for a map overview.The zoom levels are very easy to control in that there are three zoom levels, not a gradual scroll-wheel style zoom. It very much seems like this was developed for console controls, which is perfectly fine for me, but may frustrate people who want to play on a keyboard and mouse.While speed up on toggle instead of press may seem like an odd change (it's optional, but it's the default setting), it seems more natural once you've adjusted to it.Resource points advance with time, but also on wave completion, not on kill.If you liked Defense Grid, and you're not allergic to console controls and a nice comfy couch, DG2 is a huge recommend+.

												I do not feel like a tower defense game should have been very hard to make a sequel for. Defense Grid: The Awakening was  the first successful retail tower game that I can remember, and it did everything well. There was a great difficulty curve, and there was a lot of replayability.Somehow, the developers took everything the first Defense Grid had, made it just a little bit worse, and released it as a sequel. I can not really put my finger on why, but I did not enjoy this one as much as the first game.The humor is a big miss, and the dialogue is far more annoying than entertaining. Instead of one AI commentating, there is a squad of them bantering back and forth, and very quickly it becomes more noisy than interesting. The AI also seem to enjoy talking for awhile after you finish a mission, either delaying you or forcing you to miss the story to get some more gameplay.The game is much easier than the first one, and very few maps gave me any trouble. It is seemingly impossible to play through on hard for your first time, though, because you need to upgrade your towers with rare drops. The main campaign missions don't last long, and I didn't feel an urge to play the side missions.I still had a good time with the game, but it is a disappointing sequel to one of the best tower defense games ever. If you're craving more Defense Grid, it can't hurt to pick up for a lower price, but it definitely leaves something to be desired.			"

												This review will speak to those who played and enjoyed Defense Grid 1.The graphics have been made prettier, but I find this was not required. The original game was fine enough.The towers are ever so slightly different. A missile tower exists now aiming down instead of up, though it seems redundant with the meteor tower. No flying enemies yet 8 waves into the game.The menus are more confusing and seem more optimized for console play. No more independent mouse cursor, your mouse is locked to moving your entire view around. No clicking on any button-looking screen decoration; you have no mouse.The levels are challenging and fun, definitely worthy additions to the existing Defense Grid database of fun puzzles.PROBLEM: The voice acting and script writing has gone down tremendously in quality. The Commander character in particular feels like a pubescent boy constantly yelling in the mic, existing only to keep repeating the same message to the player. The elder British commander, while once being a lone, tragic figure, is now just a surly, self-confident boob. The female AI characters are both shallow farces of characters, used for scornful comic relief or suspicion. Worst of all, since there's a zoo of AI's with you at all times, you are constantly treated to this circus of immature jokes and rather light-hearted treatment of a vital threat to humanity.In the original game, you and the AI formed a bond. You got through this together. Now? You're the only one doing hard work while the AI's bicker, insult each other, and generally provide nothing of use.So, buy it for the puzzles and great gameplay, but you might actually enjoy the game better on Mute with some techno playing. All the important bits of the plot are found between levels in the decoded alien script. Use your imagination, and spare yourself the Five Stooges uploaded into AI form.			"

												What is Defense Grid 2?A Tower Defence game in the traditional format. Aliens spawn from one or more locations in progressively harder waves, move towards your base, steal power cores, and attempt to escape. The player has to stop them by spending limited resource points to place towers such as lasers and flamethrowers, in specific build locations around the map.Is it any good?Absolutely. Tower Defence has become one of my favourite genres, I've had alot of fun with the original Defense Grid (Steam tells me I've played it for 84 hours) and several other games, so I was expecting to enjoy D♥♥♥♥nd it has not let me down.What pleased me?•	Level design. There's a nice mixture of narrow paths, wide open plazas where you can build a maze, and multiple paths that force you to split resources.•	New types of aliens. One can regenerate health when not taking damage, another gives off an EMP that temporarily disables nearby towers when it dies, and there's also a dropship that lands next to your base and spawns a bunch of other aliens.•	Tower loadouts. There aren't many new towers, but each tower can unlock new special abilities that are equipped pre-mission. For example, lasers can slow down the targeted alien, teslas can disable an alien's stealth ability, and several other towers can automatically prioritise the strongest alien in range.•	Orbital laser has alternate modes, such as shooting towers to overcharge them and do more damage for a short time, or shooting loose cores to teleport them back to base.•	All of the above points result in lots of tactical depth and variety.•	Value for money. There are 20 maps, they all have multiple alternate challenge modes, and 4 difficulty levels. You can potentially spend dozens of hours trying to achieve a gold medal on each one.•	Your current score is displayed while playing, which is really useful to see how close you are to earning a medal.•	Stability. I've only suffered 1 crash in 10 hours, and the developers have just released a patch which should fix the most common crash reasons.What disappointed me?•	The story is nonsensical gibberish and voice acting is poor. However, I don't think Tower Defence games need to be strong in this area, so its not a big problem.Overall recommendationIf you like Tower Defence, buy D♥♥♥♥t full price. If you've never played the genre, DG2 would be a good game to start with. I don't think its essential to play the first game to enjoy the sequel.			"

												I know this has been out for awhile, but I recent;y picked it up and decided to give it a try. I really enjoy Tower Defense games, and Defense Grid 1 was great. Defense Grid 2, seems to be a worthy successor with a few upgraded aliens, some new graphics, good sound, excellent writing, superb voice acting, well balanced maps, and some neat tower upgrades. I've seen reviews that say it's just a re-hash of the first one, and I guess about 90% of the gameplay is the same, but that sure didn't douse my enthusiasm or diminish the fun I've had playing the first 10 levels of the campaign. In short, if you liked the first one, this is a worthy successor. If you haven't played the first one and you're not sure you want to plop down the cash, go try Defense Grid 1 out first. It's a cheaper investment and you can catch up on the story before sitting down in the middle of this one.			"

												Note: this review is mostly from the PS4 version of the game, which I also own and prefer to play because my Notebook can't handle the PC version very well.  They're the same game, but I've played that one more.  I clarify this because I only have 1 hour clocked on the PC version, and I don't want to give the impression that I haven't played it enough.The original Defense Grid is one of the best Tower Defense games in existence.  Heck, it probably is THE best.  Incredibly fun and addictive (in a good way), with a lot of content, varied gameplay and clearly coming from a group of developers who care for their audience and know how to make fun games (as evidenced by the minigames they created for the Portal 2 ARG).At first sight, this sequel looks to be the same.  A fantastic entry in the genre with the same basic gameplay and enough upgrades to justify it being a sequel rather than just DLC.  There are new tower types and upgrades, new enemies, new special weapons (the original had only one), a new story and lots of new characters.  There are also new modes to play (with advantages or handicaps) and extra abilities that can be setup before starting each stage.  In short, there's A LOT of content here.But, it's an impossible to ignore fact that, when compared to the first game, this one is still inferior.  And this is mostly because of a couple of factors: freedom and balance.  The original game pretty much allowed you to play however you wanted.  It gave you a lot of freedom on how to approach each stage.  This one, though, requires certain stages to be played an exact way if you intend to finish it with a decent score.  This issue causes the second one, as there's a couple of ridiculous difficulty spikes, as in a few stages the game forces you to change your playstyle to something specific if you want to have any chance.  Now you're basically following orders rather than playing for fun.To be fair, if you don't care at all about getting medals or keeping all the cores at the end then the difficulty is not a problem.  This is a very easy game in that respect.  Much easier than the first one, actually (there aren't even flying aliens here).  But if you do care for a question of completionism, challenge or achievement hunting, you're going to have a lot of frustration and you'll probably be forced to look for walkthroughs (something that rarely if ever happened on the first game).In short, it's still a good game.  Great even if your expectations for gameplay end with ""being able to advance to the next stage"".  But it's still an undeniably inferior product to the original in aspects that are quite important for this genre.7/10			"

												Cant wait for release! One thing i still dont understand is the scoring system. I dont really understand it and i have read the guides concerning this. I still dont get it lol. Last game i built fewer towers and killed the same amount of aliens but still did not beat my best score. I like the way awakening scores players. If you want those big intrest rates you are forced to build effeciently from the get go. At least i understood how i can get a better score i guess is all iam saying. please make difinitive scoring system that everyone can understand.			"

												Hello and this is my review about this game!This is a strategy Tower defence game.Interface/Menu/SettingsAll resolution sizes are available.You can only choose fullscreen or windowed mode.You are able to change the controls on the keyboard.You are able to change the controls on the controller.You can play with the xbox controller.There is a master volume slidebar available.There is a music volume slidebar availableThere is an effect volume slidebar available.There are dialogs volume slidebars available.You are able to toggle the subtitles.About the game.You can build your own maze on some of the levels and let the alien walk through your maze. Towers are shooting at the aliens and hopefully kill them. You can upgrade a Tower 2 times (So max level is 3) and you will increases their power or effects. Each alien has their own effect and style. So a variety of some Towers would be useful. Some towers are good for swarms, Some are good at killing off solo aliens. Some towers are good to slow down fast enemies. You also have a commander (That is basically you), There are several commanders each with their own unique power.Graphics are very nicely done. The story line speeches are totally voiced over and the game is very well instructed aswell.You are able to play this multiplayer and even LOCAL! There is a story line, difficulty settings and other game modes!There is a tower and Alien Encyclopedia available.Other things.It is just a regular Tower defense game with the same regular rules.-------------------I Give this game a 9/10			"

												I'll keep this review short and sweet.  If you like Tower Defense games, and if you liked the original Defense Grid, then you should *definitely* pick up DG2!  The graphics are slightly better than the first Defense Grid, but the excellent gameplay and mechanics have returned and have also been refined and enhanced.  One of DG2's greatest strengths is its level design.  Now the levels are bigger and better, but more importantly, they evolve and that changes up the gameplay considerably (in a good way).  D♥♥♥♥lso features some online multiplayer and co-operative gameplay which will appeal to those who love multiplayer strategy games.  The core of the game still revolves around buying, placing, and upgrading towers, but DG2 takes the classic formula and almost perfects it.  The story and narrative is interesting but of course it comes secondary to the mechanics and the overall polish found in the implementation of DG2's features and it's slick and easy to use inteface.  It's a little more expensive than the original Defense Grid when it first came out, but if you're enjoy the genre and loved the prequel, then you'll love DG2.  The $24.99 price tag is steep if you're a casual gamer or casual TD player, but the increased cost is well worth it if you consider the extra gameplay and replay value to be had from DG2's multiplayer modes and the inclusion of a level editor and Steam Workshop support.  On top of all of that, Steam achievements and online statistics make a return from the first game with even more detailed info that will allow you to compare scores and compete with your friends or other players from around the world.  So if you're a casual player of the genre, I'd recommend waiting for a sale or a slight price drop.  Everyone else who likes sinking their teeth into a good Strategy game or Tower Defense, and those who also like multiplayer modes in those genres, look no further - because DG2 will keep you entertained and occupied for quite some time.

												Very happy with this game and got my money out of it.  I can only hope that you like it because DG1 and D♥♥♥♥re the best tower defense games out there.  Glad the air units are gone because that was just a discration in DG1 once you memorized what you needed to kill them.  Love the game and all the modes it provides you to play.  Cannot say that I have really tested the co-op or head-to-head modes yet.What I do not like is the console port - Oh why must I use arrow keys on a PC - Seriously?  Also, for having a DG1 already in place we sure launched with some stupid issues - Like impossible scores on the leaderboards.Overlooking those 2 things it is a fun and wonderful game.  I suggest that you get this...			"

												People kept telling me, ""Defense Grid is the greatest TD of all time.""I looked at the videos and I was like, ""Well, it looks good.""I looked at the price tag and I was like, ""♥♥♥♥ that♥♥♥♥♥♥"" and I marked it 'Not Interested'.Then yet another person was telling me how awesome it is, and I looked in and saw it on sale for $7. So I bought it and I'm sitting here playing it. I'm already about 1/4 the way through, and it's the exact same game as all other standard TD games. I mean seriously. Same tower types, same enemy types (except the cloaking enemy), same general strategy.So I mean... It's not a bad game, but for ♥♥♥♥'s sake, $25? That's just too much for a generic TD. I mean the only advantage here is flashy 3D graphics and voice acting. I ♥♥♥♥ing hate flashy 3D graphics and voice acting when all they accomplish is jacking up the price.So anyway, I'm not really mad that I paid $7 for it, but I'm not going to recommend it either. $25 is outright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for a generic TD.Oh, and it wigs the ♥♥♥♥ out if I try to play with the mouse while a controller is connected or turned on.

												Pure, strategic Tower Defense with a lot of depth thanks to a wealth of play modes, difficulty choices and most importantly tower customization options.  A good sequel to the famed original, 'Defense Grid: The Awakening' which is hailed by many including myself as the best TD ever made.The sequel plays more different than it looks, resource income and scoring is tweaked a bit which has put some off, but is in my opinion an improvement. Boost towers is a great idea which offer extra upgrade options and can be used to adjust towers' line of sight and range.All is not perfect however, and here's a few things that should have been better:- The aliens are poorly designed and it can hard to tell the different types apart at a glance.- Bad sound track.  One track for menues and one during playing is extremely repetitive to listen to.- Ugly low quality FXAA that one has to fiddle with Steam launch command lines to disable.- Leaderboard cheaters is still a thing,  taking some of the drive to replay levels to improve your scores away.- UI is clearly designed for gamepad or tablet navigation.  It is so awkward to navigate with mouse+keys I've actually given up and now play this with a PS3 pad instead.  Big disappointment.- Monetized Steam Workshop for custom maps that is poorly maintained.  Charging money in a retail product for user generated content is a massive slap in the face, this needs to STOP.Outside of that, DG2 is very enjoyable and can offer dozens of hours of well designed tower defense gaming for those that must gold medal various game modes.

												I was a huge fan of the first Defense Grid. I think I have around 170 hours in it last time I checked. I was really looking forward to DG2! I pre-purchased it and played the beta a LOT!After nearly 30 hours of game play in the final release, I feel a little let down. DG2 isn't a bad game by any means but there are a few annoying things about it that keep me from loving it the way I did the first one.First of all, the scoring in the game makes absolutely no sense what-so-ever. Even after all my hours in the game, I have no idea which strategies earn the most points (and I've read all the posts from the developer about the points system). The point system seems very random. The tips the developer has on the DG2 Steam forum are at the very least misleading. The things they claim get your the most points, absolutely do not. The only reason I was able to put up several top 50 scores is nothing more than dumb luck. I have no idea what I did differently that got me more points than other times I played those maps.Ultimately I find the points system extremely frustrating. If I don't know what kinds of things I get rewarded for, how can I possibly come up with strategies that will advance my skill level in the game? I don't want to win with luck. I want to win because I came up with a brilliant plan to score the most points given a known set of measurements of success or failure.Other than that, the game is actually pretty fun. If you're looking for a tower defense game you can play for 15 to 20 hours, DG2 is a great choice (If you already have DG1). If you want a game you can replay over and over, you might want to pass on this one.			"

												At this point I'm really disappointed by this iteration. It feels like little more than a $10 expansion pack. The visuals are very similar and the mechanics don't seem all that different in the current build. I just don't think the current offering justifies the $25-30 price point.That said, this is very much a Defense Grid game. It seems promising and if you can get over the price or find it on sale it will be a great buy for fans of the original, though you aren't getting much content in the early access. If you haven't played the original yet, start there as this isn't the place to sample.			"

												It's Defense Grid again. It's solid tower defense. They've shaken the towers up so that cannons aren't the be-all and end-all of defense, an in fact rather than needing half your maze be ballistic to knock down shields, shields are reworked to the point of almost being irrelevant if you place the disruption tower upgrades appropriately. (As a final insult, level 3 cannon towers are now ugly wheezing bellows. This is not how recoil works, animators. The aliens tend to largely all look the same, too.) Airborne enemies are gone completely, although drop pods make for a tactically interesting replacement, running the maze in reverse.BUT. Big but. Hairline of negative review but.But it's deeply, deeply marred by the godawful AI banter. Everything that was mildly charming and background in the last one is now rubbing in your face like a chinchilla-urine-soaked cheese-grater as a badly-written soap opera unfolds between a half-dozen scenery-chewing unlikable characters. Yes, even he from the first game has become insufferable, and they predictably take his one little quirk and roll a whole stupid plot point around it. Do yourself a favour and put the dialogue volume slider down to zero. Then turn off the subtitles too. The story in this will just kill braincells you need to play the actual game.Oh, and there are persistent unlocks, because boy we've sure gotta be next-gen. I've yet to see if they ruin multiplayer, because that was so ill-designed in the beta it discouraged the other player from buying it.It also feels short when you put it up against the ridiculous amount of content the first one got. As always, wait for a deep sale. This review would certainly be negative at full price.			"

												I highly recommend this game to those who are new to and familiar with the tower defense genre. I played the first Defense Grid a few years back mainly on Xbox 360 and I feel the sequel compares quite well. Just like the first game, I was hooked into getting the highest medal possible on each of the levels.Found the games story mode to be easier than the first Defense Grid (Probably due to the lack of flying enemies I'd forget to pain attention to in the first game). You can complete levels using a variety of different strategies, at least on easier difficulties.The graphics are nice and I always felt I could get a decent view of the action by rotating/zooming the camera. I ran the game via SteamOS without issue. I used an Xbox 360 controller, which worked fine but feel that the game caters more to keyboard/mouse/desktop setup. Playing from my couch using a 42 inch display I found it challenging to read the text at times (maybe I'm just getting old).I liked how the story played out via audio/text at the beginning of each level while you were playing the game. The story was light and non-intrusive.Fingers crossed for Defense Grid 3.			"

												This is a review based on playing through the first chapter of the campaign missions in Defense Grid 2.The tower designs seem more modern than futuristic this time which is good for me. The gun turrets look more like AA guns now and the cannon turrets look and move vaguely like the mechs in Battlefield 2142. The Medals are back but are purely points based now instead of points and cores like before. I had one core get taken by the aliens in the 2nd map and still got a gold ""medal"" for it.Other tweaks like the graph showing your score over time with the bronze, silver and gold medals appearing at fixed point values for each map make it easier to tell how you are doing on the map.You now have a Command Shuttle as well and if you click on it you can see your mission stats in real time. The AI from DG: tA is back of course but you also have 2 other AI helping you as well and the banter between them and the other AI you encounter is an interesting change.Being able to upgrade your turrets with mods before starting a mission and the new Booster unit with the Overdrive ability are also cool. For a total cost of 250 energy (50 to deploy and 200 to activate Overdrive) I can see them being used in a few strategies.I will post an update as I play through the rest of the campaign.			"

The story in this will just kill braincells you need to play the actual game.Oh, and there are persistent unlocks, because boy we've sure gotta be next-gen. I've yet to see if they ruin multiplayer, because that was so ill-designed in the beta it discouraged the other player from buying it.It also feels short when you put it up against the ridiculous amount of content the first one got. As always, wait for a deep sale. This review would certainly be negative at full price.			"

												I highly recommend this game to those who are new to and familiar with the tower defense genre. I played the first Defense Grid a few years back mainly on Xbox 360 and I feel the sequel compares quite well. Just like the first game, I was hooked into getting the highest medal possible on each of the levels.Found the games story mode to be easier than the first Defense Grid (Probably due to the lack of flying enemies I'd forget to pain attention to in the first game). You can complete levels using a variety of different strategies, at least on easier difficulties.The graphics are nice and I always felt I could get a decent view of the action by rotating/zooming the camera. I ran the game via SteamOS without issue. I used an Xbox 360 controller, which worked fine but feel that the game caters more to keyboard/mouse/desktop setup. Playing from my couch using a 42 inch display I found it challenging to read the text at times (maybe I'm just getting old).I liked how the story played out via audio/text at the beginning of each level while you were playing the game. The story was light and non-intrusive.Fingers crossed for Defense Grid 3.			"

												This is a review based on playing through the first chapter of the campaign missions in Defense Grid 2.The tower designs seem more modern than futuristic this time which is good for me. The gun turrets look more like AA guns now and the cannon turrets look and move vaguely like the mechs in Battlefield 2142. The Medals are back but are purely points based now instead of points and cores like before. I had one core get taken by the aliens in the 2nd map and still got a gold ""medal"" for it.Other tweaks like the graph showing your score over time with the bronze, silver and gold medals appearing at fixed point values for each map make it easier to tell how you are doing on the map.You now have a Command Shuttle as well and if you click on it you can see your mission stats in real time. The AI from DG: tA is back of course but you also have 2 other AI helping you as well and the banter between them and the other AI you encounter is an interesting change.Being able to upgrade your turrets with mods before starting a mission and the new Booster unit with the Overdrive ability are also cool. For a total cost of 250 energy (50 to deploy and 200 to activate Overdrive) I can see them being used in a few strategies.I will post an update as I play through the rest of the campaign.			"

Posted: December 19, 2014
												Alright, so first of all: I am a big fan of DG 1 and I like DG 2. There. This is a review to dispel some of the wrong and inaccurate information in many negative reviews, that almost made me NOT buy the game!I am currently at Level 6 out of 20, so I have completed 1/4 of the game. This gives me enough information to write a first review. Here are some of the main complaints and what I think about them:1. People complaining that the game is too easy and everyone can beat it on gold and that they can't show off their virtual♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and don't know how to distinguish themselves and increase their score.A: No, the game is NOT too easy. There are 4 difficulty modes. I play on normal. Normal is pretty relaxed so far. There are 2 difficulties above that. I imagine they can be pretty hard. You also have additional challenge modes. You should not get bored unless you're maybe extremely good, but the average john will be challenged with normal alone.Your score is calculated whenever you kill an enemy alien. The score depends on the alien, how much money you have when you kill the alien and how many cores you still possess while killing said alien, while floating cores (the ones not at your core station) count only partially. Only cores that have been taken out of the map do not count at all. Apparently, the scoring system works very similarly to DG 1, but in real time. So this point of criticism is not valid in my opinion.2. People complaining about the resource system and that they have removed interest.A: This is technically not correct. You now receive a fixed income rate per ""tick"", namely 10, that is true. At the end of a round or every second round (I have to admit I haven't exactly figured that out) you get bonus money based on how much money you have NOT yet spent, meaning the more money you have available the bigger the bonus, i.e. interest. This is explained in the 3rd mission I think. People need to read and pay attention and not provide misinformation (almost every negative review that I read had this issue). So, not only does it pay off to play conservatively in terms of score, but also in terms of money and thus longevity/sustainability. Edit: I forgot to mention that you do no longer gain credits by killing aliens, that's true and it didn't even occur to me...that's bs. That's also why the command tower is gone I think.3. People complaining about how horrible the UI is.A: I have no idea what they are complaining about. People just complain. The UI is perfectly fine. You can get all the required information, it is simple to use etc. You can activate paths, you can show tower impact ranges, building and upgrading towers is as easy or easier than before AND you can play the game with a game pad just as well as with mouse and keyboard, which is brilliant. I personally am a mouse player primarily but I like to use the controller for this, because I can and it’s easy to use. (Update: Just checked and you can also use it in DG 1 but it is slower. Works fine too, however.)4. People complaining about the graphics and style.A: I have to agree here that DG 1 simply had clearer visuals. They tried too much with DG 2. It basically still looks the same, but with a lot more clutter and effects. Aliens and towers are harder to distinguish, although I’d say towers can are still easy to distinguish. Aliens on the other hand feel a bit bland, but mostly I can still see what I’m dealing with. The UI also tells you in the wave information. Personally I wish they had not changed the engine. It didn’t make a lot of sense and probably cost a lot of money. It’s not “ugly”, however.5. People complaining about the performance.A: Personally I couldn’t see any real lag, even with larger alien crowds. Maybe this happens later on. I did notice, however, that the game “seems” a bit sluggish in general.6. People complaining about the sound.A: This is unfortunately absolutely correct. The gun towers simply drown out all other sounds. You could barely hear them in DG 1, but in DG 2 one or 2 gun towers feel like a Manowar concert. You can still hear most other towers if you are in the vicinity, but especially the concussion and the cannon tower are basically silent towers, which is very sad, at least in the cannon tower case, because that “oomph” rocked! I always did hate the concussion tower sound.7.  People complaining about the unimaginative level design.A: Can’t really comment on that. So far the first 5 missions were pretty basic in design. You have to keep in mind, though, that this is not an expansion, but a new game, thus early levels must be simple to have a good learning curve for new players. Will see how it will be later on.8. People complaining about the story and the AI chatter.A: The story is…well, it’s a TD. Who cares, really? I do partially. Fletcher is still great. The others are ok. Before each level you get glimpses into the aliens mind set…this seems “interesting”. So far the chatter has been ok. I think you can also just disable the sound for that? Not sure. Just waiting for the raspberries!9. People complaining about the workshop integration.A: This is actually a pretty strong negative point for the game. Apparently you can “vote” for maps in the workshop, which then become available on the official DG store. I checked and one map seems to cost TWO dollars!!! TWO. Not only is it ridiculous to sell them, but the price is so over the top it is not even funny anymore. If you value community created content, this might be the point for you to NOT purchase the game.Now some general info:-	Aliens: There are a few new ones. Some that regen health. Nothing too interesting. I’m not sure if they took some out. Didn’t look like it, but could be. All in all, pretty boring stuff if you played DG 1.-	Towers: The tower encyclopedia in game does not list ANY new tower at all. In fact, the command tower is now missing…I think that’s the only 1 though.-	Boost blocks: You can build these cheap blocks to create mazes and put your towers on to give them additional effects like increased damage or cloak detect…etc. The concept is “ok”, the execution is…meh. You basically want to build them for every tower, because they only cost 50 credits and without them a tower can simply do 20%!!!!! Less damage. That is huge. Ofc, the upgrade costs money, but still…20% more damage for 250 credits? Still a good deal. Plus you get extended range and fire arcs. I don’t particularly like it. It is a bit clunky.-	Tower bonuses: You unlock bonus abilities for your towers, which you can choose before a mission. For example, my laser tower currently does 15% splash. This is a nice addition, but they could have added more interesting effects. Maybe there will be better ones later, but I somehow doubt it. -	Different commander bonuses: You can now choose a special power at the start of a game. No longer just orbital laser.All in all I would say that DG 2 is a good TD game. IF you have played DG 1 you might find that better in some aspects. It also has more maps to play on. IF you have NOT played DG 1…get DG 1 lol. No, seriously. DG 2 is not a bad game, but DG 1 is better imho. It is not as bad as people make it out to be and I will recommend it, but ONLY at a severely reduced price. Right now, it is 66% off…so only 8 euros or so, which is ok to get a few hours of new tower defense stuff.Overall, however, the “changes” and “additions”, wherever they are, do not warrant a full price…and the community map selling is just plain evil. The creators probably get some small amount for each purchased map, but if you are a map creator and doing this for the money, you’re doing it wrong. I loved creating Star Craft Maps back in the day…it would have never occurred to me to charge anything for that…pffft.			"

												This is the same good old formula as the first incarnation with a couple of new upgrades concepts for towers, and improved graphics. Also, the levels are interactive, making for interesting strategic planning. I would highly recommend it. It looks to be a top contender in the TD department.Personally, DG has always been my favourite TD game, and I think this will not let me down.Aside: I wish they had added more types of towers... Just look at Orcs must die (awesome selection). Apart from that, I love this game!			"

Unfortunately the replay value is low and my desire to continously redo each level in the different modes is non-existant.  While the game was fun in it's first play thru, the tower stratedgy largerly stays the same with you only building the same few towers over and over and over.  While I'm a really huge fan of tower defence games...this one is just lacking.  I think they spent more time on graphics then they did gameplay.			"

While the game was fun in it's first play thru, the tower stratedgy largerly stays the same with you only building the same few towers over and over and over.  While I'm a really huge fan of tower defence games...this one is just lacking.  I think they spent more time on graphics then they did gameplay.			"

You expect 2 to be an improvement on 1 however.On my machine the mouse is jumpy and almost impossible to get it to settle over one of the install points so I cannot deploy towers, there is no way to desensitize the mouse.  So the game is basically unplayable on my laptop.Therefore I cannot recommend it to anyone or comment further.Seriously disappointed after try to play on a number of occasions it will be removed and I will give serious doubts about further games from the same supplier.This moused problem is not something i have had with other games.

												Overall it's really good, but it's more of the same rather than the upgrade I would expect from a sequel. There's a small shuffling of powers, as command towers don't exist but get the same thing from upgrades. The orbital laser can do some new things other than just damage, like slow enemies or buff towers. There are no more flyers, but rather dropships that land at your cores and spawn enemies there. Everything else is pretty much the same, which is disappointing, but since the same is still very good I'm happy with my purchase.			"

												I bought this game without even thinking for two reasons:1. I loved the first DG, and it's probably the most memorable TD I ever played so far.2. I was going to play the new game in co-op with my friend.Horrible lobby and menu system took me quite some time to figure out how to launch a normal coop campaign game.Then came poor balance. The game was too easy on normal, and way too hard on the next difficulty. Also the level design - I really could not understand why every second level did not even involve any maze building, we just had to place new towers along the road as money came in. On some of the last levels I usually got bored by the end of level so I did not even build towers, I was just talking to my buddy about out stuff and watching monsters get killed.Another problem - connection drop-offs. We got disconnected on every second level, mostly just before finishing it. But since the levels we so easy, I we did not bother and moved to the next one.Last two levels we could not launch at all, because the game was just infinitely loading, no matter what we tried.I am not even going to try look for the fixes for these issues, because the game is not worth it.

												Absolutely loved the first one. I enjoyed the simplicity and difficulty. still my favourite tower defense game.This one is too easy. The boost towers combined with the usual upgrades, then the additional commanders and tower abilities take away more enjoyment than they add. The storyline is predictable and voiceovers mediocre at best. Really a pity, I was looking forward to this one.The interface was improved and the inability to inadvertantly block paths was a welcome addition.Although I completed the game I still replay the original with this sequel gathers dust.

												I was disappointed with DG2 unfortunately.   The main reasons for this:1.  The graphical upgrades from DG1 actually made it harder for me to work out what was going on.  Lots of bells and whistles, but they don't add to the core gameplay, which felt a lot cleaner and more precise in DG1.2.  The voiceovers.  Goodness me, these are... terrible.  DG1 was characterised by a really quirky voiceover whose occasional glitches and obsession with raspberries was amusing and sometimes a bit sad.  For some reason in DG2 this has been ""upgraded"" to a banter between at least 3 different characters, that really pushes hard for laughs and fails miserably.  Not funny, just cringeworthy.  3.  Gameplay generally; again the feel isn't there from DG1.  Having the option to build towers on top of other blocks and upgrade them both should in theory have added depth and complexity, but the beauty of DG1 was in figuring out the patterns and where you could divert the enemies to.  The levels of DG2 I was able to grit my teeth through just seemed really dull by comparison - more thinking about which combination of upgrades, and less thinking about pathing.Like most things, it's just my opinion based on playing for a little while and really failing to enjoy it at all.

												Defense Grid had set the bar for Tower Defense games, my favourite genre. Somehow, I expected this game to actually raise it - but instead, I felt like I was basically playing the first one again but with different levels. To add to this, the story in the first game was great and made you feel involved, whereas this one really doesn't.Im not sure what I expected, or how it could be better when the genre really is defined by Defense Grid the first, but it would have been nice to see Defense Grid 2 show some innovation, or bring something new to the table.

												I liked the first DG, and this one is very similar. I like that in this one it shows the pathing so you can immediatly know how placing a tower will affect things. And I also like that you can't even build a tower when it would be blocking. Unlike the first one where you could build the tower, but then they would just walk through. The game looks good and I didn't experience any issues with the single player.However, I did have issues with the multiplayer. I would like to try out the multiplayer, but the two times I tried, it failed to connect. There are other minor issues in my opinion. The menu system is confusing. And the story is worthless. The out of mission tower upgrades are confusing. I have no idea what I did to get them. And there is no free workshop content as far as I could see.I think many of these issues can still be addressed. Any paid DLC I would hope adds more variety, for example, more tower types, and more alien types, not just one map at a time.  Overall though I still recommend it for an tower defense fan if you can pick this game up on sale.			"

Defence Grid 2 is the best tower defence game in my opinion.Its everything you expect in a tower defence game with a few added touches.It's one of the few games I will repeat play continusly, even after getting in to other games. A quick dip in to DG2 is always satisfying.I only wish the leaderboards were a bit easyer/nicer to navigate. Or if it showed you leaderboard stats on the level select screen, that would make it perfect.			"

												Considering the high price I cannot fully recommend it.... the campaign is played through quickly, the multiplayer modes are not that fun. The only thing that keeps me playing at the moment though, is the random power upgrades that you can unlock through playing. I think once I have them all there is no motivation to play anymore...If you can get the game on sales, buy it, otherwise I recommend waiting for maybe some more content.EDIT: In retrospect, don't know why I gave it a thumbs down. Even though I don't play it anymore, I spent overall many many hours in multiplayer. Good memories.  It's expensive but if you like tower defense its ok.			"

												How is it I have not writen a review for this title?DG2 is fun! It's Pretty! It is a tower defence game with a story. It has many challenge modes.Your task is to stop the bad things gwtting to the cores and then taking them away with them.On easy you get to learn the game. After that the game can be a challenge at higher levels. Then there are to Co-op modes and a few more things.I have played 20.9 hrs and the game still offeres about the same amount of time in play maybe 10 hrs I will have to see.I give this an 8.2/10 Its bug free for me, looks nice, plays well, has a story/reason for doing things and there is co-op if you would like to do that.DG2 is a good fun game.

												I love a good tower defense game, I have ever since they existed in Warcraft III. I read tons of good reviews for this game so I grabbed it, but it is not grabbing me. There are an overwhelming amount of modes and I don't understand why. You can place towers in specific places but they aren't highlighted well and sometimes are on the path, so knowing they are there would be important. There's very poor visual feedback and the game is extremely easy to just zone out during. Any feeling of tension is wiped away due to this. I do not think I can continue playing it, it is just so boring. When I start to fall asleep during a game it is time to uninstall it. I am sad this game did not work out for me but it just did not.

												A Solid Tower Defense game, however lacking in two areas:1. small maps with very little room to actually maze. Most of the time your placing big upgraded towers and using brute force to win instead of cleverly designed mazes. Mazing is a key aspect of any tower defense game.2. You have to earn special abilities for each tower and it is rng based. By defeating a stage gives you a chance to get a bonus ability for the towers.When you first start playing your towers are at their weakest, kind of a catch22. So to make it easier to defeat stages you need to defeat more stages. This is a flaw in logic.			"

I was looking forward to the long awaited release of Defense Grid 2 with high expectations, but with some fear that it just couldn't be as good as the original game.  DG2 may have done just that.  The graphics and gameplay are a great upgrade from the original.  The story fit well.  There are change and additions that have expanded the original into something bigger.			"

												Tower defense is one of my favourite genre, Defense Grid do that in right direction.So let's talk about the 2nd series.- Graphics, the eyecandy although I'm not sure it was meant to please our eyes because it's whole new design & game engine, tower design feels cartoony instead like modern warfare, especially with glowing colors inside almost every towers, the explosion also feels overkill when it zoomed to max, it's hard to see the aliens because it's covered with explosion, with every details and things the graphics makes my eyes tired so quickly I have to quit the game when I play for an hours or two, before it starting to hurts my eyes.- Leaderboard, maybe you want to race or at least see what you've achieved compared the others, however cheaters ruin it, at this point I don't even bother to see my rank, things like this is discouraging.- AI Script, honestly I never pay attention to story but as you progress eventually you will know what's the situation of our game, and this time we are playing with more AI (it mean more voice) but this time unlike lonely, kinda adorable AI from DG1, I feel this time they were so clingy to each other, if you pay attention to the last scene and conversation our next Saga probably continue with Alien getting help by one of AI from this series.- Tower design (change, buff, nerf, etc), in DG1 mazing require cheap tower and Gun Tower is the cheapest of all, however being the cheapest not always the worst, which in fact you can complete whole game by using only Gun tower. in DG2 things have changed, they add Boost which do nothing except to elevate tower and gives certain buff. Gun tower nerfed a little bit, they didn't have so much power like in DG1, even stacking it doesn't really help in certain maps, and with no more Air alien making MISSILE tower kinda unnecesarry addition, Meteor tower does it better, Concusion tower in this game get's buff heavily, making Inferno tower kinda in same situation like missile tower.- Sound, not much different with blast and so on, it's great but I miss building sound from DG1Overall, DG2 feels like more fantasy instead sci-fi, a bit issue specially graphics keeps me not want to stare at the screen for very long time. I can play DG1 for many hours before my eyes get tired.Do I recommend it? Yes ofcourse, but if you haven't play DG1, buy that too, and play it in reverse order, play this first, and DG1 later.			"

												I have mixed feelings on DG2. It's more of the same as Defense Grid, which is good, but it lost it's heart. It feels more sterile. It has updated graphics, and the environments does look good, much better than in the first game. But the same can't be said about towers and enemies. Both look awkward to me, the towers looked much more functional in the first game, and their upgrading was much better, now when you upgrade a tower it simply vanishes into a hole, and the new tower emerges in it's place. Lame imo. And the aliens look well just bad, nothing like in the first part. In the first they looked mechanized and tough. Now most of them look like a chicken had a baby with an insect.  Others simply look like insects. And some look like dinosaurs without heads.But those are just externalities, if the game mechanics are still there there is no problem right? Sadly this is not the case. Game mechanics are much simplified now. The first game got it's appeal from the fact that the aliens were after your power cores, and the more cores you allow them to take, the less resources you can salvage. So your first aim was always to kill the aliens before they could reach the cores at all. Another fine thing was, that you gained interest for unspent resources. So you couldn't build towers like no tomorrow, because the more money you kept the more you made. This made a very interesting juggle to always have just as much firepower built that is absolutely necessary to kill the next wave of aliens, and no more. Because that meant loss of resources and less score and the end. Or on harder levels lack of resources to build enough defences for the next wave.Now the basic principle is the same in DG2 too, the aliens come for the cores and take them if you allow them. But the fine details are completely eradicated. It doesn't matter if you kill the aliens before or after taking the cores as it doesn't influence your resources. And interest is fixed, you always have the same resource flow no matter how many credits you have. So it's completely unnecessary to hold back on building, you can empty the treasury all you want all the time with absolutely no repercussions. To me this means the game just lost it's heart. Now all you have to focus on is tower placement that's it.There are a few new features like upgrades to towers that give them more firepower, or disrupt shields on aliens, or give a score(not resource!) boost, but it's not enough to offset the loss of the things mentioned above. And there is one more thing missing, there are no flyer aliens anymore. All of them are walkers. Or rather there is something that could be considered flyers, as sometimes they drop a pod next to the core housing to hatch aliens right there. Frankly this I feel is cheating in a tower defence game.  It kills the purpose of the game if the enemy can appear right at the finish line.Amongst other minor new features are self repairing aliens, that if you stop hurting them get back to full health, but as soon as you're prepared for them they make no difference. And aliens that drop shields on levels for other aliens to pick up, but with the disruptor tower upgrade this feature becomes mute too. I mean you don't have to alter your strategy because of it, just upgrade a few towers to disruptor capability and you're set.And you have new superweapons as well, but as I found out most of them are too weak to make a difference. So you'll stick to one or two of them anyway.Unusually for a tower defense game there is also some kind of back story, but it's even more lame than in the first game. And they went too far with AIs I mean you have these AIs whose only role seems that they spout nonsense into your ear all the time, one of them more annoying than the other. In the first game you only had one, that was fine. If they wanted more characters they should've made some real NPCs not all of them AIs. Or small cutscenes maybe to make it more personal. But there is nothing like that. They wasted money on recording half a dozen idiotistic voices in a studio. So that's what I think about Defense Grid 2.Mind you I haven't played all the game modes yet, only the basic campaign. But it feels lacking. If I want to score it it's a 6 out of 10.			"

												I actually really wanted to like this game, but i just..can't recommend it..I started playing, with a friend...learned that the mutilplayer game mode were added after the game was done...It's very simply just the same maps with share resources....really disapointing..The single player, isn't that hard...So far I have only used two of the diffent towers, (The rest dosen't seem worth it after trying them once in the game you unluck em), and I have gotten gold on every mission, without losing a core... So I ramped up the difficulty, and..than the game just started feeling unfair...So..No! Don't buy this if you are looking for a tower defence game...Plenty of better ones on free websites...the game is okay, for a single playthough (3 hours or so) Haven't reached the end yet my self, but I can see all the maps and each map dosen't take that long, so at max 3 hours, based on the math done here 3 ""worlds"" in..There is minimal replayablelity..even tho the game attempted to make alot, the replayability is simply adding a modifier, (handicap to your self or bluff to the enemies) and, because of those..It really just feels like the same map, as it was without em...So, If you want a hard tower defense, do not buy this..if you, just want to play a brainless tower defense for a few hours, than I would recordmend it.

												Defense Grid 2 is a solid Tower Defense game. It's fun for at least 10 hours, which it took me to pass through it once plus a bit on top of that. It's an excellent game if you just want to put your brain in AFK and watch a movie at the same time. But the critical error this game makes is it's got a price.It may sound silly, but to be honest, when asked ""what new does Defense Grid 2"" bring to the table, the game chokes. I don't see why you would play this instead of something like Onslaught 2, which is a free flash game. This game plays the safe game, which in this genre is kind of silly considering the amount of copycat TD games that exist.One thing that the game has going for it is relatively high production values compared to other TD games, but that's not what you're really looking for in this genre, now is it?All in all, if you've ever played a TD -game, then you've already played Defense Grid 2. It brings nothing new to the table and is therefore a creatively low-effort game. If you get it for 1$ in a sale, then it can't really harm to get it, but there's no justification for a full price purchase.			"

												The best-looking and challenging tower defense out there, with lots of options and a target which loses ""cores,"" which can be recovered if in time, There is a lot of ""story"" dialogue at each level's beginning, but it's ignorable, even though the game doesn't really start until the dialogue is over. Very well done, and highly recommended.			"

												Backed the game on Kickstarter.Got the game for free.Tried many times to play campaign on elite (as I did in DG1).Failed badly already on level 2 and 3 (starting with Threshold).All tube tutorial video strategies for elite difficulty level failed for this map. Devs have probably catered to players whining about game being too easy and buffed the difficulties in recent patches w/o proper testing.Tried to play multiplayer, waited for 50 min, the matchmaking haven't found anyone to play with (meaning the total achievement completion will be impossible).Never managed past level 3 since I play only on elite for achievements. Uninstalled the game.As much as it hurts me, I won't recommend the game, since its difficulty level is unpredictable across the campaign.			"

												You've got to be kidding me!!! The graphics are @!$#@, the gameplay makes no sense, even the music is crap compared to the original score. Back to this garbage in a moment, well I thought, at least I can use the level editor...nah, that would have been too easy. When I loaded up the the editor, half of the program seem to have been (nyi)..I asume that stands for not yet installed? Well when do you plan on installing it? Next week, month, never? The graphics are not to be belived for a 2014 game. No smooth animation, you can't zoom in really close like the original(I guess they don't want you to see how♥♥♥♥♥♥poor that stuff really is!) I probably could go on but what's the point? Valve and Hidden Path got your money, they don't give a damn. I have been waiting for this game for years. What a letdown! What a POS!! Maybe I will write more later. Oh and Valve, you should not count ANY time played on demos,betas and any non-fianalized product as time spent using the product(as is spelled out in your virtually non helpful refund policies!)YoursWes			"

												This is an alright game, not a great game. It is fun enough, and may well be worth the buy on sale (I did have fun playing through it) but it is not nearly as polished as it needs to be for the price tag. My complaints include the random system of attaining upgrades for your towers, the lack of tooltips, restrictions of mouse movement (once in the upgrade menu of a tower the mouse can only move up and down, a symptom of being a port from consoles not done right) and the inability to easily restart a mission in multiplayer mode.

Setting the bar as the definitive tower defense game, Defense Grid 2 introduces new worlds and threats to test your tower placement strategies. With a bold new look, a compelling single-player campaign, and the addition of new game modes, online player-versus-player and multiplayer co-op, every play-through brings fun new opportunities and challenges. - Highly Recommended!

												Hidden Path should feel utter shame for defense grid 2, which clearly is a attempt to milk DG1's fan base. I was very excited to get this game, even more so when I saw co-op. within 5 minutes of playing this game I already could see some issues.Co-op?? co-op is more like single player with spectate, players SHARE the resource pool effectively making multiple players pointless.UI - The UI is ugly, clunky and 1 dimensional, it litterly looks like something I made my first term in freshman year for a Photoshop class.Gameplay- is almost the same as defense grid 1, it offers a few new but completely unneeded features.settings- this game lack many basic video game options, like changing the sound setting... yep that right you can't change the sound settings. luckily it does support diffrent resolutions, the problem is you need to change it outside of the game, meaning you cannot change it while the game is running...price- this game in no way justifies its price its hastily slapped to together, most of the new features like co-op are horrible and had little to no thought put into them.PAYING FOR FAN MADE CONTENT - yep that’s right they charge you cash for stuff fans made...I really enjoyed Defense grid one, and i have to say I feel thoroughly cheated. I can't help but feel like Hidden path realized they had a good fan base and made this just to milk them. DO NOT BUY THIS.			"

												Horrible.  The first Defense Grid is better. DG2 has a mouse problem where the mouse is too sensitive and the setting won't correct but make it worse.  It takes several clicks of the mouse to get the tower menu to appear and then several more clicks to get the choice you want.  By this time, several of the aliens have passed by.  The computer banter is useless and distracting.  When there is a good piece of information, I have already tuned out the banter and missed the info.  DG1 is a classic tower defense game and DG2 is a swing and a miss.  I stopped playing at mission 7 as the mouse arrow was vanishing and pretty useless at bringing up the tower menu.

												One of many glaring deficiencies you’ll see in DG2 first off is that the designers really have NOT put any creativity or basic thought into scaling. Buildings are microscopic compared to the enemy you are combatting and it looks ridiculous to say the least, removing all intimacy from the battles; it would have provided a personal experience if the Grid, Creatures, and Environment were all proportionate to one another. My question is- why go through all the trouble of improving the battle effects, make the weapons systems look really dorky, and the creatures so plain? Is this the “Bold New Look”? This is KIDD STUFF. As for the “Beta Release” Game Play, (3) Graphics, (7) Sound (3) Story (?) = 3.25ish. Bottom line- it’s a new tower defense game to play. Hidden Path Entertainment- you should see what the youngsters are doing at my community college DMA department, because you’re not getting squat for your dollar, this could have been a blockbuster.

												Im the biggest fan of this franchise and couldn't wait for the DG2. But as soon as I launched he first campaign, my jaw dropped with dissapointment. The only original feature barely remaining is the grid-based map layouts to filter aliens through, but that's about it! The enemies are barely indestinguishable from each other, way too tough, too fast, the towers all look the same, towers are super weak, and it used to be pretty clear by the borders on the towers where aliens can and can't go, but instead now it shows you a pre-calculated path. The path mechanic I dont think has improved anything because for me, the challenge always seemed to plug the gaps you didn't see, that was the challenge!Im sorry, so dissapointed, the art style and game play is for an entirely different game, this is not a good sequel for a legendary game as Defense Grid.

												Loved the first game, and bought and liked all the DLC for it. Have been waiting for the sequel eagerly. It's the first game I've eveer bought full price on Steam. I have to say it's disappointing. Almost every aspect of the game feels worse than the original for some reason. The graphics are of lower quality, not just visually, but design-wise. The new designs make everything look very similar. Aliens and towers do not look different enough. The scale also seems off... the aliens are too small when compared to the towers. Graphics are very jagged even on ""very high"" graphics setting. Disappointed also to see that the final release of the game only has 21 levels. Hoping very much that things improve, but right now, it's not a polished game. Seems unfinished. I don't know what they were working on for so long.			"

												Update 9/20/2014In the last update they did for the beta it got better, some of the towers do seem to have more animation but the new teals tower's lighting animation caused graphical black lines to pop on my screen every time it fired as though there was a graphical glitch.I still feel like the cannon tower looks way to different from its predecessor (give me back my three barrel death cannon) and i do agree with allot of people that a locked mouse when in tower selection is not the way to go.The game play has gotten better, less laggy, and the explosion effects dont seem as crazy as they first were.In regards to the ant path and the color of some of the aliens it seems to have been toned down and maybe it was just a over arching bloom effect gone crazy before.Overall they have fixed a lot, I notice they took out the teasel tower for now.I hope they rethink the cannon tower in its final upgraded form. Say hello to my death accordion you aliens lol and the only other nagging point is the heart beat do-dad when you right click on the alien. Wish it truly reflected the aliens health but not at this time…just a looping animation.--------------------------------------------Original 4/23/2014The game at this stage is a bit choppy on my system and its also very hard to distinguish the aliens from the path and all the effects that happen from explosions.I really miss the old simple colors and the clean look and feel. It feels like my computer is working way to hard on fancy graphics. If they had kept the same graphic engine but put all of these new towers, aliens and functions into this DG2 it would probably play allot smother.Hope they tone it down again so I can see what my towers are shooting at and fix this jumpy game play. Esp going from normal speed to fast forward nearly made my system choke.Keep up the good work though :)At this time im saying NO to recommending only because even with my $$$ graphics card the game was graphically sluggish, jumpy, and visually a mess to play.

												Honestly, this game is just an absolute pile of mediocrity. I feel sad I've wasted too much money on it. even the simplest tower defense games from flash websites and blizzard custom map schemes are much more complete, in dept, with more towers, better controls and way more monster options.It was really disapointing to me in a way, that even after the second match I've unistalled it feeling ashamed of such a waste of money.The ONLY decent gimmick was the stage changing and growing in the middle of the match, apart from that, you can find MUCH better tower defense games FOR FREE.

												I'm a long-time fan of DG1, and bought D♥♥♥♥gainst many reviews saying it was the lesser game.  To keep it short and sweet:-They removed flying aliens but kept missile towers.-They added a blank tower block (costs 50).  It allows mazing and damage boosts to towers.-As you progress through the story, your towers acquire items that can give and take from the tower's original damage/function.-You can now select different AIs for different command functions.  Orbital laser's on the first one, other command functions (including a laser that boosts your towers' damage output for a period of time!) are TOTALLY viable.-They imported the old scoring system, so you have the option of having the DG1 resource accumulation.-There's frickin' multiplayer, man.Lots of reviews say there's more mazing in these maps, which to be honest, I'm hoping that comes out a bit more in the later maps.  Unlocked the 4th mission, not as much mazing as I'd hoped.  I liked the super grinder missions, which, I haven't seen any on these yet.As a fan of DG1, I was -totally- satisfied with my purchase just browsing the options before my first mission started.			"

												Defense Grid 1 (DF1) was a very solid game and Defence Grid 2 is its successor. It is worth buying on special and is not good as the original.DF2 is a solid game, with a few extra gameplay elements over DF1, however Hidden Path Entertainment has created a game that is too long, with too many poorly distinguished options that overly complicates things under the time pressure of waves of enemy, and a storyline that leaves you as a bystander more than a key participant.It just doesn't play as well and can become tedious. There is replay value, but it is not appealing. Given a choice, play DF1 as it is perhaps the best tower defense game available. Another game, Defender Quest, is less polished but preferable to play than DF2.			"

I have just played it through twice, the second time trying to beat my score from first time round. Tremendous fun, trying new tactics out. I also like the shuttle grid enhancements - click on it and you'll see what I mean. Story? Meh, who cares?

												I absolutely loved the first Defense Grid.  I think it was in my top ten time sinks on the 360 and I completed all challenges on most of the levels.  This one, I've had fun with but I'm not finding quite as addictive.  I think perhaps it's because I played so much of the first and other than a whole lot of new levels, the only addition is the advisor ability.  If you've never played the first, there's no reason to not start with this one.  It offers more levels and a little more gameplay depth.  If you're worn yourself out the first, I say pass unless/until you're really hungry for more.			"

												I am a big fan of DG1 and spent many hours on that game. I don't review many games but DG1 deserved a positive review. With DG2 I was a bit uncertain. I downloaded the demo and found the opening interface very different. I also noticed the graphics was a bit more sluggish and found the towers a bit more challenging to differentiate than DG1. But that is easily fixed by notching the detail level down. It doesn't materially impact gameplay.Steam recently had a 75% sale and I couldn't resist anymore. I am happy to report that DG2 is very enjoyable and I am quite happy I purchased it. There are enough differences in DG2 to make it worthwhile for the upgrade. You don't have to have DG1 experience to play but it is nice to see where DG2 came from.  I recommend people get BOTH games. In DG2, I really like the addition of the Boost tower. In DG1, players are forced to buy guns to shape paths but it was ""often wasted"" resource because upgrading them didn't provide strategic value. The Boost tower is perfect for shaping paths.The Missile tower in DG2 has been changed to become an attack unit against land aliens between the Cannon and Meteor towers. In fact, there are no aerial units in D♥♥♥♥s it was in DG1. I have mixed feelings about this. In some ways, it makes DG2 easier without having to contend the aerial units. I think Hidden Path needs to bring the aerial units back again.I have attempted to play multi-player but haven't been able to find anyone in the multi-player search function. I guess I will have to find someone I know to play it with.Hidden Path has not provided much news on the future of DG2.  The Hidden Path store has some .99 maps designed by devoted players and approved for sale by Hidden Path.  But it would be nice to have some DLC packs. Having said that, there are many free maps created and designed by fans to play. Unfortunately, it is a bit cumbersome unless you are somewhat technical-oriented.  Non-technical people will be forced to pay for store maps.Overall, I am big fan of both DG games. Hidden Path needs to release more information or news on the future of DG2 or it will languish. I have read some of the negative reviews and some of the complaints are just offbase to me.  People are overly-critical of DG2. Hidden Path has reduced the price and if you get a 75% Steam sale, it is simply a no-brainer to get it. "

												Tower Defense is a genre I've always had trouble getting into. Often the 'plot' is string-thin if even present and the mechanics are often a sticking point. Defense Grid 2 helps justify its existence by having a fairly solid if modest narrative and a colorful cast of characters with a fairly lame but at least present story. The gameplay is simple and can at times require a few retries to get a level down just right. Getting a high score can be fun and challenging, but the game doesn't pick up in true difficulty until Hard difficulty. Even then, hardcore fans of the first game may be disappointed in the comparatively more gradual curve, the sometimes outright random level difficulty (some missions you can do with say, a few gun towers in one spot, while others are really hard suddenly), and the loss of flying units.Basically, this game is more accessable then its predecessor when it comes to new players. I really love this series and would love to see more added to this game- but uh, right now I don't know if it's worth the ~20 usd that they are charging. It's a gem in terms of some character points (namely in regards to Memory and Arteficial Longevity), but the gameplay is essentially OK.COOP is really fun, it makes for a pleasent time killer and I found that collaborating on tower placement tended to work well- and on some of the larger maps it's pretty much a guarenteed win to have two players handling towers up front and in back. Still, I caught the game on sale for about 3-4 dollars and feel satisfied with it. Sadly, I'm not sure this series has enough to offer for its price as of present.			"

												Very enjoyable sequel to Defense Grid (DG).  Improvements over the original edition were the incorporation of aspects of the “Command Tower” into the Boost tower.  The Boost tower does add a bit more of nuance then the original edition.  Initial maze creation is less costly with the Boost towers, and careful placement of the Boost tower is still essential in winning the game.   If you’ve played the extended versions of the original DG, you’ll find that you will quickly be able to excel at this version.  While the Orbital Laser was the only choice of off-world help in the original edition, DG2 does a very good job in expanding the options to allow tower boosts, resource (money) boost, and more.  Some levels are well suited to these new options, where the Orbital Laser would have been over-kill or less challenging if used.Well worth the money, and even better if reduced via a Steam sale price :) "

												first thing first: I'm a huge DG fanbut I'm no fan of this one here.to be fair, the PROs:+ good looking menu+ nice graphics, but not really an improvement from DG:Awakening+ most of the game like in the first DG+ tesla tower with new abilities+ new: boost towersto be honest, the CONs:- tower AI. I just witnessed several towers turning and aiming for enemies without shooting because they were too busy turning. Very frustrating when you know that you actually built strong towers and the weakest aliens just run through.- controls suck. Backspace almost doesn't react, so when when you jump backwards and find yourself in the same situation because you just passed a checkpoint, you keep hitting backspace until you give up and simply restart the mission... o.O- controls suck. Again. The signals incoming from the mouse seem to be ignored by the game half the time. Affects the menu and ingame mechanics- new default game mode drops credits per killled alien, adds credits per second instead. Other game modes availableI must admit, I am a bit frustrated.4/10			"

												Defense Grid 2 is like the average season after you win the Super Bowl. The prior Defense Grid was special and I played for hours. The graphics, voice acting, game elements were just right. Defense Grid 2 tried to fix something that wasn't broke. They say a camel is ""a horse designed by comittee"" and thats how this game feels. The sum isn't greater than the parts like first DG game. The acting is over the top. Game elements have been dummed down and made less interesting. The GUI is overcooked, The towers are more clunky and the resource management skill isn't there. I put 500 hrs into early DG. I never would have done that with this game. For the cost its still worth a buy and fun to play. I think the devs deserve another shot to bounce back			"

												The original was more entertaining to me, but this one is pretty good, anyway.  I recommend it to tower defense junkies because... well, we simply can't have enough of this genre, can we?  That said, DG2 is a game I recommend only at a deep discount.  It won't offer much difficulty and may be a little too slow-paced for tower defense veterans.  It has unique features, like the tower booster platforms, and the voiced dialogue is nice the first time through.  I wish the game gave you the option to turn the dialogue off for repeat sessions.

												Brilliant, beautiful game.In many ways even better than Defense Grid 1 (which is really, really saying something).They actually found great ways to expand upon the formula with 1- more intuitive tower types, such as ""boost"" towers that do the functions the old ""Command Towers"" did- but also allow OTHER towers to sit on top of them, for a better vantage point 2- more challenging enemies, including EMP aliens that temporarily shut down towers nearby when they are killed, and ones that 'drop' shields for other aliens to pick up3- Some customization of the towers and superweapons that remains nicely balanced.4- Dynamic level design that you can change in some ways (for example, adding a whole new section of level if you need more space to separate the aliens from the cores).A tiny bit short is my only complaint- but even THEN it's worth every cent!Buy it.

Look at the original game play, and do that. This is far more clunky, I felt like I wasted my time playing the first hour. In that amount of time, the sotry failed to make any sense 3 times as well. Thanks for ruining all of the potential of the first. I really hope they remake this in the spirit fo the original, I'm suprised that they don't have some play to win cash/crap store at this point. -10/10 will tell everyone not to waste thier time even looking up this game, let alone playing it.

But compared to the average tower defense game, it's definitely recommended.Compared to the original, it isn't as hard, doesn't have as much content, has a weaker story, and just isn't as fun. I played the original for 72 hours. I played this game for 16. I still think fondly of the original. I mostly forget the sequel, but I do hope they'll add some extra content in the future that is better balanced and more challenging.So, if you love tower defense games you should buy the original and this game. If you only like tower defense games once in a while, buy the original and it will give you enough top quality content to last a long time.			"

												The original Defense Grid is considered one of the best Tower Defense games out there.  So the question is....how does the sequel hold up?The short answer is: Not as well as the original.On the other hand Defense Grid 2 is still a fun game.  It follows all of the tower defense tropes as expected.  A variety of towers.  Upgradable.  Place them to best abuse the map layout while killing as many aliens as possible.  There is a story like in the original but this time you have a lot of new AIs joining your crew with their own quirks.  Each also offers an alternative special weapon such as a resource gathering laser or the ability to control what the towers target.  Most of the new AIs don't get enough time to be throroughly developed with one exception, but still it allows a lot of fun interaction between them.   Now where the changes have happened.  First there are no longer flying aliens with their alternate routes.  Overall this makes things a bit easier as you're not worrying about them.  The missle tower is now basically a cannon tower on steroids.  Even more firepower with greater range but even a slower rate of fire.  Command towers are gone.  Instead you can upgrade boost towers which you place a normal tower on.  The upgrade choices are disrupter(reveals stealth, turns off shields on nearby enemies), score boost(does exactly what it says), and overcharge(ups tower damage by 25%).  This also helps make things easier as disrupter is really good meaning certain towers just aren't necessary(notably the Tesla tower which is the main anti-shield tower.  Why use it when you can just upgrade another tower with a disrupter?).  There are unlockable upgrades that you get by beating levels.  These are handed out randomly sometimes when you beat a level with higher difficulty increasing your chance of a reward.  Most of them make your towers better at no cost so if you're having trouble with a level, these can definitely make things easier for you.  For example there's a temporal missle reward that causes your missle tower to heavily slow an enemy as well as doing heavy damage to it.  You can only have one of these upgrades assigned to a specific tower at a time and it applies to all copies of the tower you make.  The aliens are mostly the ones you know from the original although a few new ones have been added and some older ones have had small changes in how they do things.  And the fliers as noted before are gone.  Overall Defense Grid 2 is a fun game with the AIs giving it some personality if perhaps a bit too easy due to certain easily exploited mechanics.  Definitely worth adding to your collection if you're a fan of the genre but if you don't like the genre there's nothing here that's going to change your mind.			"

												As an avid Tower Defense lover, i had high hopes for Defense Grid 2, but.. Hidden Path seems to have had other ideas in mind, such as charging players for player created content, minimizing replayability (If it were not for the achievements i would not of put as much time into this game as i did) and overall creating a bland experience.The multiplayer scene of this game is literally non-existent. There is nobody that plays this online. There is no new content for this game coming out and it seems it has just kind of been abandoned for other things, which seems to be a trend for Hidden Path.Oh, but WAIT! NOW they are bringing Defense Grid 2 to the Oculus rift! Why, might you ask? Probably for a cash in. They say the graphics are going to be better, this and that, we'll be able to see the monsters better.. Its all a load of horse crap. I love tower defenses, but please stop supporting companies like this that just make generic games and then offload them so they can start on their next offload project.I did get some enjoyment out of this, but once you realize you are literally the only person on steam playing this, it becomes increasingly boring and just.. Blah. This might of been worth our time, had Hidden Path actually put a substantial amount of theirs into it. I think i bought this game for like.. $16, without even reading any reviews, just because i love TD's that much.. But it was a mistake overall. Don't be that guy. Read the reviews, don't support this bullcrap in our treasured gaming community.			"

												Tower Defense is a genre I've always had trouble getting into. Often the 'plot' is string-thin if even present and the mechanics are often a sticking point. Defense Grid 2 helps justify its existence by having a fairly solid if modest narrative and a colorful cast of characters with a fairly lame but at least present story. The gameplay is simple and can at times require a few retries to get a level down just right. Getting a high score can be fun and challenging, but the game doesn't pick up in true difficulty until Hard difficulty. Even then, hardcore fans of the first game may be disappointed in the comparatively more gradual curve, the sometimes outright random level difficulty (some missions you can do with say, a few gun towers in one spot, while others are really hard suddenly), and the loss of flying units.Basically, this game is more accessable then its predecessor when it comes to new players. I really love this series and would love to see more added to this game- but uh, right now I don't know if it's worth the ~20 usd that they are charging. It's a gem in terms of some character points (namely in regards to Memory and Arteficial Longevity), but the gameplay is essentially OK.COOP is really fun, it makes for a pleasent time killer and I found that collaborating on tower placement tended to work well- and on some of the larger maps it's pretty much a guarenteed win to have two players handling towers up front and in back. Still, I caught the game on sale for about 3-4 dollars and feel satisfied with it. Sadly, I'm not sure this series has enough to offer for its price as of present.			"

												A simple but deep Tower Defense game. As you play through the story the maps go from simple one path maps to maps where you need to build tower mazes in order to survive.+ Plenty of different tower types.+ Lots of different maps.+ A lot of different modes.+ Online leaderboards for all maps/modes.+ Custom maps.- Story is a bit lacking.

												Ahhh, Defense Grid is back, and it's just as wonderful as before. Great voice acting, good story (a little more interesting this time around), and solid gameplay. Some levels are set, while others (moreso in the later ones) require pathing, but there are multiple ways to acheive victory. The towers are a little more balanced now - they all have their strengths and building a single tower type is not a good strategy. Inferno is the only tower that seems underpowered, but it's really cheap. You are able to exploit the pathing on some levels to make the mobs go back and forth under your guns, which isn't that fun (but not required, so don't play that way!)If you liked the first one, definately get the sequel. If you haven't played the first one, buy both! 8 hours to complete the story mode on Normal (gold on all levels). There is TONNES of content (mission modes, endless, coop, multiplayer) that I haven't even explored.			"

												It's hard for me to reccomend this game, get it on sale. If I could only choose ""No Opinion"". If you have DG1 this game can be a nice addition to your library. It's fun, playable, has some nice new features and the graphics detail is nice. New AI's have been introduced that have unique Orbital attack modes from the original laser bombardment to power core teleportation and more. Towers can also now gain enhancements in addition to normal upgrades, which is very welcome. Enhancements vary per tower and include piercing shields, slowing the target(s) and chemical ordnance to name a few. There are new enemies but no more flying enemies. The Missile tower now targets ground units and is very effective. But...The game campaign seems short, only 21 missions. Of course with several difficulties, the game-play can be much longer. As of June 2015, the game suffers from several serious bugs. Even the bug reporting application crashes unless the player manually creates a ""Logs"" folder inside the main game folder. The most serious bug involves the use of the Backspace key, which is designed to restore previous auto-save points. Without this function, it is like playing the game in Ironman mode.			"

												Very enjoyable sequel to Defense Grid (DG).  Improvements over the original edition were the incorporation of aspects of the “Command Tower” into the Boost tower.  The Boost tower does add a bit more of nuance then the original edition.  Initial maze creation is less costly with the Boost towers, and careful placement of the Boost tower is still essential in winning the game.   If you’ve played the extended versions of the original DG, you’ll find that you will quickly be able to excel at this version.  While the Orbital Laser was the only choice of off-world help in the original edition, DG2 does a very good job in expanding the options to allow tower boosts, resource (money) boost, and more.  Some levels are well suited to these new options, where the Orbital Laser would have been over-kill or less challenging if used.Well worth the money, and even better if reduced via a Steam sale price :) "

												I like this new version.  Big, big fan of the first DG, and now a fan of D♥♥♥♥s well.  It's not radically different from DG1, and thats a plus.   Yet there are significant improvements like the rotating perspective, new towers and attackers, more gameplay variations for each map, ammo variations, larger maps, etc...  All with nice, fluid gameplay and no lagging.  I am using a mediocre AMD APU grapic processor with only 512mb dedicated ram and I have it set to 'Very high' graphics..Intially I had noted that I didn't want all the A.I. chatter, but I have since found that I could turn them off, turn down the frequency or just lower the A.I. volume in the settings.  Nice.  People at HP were thinking proactively.This promises to be a well spent 25 bucks.  If you liked DG1 or TD games in general, buy it.  For those not already familiar with DG, think of traditional Tower Defense games in general, but with everything bumped up several generations using a gaming engine (Gamebryo) used by some of the larger and more expensive game titles found on Steam.As time goes by, I am enjoying this more and more.  Becoming a DG addict all over again.			"

												I am a Defense Grid fan and just can't wait for new stuff. I bought Defense Grid 2 a few days ago and I am a bit disappointed by this sequel. Indeed where first Defense Grid The Awakening seems polished about graphics and gameplay Defense Grid 2 seems to be a beta version which keep to be improved. First of all game is lagging on my core i5 laptop even in low settings, towers movements are too fast and jerky, aliens are too fast and unreadable, health bars cannot been hidden (?), Inferno and Meteore towers are very shy, Laser tower is ugly, moreover there are too much blah-blah-blah ! I cannot stand all these useless speeches ! Level introduction are too long, who cares about ? We wants action and now ! But game is colorfull and overall packaging is pretty good. In conclusion this sequel is not essential but deserve a try. I hope that Valve Team will read and care about gamers comments and improve Defense Grid 2 as it seems launched too early and need polishing.			"

												For me DG 1 was pretty much perfection. The GFX was clear and minimalistic. The aliens and towers very distinctive. It was a game with enourmes replay value due to clever mechanics and good expansions.The good news is that it`s still Defense Grid - which means a quality game with good mechanics, and loads of different game types based on the campaign maps.The bad news is that they made some changes to the flow and the mechanics of the game. They removed or cut ""juggling enemies"" from the game  which is a massive mistake imho. It`s one of the core mechanics that made DG 1 stand out against other tower defense games. (I assume it will be reintroduced in some future DLC)They`ve made some changes to the towers as well. Most of the towers are pretty much identical to DF 1 when it comes to actual mechanics despite the new paint job. Command towers are gone though, but their functionailty is now tied into a new ""tower unit"" - the ""boost tower"" which gives increased heigth and various custombuild options, so you can have a gun tower with increased damage or anti stealth - that sort of thing. Missile towers can now target all units, so it`s no longer an exclusive anti aircraft tower. (I haven`t seen too many aircraft so far)There are also more commanders this time and each commander have different ""command powers"". This just means than in addition to the orbital laser (smart bomb) you get alternatives - like increased tower damage and that sort of thing. It`s a bit like the command powers from Advance Wars.I haven`t finished the game yet, and hopefully it`ll last me months and months like DG 1 did, but I`ve played enough to have an opinion on the game. To me it feels like a slightly more clunky game with slightly more sterile GFX and aliens. It feels like there`s a bigger emphasis on visual deception.  You spend a lot more time on figuring out what`s going on. What parts of the map are background and what parts are actually important. It`s not always clear what range your tower has or if it`s even on the right altitude. To me that`s the wrong sort of complexity. I prefer the visuals and the design to be clear, so you can concentrate on what`s important - placing the towers, juggling the aliens and so on.In the end it`s the difference between a perfect 10 (DG 1) and a score of somewhere around 8-9 which only prolonged play will reveal. I consider 5 to be average, so still a good game. "

												So we are back once again in a world of towers, aliens and cheesy one liners. Welcome to Defense Grid 2.So I've racked up 11 hours so far and thought I'd leave a reveiw.The first game clocked up so many of my hours on steam and xbox (yes I bought it twice) due to the addictive nature of trying to get all of those gold medals. DG2 carries on with this in that you have 20 main story missions and tonnes of challenges to conquer afterwards. The core concepts are still the same, so if you were a fan of the original then this is worthy of your cash. While the games share many similarities, it has a few differences like;*Several levels can be altered via your command tower so you can adapt to certain situations*End of level drops that can slighty change tower functions eg. slpash damage, target strongest enemy*Multiple AI characters which change the function of the orbital laser eg. extra resources, temporal blast*No flyers :(*Multiplayer and coopI found the campaign to be quite a bit easier than DG1, though a lot harder than Containment. I found that due to the lack of flying enemies you are able to concentrate more on the ground assault. Hopefully we may see a return with some DLC. The game itself feels good and the graphics are improved, and the dialog will often have you shaking your head yet you will still have a smile on your face. This is a worthy purchase for younger members as the concept is easy to pick up, and also for the completionist who must have EVERY GOLD ON THE HARDEST DIFFICULTY EVER! You will also receive DG Architect where you can create your own levels for the Steam Workshop, however this is'nt as simple as you would find on the likes of Cubemen 2. There are already a dozen maps on there now and some look really impressive, so hopefully we will see a lot more on there soon.Overall a very good game and well worth the dosh.8.7/10Now if you will excuse me there is a Super Grinder that requires my attention.

So far it looks very nice, it has a nice variety of enemies with their own special abilities, and its not too difficult unless you want it to be.You basically use resources to build towers that each have a certain range and are good at taking out certain enemies and ok at damaging the rest. For example the gun turrents are ok in general while the flame thrower turrets are good with groups of enemies and they also keep on burning for a bit after they run by. So far I havent really encountered any problems either.10/10			"

While I ultimately disliked the first DG because of the ridiculously stupid difficulty scaling, the innovations that I've seen so far in DG2 seem solid. I'll review this once they finish the game, but for now, tentatively recommended.Just don't preorder it and wait instead for the first sale, unless you have too much money.			"

												Being a Beta Tester i've found very little amount of bugs in this, although i've only played the game for a hour and it is very entertaining, it is a classic tower defence and has a unique pattern to it. In my opionion i definately recommend this game.			"

												If you enjoy tower defense games, DG1 was my favorite.  You can tell this is an early/beta release and there is still a lot to be completed/improved, but after playing this early build of DG2, they appear to be on the right track of improving on everything that made DG1 great.			"

												The definitive tower defense game. I adore Defense Grid, have spent dozens of happy hours finessning my technique. Please, Hidden Path, an official expansion pack. And make it hard. And more of the loopy plot. But if you cannot wait, Commander, there are more levels in the store at 99c each. Ignore the bit of the store where you are just voting on levels to include, as that will only frustrate you. Just go to the store.Or, with the blessing of the game makers at http://www.DG2FreeMaps.com.  "

												I am a sucker for this game, simple and fun. It also happens to be one of the most visually pleasing ones. I don't think much of the story though, it is kind of 'meh'. But you are not playing these kind of games for a story anyway (I hope :) ) you play it as a nice distraction, and somewhat challenging puzzles. Although for me personally, this game isn't really hard. It is a nice thing to play when I got nothing to do, and want a bit of fun. And for this, the game certainly delivers. On the negative side though, I find the UI at places, quite 'busy'. And even confusing at places. Looks more like a section of a magazine, than a useful UI really. And the campaign, seems to be mixed up with disconnected levels? I can't really tell, and that isn't really good. A campaign should have a clear progession. But that is not to say I think the levels themselves are bad.. they are not. I am saying the UI layout is messed up.Update: Well.. finally I finished this game. While I still recommend it, what I previously said is still true. UI is very messy and illogical. The story is really quite 'meh'. But the game is fun, albeit some levels are really too easy. The balance of progression is not stable, and you'll find some incredibly easy levels, where the game actually should be more difficult to play. I think the first version of this game actually handled this better.			"

												If you like the first game, you should stop reading this and just buy it. Come on, be a big kid.Defense Grid 1 has got to be one of my favorite games of all time. I had it for Xbox 360, and on one of the challenge levels I accidentally tied for top score on the entire leaderboard during a warm-up. Instantly this game became something special to me, and when I found out about the sequel, I jumped for joy motionlessly in my chair. I did what any regular person does at this point, and completely forgot about it. Built myself a desktop recently, and got back into PC gaming (don't know why the ♥♥♥♥ I didn't do this sooner). I found this game and became overjoyed, and went to go buy a Steam card (N1gg@s get shifty when you use your card), got back home, got stoned, and fell asleep. Out of some miracle, it was on sale the next day, and very quickly it got me to space on homework and now I have to rush last second constantly, but it's so worth it.Gameplay doesn't seem much different than the first, but there are some welcome additions! I wouldn't have wanted it any other way honestly. There's plenty of challenges for each level, and the menu is clearly set up to show all your medals on each of the difficulties you've completed. Boost towers are just plain unfair if used right, and the missile towers are much better than before. Me boostaCONS - I wish there was more selection on maps to change paths of enemies, I felt like they were all pre-determined and felt limited. That could also be my problem not seeing them, but I felt it deserved mention. Also, game can be too addicting, so don't play if you have homework or other♥♥♥♥♥♥to do.			"

												The game is pretty great. Challenging but not frustrating. Good sense of accomplishment when you win. I'm not sure that it's better than the original though. It has a few more bells and whistles but it's not entirely clear how they're supposed to improve the game. Other than the slightly improved camera I could do without most of the upgrades. That's just my personal opinion, maybe you'll love the new tweaks. I could wish that they hadn't made the temporal towers so much weaker than in the original but whatever. This game is still a must buy if you love tower defense games and enjoyed the original.			"

The fact of the matter is that they had an impossible task; to take everything that people loved about the first game and some how make it better and new.  It has a few new aspects to it that are interesting, however it will never be the classic that came before. Die hard fans with sky high expectations are always going to be disapointed, and that includes me too.It is definately worth buying though, and I would recomend it to anyone who played and enjoyed DG1.

												This is only my second TD game after Space Run and even though I loved SR, I did not have high expectations for Defense Grid 2. Boy was I wrong.Defense Grid 2 has everything needed to keep you involved and entertained:+ A lot of weapon types+ Level variety+ Nice graphics+ Good voice actingThese things combined guarantee great replay value and hours of fine entertainment. And even after you get through the main campaign, you're not done; you can check out the many player-designed custom levels (sold in-game at $0.99 each) or — if up to the task — you can start designing your own custom levels with the game editor, and even sell them yourself.I grabbed Defense Grid 2 during a Steam mid-week sale at an awesomly steep 75% discount but after playing it for a short while, I honestly think it deserves its list price.Are yuo a fan of tower defense games? If yes, by all means buy D♥♥♥♥nd you will not regret it even at full price.If you aren't familiar with this game genre, grab this game when you see it on sale and check it out for yourself. Chances are, this lovable indie game will keep you entertained for many hours.Enjoy!			"

												This is an even better version of the defense grid game, and at the sale price its a steal. A lot of fun new mechanics involved and the AI banter makes it not so boring. The only major downside for me a CTD bug. The game every now and then is convinced that my computer cant run DX10 and exits to desktop losing all level save data. If i exit the level on my own i can start where I left off, but every time it crashes this way it does not save a checkpoint no matter how far I made it. The game itself is fun but this bug is rather annoying.			"

												Ahhh, Defense Grid is back, and it's just as wonderful as before. Great voice acting, good story (a little more interesting this time around), and solid gameplay. Some levels are set, while others (moreso in the later ones) require pathing, but there are multiple ways to acheive victory. The towers are a little more balanced now - they all have their strengths and building a single tower type is not a good strategy. Inferno is the only tower that seems underpowered, but it's really cheap. You are able to exploit the pathing on some levels to make the mobs go back and forth under your guns, which isn't that fun (but not required, so don't play that way!)If you liked the first one, definately get the sequel. If you haven't played the first one, buy both! 8 hours to complete the story mode on Normal (gold on all levels). There is TONNES of content (mission modes, endless, coop, multiplayer) that I haven't even explored.			"

												So, I'm in the middle of the campaign, and I'm sharing my first impressions:1. The towers and their possible boosts are working together well and allow for a multitude of strategies.2. Map layouts are really cool.3. So far, the story which is being narrated by the voiceactors is somewhat convoluted; fortunately, you can ignore it without consequences.4. Controls are great, game is immensely fun.5. The possibility to select a difficulty level, from Easy to Elite, is great - you can find your own level and stick to it, or change it between missions.So far: Recommended!			"

												You sit down to play at 6 PM, you don't stop playing until 4 AM. Defense Grid 2 hits the nail on the mark as a sequel to the great and highly addictive Defense Grid: The Awakening. The game plays 90% the same as its predecessor with upgraded graphics and a new tower item system, command shuttle, and boost towers to vary the gameplay and create new strategies. The campaign is engaging for a story being only told through dialogue of the familiar Fletcher and brings back many of characters we met in the Containment DLC.My only complaint would be that they kept the game so familiar, it would have been nice to see some new towers, maybe an ultimate tower, something that took up more than one space on the board. For $25 this game is highly reccomended, the multiple game modes. addition of multiplayer, and mod support will provide hundreds of hours replayability in a game that sets the standard and defines a genre.

The preliminary inspection of DG2 seems to really show more of the same - which can only be a good thing. A few additional features - though in the demo I missed a few of the touches of character that turned DG1 from a great game into one that was unmissable. Perhaps I'll find this in the full title - regardless, more of the same outstanding blend of balance and strategy can only be a good thing.			"

												Very enjoyable sequel to Defense Grid (DG).  Improvements over the original edition were the incorporation of aspects of the “Command Tower” into the Boost tower.  The Boost tower does add a bit more of nuance then the original edition.  Initial maze creation is less costly with the Boost towers, and careful placement of the Boost tower is still essential in winning the game.   If you’ve played the extended versions of the original DG, you’ll find that you will quickly be able to excel at this version.  While the Orbital Laser was the only choice of off-world help in the original edition, DG2 does a very good job in expanding the options to allow tower boosts, resource (money) boost, and more.  Some levels are well suited to these new options, where the Orbital Laser would have been over-kill or less challenging if used.Well worth the money, and even better if reduced via a Steam sale price :) "

												If you like Tower Defense, this is a great game.BUT:The game is short! After 10 hours, you are through the campaign.... and I did not find anything else. The workshop does not allow you to download any maps. They have a store, where you can buy additional maps ( $2 for a single map????). In fact - does steam allow publishers to have their own stores to sell DLC?Finally, there should be an editor somewhere, but I cannot find it (I assume that it is not included in the mac version). The graphics are really great, but they require significant system ressources, at least in the mac version. If you have lots of towers and lots of aliens on the map, the frame rate goes down to about 1 fps. My computer (late 2013 iMac) is not a true gamer pc, but definitely not low end.Finally, the software quality is awful. The program starts with a (completely superfluous) launcher that crashes at least on every second start attempt. I fixed it by altering the launcher itself, so it starts the game immediately. Nevertheless, if I pay money for a game, I assume that it works without having to click through a mess of ads that actually do not work.In total, although I enjoyed this game, I do not recommend it.

More stuff and things (tower types, superweapons). Yes, it's both good and bad.2. The towers don't feel like they do any damage anymore. It's meant so that you have to upgrade via various methods, but really it's just frustrating as hell if you liked the first one. I understand it's a different game, but quite frankly I don't want to play a DG where a lone gun tower struggles to kill a lone swarmer. It all feels underpowered and cheap. Every tower feels like a downgrade compared to the first.3. They took the character interaction from the first one and multiplied it by 100. Sure, it's endearing at first. But they other AI are all CONSTANTLY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ OR INSANE AND THEY TALK FOR GOD DAMNED EVER. No matter how much you liked him talking about raspberries in the first, you will be tired of these morons bantering.4. The maps feel smaller, like they're meant for less towers. There is far less of the open maps where you get to build a path. Instead they try to make to navigate the multiple tiers of configurable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you didn't ask for.5. It isn't DG1. All I wanted was more DG1.6. The price is absurd. It's managable if you get it on sale but don't spend more than $5 or you'll be annoyed later.Bottom line, there is something about DG1 that this is missing. Some simple spark, some novelty, something... is lost in a wash of pointless enhancements to a game that was already great.			"

												A very fun game, but very easy once you've figured out the general strategy. The replay value is pretty low; I have the exact same build order for a lot of the different game modes as I do for the story mode. Only the earlier maps are still particularly difficult because you don't have access to the more powerful towers. That said, I've gotten a lot of good time out of this game. I am still excited to try the multiplayer modes. That might provide the variety this game needs to shine, and in that case, it would have been better off focusing on multiplayer in the beginning. I'll still definitely play DG3 if they ever make one.			"

The campaign is also suprisingly fun with campy chatter and a solid variety of environments to solve and perfect. I won't go into too much detail because you will know if you like this or not.

												It's hard for me to reccomend this game, get it on sale. If I could only choose ""No Opinion"". If you have DG1 this game can be a nice addition to your library. It's fun, playable, has some nice new features and the graphics detail is nice. New AI's have been introduced that have unique Orbital attack modes from the original laser bombardment to power core teleportation and more. Towers can also now gain enhancements in addition to normal upgrades, which is very welcome. Enhancements vary per tower and include piercing shields, slowing the target(s) and chemical ordnance to name a few. There are new enemies but no more flying enemies. The Missile tower now targets ground units and is very effective. But...The game campaign seems short, only 21 missions. Of course with several difficulties, the game-play can be much longer. As of June 2015, the game suffers from several serious bugs. Even the bug reporting application crashes unless the player manually creates a ""Logs"" folder inside the main game folder. The most serious bug involves the use of the Backspace key, which is designed to restore previous auto-save points. Without this function, it is like playing the game in Ironman mode.			"

												I absolutely loved the original DG and spent waaaa-aaaay too much time playing it as I'm a tower defense junkie.  I held off on purchasing this one for quite a while and honestly didn't expect DG2 to be anything more than just a rehash of DG1.  I caught a deal on this title and I do have to say that I like some of the options that they added to this one from the last.  The ability to add abilities to your towers and pick what abilities your Commander has going into each mission is a nice tweak to an awesome title.  These things, along with some improved graphics, added just enough for me to make this game well worth the price I paid for it.  Nice game especially if you get it at the right price.			"

												Defence Grid 2 builds upon the surprise hit of the original with a miriad of new and welcome features. The original revived the Tower Defence genre and also allowed it to take the leap from free flash game over to a full retail release. That was not unwarrented, it oozed charm in it's voice acting and visual simplicity. Thankfully the voice acting is back and indeed expanded with a cast including that Bioware favourite Jennifer Hale and Firefly alum Alan Tudyk, both of which are exactly as excellent as you would expect!In the natural expansion that comes with being a sequel there appears to have been a good deal of confusion. Menus are mindbogglingly unintuitive to cycle though, it brings back awful memory of the dashboard that shipped with the Xbox 360 on launch (trust me, it doesn't hold up). There's plenty of game modes that seem well designed and add lots of life to the intrepid builder, but they are quite hard to track in the interface. I think my biggest complaint is that somehow it has done the impossible and has had a visual downgrade between itterations. After a few rounds you get used to the clunkier visuals and settle into the varied and polished gameplay. There's some great length to the campain, expanded by the dozens of variations and challenges per mission, it really does give you some wondeful value if you want to even complete 1/5 of the modes available.In summary, while on the surface making something as simple as tower defence work on a larger scale may seem easy, DG2 finds a few of the faults that have defeated some of it's competition but it still exhudes the charm and polished gameplay that made DG1 such a runaway hit. If you want more Defence Grid, here it is!			"

												Defense Grid 2Pros:  Defense Grid 2.  More awesome tower defense goodness.Cons:  Wish I'd know about the Level Editor / Steam Workshop BS before purchasing.  You have to pay $2 per map through the DG2 shop - maps created by your fellow gamers.  Sure, the maps are listed on the workshop but you cannot download them.  You are expected to rate them based on screenshots and high ratings will get the maps into the DG2 store...Seems a bit ridiculous.Do NOT purchase at the full price if you are doing so based on the Level Editor / Steam Workshop.Edit:I have to say, since discovering the Steam Workshop BS, my enthusiasm for the game has declined to the point of simply not existing.  As I sit here now, thinking about playing some Defense Grid, I feel the first calling to me, not #2.  I haven't even beat all the maps and don't feel inclined to do so.Its not horrible or even bad...Just not great.7/10			"

I bought pre-order DG2 with free DG1 based on the great experience from DG1, but after playing DG2, I think DG1 is the one I bought.Gun towers are shaking when shooting. All towers seem to tremble when building and upgrading. Tower tracking speed is slow. Sound and graphics effects are upgraded, but don't feel good. A lot of things seem wierd.There are some highlights though, like the tower base and add-ons, but it doesn't attract me enough to go on the champion.

It is worth buying on special and is not good as the original.DF2 is a solid game, with a few extra gameplay elements over DF1, however Hidden Path Entertainment has created a game that is too long, with too many poorly distinguished options that overly complicates things under the time pressure of waves of enemy, and a storyline that leaves you as a bystander more than a key participant.It just doesn't play as well and can become tedious. There is replay value, but it is not appealing. Given a choice, play DF1 as it is perhaps the best tower defense game available. Another game, Defender Quest, is less polished but preferable to play than DF2.			"

												While it lacks the sense of urgency and standard of level design of the first iteration this is still worth a purchase (I got it in a midweek sale, worth keeping an eye open for reductions).Adding lots of new characters to the story didn't really do anything to add to the entertaining narrative of the first game, but all the same it was nice to hear the old AI again.

												Had a lot of fun here.  Interesting map designs, a reasonably engaging story (unexpected for a TD game), and satisfying gameplay.I did feel the balance of some of the towers made it too easy to spam, and I would have liked to see a few more complicated maps that allowed for more creativity in the pathing, as even on the hardest difficulty I only got stuck a few times.  But overall, I enjoyed my time with this one.  Worth picking up, even if you're not that into tower defence.			"

												I consider this game one of the few gems i have in my library. It's quite honestly a fairly well balanced game. Its far more balanced then the original game that was beatable by building only gun towers. This version has a lot more story dialog to listen to during the game, due to the increase in number of AI's you deal with. Bottom line is if you love tower defence games this is an amazing game to fill that itch.			"

												If you like the first game, you should stop reading this and just buy it. Come on, be a big kid.Defense Grid 1 has got to be one of my favorite games of all time. I had it for Xbox 360, and on one of the challenge levels I accidentally tied for top score on the entire leaderboard during a warm-up. Instantly this game became something special to me, and when I found out about the sequel, I jumped for joy motionlessly in my chair. I did what any regular person does at this point, and completely forgot about it. Built myself a desktop recently, and got back into PC gaming (don't know why the ♥♥♥♥ I didn't do this sooner). I found this game and became overjoyed, and went to go buy a Steam card (N1gg@s get shifty when you use your card), got back home, got stoned, and fell asleep. Out of some miracle, it was on sale the next day, and very quickly it got me to space on homework and now I have to rush last second constantly, but it's so worth it.Gameplay doesn't seem much different than the first, but there are some welcome additions! I wouldn't have wanted it any other way honestly. There's plenty of challenges for each level, and the menu is clearly set up to show all your medals on each of the difficulties you've completed. Boost towers are just plain unfair if used right, and the missile towers are much better than before. Me boostaCONS - I wish there was more selection on maps to change paths of enemies, I felt like they were all pre-determined and felt limited. That could also be my problem not seeing them, but I felt it deserved mention. Also, game can be too addicting, so don't play if you have homework or other♥♥♥♥♥♥to do.			"

												Good sequel to DG. More of the same, but with extra voice acting adding even more story style to this version. Only TD with a decent story imo, and although I found this one to be relatively predictable it was still good enough to hold attention with the jokes. The gameplay is much the same as the first, with the nice optional feature of backspacing to checkpoints to try different optimizations.Cons are probably that not much got added gameplay wise in terms of towers or mechanics, but in a TD there's limited options. There are definitely limited control options, in many ways this seems to be designed for use with a controller rather than mouse+keyboard, and particularly in the menus there's a fair lack of mouse control.Overall, a worthy successor and if you enjoy TD and DG1 (which I would recommend you play first tbh) this is worth a buy when on sale.

												I like this new version.  Big, big fan of the first DG, and now a fan of D♥♥♥♥s well.  It's not radically different from DG1, and thats a plus.   Yet there are significant improvements like the rotating perspective, new towers and attackers, more gameplay variations for each map, ammo variations, larger maps, etc...  All with nice, fluid gameplay and no lagging.  I am using a mediocre AMD APU grapic processor with only 512mb dedicated ram and I have it set to 'Very high' graphics..Intially I had noted that I didn't want all the A.I. chatter, but I have since found that I could turn them off, turn down the frequency or just lower the A.I. volume in the settings.  Nice.  People at HP were thinking proactively.This promises to be a well spent 25 bucks.  If you liked DG1 or TD games in general, buy it.  For those not already familiar with DG, think of traditional Tower Defense games in general, but with everything bumped up several generations using a gaming engine (Gamebryo) used by some of the larger and more expensive game titles found on Steam.As time goes by, I am enjoying this more and more.  Becoming a DG addict all over again.			"

												I am a Defense Grid fan and just can't wait for new stuff. I bought Defense Grid 2 a few days ago and I am a bit disappointed by this sequel. Indeed where first Defense Grid The Awakening seems polished about graphics and gameplay Defense Grid 2 seems to be a beta version which keep to be improved. First of all game is lagging on my core i5 laptop even in low settings, towers movements are too fast and jerky, aliens are too fast and unreadable, health bars cannot been hidden (?), Inferno and Meteore towers are very shy, Laser tower is ugly, moreover there are too much blah-blah-blah ! I cannot stand all these useless speeches ! Level introduction are too long, who cares about ? We wants action and now ! But game is colorfull and overall packaging is pretty good. In conclusion this sequel is not essential but deserve a try. I hope that Valve Team will read and care about gamers comments and improve Defense Grid 2 as it seems launched too early and need polishing.			"

												For me DG 1 was pretty much perfection. The GFX was clear and minimalistic. The aliens and towers very distinctive. It was a game with enourmes replay value due to clever mechanics and good expansions.The good news is that it`s still Defense Grid - which means a quality game with good mechanics, and loads of different game types based on the campaign maps.The bad news is that they made some changes to the flow and the mechanics of the game. They removed or cut ""juggling enemies"" from the game  which is a massive mistake imho. It`s one of the core mechanics that made DG 1 stand out against other tower defense games. (I assume it will be reintroduced in some future DLC)They`ve made some changes to the towers as well. Most of the towers are pretty much identical to DF 1 when it comes to actual mechanics despite the new paint job. Command towers are gone though, but their functionailty is now tied into a new ""tower unit"" - the ""boost tower"" which gives increased heigth and various custombuild options, so you can have a gun tower with increased damage or anti stealth - that sort of thing. Missile towers can now target all units, so it`s no longer an exclusive anti aircraft tower. (I haven`t seen too many aircraft so far)There are also more commanders this time and each commander have different ""command powers"". This just means than in addition to the orbital laser (smart bomb) you get alternatives - like increased tower damage and that sort of thing. It`s a bit like the command powers from Advance Wars.I haven`t finished the game yet, and hopefully it`ll last me months and months like DG 1 did, but I`ve played enough to have an opinion on the game. To me it feels like a slightly more clunky game with slightly more sterile GFX and aliens. It feels like there`s a bigger emphasis on visual deception.  You spend a lot more time on figuring out what`s going on. What parts of the map are background and what parts are actually important. It`s not always clear what range your tower has or if it`s even on the right altitude. To me that`s the wrong sort of complexity. I prefer the visuals and the design to be clear, so you can concentrate on what`s important - placing the towers, juggling the aliens and so on.In the end it`s the difference between a perfect 10 (DG 1) and a score of somewhere around 8-9 which only prolonged play will reveal. I consider 5 to be average, so still a good game. "

												8/10 Tower Defense GameCons: Primarily a console game - hurts the PC version with clunky interface. No Survival Mode. Plusses:All the other tower defense options in existence. Great Tower & Boost selections. Impressive maps. Excellent flexibility with difficulty settings. Great on console or in Big picture mode with a controller.			"

												You sit down to play at 6 PM, you don't stop playing until 4 AM. Defense Grid 2 hits the nail on the mark as a sequel to the great and highly addictive Defense Grid: The Awakening. The game plays 90% the same as its predecessor with upgraded graphics and a new tower item system, command shuttle, and boost towers to vary the gameplay and create new strategies. The campaign is engaging for a story being only told through dialogue of the familiar Fletcher and brings back many of characters we met in the Containment DLC.My only complaint would be that they kept the game so familiar, it would have been nice to see some new towers, maybe an ultimate tower, something that took up more than one space on the board. For $25 this game is highly reccomended, the multiple game modes. addition of multiplayer, and mod support will provide hundreds of hours replayability in a game that sets the standard and defines a genre.

												As an avid fan of the Tower Defense genre, I loved the first DG harder than any previous title in the genre. I sucked the marrow out of it and enjoyed every minute. The preliminary inspection of DG2 seems to really show more of the same - which can only be a good thing. A few additional features - though in the demo I missed a few of the touches of character that turned DG1 from a great game into one that was unmissable. Perhaps I'll find this in the full title - regardless, more of the same outstanding blend of balance and strategy can only be a good thing.			"

												Very enjoyable sequel to Defense Grid (DG).  Improvements over the original edition were the incorporation of aspects of the “Command Tower” into the Boost tower.  The Boost tower does add a bit more of nuance then the original edition.  Initial maze creation is less costly with the Boost towers, and careful placement of the Boost tower is still essential in winning the game.   If you’ve played the extended versions of the original DG, you’ll find that you will quickly be able to excel at this version.  While the Orbital Laser was the only choice of off-world help in the original edition, DG2 does a very good job in expanding the options to allow tower boosts, resource (money) boost, and more.  Some levels are well suited to these new options, where the Orbital Laser would have been over-kill or less challenging if used.Well worth the money, and even better if reduced via a Steam sale price :) "

												Expanding on the game mechanics of the excellent Defense Grid, DG2 introduces boost towers which can function as inert blocks to channel the enemies, or enable upgrades to towers built on top. There are also multiple space weapons now. In play, you are awarded enhancements to the basic tower ammunition, which show up at the end of a round, and which you can use from then on. There's also the command shuttle, which lets you see heat maps of where your fire is concentrated and gives you the ability to raise hidden terrain. One thing that has been removed is command towers, which I used to like in DG1.I have no problem recommending DG2. It is one of my favourite games of all time. I hope there is DLC and even DG3 in the pipeline. I just wish there were currently more official maps.			"

												For those of you who have played this game, this game will look very familiar, which is good! The basic concept is the same; there is a path that you place towers along in order to shoot down the aliens that walk along it to steal your cores. This raises several questions. Why is that an alien alliance comprised of several different races are so technilogically advanced they managed to push humanity to the brink of extinction, and yet are so stupid they walk in a path with no attempt to change things up and even though hundreds of their kind were killed before them, none of them bother to bring a weapon to shoot down a tower. After playing this game for a few hours I grow concerned for these poor aliens. Maybe it is I who is pushing them to the brink of extinction...Anyway, this game is much like the original, but with enough new content to make the game interesting. Each tower has a special affect you can add on before the mission, and I believe you can choose from multiple for each one. You have to unlock them, so to start with you won't have any. For example, the basic gun tower can have the priority target mod added to it, which will make it shoot at the strongest enemy in range rather than its seemingly random choices. These little mods can affect the game a bit, and It's a fun bit of customization. In addition to that you can choose a leader's ability, such as an orbital laser that'll kill about anything in range or an extra resource drop. Each ability takes 5 minutes to cool down. It's no game changer, but it's a little thing that can help if you remember to use it.I only have two complaints. For one, there is no endless wave match available as far as I can tell, which seems like it could be easily accomplished and would be a lot of fun to play. After someone becomes good enough the grinder waves get boring and you just want to see how far you can make it. Also, if you put the game into fast forward mode after a few seconds the towers will start spinning around and stop shooting at enemies, so only use fast forward when no enemies are in range. It sucks, and I hope the developers fix the problem.Overall, the game is enjoyable, and for its price a great buy. There's even multiplayer now, which I've yet to try.			"

												I consider this game one of the few gems i have in my library. It's quite honestly a fairly well balanced game. Its far more balanced then the original game that was beatable by building only gun towers. This version has a lot more story dialog to listen to during the game, due to the increase in number of AI's you deal with. Bottom line is if you love tower defence games this is an amazing game to fill that itch.			"

												Had a lot of fun here.  Interesting map designs, a reasonably engaging story (unexpected for a TD game), and satisfying gameplay.I did feel the balance of some of the towers made it too easy to spam, and I would have liked to see a few more complicated maps that allowed for more creativity in the pathing, as even on the hardest difficulty I only got stuck a few times.  But overall, I enjoyed my time with this one.  Worth picking up, even if you're not that into tower defence.			"

												Brilliant, beautiful game.In many ways even better than Defense Grid 1 (which is really, really saying something).They actually found great ways to expand upon the formula with 1- more intuitive tower types, such as ""boost"" towers that do the functions the old ""Command Towers"" did- but also allow OTHER towers to sit on top of them, for a better vantage point 2- more challenging enemies, including EMP aliens that temporarily shut down towers nearby when they are killed, and ones that 'drop' shields for other aliens to pick up3- Some customization of the towers and superweapons that remains nicely balanced.4- Dynamic level design that you can change in some ways (for example, adding a whole new section of level if you need more space to separate the aliens from the cores).A tiny bit short is my only complaint- but even THEN it's worth every cent!Buy it.

The graphics, voice acting, game elements were just right. Defense Grid 2 tried to fix something that wasn't broke. They say a camel is ""a horse designed by comittee"" and thats how this game feels. The sum isn't greater than the parts like first DG game. The acting is over the top. Game elements have been dummed down and made less interesting. The GUI is overcooked, The towers are more clunky and the resource management skill isn't there. I put 500 hrs into early DG. I never would have done that with this game. For the cost its still worth a buy and fun to play. I think the devs deserve another shot to bounce back			"

												Defense Grid 2 is like the average season after you win the Super Bowl. The prior Defense Grid was special and I played for hours. The graphics, voice acting, game elements were just right. Defense Grid 2 tried to fix something that wasn't broke. They say a camel is ""a horse designed by comittee"" and thats how this game feels. The sum isn't greater than the parts like first DG game. The acting is over the top. Game elements have been dummed down and made less interesting. The GUI is overcooked, The towers are more clunky and the resource management skill isn't there. I put 500 hrs into early DG. I never would have done that with this game. For the cost its still worth a buy and fun to play. I think the devs deserve another shot to bounce back			"

												Feels like a cash grap, riding on the tails of the original. I get wanting to make money, but score bonus upgrade? basically mandatory boost towers? Look at the original game play, and do that. This is far more clunky, I felt like I wasted my time playing the first hour. In that amount of time, the sotry failed to make any sense 3 times as well. Thanks for ruining all of the potential of the first. I really hope they remake this in the spirit fo the original, I'm suprised that they don't have some play to win cash/crap store at this point. -10/10 will tell everyone not to waste thier time even looking up this game, let alone playing it.

												Expanding on the game mechanics of the excellent Defense Grid, DG2 introduces boost towers which can function as inert blocks to channel the enemies, or enable upgrades to towers built on top. There are also multiple space weapons now. In play, you are awarded enhancements to the basic tower ammunition, which show up at the end of a round, and which you can use from then on. There's also the command shuttle, which lets you see heat maps of where your fire is concentrated and gives you the ability to raise hidden terrain. One thing that has been removed is command towers, which I used to like in DG1.I have no problem recommending DG2. It is one of my favourite games of all time. I hope there is DLC and even DG3 in the pipeline. I just wish there were currently more official maps.			"

												Brilliant, beautiful game.In many ways even better than Defense Grid 1 (which is really, really saying something).They actually found great ways to expand upon the formula with 1- more intuitive tower types, such as ""boost"" towers that do the functions the old ""Command Towers"" did- but also allow OTHER towers to sit on top of them, for a better vantage point 2- more challenging enemies, including EMP aliens that temporarily shut down towers nearby when they are killed, and ones that 'drop' shields for other aliens to pick up3- Some customization of the towers and superweapons that remains nicely balanced.4- Dynamic level design that you can change in some ways (for example, adding a whole new section of level if you need more space to separate the aliens from the cores).A tiny bit short is my only complaint- but even THEN it's worth every cent!Buy it. NOW.			"

Defense Grid 2 is very similar to the first one in the series, but that doesn't matter much to me, since I liked the first one as well.The sad part of Defense Grid 2 is that it supports multiplayer, but there is never anyone to play with, so I've never been able to try the multiplayer mode.It's an onverall good game!

												This is a great follow up to Defense Grid: The Awakening - a slight adjustment to towers (for the better), different commnders with unique abilities, more options for fortifiying and strategising in each round and what I consider to be a much more interesting and developed story. I enjoyed DG:TA but if I recommend this one out of the two, I reckon you'll get a lot more out of it. There is multiplayer, too, if you're into that and there's a lot of content to work your way thriugh and a horde of achievements (if that's also your thing). All-round great game! *****			"

The only major downside for me a CTD bug. The game every now and then is convinced that my computer cant run DX10 and exits to desktop losing all level save data. If i exit the level on my own i can start where I left off, but every time it crashes this way it does not save a checkpoint no matter how far I made it.

The other 10 attempts resulted in 'Network problem, disconnected' within the first 5 minutes of the game.During this whole ordeal we were talking on skype and there was no call quality problem or anything else to indicate there was any sort of real connection problem.

												As the name may imply, this is purely a tower defense game.  You build towers to stop things reaching the end of a maze.This game is... alright.  Thats the most I can say.  The gameplay is average.  The difficulty is average.  The production value is exceptional.  As a fan of the genre, this was a fun, if not unimpressive game.  The most impressive aspect is the overall astetic work aside from the gameplay; however, that is worth jack all.  It has a story but who cares? It isn't engaging.  The graphics are shiny but eh.  Despite what may seem like a lack luster review, I honestly can't bring myself to vote against this game.  It is standard fare, but it is unoffensive standard fare.  This is a game that you don't really get board with but you aren't exactly excited to boot it up either.What does that mean?  If you like tower defense games and you really need one to play, absolutely go for it.  If you are new to your genre?  There are better.  If you dislike the genre, this certainly isn't a game to change your mind.It's a tepid reccomendation.			"

												tl;dr - Yes, the campaign is easy (beat it in 12hrs). But it's more to get you ready for the gold level and harder challenges. Some people seem to just beat the game and then skip the challenge modes.. that's actually where the real fun is at. Co-op works fine. No you don't 'need' to make an account.I've done a full play-through of the basic campaign and some other modes slightly. This may be the 2nd best TD game I've tried, if you include the story and the other modes. Obviously Defense Grid 1 is far, far better and more challenging. If you catch this on sale, go for it, but not just for the campaign.. get it for all the game modes and challenges.. and that's what many dislikes here are forgetting..And no.. you don't need to create an account. The account screen pops up, click skip, and play on. Personally I enjoyed this game.Pro's - -Solid Graphics and particle effects, if your system can handle it. -Fun little story.-Multiple game modes (yes I play Co-op with my wife and it's fine). -The campaign is more like campaigns in classic games.. it's a training ground, thus all the other modes are a huge plus.Cons - -Lack of any real DLC campaigns (compared to DG1).-The functionality of boost towers and map designs make the campaign just too easy if that's all you play it for. -If your system can't handle everything, you may have to turn down the settings (it's still fine, it's just not optimized the best).-The story didn't really make sense until the last two maps.

												Best Tower Defense Game I've ever played, and easily the game I've played the most in the last three years.  It is so good that I'm playing through the campaign again for a second time instead of playing all the new games I've purchased.  Challenging, beautiful, and some of the best voice acting you'll ever hear in a game.  I'm here trying to find user-created boards, and like others, I'm finding they are not allowed -- but this is not enough to drop the overall score by a half-star.  Can't wait for DG3!			"

												This is a good Tower Defense game and I think the first one is still one of the best of them.  This version is good with lots of options and custimizations but for some reason I feel it's lacking something that the first one had.   I still think this  version is good and worth playing (especially for $15) but if you have not tried any of them yet I recomend the first one first (bedised it helps with this ones story).   "

												There are already plenty of brilliant reviews for this game. I just want to add a very simple ""thumbs up"" and recommendation here as well. One of the most entertaining games in the genre (tower defense). Exceptional attention to detail! Plenty of weapons, thanks to many tower upgrades and mods, and a variety of special weapons. Well-written and humorous campaign and dialogue. Fantastic mechanics and controls, and great controller support. Graphics and design are fine, but could use improvement (perhaps engine limitations). DG2 may just beat the original! My rating for DEFENSE GRID 2: 8 out of 10.			"

												For me this was just as much fun to play as the first one.  The variety of tower options and multiplayer modes were nice additions.			"

												My favorite tower defense game!  All the extra challenge modes give tons of play variation even after you have beat the main campaign.			"

												I didn't realize that I enjoyed games of the tower defense genre until I tried Defense Grid 2.  I've tried other similar games since buying this one but I think I still enjoy this one the most because it also includes a pretty detailed story.  I went and found Defence Grid (1) as well and it was also quite enjoyable.			"

												I've put 12 hours into Defense Grid: The Awakening and bought a bunch of DLC and then downloaded the DG2 demo and then bought Defense Grid 2. Both games are a blast to play over and over. I also like that both have free demos you can play before buying. Demos used to be common but not as much lately. These are both outstanding games and well worth the asking price. Ignore the bad reviews. As Taylor Swift says, ""Haters gonna hate!""			"
