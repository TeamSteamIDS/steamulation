												I bought this game for my father since he used to play back in the days.He worked as a baker before he got unimployed. All he did was play Knights and Merchants.Now he is unimployed and whenever I see him, he is still playing this...I've tried making him play many other games, yet he always comes back to this... On the same day.It has been many months since then, and he still plays it.Nothing but Knights and Merchants.He doesn't seem to know how to save a game. He always restarts and enjoys it alot.I told him to play this on offline mode though, otherwise I can't play my games on steam.However, it is not exaggerated if I say he played atleast 1000 hours. If not more.My father is 55. Only plays Knights and Merchants.			"

												Things that caused that I liked this game:- Real presentation of the manufacturing and transporting process of goods (farm need land of soil -> soil is watered and seeded -> crops grow -> crops  are cut and then transported to the mill -> mill makes flour which is transported to the bakery -> bakery makes bread)- Great building process . Every stone and plank added to any building is carefully built piece by piece, and best part is you can SEE that happens. Buildings DO NOT just pop up from the ground, but they are built categorically.Even today, there is no game in the world that presents that kind of reality in building and micromanagement of goods.

												Knights and Merchants! So many childhood memories I have of this game. I remember playing this years ago and sucking horrible at it because I was too young to be any good in strategy games but now im older and somewhat better at strategy games, spent over a 100 hours in this game because its so addicting and time consuming :)Upon purchasing and playing this game, the game kept crashing and crashing for me when using windows 7. Luckily fans made a HD remake mod for this game and I can play at without any problems, even though the remake version isnt 100% complete yet and it need some tweaking here and there. But thanks to that mod I had so much fun playing this game and the new custom maps that came with it.I defenitely recommend this to play if you like strategy games and have ALOT of time at your hands :)			"

												A truly amazing game. It is one of those games that will hold your attention for years to come. I remember walking into a very old Poundland type of shop when I was younger. Literally a year or so after it was released in the early 2000's and we found this game just in a discount shelf, so it was bought for our almighty Windows 95/98 machine. It was one of the best games I had ever played, of course, I was very young, 6/7 years old, and not very good at it, but it was epic and always will be.Betrayed by one of your own, you must set out to defeat the enemies of your land with those loyal. Building villages to towns and cities, to defeat your enemies. This is no easy game. It requires time, patience, knowledge and a did I mention time?Strategy is extremely important. You cannot mass produce the same troops, not unless you want rekt by some archers and some militia. Speaking of armies, it is important that you keep a steady flow of resources, as your serfs are the most important people you can create. They take raw resources to buildings so that food and weapons can be created, to then be transferred to your castle or storehouse. Every character you can create serves importance, resources are limited and sometimes time is as well, as the enemy A.I. will attack and will be ruthless towards you, the further into the game you get.I must mention KaMRemake.com here, not because I've been asked to, but because of the work they have put into the Remake. coded from scratch, as the original code was never released, Krom and Lewin have recreated this masterpiece, fixed bugs, allowed speed up buttons, pause buttons and some new maps and a totally new and improved multi-player! With the Remake you also get 3 new campaigns created by players, for players, that are very challenging and not for the feint hearted. Download the Remake, you will not be disappointed! If you are into strategic fighting and building games, you NEED to get this now! It's late, I'll probably add to this review soon, but for now, peace!			"

												It's going to be difficult to explain why I've played this game for a while. I started it up the first time completely confused as heck wondering why no one was listening to my commands and quickly stopped. Decided to give it another shot and am quite happy I did... as I ended up playing for four hours straight. The AI is interesting to note on this one. Rather than telling peasants (or serfs as their called) or builders (laborers) to do exactly what to do - you are a planner and the serfs and laborers do your bidding automatically. Yes, that means that serfs and what not micro manage themselves. It can be a bit of an issue as I've noticed building 3 or more buildings sometimes can halt production, none the less though once this is addressed there shouldn't be issues. Roads need to be built to interconnect the city as well as allow serfs to travel to the job site to drop off materials for the building to be built. Laborers and serfs work closely together to accomplish the building - serfs mostly look after distribution of resources. There are A LOT - of different resources which get stored at a supply house. Bows, swords, shields, flour, corn are just the beginning of what is stored.There are different types of units military wise but the civilian crowd delivers stability to your village. Bakers can be trained, animal trainers, farmers, carpenters, wood cutters, miners etc... It can get quite crazy and overbearing at times early on in the campaign to see how much can be done with the diversity of the units. Battling is interesting and is as cool as an old style RTS can get. What is neat though which I wish other games would follow is when holding down the right mouse button, you can actually choose 360 degrees which way your troops should face. When you select a band of your troops, you are able to link up units with other units (conjoin groups) and are able to unite a bunch of units under one banner. Be it under one banner or not, you are able to rotate and position in HOW MANY lines the troops are allowed to be in. This really helps keeping a long line of infantry while keeping a band of arrows behind the infantry line.I got this game extremely cheap on sale and figured why not? Somehow for some reason, I like this game. Some of the in game perks as which way the soldier should face I found absolutely brilliant even though simple. I found myself mesmerized watching the AI serfs and laborers do my bidding and build. Is this game for everyone? Not really - you may get sucked into it like I did or you may think this is some stupid old game that should stay buried. I will recommend it as someone who is consistently looking for action in games, found myself happy with the eventual build of my village.RATING : 7.4/10 Gameplay B Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface C Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  B-ScreenShots : Soldiers need to be fed as you can see on the right (condition) while a button needs to exist to give peasants crap for standing around and pretending to not look busy "

												Back in 1998 I spent a lot of hours playing this marvelous game. The city-building part is fun and easy, but battles are even more fun and, despite game's simplistic looks, challenging (at least sometimes). It's hard to recommend this 15 years old game with something like ""Settlers 7"" released, but it still could deliver a lot of fun if you don't mind outdated graphics.			"

												Knights and Merchants, or KaM to those of us that have played the game on and off for decades, is a fantastic and fun game in which you build and fight in a variety of lands.  Each 'mission' has it's own goals, however they do tend to blend together and every new map seems to have the same goal.  Battle missions, where there is no building, are quick, and you will find yourself on the losing end if you're not paying attention.  First time players will see themselves restarting a battle mission a time or two.KaM is an old game indeed, and this release on Steam finds you with the original, ""The Shattered Kingdom"" and the next release ""The Pesants Rebellion"" (both known to the community as TSK and TPR respectively.  The Steam version also includes an ""HD Version"" which modifies the graphics a bit and the game speed.  It also opens up all buildings starting at mision 1 which is not what the orginal game does.If you are into strategy build sims then KaM is a game you will want on your list!That said, if you buy this game from Steam or from GOG, I would recommend you play TSK and TPR missions 1-3 only.  That will give you the fundamentals of the game and how it works.  You'll also see several issues with the game and you may encounter a bug or two.  Even with the bugs in the original game, it is worth playing, and worth your time.  Why only the first 3 missions you may ask.  Well, that's because as awesome as the game is, it gets better with the KaM Remake.Once you see the game in all its original glory, you simply MUST go get the KaM Remake from www.kamremake.com to enjoy the game with today's computer capabilities.The good folks over at KaM Remake have rebuild this awesome game from scratch and added some enhancements, such as better AI, a map editor and the ability for you not only to create your own maps, but make your own missions or even entire campaigns.  They have truly taken a great game, and made it better using all the original game pieces such as the units, environments, and animations, and recreated the game code to support today's computing power and screen sizes.  My personal favorite, is the ability to zoom in and out with the mouse wheel.While the KaM Remake has removed two building types for game balance, they added the Marketplace, which was part of the original game but never implemented.  The Marketplace adds a new factor to the game, allowing you to trade one type of resource for another.  This opens up a TON of options for map, mission, and campaign creators.Additionally, the KaM Remake is FREE.  Yep, you heard me, FREE.  However you must own KaM in order for the Remake to install and work.  Details can be found at www.kamremake.comBuy this game.  Get the remake.  You'll be glad you did.			"

												This game brings back such memories.. Ah..Anyway, nostalgia trip over, here's my views on this game.Pro's and benefits:This game has an indepth resource management system. Seriously, it's way better than anything to date. Your army can drain your economy rapidly depending on how big it is, so fielding smaller armies can be mutually better, if it may take longer to defeat your enemy.Strategy is actually required for this game. No really, it's not a case of throwing a large army of 50 spear holders against a small force of 10 swordsmen with some archers behind, because that'll just get you murdered and that's a whole bunch of gold and resources gone. It's better to have small squads of 6, 9 and 12 with occasional 16 squads appearing now and then.The nostalgic feel of this game is incredible! This game was made a good 10 years ago at the very least, maybe even earlier. Because it was made earlier and during the time that game developers actually had the balls to step outside the box and try something now, it created this game as well as many others.The Cons/painful stuff:Crash crash crash landings. This game SUCKS with the amount of crashes you can get. Seriously, there's an amazing amount of things you can do, and half of them will make you crash to desktop faster than the speed of light. (Note: this can be remedied via downloading the remake version on modDB. No free game for you though, you have to own the game to get access to the remake. Nice little touch of coding on the dev's part)Time. THIS TAKES FOREVER!!! No really, you can be there for a good few hours figuring out one single mission. It can get really frustrating and at times I need to quit and relax my mind before I blow a brain tumor.Final score:I give this game a 4/5.I'm giving it this score because considering everything that's great about this game, the crashes and amount of time it takes, as well as the sheer amount of difficulty some missions can have will result in rages and you not touching the game for a full week. However considering everything else about the game, it's really fun to play.Notice: With the remake edition, multiplayer is available as well as a few other options, not to mention the crashes are at a minimum and you can increase time to X10 so waiting on your♥♥♥♥♥no longer becomes such a dull practice. Use the remake version if you want a better game in general. (again, you must own the game before you can use anything in the remake, and even then the remake isn't complete even today, so expect a few issues)			"

												Finally The game is out on steam, Knights and Merchants is a typical Strategy game Based on the feudal system in the middle ages or what we call as Feudalism, What made Knights and Merchants Stand out back then that its even alive today is that game has a strange charm about it, It has no epic story or huge cinematics but its rather simple and great implementation of the feudal system , If you have played settlers this is no strange game then, its very similar to it .What i like about Knights and merchants is that game is well paced and restricted unlike the other games like age of empires where you can build up very quickly and rush others, KAM lays down a Strong System where you need to have specifc Buildings to progress to the next one , so Unless you have a strong economy setup , there is no way to build up a army Fast and rush, It retains that cumbersome slow system Feudalism was. You can Focus on the city Builiding and then make units.It even has a feeding system where you have to feed everyone in your base constantly so , planning is very important , without the right balance people will go hungry and die eventually.Everything is simple and Influences your game in a way.Its a very unique old game , unless you master that starting tutorial the game will be impossible to play easily.There are a lot of fan based Re-makes and fixes but i recommend playing the game as it is, Its a great challenge that way, specially For those not interested in multiplayer.Do Remember to save a lot , The game tends to crash after a long stretch of gaming or music changes			"

												When buying this you will not be able to rush your enemy in under 10 minutes. It's a game which requires a long breath in gaming because it can be named... slow. But when buying this you'll get a classic strategy game. So if you dislike retro strategy games, then leave and never return, but otherwise it's a game which is recommended for you!			"

												Knights and Merchats a truly amazing game, ohh and very hard, if you are accustomed to games that came out in recent years, yea you are going to have a hard time mastering this one. Graphics  - If you have played the first or second Age of Empires or Age of Mythology you won't have a problem with these graphics. For graphics nearly 20 years old, it still holds up to the titans of its genre Age of Empires/Mythology. 8/10 Music  - Relaxing and fun to listen to, like you are really in a tavern. 8/10 Cinematics  - None Story  - A normal story, nothing too boring to nothing too exciting just right. A story about betrayal and your quest through various lands to achieve revenge. 7/10 Content  - A lot of stuff. The variation of troops and buildings is truly amazing,the way the maps are made, the effects that every single thing has. Some recent games have less content than a game nearly 20 years old, truly without words. 10/10 Controls  - A little stiff as expected, but can be easily fixed by giving it some time to sink in. 8/10 Gameplay  - Fluid and well paced, still needs a little getting used to, but when you do, it all pays off. 8/10A must have for strategy and base building lovers, a true gem. True it isn't Age of Empires/Mythology or even Starcraft, but hey give it a try, I did and I am here giving it a recommendation. Final Score  - 8.1/10			"

												The first thing that stands out in this old game is the excellent detailed unit animation, the graphics are quite good too (for an old game like this), ambient life is very nice (like crabs on the beach and foxes scampering through the forest), landscapes are nicely rendered, music is suitably medieval and the sound effects are very good. It's one of those classic games that is difficult to learn, but once you learn how to play it, you will enjoy it immensely.

												This is THE game that got me into the RTS genre when I was a kid (before Age of Empires 2). It is a nice classic game. It involves a complex economy, involving production chains of raw material to finished product like ANNO 2070, which I like. The military fights are alright (make sure you have planty of archers). The pathfinding is okay though not as responisve nor smart as the only thing that is annoying (damn you modern RTS). This is a solid classic RTS if it is something you are looking for from the old days.			"

Amazing how good the music is with this one. I didn't hear such wonderful medieval soundtrack in a long while.  This is a hard one to get into because of the complex micromanagement and economy, but it's worth it at least for the atmosphere.Not for people who want action!			"

												After 113 hours, i've decided....This game has a certain charm to it. It's an extremely slow paced Realtime strategy. The best feature has to be the multiple resources and the length it takes to produce soldiers and food.Another interesting feature of the game is that you have to consistenly feed your military units. It is difficult to slowly produce a large army to just steam roll because of the feeding mechanic. The overall game has a nice balance of managing resources that is missing in other rts games.All of this said, the game has exploitations due to it being almost 20 years old. On top of that, frequent glitches (even with fan patches) can cause the game to crash and even make a stage unwinable (due to a crash everytime something is destroyed).The game cost so little money it could be worth it, but it's glitches and slow pacing can be draining. But if you've got a buck to spend and some time to kill, go for it.			"

												This game took me by surprise. I'll admit when I first looked at it, I didn't think I would like it. The game is dated. You can tell from the graphics it is a much older game; However, I started playing the tutorial and realized the game is very similar to the original Age of Empires, which I spaced out on for many a late night hour. It has it's differences such as farming for corn, to mill into flour, to bake into bread, and so on, but that gives it a certain appeal. I found myself playing for a few hours, after only intending to play for 15 minutes or so to write a review. I think if you see this game for dirt cheap, and you enjoy games such as Age of Empires, this is definitely worth a try. It is an older game, so be prepared for that, but you should find some enjoyment with this little gem.			"

												Great Nostalgia, as I played the original game ~2000 when I was a kid. If you already played this game, you can't do much wrong buying it again, it contains both campaigns (The Shattered Kingdom [TSK] & The Peasants Rebellion [TPR]) which should take ~50hrs of raw speedrunning if you still know the concept of the game.There is a problem though: This is NOT the original game from 2000! It's a remake with a hell of bugs and changes (esp. if you played TSK and didn't own the Gold Edition)Some things I noticed:Opposite KI is waaaaaay worse than the original game (only TSK). E.g. senseless re-adjusting of the forces which is an invitation to lure them out with an archer without much trouble. They once didn't attack for 30 seconds after my archer hit them and just ran one by one in their death. Then the next army and so on. I killed about 50 Units and didn't lose a single Platoon of guys.It's not just more buggy, the KI seems to be more passive than it used to be. I remembered some TSK missions - in Mission 4, they used to have a really vicious timing-attack pressuring a small opening in the mountains if you stood too passive and just tried to eco. The chevalry didn't even move a single feet/hoof in this remake. So lets say you have very much time just building your economy, which you didn't have in the original game and made it kinda tricky to balance economy and army.Another (quite annoying) bug is that - if you build the mercenary camp - mercenaries kinda freeze the game. Commands are delayed by ~5 seconds, which can cause big frustration in a combat. So I recommend playing TSK missions without building the mercenary camp, though the units are in some mission very useful.On the other hand, they didn't fix a giant bug concerning siege: if you click in a good rhythm at a building to attack, you need 1/2 of the time to destroy it. I found it out by accident in the old game and it's a really abusive thing, especially with the dumb KI which does not move for a big time. In one mission i just sneaked a platoon behind the lines and used that - If you split your original forced the missions would have needed maybe 10 minutes instead of 2 hours.Now while this may sound really bad, you can still play the game and have lots of fun. But you have to be your own judge: If you abuse the mistakes in the game it's a really boring Settlers-spin-off. If you play honest some missions still are kinda tricky, especially in TPR. The story is great, the games brings many old feelings and the music still is nice (though not the same as in the original game, which I liked more)For under 5€ definetely a must-have!			"

												Before Age Of Empires... There was K&M. Knights and Merchants forces you to use tactics and strategy employed the right way the first time around. Resource gathering is also a high priority and will reserve many hours. Its a great game, even today and uses a number of features that haven't been used in any other games since. For me this game is a 10/10 based on that it is such an iconic game and one of my first!			"

												I used to play this game as a kid and I remember always going back to it, because it's so much fun. Honestly, the best part of the game is building your village and I have to admit that I don't play it for the battles; they're pretty much a necessary evil, haha. It's fun to keep trying new layouts and road systems. I can spend hours just building a village and then start over once I'm done.The mechanics are great, just plan your buildings and roads and your serfs and workers do all the work. Try not to build too many things at once though, because you will make it go slower accidentally. The workers have a pre-set priority. For example, if a building needs resources the serfs will go there first, and once the building has resources, the workers will go there to build it. This means that roads won't be finished (the workers abandon it to do the buildings first) and some workers might even die while waiting for stones. So, try to finish one thing before you start the next project.The music gets stuck in your head, I catch myself humming the themes while at work. Crazy. Very fun to play, very nostalgic. The graphics may not be anything fancy, the game surely makes up for it. I definitely recommend this to anyone who's on the verge of buying it. And be honest, for this price, what do you have to lose?			"

												Knights and Merchants is a golden relic from the past. While the graphics aren't great compared to modern titans, they were some of the best when this game first came out. It's a great example of classic old school rts/micromanagement. While the gameplay is a bit unusual, you learn most of the mechanics of it through the campaign.Skirmishes are great for practicing and for goofing off with ideas. The ability to organize your soldiers in rows and columns is nice, and allows you to better place your soldiers in small places.On the downside, if you don't like having to build each individual building and creating each specific unit for each building, then this game is not for you. If you like to micromanage everything, then have fun, you'll enjoy it.Overall I give it a 4/5. While it is a classic gem from the past, the graphics make it a bit hard to tell apart your troops and your opponent's.			"

												My god I played this game so much as a kid! It is a super in depth game similar to the original warcrafts. Unlike warcraft though, these maps can take forever since you have to start from a store house and make all your resources from food to weapons to character units nd army units. The combat in this game is much more complicated as well, forcing you to attack more strategicaly rather than just trying to zerg rush. On a lot of maps when you are given starting troops, with the proper attack strategies, you can take out your enemies with just the starting troops. The maps are long and pretty tedious but watching your town flourish is so addicting and the great music will keep you entertained the whole time. It is by far not without its flaws though, the original game's AI is pretty dated and while everything will work fine just working towards your goal, if you try dominate the map your serfs will kill themselves trying to walk across the map when an inn is right next to them. Also this HD version for some reason lacks the super fun music the original had. There are mods for this game online offering enhanced AI and other awesome features worth checking out.			"

												Knights and Merchants, or should I say KaM, is a fun strategic game that is basically like SimCity and Civilizations mixed together. At first, I didn't know what to do. Luckily, I figured it out moments later. I built a town, and raised my warriors from the roof up. This is probably a strategy game that I will love alongside Warcraft III. I have only encountered the town tutorial, and I can't wait 'til I get to the battles!			"

												Dont even bother playing the steam version, as mention in other reviews both the original version and the HD versions are broken beyond repair.  The HD version's combat controls are bugged, the right click, which is used to choose direction in which the troops will face either doesnt work, or it will work, however the cursor will not stand in place ( as it should, since once youve clicked on your position, you then hold the right mouse button to choose the direction in which your troops will face.), since the cursor wont stand in place when you hold down the right click, you will be unable to choose your desired position+direction effectively. As for the original version, it wont even launch on win10.The only way to play and possibly enjoy the game is by installing the KAM remake mod.			"

												Knights and Merchants is somewhat a mixed bag, in my opinion. On one hand, the town creation system is very engaging and highly enjoyable... But, if you are looking for an alternative to Age of Empires, then you have come to the wrong neighbourhood.The combat systems in this are EXTREMELY finiky, and attempting to give quick orders to your troops in the heat of battle is almost impossible. The Archers in this game are definitely the most unresponsive units i have ever tried to control in a strategy game. 90% of the time, when I try to tell my archers to shoot some approaching axe-men, they merely run up to the axe-men and let the axe-men kill them. One such time was when I was attempting to order my archers to fire into a battle, over a mountain, which they have the range to do. No matter what I did, half of my men would start shooting, the other half would run around the mountain and sit there and allow themselves to be killed. I assumed that it was because they were out of range. So, i loaded a previous save and tried again, only this time, I split up the archers into 2 different groups, keeping all of the ones that had been shooting before, in place and telling the others to sit and look pretty... Half of the firing group ran around the mountain and got themselves killed...The melee units are a little better, but a lot of the time, just trying to order them to form ranks will have one of them charge off into the enemy, ala Learoy Jenkins. Other times, they will ignore your orders completely, specifically, one time when I was down to my last axe-man in the enemy base, and I was ordering for him to start attacking a building, he merely stood next to the building and focussed on killing serfs (Sorry, little buddy, but peasants only count in the event of a draw.)That being said, when the game IS performing how you want it to, it is actually very satisfying. Bottlenecking your opponents on a bridge with a bunch of axemen with archers behind them, showering your opponents with arrows, whilst they bounce off of the axemens shields, like in 300, is a very fun thing to do.One last thing to note is that, the combat is somewhat fair, because the enemy AI appears to have much the same problems controlling it's own troops.I love this game, but oh my god, the combat just makes me want to pull my hair out.If you are looking for a medieval style Sim-City, however, I would highly recommend it, because this is one of the most satisfying games to build a vast, thriving city.Don't get me wrong. I love this game a lot, but I can't, in good conscience, recommend it. If you want a Medieval strategy game, get Age of Empires. If you want a Medieval city building simulator, buy Banished.			"

												If The Settlers and Dark Souls had a love child, it would be Knights and Merchants.I never got to play this when it was originally released in 1998, and I regret it, but the mistake has now been rectified! K&M is an old school RTS/city economy builder hybrid. The concept is simple, the graphics a little dated, but still good enough, the sounds are simple and your minions make cute little comments when ordered to do something. The UI is easy to understand and on the surface, it seems a simple game. But within a velvet glove lies an iron gauntlet, ready to smack you down, and when it does, it hurts, because K&M is a deceptively difficult game, and a huge time sink. Some of the missions took over 10 hours to beat, and that isn't counting the restarts after 6-8 hours because I realised I had made some critical error with town planning or resource gathering about 20mins in that didn't come back to bite me until 8 hours later. And the crazy thing is ... I loved it! Even when you think you've beaten a mission after hours and hours of gameplay, sometimes the game surprises you because there was a second enemy hidden up in the corner, quietly building up resources and armies to attack you while you were focused elsewhere. Time to restart after 5 hours!Besides being extremely difficult, with huge resource management, it's not enough just to gather resources and men to build up a large army, that army needs to be fed when deployed, send food to the army, your workers might not have enough to eat. Resources are also limited, you might run out of coal, or iron, or gold, or the mission limits these to add to the difficulty. You might have a shortage of available farmland with which to grow food. All obstacles to be discovered and overcome.The only negatives I had was that the game tended to crash occasionally, at least in the HD version, and because I'd forgotten to save for a few hours, or in one instance six! I lost a lot of progress, but at least I was better prepared on restarting! Save often! It also took me a while to figure out you have to micro-manage archers. They won't fire automatically at enemies unless they are facing them. I wasted so much time in the start wondering why my archers just sat there and let the friendlies in front of them die, and then waited for the enemy to rush them without firing a single arrow, when I needed to change the formation so they were looking in the enemies direction. This wasn't explained anywhere.If you like old school RTS and haven't tried K&M ... it's cheap, it's a classic, you'll get 100's of hours of gameplay out of it, and I think it's worth recommending!

												An all-time classic. Building a town from scratch and feeding your hungry people has never been so much fun. The campaign is a fantastic ride where you start defending your own town from invaders with advanced weaponry. You only get to catch up with the enemy technologically several missions later on. And once you catch up with them, they start to overwhelm you with huge armies. You defend and push them back again and again through epic battles. This whole journey leads to a grand closure where you ultimately unite a shattered kingdom under your own flag. With cute graphics, lovely weapon sound effects, awesome unit quotes and responses (especially during battles!), everything's just so epic and so beautifully crafted that I believe this game is still unrivaled after all these years. Thou must needs play this game. To thy weapons!			"

												I've played this quite some time ago and I have mixed-feelings towards that game, but since this one has additional campaign and reworked version I'll give it a thumbs up. This game resembles Settlers 2 in many ways, but there are major differences. Firstly army is under your direct command and this is a huge advantage of this game. The battles are really nice, however I ware founding myself quite often overrode with enemies where I ware still struggling. The graphic is really nice and  it is enjoyable to watch all your citizens working, eating and prosper. The second main difference is that this game rallies heavy on stone and food, much further then Settlers ware and this is where the problems begins... The stone is needed not only for buildings itself but one is building roads with them, and also they are the defense ammunition for your defense towers. In reality it is easy to use up your stone stock quite fast, especially since roads are crucial. Your citizens will not refuse to work without food like in Settlers, but instead they can starve to death, this is not the biggest problem with the army but like in reality mostly with common people. Why? Well, for larger cities this game has a real problem with transportation, one needs to build large roads and quite few additional stockpiles to maintain everything at reasonable level. Your citizens have a bad habit to ""bump"" into others and it takes few second before they use opportunity to bypass other people, you know, like in reality rumors, etc ;) However that cause quite large delays in their moving and in the effect people can start to die as either they will not make it to tavern, or other folks will not be able to restock taverns in time. I have good moments with this game, but towards the end I found it to be a more struggle then fun, but I could recommend it for the good moments, and the price tag seems well fit to the content. "

												I know this game from my PPC Amiga back in the days. It got a very late conversion to it but i liked it back then as much as I like it nowadays. The game has a few twists that make it different to the typical settlers game:It is much more slow paced, but this is a good turn. In some parts of the gameplay it's even more realistic especially in the military part: Instead of single knights you have different type of units that are organized in seperate groups or squads within the same weapon type. These squads can be moved much like they did in the real medieval or baroque world and the strategic placement of military units before a battle most likely WILL differ the victorious player from the loosing one.The game has very nice and athmospheric graphics and background musics. Everything is handdithered to a 1024x768 resolution and it's all nicely blended together. Furthermore there is much detail to discover in the landscapes like floating searoses, swimming fishes or the leaves of trees weaving in the wind. Ok, now you could say that the graphics of the game look kinda oldish but at least I like 'em very much the way they are, as (again) I personally dislike most real 3D game engines especially for this type of strategical.I think every lover of the settlers searching for a different and in some degrees more complicated but nevertheless completely fun driven medieval simulation should give this game a go. The support for actual systems is very well as it runs on all newer windows versions without problems and all the released bonus missions (nowadays called dlcs) are already included in the main package. So this historical version will give you quite some weeks or months if not years of fun. I mean it!If you for whatever reason missed this gaming jewel in the past you should go and buy it now !!!

												This game is beautiful because it bring to live nice memories. Otherwise is an extremly frustrating game. Military units are hard to control and lose battles because they do not execute the orders, you can not set the production chains so the resources are distributed randomly. I spent lots of hours with it, but in the end the fun / frustration rate is just wrong. :)			"

												Knights and Merchants to me is more of a museum piece than a game I would recommend to a friend. I say this in the most positive way possible and for several reasons.First of all, and least importantly, the graphics have aged rather not all that alrightly. There are an abundance of worse examples but Knights and Merchants is definitely on that fringe of being a little too jarring to sink into.Second, this game came during an age when many of the muscle memory type commands and standards of user interaction were still being experimented with and ironed out. That’s not to say that K&M plays poorly, after 8+ hours of play it’s still a game I’ll dabble in at times in the future. It just feels a bit clunky. Much in the same way a typewriter would feel clunky after using a modern keyboard, all the functionality is intact but the experience is just antiquated.Finally, and what I would imagine would be the tipping point for the average summer sale shopper, Knights and Merchants is DEEP. If you really want to dig into this game, I would absolutely recommend it. The gameplay comes from a time when people didn’t expect games to hold their hands and it has no qualms about offering up as much depth in gameplay as machines could handle back then.Knights and Merchants is a great game but for a modern audience I think it would be eaten alive. It comes from a different time but that doesn’t automatically make it bad, just very novel in this day and age.			"

												THIS GAME RULES BUT DON'T BUY IT ON STEAM!!!!!!!!!!!!Since the 2nd mission the game crashes frequently so I guess all other missions will be the same crap which then you would have to reset your pc to get out.HD version doesn't even work at all with a normal screen.Just download ""KaM Remake"" and you'll save yourself €7 for a game that doesn't even work properly. You can even make a donation of €7 and your money will be better spend because they work with donations to make the game better.And no steam doesn't give your money back when you feel like being ripped off when you played for more than 2 hours, even when you've explained that you bought Kam Remake, merged it with the steam version and played KaM that way!

												Knights and Merchants. The revolution is coming. A prince had take overthe kingdom, and you will have to conquest it and liberate your people.When you try to know why this game hasn't the recognition it deserve, you will find that he was launch at the same time as Age of Empire. This is the reason why the big marketing machine had shadowed one of the biggest strategy game of all time : Knights and Merchants.I'm a total fan of the game, trying to create every town with the right urban organisation, avoiding starving and creating the best scheme for wining. Each level is original, and you have to make every time a new strategy : Enhance you food supply, securise raw material, make warrior as fast as possible to support your allies.As an old game, there are some bugs, but guess wgat, they are more funny than anything else : Ennemy's Ghost Town, Ennemy do not feed it's soldier sometime and makes it easy to win. Those type of bugs can happen 1 time on 99.But this game is one of the best strategic game ever.I recommed it if you love strategy games and if you have the time to play it. It can take between 15 minutes and 5 hours to beat a level. Yes, you read it, 5 HOURS, and it's worth it, looking at you army detroying the ennemy building. A great satisfaction 20/20.			"

												This game is still great. Recently started playing again after some years.I find it quite sad that there hasn't been a game made after K&M with the same concept. There are plenty of good RTS games around, but none like this. K&M focuses more on building a good village, where there will be enough food for your people, and placing your buildings strategically to contain a good chain of supply.If you like this game simply depends on this: do you like building your city for more than an hour before getting huge battles or do you play your RTS just for the battles. If it's the first one, you will like playing K&M, if it's the second, you would be better off playing other RTS.			"

												This game is really nice piece of artwork for itself. Sprite animations, nice music, line manufacturing, attention to details, colorful environments and buildings, art of war... It really has everything. And it was game of my childhood as well. I used to play game without fast forwarding and missions took hours, days to play, and it was still more fun than most of today games. There were other games like Settlers but none managed to capture magic of this game. And it aged pretty well i think. Other major factor in the game is strategy... there are no health bars and with 10 men in right position you can kill 100 other men. Game is total pro, but for con I would probably put animations between missions which were quite bad even for that time. And maybe repetitive game play... although it is not repetitive as it looks like. If you are cunning enough and have great strategy, you can win many missions without constructing a single building. Other con I can think of is hard game play (for beginners) as the game is quite non-forgiving when it comes to wrong choices, and poor micro management. But again, it is also a kind of an advantage since you perfect your game play like that. Overall, one of not so popular classics.			"

												The game is great.. however it's definitely not for everyone. I used to play this a lot as a kid and I enjoyed it. I do recommend getting it if it's on a sale. If it's not, then you probably shouldn't spend your money (unless you're a fan or played this game before, of course).There are a few frustrating things like:- Can't plan roads ahead - the builders won't start building buildings until they finish the roads.- People constantly getting into each other's way and pushing around.- Poor unit control (and impossible to control ""passive/friendly"" units).Another thing (which isn't necessarily a bad one) that I can add is that the game is slow. It takes forever to get things done and I often minimize the game to do other things.I think this game deserves a sequel. I don't see it coming anytime soon though.			"

												While not necessarily the best RTS out there, this one holds fond memories for me. It was the first one I ever played and was thrilled to find it again on Steam. A word of warning beforehand; get 'Kamremake' (after buying the legit copy ofcourse) or run the patch which is mentioned often in the reviews/discussions for the best experience. You can expect higher resolutions, better zoom-options, scrolling, more accurate point-and-click gameplay as well as more options besides the campaign(s).What can you expect? A challenging RTS wherein you must manage your economy, borders and army well. Yes, it comes with a few quircky/iffy, particularly when it comes to positioning your squadrons. This takes a little practice, but when you get a hold of it you certainly do not need to outmatch your opponents in numbers. Make use of the terrain, funnels and some 'body pulling' to decimate armies. The first two missions do well enough to teach you these basics. From there on it ramps up the difficulty incrementally, both in terms of the might of your opponents as well as the mission type (open map versus say an entrapment mission). By far the most challenging missions are those that keep you on a tight timer before you get overwhelmed.Disregarding the option to speed up the game, prepare to spend hours per game/map as in the olden days. Combined with the music and the sounds of productivity emitting from your bustling settlement this is ideal when coupled to getting some work done or other chores around the house.			"

												It's awesome that this game is now available on Steam.This is an oldskool RTS that has many features that are still lacking in modern games and it's a good example of a game with enormous detail and a huge economic simulation besides the ability to fight fights that feel like they matter.The Steam version has two full campains included wich I believe used to be sold seperately as two games.Sadly it is showing it's age a little because of these points: - No widescreen support, i.e., black borders on most monitors - Slightly unstable (my play session crashed after two hours)Still, it's an absolute must-have if you like RTS games!

												I used to spend hours and hours and hours playing this when I was a kid. It has a beautiful soundtrack which fills me with happiness every time I hear it. The campaign is difficult but a ton of fun and playing normal maps is great too, even if the AI isn't that good. It still has some late game bugs that could ruin your game, but I find that it doesn't occur that often and if it does you just gotta make sure you win fast. :pI highly recommend you install the Remake from http://www.kamremake.com/. It fixes tons of bugs and makes the game so much better you could call it an entirely new game.This is definitely a nostalgia influenced opinion though.			"

												This is a game that i first played as a child, this was my first ever game. Back then i loved it. I still do now. This game has everything an RTS should, although it's old, it's still a great game, it really is a big shame companies don't make games like that anymore. For those looking for some multiplayer acton there's the remake which adds that, plus plenty of new maps and improves the AI as much as the source code allows it.If you're looking for a real good RTS, then this is the game for you			"

												This is an old pearl never aged, a slow RTS game in 2D. Manage a village with an war economy, prepare the troops, feed them and your servants. There is only a long campaign. But there is still online a good comunity, search at KAM Remake, from their site you can download a wonderful mod that improves the game with few new units and many campaigns. Aboveall there are some servers for online gaming. Therefore I suggest to buy this game, and after to download KAM Remake for more campaigns, custom skirmish online and vs CPU ( and a better graphic resolution).			"

Very meticulous resource building game, the actual combat can be buggy and frustrating. Make sure you save before a batle and always build tripple size roads in and around your town centre.			"

												The tutorials are a bit lacking in these older games but I managed to learn the basics in this ones. This game is an enormously fun little strategy game, very charming. It feels to me like a slightly dumbed down version of the settlers but it does not fail to impress overall, the army management being much better.			"

												I would only recommend this game if you already played this game in the past and really liked it.  If this game is new to you, it will be incredibly frustrating.  To create your economy, you are forced to build your buildings in a specific order.  There is no wiggle room, the game will only allow you to create building type 15 after building type 14, but only after you built 13, and so on.  It's a tedious process, and it takes your serfs about 4 minutes to build each building if everything goes smoothly, which it never will.  Serfs get stuck in roads...a lot.  The end goal of a healthy economy is to build a large enough army to beat the overwhelming forces of your enemy.  If you lose the 30-40 troops you are assigned at the beginning of the mission, it will probably take 1-2 hours to replace that army, and that may not be enough to kill the 300-400 enemies that you will be facing.  Also, winning a battle is always going to involve having one of your archers lure the enemy force into your carefully prepared army lines with militia in the front and archers in the back.  Over and over and over again.  That is the only strategy that you are expected to use or that will work.  You have to be quick about it too, because your troops will get hungry and have to be fed about every 15 minutes or they will die, which means you need tons of food and plenty of serfs to walk the food all the way across the map to feed your massive army.  Once in battle, the controls are clunky, the soldiers are incredibly hard to direct, and the archers must be positioned perfectly or they will be unresponsive.  If you do get this game, save your game a lot, because you do not want to lose many of your soldiers in battle.  Each soldier is a huge investment in time and resources. The game crashes a lot as well, there seems to be an issue with the sound causing crashes, so you may want to turn the sound off.  Be prepared for a lot of micromanagement and 20 very long levels in both campaigns.			"

Despite that, it's very... slow, yet relaxing. I could still play it for hours. If you have ever heard of Banished, this would be the game coming as close as possible to Knights and Merchants.			"

												This is, as many have told, the game of my childhood. Since I've bought it here on steam I am afraid to play it because of how addictive it is. I prefer the economic aspect of the game rather than the militar. The chain of production, the city planning (and that street pathfinding thing) and food management are great challenges without having even to fight the enemies. The fighting system is good, but since it's a game that was made more than 15 years ago, some things could be way better. Still very good and relies a lot on tactical thinking. For those who think the game is slow, and it is, I recommend pressing F8 while ingame. This will speed the game :)Do you like RTS? Buy it.			"

												This is one of those games that you probably got with a bundle or some promo and out of nostalgia for the 90s and the steam cards you give it a go around 8 when you are back home and suddenly it's 4 o'clock in the morning…It have it's share of problems and it may feel stupid for today standards (imagine that you need to turn the archers yourself to face the enemy so they can start attacking…) but I found it very challenging to try to win.At first I was very frustrated but then I tried to understand how it plays and I liked it.I loved that you really need to do resources management and you need for example to pick wood, make planks, then shields, then axes and finally a soldier and you don't just have a super simplified system like in other games that you need just 1 or 2 resources to do this. More advanced units need even more resources.I also loved that you need in fact to feed your people or they will just die! Really this game is complex even for today's standards and while the graphics are absolutely outdated from a point on you just don't care, because you enjoy the game. The HD version helped giving you more zoomed out view that look better in a 1080p monitor.It is not for everyone but if you like micromanagement and you are willing to “forget” modern gameplay and retrofit yourself to how the games used to play, you will enjoy it.

												A fine game, starts off really chill, you can easily afford to chat with friends or even go make yourself a sandwich at the beginning of the game, but don't do that later- once you get to building your troops it gets wild! A true strategy at it's finest.Be warned tho, if you thought that, per say - command & conquer or starcraft was slow paced and didn't like how long it takes for you to build up your base before you can get to building an army and start your attacks...this game's gonna be your worst nightmare.

												Totally recommend this game.Classic strategy game, which you've to micro manage all your kingdom needs, to sucess on your campaign map.The micro management is actually a need system, which requires something to build your next building, for example.If you want produce bread to feed your population, you'll need to build a mil to produce flour, to produce flour you'll need to build a farm produce corn, to build a farm youll need wood and stones.And so keep going, weapon, armory, gold or whatever, need to follow a tree of needs to be acomplished, that's why this game is cool and I recommend.

Sad it's not as popular as the other RTS giants.The complex economy system and battles make every mission, map and multiplayer game just a joy. Building up a stable economy and building your army is just very satisfying, especially with its art style and atomsphere, and don't even get me started on the amazing music. Very fitting for it.Tho I suggest this game here, I recommend buying it and then installing over it the KaM Remake which fixes a lot of bugs and makes the game 100% problem free on a modern PC, also it supports multiplayer.A must have if you enjoy great RTS games but which are also difficult.

												Knights and Merchants is one of those games I grew up with, how ever saying that I have put allot of time into the game. Compared to the old version I have on the CD format the Steam version of it seems to be easy to gather food (by adding in the fishers hut) and dose have some fix's to the builders where they would stop working after you grew to fast. Though with this the steam version also made it longer on the missions compared to the old game. To those who never played this classic I would highly recommend this to you, the game is based on building your town and getting an army up fast. Though if you grow your town to fast you will lose, you need to have about 6 farms, 6 wine farms, around 3-4 pig farms and 2-3 mills that will take care of your food for most of the game and lets you get plenty of pig skins to make the better units. I would also like to add that you need about 5 or wood cutters. You will run out of wood and stone fast, on the other levels once you get to about half point of the game you will need to get gold, I would say rush to that asap. There is also a trick to winning the maps with out losing to much men, you make a single bow unit and put him close by to enemy units wait for them to come out of there base to attack your unit, then with draw him back to your line (that needs to be near by). With this tactic you can wipe out there main force. Sometimes this will not work if you don't have the right units to do it. Most maps will last you 2-4 hours so make sure you have time, and that you make 2 saves (one at the start of the level encase you screw up, and a mid map save or a save when you need to take a break). The game dose take time in fact allot of time, I have not beat the steam version and made it to the last level on the old school version before my old 497Hhz died. Over all Pros and Cons:Pro's*Game has much needed fix's such as the builder’s bug and the resource bug.*The AI dose not rush you as much as the old version (except on a few maps with just fighting units).*You are able to do a mid map rush if you are a vet of the game.*Added single maps where you can play AI with out the missions however you can not set up teams and the AI is highly lacking.Con's*The music is not the best is not the original and will sometimes lock up.*The sound file's of the game will sometimes skip if you have the music on which can lock up the sounds.*Increased the games time for most maps where it will take you an extra hour.Over all I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys games like AOE (Age of Empires), Warcraft III. It is well worth the price of the game.			"

												A pretty old game that, despite its age is still very enjoyable nowadays IMO. Only thing that kinda bugs me is that troops sometimes seem to have a low AI. One of my favorite games when i was about eight years old, still enjoy playing it these days.			"

												I played this years ago after finding it at a computer fair with my dad. We both then lost entire days to this. We would start in the morning, and before we knew it, it was getting dark. Its not so noticable on the first few levels, but towards the end, you looking at some long games. I loved this game, and recommend everyone gets it. But if you start playing it, and suddenly realise its tomorrow, don't say I didn't warn you.Get KaM remake. The base game only has resolutions 800 x 600 and 1024 x 768. KaM remake allows a lot more, and you can even run in windowed mode if you so wish. The mod is compatible with this version, details and downloads are available at http://www.kamremake.com/If you liked the origional Settlers games (before 5) you will love this. (Personally I don't think much of the Settlers games, but that could be because I played this first).KaM has more micromanagement than most strategy games that are not built around it (see the Tropico series and any of the Tycoons (Railroad, Rollercoaster, Airport, Lemonade Stand etc etc etc)), and contains a much more strategic realtime combat system, where you can't just constantly throw units away at your opponent until they crumble.As a comparison to other strategy games lets look at food.Most strategy games you need farms; food is now sorted.KaM has 3 food types; bread, sausages and wine.Bread requires; a Wheat farm, a Windmill, and a Baker.Sausages require a Wheat farm (to feed the pigs on the...) Swine Farm and a Butcher.Wine requires only a Vineyard.However, so your non-military units eat, you need atleast 1 Inn. (The Inns can sit either 6 or 8 people I can't recall exactly so if you have a lot of non-militants you need more than 1 Inn...but you wont have to worry about that until later in the base game (Shattered Kingdom)).5 useful tips. (Contains what some would consider a spoiler)1: Ignoring military, I generally recommend 3 serfs for every 2 buildings. Its not exact but works well enough for the most part.2: For highest efficiency each farm should have 14 fields close by.3: On the first combat only mission STOP ALL YOUR UNITS. They will be slaughtered very quickly as they enter a valley. You will be fighting a much larger force, but use your head and you can do it.4: Save often in different slots. This game is very unforgiving and something you did or didn't do an hour ago can make all the difference now.5: Treat every military unit as Sacred. They can be costly and just a plain arese to replace.			"

												I have played this game for years and years for about a thousand hours.. When i recently came across it on steam it was a no brainer for me. This game is just great, and not because of nostalgia.It has gameplay for any kind of rts/stratagy gamer. You can build big cities and raise armies. Because of the ''build chain'' you will always have to work hard for your resources: you need a farm for grain, then a mill for flour and a baker for the bread. This system makes you always want to expand. The armies itself are not really my thing. For those who do like that sort of thing KAM has a fun army system, meaning you have to work really hard to sustain an army, food, supplies, recruits, workshops etc. And if you want to disable enemies i recommend you just google Knights and merchants map editor/mission editor. And then you can ''mod'' the maps to your own standards. Have fun!All in all this game is just really awesome!11/10Note: English is not my native language.			"

												A very underrated classic game. I originally bought this game when it was first released and it has never gotten the recognition I felt it deserved. This is a Real-time-strategy game for players who enjoy playing the civilian/production side of the RTS experience, so if you're the kind of player who wants to build a massive army and kick butt with very little regard for your work force then you should look somewhere else. But if you want to build a complex city with charming buildings and likeable workers going about their jobs, then prepare for a real treat.Pros-A complex city construction system. If you want to train a soldier, you must first hire a recruit, build the weapons and armor they will use, and manufacture the components used to make the weapons and armor with first. And of coarse, this process requires buildings and workers for every stage of construction. Enjoy the process! :)-The graphics and animations are charming. They are old-school, but charming.-Population size is only limited by food production. You can keep growing your population for as long as you have the mats, but if you don't have the food to feed them with, you will be looking at a massive starvation die-off.-A wide variety of types of workers for doing different jobs. Builders build. Serfs carry resources to where they are needed. Farmers grow crops. Blacksmiths craft armor. etc. etc.Cons-The game's tech-tree is more rigid (unforgiving) than I would like. You start the game with a certain amount of resources. And if you use up a particular resource before you've built the ability to produce more, then you might as well restart the round. This is especially true of gold, which is used for hiring new people. If you run out of gold before hiring a miner to mine gold with, you're town is permanently plateued. -Very difficult to maintain a large standing army, because you need to feed them. And every piece of food you're giving to a soldier is a piece of food you aren't giving to a worker. And you only benefit from soldiers for as long as you are fighting. Large armies can cause massive starvation die-offs if you don't manage things properly.-The player really needs the ability to grab a worker and give him a direct order to do something NOW, instead of waiting for their Ai to get around to doing it.-The Ai gets confused in an extremely long game. (13 hours or so) It works great for a long time, and then suddenly serfs start delivering mats to other people's cities (this works for you as much as against you), units start forgetting how to do their jobs, etc.-Ability to command your military is a little unforgiving. Once your army meets the enemy, you won't be able to give them any commands until after they are done fighting.OverallThis is one of my all time favorite RTS games. It's even withstood the test of time! If I could get an RTS with this games' work force and city construction combined with Warlords Battlecry's military and hero system, I'd be in heaven. :)			"

												I have been tricked! There are no merchants in this game! There are plenty of knights though, and they're mostly kicking my royal♥♥♥♥♥so I could do without those, too. Of course then you wouldn't have a game, but then again I'm not sure the world still needs an RTS with overcomplicated supply chains in a Warcraft 1 era engine. And when I put it like that, I'm sure it doesn't.Knights and Merchants is indeed a real-time strategy game set in Ye Olde Medieval Tymes, and purports to be historically accurate insofar as the tools and weapons go. What that means is that instead of building a barracks to crank out soldiers, you build a barracks that requires recruits from the schoolhouse, axes from the weaponsmith, and armor from the armorsmith. And those crafters require materials like timber and leather, which are produced at workshops from raw materials like wood and hides, which are obtained from even more workshops. All of these buildings must be built by your laborers using materials carted around by your serfs from the warehouse, and staffed by special craftsmen trained at the school. And all of these people eat a well-balanced diet of bread and meat and wine, so you'd better have your agriculture chains laid out before you get into the serious stuff.If reading that paragraph made your eyes glaze over then you have a pretty good idea of how Knights and Merchants plays. Each map requires you to erect a sprawling village of craftsmen and laborers just to produce even the most basic militia. Every unit of every resource must be carried by a serf from its point of origin to its destination, including stones for paving the roads that must connect your buildings in order for them to operate for no clear reason. This is somehow even more frustrating than it sounds because the map is essentially gridded out, and each square can only contain one unit, and they cannot move past each other.Now imagine that you have spent the requisite half an hour to build up a thriving village and produce an army of soldiers a few dozen strong. These soldiers need to eat too, and there's a ""Feed Troops"" command that will restore each man to full health. When you push that fateful button, a serf must travel to the warehouse, collect a unit of food, and deliver it directly to a soldier in that unit. This must happen for every single soldier in that unit. And those serfs can't pass through your neat rows of troops, so you get to witness a bizarre, mechanical shuffling of bodies as helpful servants slowly tear your lines apart to shove a loaf of bread into your standard bearer's face.""Slowly"" is the operative word here. Everything you do happens so slowly that it sucks any potential fun out of the game. Just constructing one building has you waiting on laborers to level the land, laborers to clear the road to the building, serfs to bring stone to the laborers to build the road, serfs to bring materials to the building site, and laborers to build it. Each of those steps happens one at a time with pauses in between for the AI to recalibrate itself. And God help you if you try to build more than one structure at a time, because your little helpers might decide it's more helpful to build the entire barracks before even clearing the land for the weaponsmith or bakery or whatever you need first. There's no way to give orders to your serfs or laborers, and even the combat commands for your troops are basic and slow to respond.It's not a bad-looking game, with detailed sprites and animations on display. The faux-3D landscape can be ugly at times but you'll be wallpapering it with buildings anyway. The sound effects are jaunty and Middle-Agey but all play over each other at the same volume, so try not to linger over your village or big battles lest you go deaf. You'll have plenty of missions to crawl through if you dare but they start hard and only get harder, challenging you to build settlements under threat of attack right from the first few scenarios. Wrestling the janky combat controls while sussing out the dozens of buildings in your production chains is not a winning combination, so anyone looking for a quality mix of real-time strategy and city building is better off elsewhere. Maybe somewhere with merchants.			"

												I gave this game a 7/10 just because the graphics are out dated (is obviously an old game) and there is other games with a little more extended menus.However is totally worth the price. If you like Warcraft III you will enjoy this variant. I expend a few hours figuring out the strageties and also managing the city was very amusing, it wanted to freez a few times but it didn't other than that the game is woth it.  "

												It was great in it's time, but after having a taste of all the current games like this have to offer, Knights and Merchants is a lackluster experience at best. The only way this game could become remotely playable is with stronger nostalgia goggles than I have. If you want to relive the fun of the genre's early days that's great, but I couldn't bring myself to play for much longer than this.			"

												Old but gold. I've played this game when I was little and now it came out on Steam. Just had to get this.This game is really slow phased and easy, although the campaign is quite challenging.Had a lot of fun with this game, it has this oldschool feeling on it. They did a good job on showing the processes from basic material to the actual product. Woodcutter cuts down tree, servant brings log to the sawyer, servant brings planks to weaponcrafter, servant brings weapon to training ground. Recruit goes to training ground, and you got an unit.Defenitely worth the buy!			"

												Knights and Merchants is one of my personal favorite Civ Builder games! Very complex economy system, quite challenging and long missions. The game switches between missions where you build your town and fight the opposing kingdom and mission where you just fight off an army of enemy troops. The game has aged very well, but it is deffinitely not without it's flaws and can sometimes be quite frustrating due to it's mechanics. Despite, I would stongly recommend this game to anyone with even the slightest interest in the genre.I do however recommend you buy the Knights and Merchants: the Peasants Rebellion version and not the Historical Version here on Steam! Big fans of the game have made a remake for the game that SOLELY works with the Peasants Rebellion version of the game! the remake involves a few improvements to the game mechanics, the ability to play the game in 1080p (the native game only goes up to 1280x1024) and an added matchmaking system with fans and veterans of the game. You can find the remake over at http://www.kamremake.com/.			"

												Excellent old school gameFirst played this game in 1997 - so its old. But in that time its lost none of its magic and its fantastic to see it here on steam.First off, the economy is excellently simulated; you need to quarry stone and cut wood to have building materials - then you must build farms/vineyards/pig farms to have raw ingredients for your millers, bakers, sausage makers etc to turn into food for your population. Army construction follows a similar theme - mining of coal and ore, followed by smithing into weapons. Recruits are trained and turned into soldiers. Thus the conquest commences.Defeating your foe is a little more standard-RTS-esqe - take your men, beat his men, destroy his stuff. Yet tactics are very important in the game - you'll need a blend of men, bowmen, swordfighters, pikemen etc - to successfully take out your foe. Although this micromanagement sounds cumbersome, the game is actually very streamlined and within a short period of time your base/town is up and running and you can focus on fighting your enemy. Brilliant retro game you can spend hours on			"

												One of my favs old strategy games, along with aoe2. On most game you are building a sustainable economy,then you build an army, then you fight the enemy and destroy their town.ProsGreat music and sound effect for the time it was release. I still like hearing the sound effect of the townpeople working.Economic system that works and makes sense.Combat is balance because there is no overly powerful unit that doesnt have a counter to it.ConsTowers that use rock instead of archers and 1 hit ko.Singleplayer ai starts with big armies and developed towns. So if you are not ready when they attacked you have to restart and plan your town growth again.SERFS walking on the road. You can only have 1 person on a road at any time except when a person switch road with another. So if you have big army of serfs, they'll eventually slow down the economy cause they will be bumping into each other.			"

												(ignore my game-time)I acquired this through some kind of event. But since i've already play this game in my other steam account,Here's my ""note to myself before buying this game""- Old School style Strategy game- The graphic looks pretty much decent for an old game- Kinda love the gameplay and it really intuitive- Build a wider road (Self Experience)- Link up,command,attack [Basic Game (that's quite fun!)]- I suggest if you REALLY want this game,u better wait till u got discount,free giveawayAnd last but not least, dont underrated this game just because this is modern age.I know there are games with high graphic or something,but you can't just looking down on old games.Cause whether you like it or not,at somepoints you'll start thinking on how many times you have playing ol' classic games and it was fun right? :D			"

												Things like these are just kind of sad. This game is one of the first games I ever played, and I loved it back then as much as I love it now. Recently, a website was giving away 7 games for free, and this one was one of them. I was quite happy to see this game again, and I wanted to try it out. Sadly, it wasn't what I was expecting. Before I start the review, though, I want to to say something to whoever is reading this: This game is from 1998. We're in 2015. The game is already 17 years old, and thus, it might look like garbage for people that are actually YOUNGER than the game itself... But there is a BIG line between a game that's Old-school (you can just pick it up and enjoy it), and out-dated (something you don't want to go back into). The Angry Video Game Nerd said that once, and I believe it suits the situation perfectly. That being said, I'll start talking about the bad things of the game, and sadly, I've found a few.First and foremost, the game comes with both the original version, and some sort of ""HD"" version that I didn't even know it existed. The original one is quite literally what it was back before, but has problems running with today's computers, crashing a few times. The HD version works way better than the original one, but FOR SOME UNHOLY REASON THAT I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND, IT'S MISSING A TON OF FEATURES! Playing with bots? Multiplayer? Random maps? Map editor? All of that, and more, is missing in the version that actually works. You can only play the tutorial, play the story-mode (I'm not a big fan of it, but there is one), and change the settings. That's unexcusable, WHY BOTHERING TO MAKE AN HD VERSION IF YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE IT UNFINISHED!?Another issue I have with the game, is something that could have been fixed alongside the HD version: You see, when you desire to build something, your builders will go there, prepare the terrain, and then the workers will start bringing the building materials: That's something that I like, buildings are done in a realistic way, not just having one random peasant hit a bunch of planks until a castle suddenly appears from nowhere. So, where's the problem? You need to connect every building with roads. Something that I also like, but roads and building can take an INSANE time to be build. Why? Your workers can only bring one stone or plank at a time, and most of the time you will have to build arround 10 1x1 areas of road to connect a building properly, and the worst part is that workers move really slow. You can quite literally spend an hour setting up your basic buildings, before you can bother to start with the military parts of a match. This only goes worse when you notice that those workers who help builders, also have to carry every resource in town. EVERY. RESOURCE. And they block themselves while walking on the roads. I believe I've said enough to make you understand, building can take longer than Episode 3 to be made.Another issue I have with the game, are the bots. After playing for a while, I managed to get the hang of it, but during your first random matches, they'll annihilate your♥♥♥♥♥ Why? Well, I can't see them in the minimap, but I bet they don't have the same issues as you do, or something. All I know is that they're always a whole stair-way above you.Something that also seems to not work properly, is the language. I have my Steam setup in English, because original dubs and translations are usually WAY better than the Spanish ones, and I can both speak and read English without an issue... But still, the HD version of the game starts in Spanish? That's because the game looks at your OS to know what language it should have, INSTEAD OF STEAM! The original version does work properly, but that's just lazy and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.A last issue I have with the game, is something quite stupid that the devs have done. So, they did NOT take the time to make sure the Steam-port was good, but they DID take the time to put ads in the game. Yeah, ads. Commercials. What do I mean? Every time you start the game, it will also start your Internet browser, and go into the Steam page of another game they did. Want to know the funny part of it? That game, named ""Raven's Cry"", that was released quite recently and was there for pre-purchase for months and months, is a huge piece of dog-sh#t. I'm not making it up, it's a horrible game. It doesn't even deserve that you look at it, but they force you to it. And it's a piece of sh#t that's worth 60€, or so they say. What dumb excuse they got for this?So, does the game actually have GOOD things? Yeah. The gameplay is great, once you get over the insane building process. Towns actually kind of work like they did back then: One guy cuts down trees, another one takes the tree and makes planks, another one transforms the planks into useful stuff. It really goes well with the gameplay. You also have to make the weapons and armors of the soldiers, something that I like a lot, and has been done in other games as well, while in here was done to near perfection. The music and sounds are quite out-dated and haven't been updated properly, but it's not something worth ripping off your ears.So, in the end... Do I recommend this game? Yeah, it's fun and quite a blast from the past. Do I recommend the STEAM version? No. F#ck no. It's not worth the purchase. I got it for free, and I still feel dissapointed. What I suggest you to do, is download the fan-remake of the game, you can find it here:  Knights and Merchants - Remake [www.kamremake.com]This is where the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and hilarios part arrives: A bunch of fans managed to fix EVERYTHING that was wrong with the Steam version, AND MORE, without that much of an issue. The original Devs didn't even bother to do it right. If you EVER want to play this game as IT DESERVES to be played, go to that website, and download it. Do NOT buy it on Steam.			"

												(ignore my game-time)I acquired this through some kind of event. But since i've already play this game in my other steam account,Here's my ""note to myself before buying this game""- Old School style Strategy game- The graphic looks pretty much decent for an old game- Kinda love the gameplay and it really intuitive- Build a wider road (Self Experience)- Link up,command,attack [Basic Game (that's quite fun!)]- I suggest if you REALLY want this game,u better wait till u got discount,free giveawayAnd last but not least, dont underrated this game just because this is modern age.I know there are games with high graphic or something,but you can't just looking down on old games.Cause whether you like it or not,at somepoints you'll start thinking on how many times you have playing ol' classic games and it was fun right? :D			"

												Instead of going in-depth about gameplay and graphics and story and such, I'm just going to give my experiences with the tutorial and the first mission of the game to give you an idea of why I stopped playing.- Building, upkeep and resource management were pretty interesting and engaging. It was neat seeing resources getting stored in actual physical buildings and getting ferried around to where they're needed instead of just disappearing into the Warehouse Beyond Time and Space to be teleported into the hands of whoever needs to use it right at that moment.- Spend some time building up my town as instructed, building mills and farms and generally having a good time, when I complete the final objective and...nothing happens. I'm just stuck there trying out some extra buildings with nothing to do and no more direction, until I just quit out and the game acts like I failed the tutorial. Oookay.- Start up the first mission and are immediately thrown into a fight with my town on fire and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥the combat is absolutely awful. I have all these different units and other than the archer's obvious advantages and disadvantages I'm given no indication what advantages a militiaman might have over a pikeman.- Instead of selecting and moving individual units, units are instead divided into companies that have to be commanded as a whole. And companies can only be made up of similar units, so if you have a company of pikemen and all of them die except one you're stuck with a company of a single pikeman unless you feel like training more.- Companies have to be fed regularly, which consists of serfs VERY SLOWLY waddling out with food for ONE INDIVIDUAL unit and then waddling back to get a second one. And there's no indication when they're finished. And you have to click on every individual company to get them fed. Trying to do any of this anywhere other than within 20 feet of your storehouse is a long and tedious process.- Have I mentioned that everyone moves REALLY slowly? And you can't give orders to multiple companies at a time? So when moving your army forward you have to click on every individual company and order them forward a little bit at a time.- The AI is dumb as a sack of elementary school dropout hammers. Most of the time they'll only attack something if directly ordered to, or if they're directly being attacked, meaning you'll regularly have companies in the middle of a big fight standing around scratching their asses because nobody's ran up and started stabbing them yet.- The moment where I quit the game was when two melee attackers broke through to my company of about 10-12 archers. What you'd expect to happen was for the archers to promptly turn them into human pincushions with MAYBE a casualty on my side if they got lucky. What happened instead was my archers freaked the hell out and scattered, running around like headless chickens without attacking while these two melee units nearly wiped out the whole company.tl;dr: Decent base-building and resource management, absolutely atrocious combat.

												The game is briliant, I bought this for the HD version, although I already had it. Unforunately the HD version is so bad, I can hardly believe it. The people who done it are terrible. The Hold Click for army commanding doesn't work properly so it is a little hard to place armies in proper formations, the thing that made this game so interesting. The pathfinding is terrible, and very buggy. And it only has the original campain done, not the expansion. The gold edition fixed many of the pathfinding problems in this game, but here, those are still there. And another thing is that you get acces instant to all buildings. Really disappointed.			"

												Knights and Merchants, or KaM to those of us that have played the game on and off for decades, is a fantastic and fun game in which you build and fight in a variety of lands. Each 'mission' has it's own goals, however they do tend to blend together and every new map seems to have the same goal. Battle missions, where there is no building, are quick, and you will find yourself on the losing end if you're not paying attention.			"

												This game is absolutely horrendous. I really want to like it, but frankly, there's nothing to like. The game has two aspects: townbuilding and combat. Ultimately, though, it's all about combat; the townbuilding is just there to facilitate your armies.That's unfortunate, because the combat is terrible, and here's why:- Controls are clunky. - Pathfinding is abysmal- Units will barely move in formation- Archers will only fire if the enemy is coming from a certain direction- Units can move off the map, killing them- Bad pathfinding and inconsiderate level design mean that this will happen repeatedly!- Units get hungry (which is pretty cool), but when you supply a troop the hungry unitss aren't prioritised, so they starve to death while their well-fed friends are getting stuffed with sausages.The list goes on. All this is just from the first level! In fact, combat is so terrible I had to restart the combat tutorial at least four times to not get slaughtered.If you like townbuiling with a little bit of combat, try Caesar or CivCity: Rome; if you like the peasant-and-pike combat, with a bit of town management on the side, play Stronghold. Either way, save yourself the ragequit and don't buy this.			"

												I remembered this game as a kid and not being able to figure out how to play it. I tried to play it like an RTS but really its more a sim. Its not a very fun one. Everything is very very slow and the tutorials aren't great at explaining much about how the econmy works and it appears to be glitched with people standing arround or building not working when they clearly have wht they need to get the job done. the combat should feel deep and very strategic but your units are sluggish and trip each other up making positioning an utter nightmare that can quickly cause you to lose instantly. I bought it for less than a dollar and I still feel cheated. Novel idea to combine the city sim and RTS genres, but bith sides of game are just bad.			"

												This was probably a great game 20 years ago.It has not aged well.Building anything feels like a lifetime while your serfs bump into each other trying to deliver materials. Admittedly, I only played the tutorial, but in boredom, I sent a lone squad of militia toward the enemy.  Three minutes later, after taking out their archers, the AI sent another squad of archers at my militia and didn't fire a single arrow, they just kept bumping into my militia, I guess trying to reposition while they got slaughtered by the remnants of my melee squad.

												The only reason to buy this game is if you played it as a kid and have fond memories of it. There's nothing it does that the original Stronghold doesn't do better. And faster- your units (including peasants) move extremely slowly, and builders must walk the entire way around the building multiple times during construction, which gets old -fast-.For a dollar it's an alright buy, but if you like medieval sims Stronghold or Lords of the Realm II are better.

												I purchased this game because I had a 90% off coupon and when I saw the screenshots it reminded me of the original Warcraft game, which I loved.  Being familiar with RTS I decided to skip the tutorials and jump straight into the game, which was a huge mistake because I couldn't figure anything out on my own.  Part of the issue was there was no way to tell what you had selected.  Most games will highlight or box the unit or building that you have selected so if you have multiple units or buildings of the same type you know which one you've selected.  Also useful for when the units get closely bunched so you know you've selected the correct one.  After quiting the main campaign and going into the tutorials I was still confused about several key points.  First, I didn't see anywhere in the tutorial that told you the ""sign post"" of a building had to be connected to the road instead of any portion of the building (as was true in Warcraft 1).  This led to frustration as I had half a building constructed and a bunch of laborers sitting around doing nothing because the road didn't touch the right part of the building.  It didn't seem possible to rotate the building to change where the sign post was.  It was also offputting that laborers and serfs aren't rolled into one job.  Having a laborer wait at a build site because he didn't have materials was disappointing, especially if the build site was right by the storehouse.  I feel as if the combat tutorial was also far to short for the complexity of controlling combat units.  It would have been nice to include the paper-rock-scissors hierarchy of which units are strong against each other.  It was hinted at by telling you to attack certain units with a specific unit type but I believe there were only two instances of this.  There was also no explanation for how to train additional combat units.  It took a bit of playing around to figure out that you had to train a recruit at the schoolhouse then train him into the appropriate class at the barracks, but only if you have the appropriate equipment.  Another thing missing from the tutorial was facing and lines.The combat in general also seemed somewhat clunky.  In the combat tutorial I had units charge past the enemy archers I was trying to attack, taking heavy casualties while they essentially encircled the enemy.  I also had a line of archers, facing forward, not auto-attack a lone enemy unit as he walked right up to them and slaughtered half the line.  It's not bad to have a lot of options and depth in combat but units should also use common sense.Overall, this game appeals to people that like to micromanage, and could be good if it had a little bit of tweaking.  If you're looking for fast action this is not the game for you.			"

												I liked this game as a kid. I finished the whole campaign and found it pretty fun. However, playing it again a few years later gives me a different view on this game. The city/base building aspect is still enjoyable. It takes too long though. I played the tutorial for about an hour before I finished it because everything took ages to build, grow, produce, etc. And then there are the horrible unit controls. Combat is a major hassle because of these. I cannot really recommend playing this anymore.			"

It's just not enough for me, even for a strategy game from the 1990 and somethings. The gameplay is too clunky, the soundtrack is worse than horrible, and the graphics... well I could give it a break there, considering its age, but that isn't enough for the price they ask.			"

												'Knights and Merchants' provides the greatest gaming experience of 2049. Featuring visually pleasing character models, terrain and atmosphere. All powered by one of the most powerful game engines to date. It is the ultimate MMORPG / MOBA crossover.ProsThe planes have very smooth controls and the physics engine allows for a great simulation of 9/11 almost as if you were there! All animals are mountable and tamable. The level cap is enough for a fun time and the amount of Champions keep you busy for hours. The maps are exciting to play on and all feature different types of Levelution. ConsThere isn't too many skills and the nexus can be easily destroyed making the match go by pretty fast. The anti-cheat security is very poor and allows many hackers to ruin the game. Way too many DLC content, making the game pay-to-win.OverallThe game is worth the money and anyone should try it. Before I bought this game I was a loser. Now I have truly experienced real gaming.Thank you.			"

												This game is so boring.It's games like these that make you appreciate modern real time strategy games. I understand the tags say Strategy, Medieval, Simulation, and City Builder, but it felt like a RTS. Modern real time strategy games have much better UIs, with less clutter, and more easily identifiable units/buildings. They also tend to give you more information about what your choices will lead to.This game grants you almost none of that. It has a very poor UI, with a lack of easily identifiable information, like what each unit or building ultimately leads to. If you are a newcomer to the game, good luck. I can't comment on the graphics too much, as this seems to be a very old game, but even still, they're not that great.The game is extremely slow paced. There are many different units and buildings to place, and I can't help but feel like less would be so much more in this game. I figured the serf would fill multiple different roles, but no, you have to build a schoolhouse to train the different types of workers. This is a convenience of modern RTS games, where you just have a one size fits all worker unit. This game affords you no such convenience. You also cannot command the serfs individually.I honestly could not sit through very much of this game. It's just so boring, with a high barrier of entry. Taking the time to learn every unit, and everything that each building does is too much for such an old, obsolete game. There's nothing to be had here, except maybe nostalgia for those that played this many years ago.			"

												This game is a tragedy.  I remember playing it back in the 90s and having a blast with it.  Back in the day, I would have rated it 10 out of 10 for fun and replayability.But as time went by and  machines got faster and sound cards went in new directions, the game sped up to the point you couldn't play the game anymore.Then I saw it on Steam, and it looked like those issues had been compensated for.  I was so happy...Unfortunately, even with Steam slowing down the pc so that the game is playable and doing minor fixes, the software just still isn't there to support modern graphics and sound.  As a result, the game crashes HARD every 5 to 10 minutes, requiring a complete system reboot (turn your power off and on again).I really liked this game, but I can't recommend it to anyone.			"

												Knights and Merchants là một game chiến thuật thời gian thực mà đối với hầu hết game thủ, đó là tuổi thơ dữ dội mà họ đã từng trải qua. Phần chính của trò chơi là phần chiến dịch, có tất cả 20 màn. Game có vẻ khó khi mới bắt đầu, nhưng một khi bạn đã hiểu rõ về gameplay, bạn sẽ thấy nó cực kì dễ dàng. Hầu hết các màn chơi trong game đều bắt đầu từ việc xây dựng một thị trấn, rồi sau đó huấn luyện quân đội và tiêu diệt kẻ thù. Tuy nhiên, có vài màn chơi chỉ cho bạn một số binh lính, bắt buộc bạn phải suy nghĩ chiến thuật để phòng thủ, hoặc tấn công một kẻ thù nào đó. Những màn chơi như vậy sẽ giúp bạn học được cách đánh thắng kè thù đông hơn mình gấp 2-3 lần. Trong suốt quá trình chơi game, những công trình mới sẽ được mở khóa dần dần, thêm vào đó là những đơn vị lính, hàng hóa mới. Thông thường, kẻ địch sẽ hiện đại hơn bạn một chút, tức là có trước những công trình mà bạn chưa mở khóa được. Nhưng đừng lo, hãy chứng tỏ mình là một pro gamer và đánh bại kẻ thù bằng những chiến thuật mang lại vinh quang cho bạn. Phần kinh tế trong game được làm khá chi tiết mà tôi chắc chắn rằng, kô có một game chiến thuật thời gian thực nào khác có thể tái hiện giống như Knights and Merchants. Ví dụ như bạn muốn có bánh mì, bạn cần phải có một nông trại thu hoạch lúa mì, rồi sau đó chuyển lúa đến một công trình khác để làm ra bột mì, và cuối cùng bột mì được chuyển đến những lò nướng bánh để cho ra một chiếc bánh mì. Thật chân thực phải kô? Vì vậy, để có một người lính thật kô đơn giản như những game RTS khác. Bạn sẽ cần sản xuất ra những trang bị riêng cho những người lính. Đơn vị lính mạnh nhất, knight sẽ cần một thanh kiếm, một chiếc áo giáp sắt, một chiếc khiên dài và một con ngựa. Để sản suất ngần ấy trang bị sẽ tốn khá nhiều thời gian khiến việc có một đội quân lớn không hề dễ chút nào. Mọi đơn vị quân trong game đều cần phải ăn. Bạn có thể kiểm tra đơn vị quân ấy có cần ăn hay không bằng cách nhấn vào đơn vị ấy. Thông thường, những đơn vị dân sẽ tự động tìm một nhà hàng để ăn. Có tất cả 4 loại thức ăn, đó là: bánh mì, xúc xích, rượu nho và cá. Những đơn vị lính thì khác, họ sẽ cần những nông nô giúp đem thức ăn tới mỗi khi họ đói. Bạn có thể lợi dụng điều này để tấn công kẻ thù trong lúc binh lính đang bị phá vỡ đội hình khi đang ăn. Hệ thống chiến đầu của game có một lỗ hổng khá lớn. Ví dụ như việc di chuyển lính một quãng đường dài sẽ khiến đội hình bị phá. Bạn chỉ có thể điều khiển một đội lính một lúc, điều này gây ít nhiều khó khăn trong việc điều khiển binh lính. Nếu như binh lính của bạn di chuyển đến gần kẻ địch, hai bên sẽ đánh nhau và bạn sẽ mất quyền điều khiển chúng cho đến khi một trong hai bên chết hết, và bạn không thể ngăn được chúng đánh nhau một khi nó đã bắt đầu. Điều cuối cùng là nếu lính của bạn đói khi đang chiến đấu, lính sẽ chết dần cho đến khi được ăn. Tuy nhiên, cũng có vài mặt tốt trong hệ thống chiến đấu của game. Hầu hết các đơn vị lính đều có những ưu nhược điểm khắc chế lẫn nhau khiến game rất cân bằng. Pikemen là lính sử dụng giáo, khắc chế kị binh như Knights. Archers cần phải được bảo vệ bởi bộ binh vì Archers không có khả năng chống lại những bộ binh khác. Âm thanh trong game cũng rất xuất sắc. Bạn có thể nghe thấy tiếng chặt cây của tiều phu, hay tiếng thợ mộc đang tạo ra những vũ khí phục vụ cho quân đội. Thêm vào đó là 20 bản nhạc nền thú vị. Tất cả tạo nên những âm thanh sống động như thể bạn đang sống trong thế giới trung cổ vậy. Tóm lại, đây là một trò chơi gắn liền với tuổi thơ của khá nhiều game thủ, trở thành huyền thoại trong dòng game chiến thuật. Nếu bạn muốn nhớ lại một phần kí ức, sao không thử download và chơi game ngay nhỉ? Đó là một ý kiến không tồi chút nào!			"

They just keep coming and you will never win. No level of difficulty and bugs. Everything that comes from steam is bugged so don't be surprised. For some reason, your forces are weaker at all time and your troops don't always follow your orders. That's part of the many bugs of this program. who ever made that game should comit suicide because he is an incompetent. Who ever gave a good review for this game used cheats.			"

												Do not buy.I'm the kind of guy who likes this kind of game. I also don't mind it being made in 1992 (I assume from the quality). That being said, this game isn't worth 3.3 hours of my life nor the money I spent on it. Pros:It made me want to play Gnomoria and AOEII.Cons:Everytime I launch the game it opens a browser window that goes to some raven game on steam. wtf?It takes a crap ton of time to do anything. ie over an hour just to get the only source of meat going.There is nothing in the game related to merchants or trading as far as I can tell.Every building has to be connected to a road and cannot be rotated, so your town is just a bunch of j shaped roads because all the buildings face down.Units cannot pass through one another and every time they meet they stop and both units try to find an open spot to go, Just try feeding all of your military units at once. I dare you.You have to feed your military units manually. Again, give it a try.Laborers will be working and will need materials in a moment, but no one will do anything until the labor stops working to wait for materials.Oh, oh, I almost forgot; after spending like two hours building all of the supply chains and buildings to make a barracks.. The game crashed! Awesome!Don't think this game was very good back in the day either. "

												This game is slow. Not slow to run, but slow to play. It takes some serious time to get anything done. Path finding is not so great and AI is pretty bad - I can walk by enemy troops to attack their base without them really doing anything to stop me. The enemy is programmed to get troops they don't actually have the resources to build which is really frustrating. Not really as ""Historical"" as I would have liked.			"

												When I first started up a mission, I had a nostalgia trip as it looked so much like Warcraft II, but after I finished the tutorials, I quickly got disgruntled with it. There is very little actual story, just about two paragraphs at the start briefly explaining why you`re at this particular battle, and no objective other than to completely destroy the enemy (which you aren`t even told). There is only one defensive building which has an incredibly short range, and quite a few buildings you aren`t told how they even work. I realize this is from`98, but c`mon! Might and Magic was far more rich in story, and Command & Conquer vastly more complex while being playable.The non-HD version also hurt my eyes, and I still play Age of Empires II. Don`t buy unless on sale AND you remember playing it. 3/10			"

												The game is older and for me it is missing too many things that I have come to expect.  Being able to drag the mouse to select units, being able to select multiple units, the select unit/building being highlighted.In addition it is frustrating to me to not be able to have a little more control over units.  For example if one unit in a company gets in a fight (maybe he took a different path than the others)  all of your units move to engage.  And you can't cancel it.There is also no unit progression which I really like.The game was probalby great in its day, and playing a few levels had some nastalgia, but it does not hold my attention.

												I'm glad I got this for free, because it's terrible. I do enjoy real-time strategy games, but this is not enjoyable at all. The tutorials don't give you any information on how to play, not that I need a tutorial to teach me how to play RTS's at this point, the only edition that works properly is the HD edition, the graphics are cartoony and just gross, and the first campaign mission thing just throws you into a battle without even telling you whether you're red or yellow and leaves you with no way to command whichever force is yours.And it's definitely not a matter of being ""too young"" because my favourite RTS's are Age of Empires 2 and Warcraft 2. I don't recommend you even bother obtaining the free key, honestly.			"

The combat section is especially poorly done, The words ""strategy"" and ""tactics"" are simply meaningless in this game, never mind what the manual claims.  More appropriate words would be chaos and stupidity. Also, you have to constantly feed your troops, one at a time, so feel free to add the words ""Chow Time"" which is what your troops do 80% of the time.  "

												Perfect as it's presented. It's amazing to build proper paths for the townsfolk to travel, like circuits of busy workers moving from building to building as you progress. The landscape is pretty as the grid of earth bends to hills and valleys, looking much more natural than most games.But one thing ruins the whole game: The atrocious AI.It's iritating to see workers pile up out of the schoolhouse and be completely useless until their hunger dislodges them towards the nearest inn, and only then will they start working. Townsfolk will collide when meeting on the paths and wildly spin off until their AI gets righted. And soldiers, in probably the most frustrating example, charge the enemy in a single. file. line. The enemy bowmen laughably pick them off one by one like target practice, and because of this not a single mission feels completable.			"

												This game is really hard to judge. There is a good part and a bad part to this game. First let's start with the good. The city building. It is great! It's practically a God game! Watching your town expand as you give small commands is a really great feeling, and relaxes you as well! It is fun to build your town, and collect supplies even. But now we must go to the bad part of this game. The combat... The AI in this game feels extremely broken. For example: I set up an army of archers and catapults as an ambush. I was going to send some scouts to attack the enemy archers and send some of my archers to draw them into the ambush. The scouts dropped everything they were doing when being shot at. Not to mention forced my archers to move to the front where they were killed. I recommend this game if you're looking for a great medieval city builder! But as for combat. I'd say restart a level if you reached that point. (Oh yes, also enemies do not fight each other even if you get them right next to each other)			"

												First time I played this game was in a demo back in 98 (was 10 years old back then) when the game was just released.  The demo came from some PC magazine that had discs full of other demos.  I was addicted, even though I sucked at RTS games.  With it being a demo, campaign was very short, had little to no tutorial and some buildings were unavailable.At around 13-14, I remembered this game but couldn't find the demo nor remembered it's name.  I would always bike to Gamestop just to see if I can find the game and remember but it was never found.  Then finally at the age of 19, I found a retail copy of this game and finally remembered the game's name.  I couldn't believe it and picked it up.  A couple years later and it's on Steam!It plays completely the same and there was even an expansion that I didn't know about.  Played for a few hours and it just brought back many memories of this game.  Still harder than Age of Empires.			"

												Knights and Merchants is a lovely game from the 90's! It's a RTS, just like Age Of Empires, but way much difficult than AOE. Why? Because it's too unnecessarily realistic. If your troops need food (i.e. bread), you need  farm wheat, process it to make flour and finally make the bread. Thus, there's an arduous process behind every single item that must be done.That's why KAM is so magnificently wonderful! ٩(o´  ▽  `o)۶ ♥			"

												This game is really hard to judge. There is a good part and a bad part to this game. First let's start with the good. The city building. It is great! It's practically a God game! Watching your town expand as you give small commands is a really great feeling, and relaxes you as well! It is fun to build your town, and collect supplies even. But now we must go to the bad part of this game. The combat... The AI in this game feels extremely broken. For example: I set up an army of archers and catapults as an ambush. I was going to send some scouts to attack the enemy archers and send some of my archers to draw them into the ambush. The scouts dropped everything they were doing when being shot at. Not to mention forced my archers to move to the front where they were killed. I recommend this game if you're looking for a great medieval city builder! But as for combat. I'd say restart a level if you reached that point. (Oh yes, also enemies do not fight each other even if you get them right next to each other)			"

												I just started to play this game, and the first thing I have to bring up is this game is a big learning curve. There is a tutorial that explains the basics, but when in game you'll find yourself stranded when all your men start to starve because the lack of food. I so far have played 8 hours and I'm still learning things. I love this game for the fact that it's very simple, but at the same time you have a lot of challenges to overcome and learn how to adapt. It hooks you in and you will see the hours go by as you try to perfect your starting strategy. This game may be very old and maybe even dated, but I think it's a great game that anyone can play. It's also an easy game to run on almost any computer, so there is no need to have a high end  graphics card. I recommend this to anyone getting into pc gaming or anyone who has a lot of time to kill and enjoys a challenge!			"

												A classic strategy game that I bought years ago and now on steam. Its beautiful soundtracks capture the medieval feel of the game(though why the old soundtracks were replaced is beyond me). You have to boost your ecomony in order to muster your forces and even then u still have to supply them with food. There is a simile regarding this in-game mechanic that reflects real-life.

												Knights and Merchants is a lovely game from the 90's! It's a RTS, just like Age Of Empires, but way much difficult than AOE. Why? Because it's too unnecessarily realistic. If your troops need food (i.e. bread), you need  farm wheat, process it to make flour and finally make the bread. Thus, there's an arduous process behind every single item that must be done.That's why KAM is so magnificently wonderful! ٩(o´  ▽  `o)۶ ♥			"

												The game itself is quite nice, and has the ""medieval touch"" in it. I'd recoomend this game for older players that enjoy strategy games. It lacks a bit of features but it doesn't ruin the gameplay tough. I'd grab this game if you like Medieval games, especially strategy. I didn't play it a lot, but tried it and im enjoying the first minutes.			"

												I first started playing this game back when Windows 95 was the dominant operating system, this is one of the hardest strategy games i've ever played. some missions with the right strategy can be beaten in the first 10 minutes, but if you make the slightest mistake with your starting troops you could be in for a 3-5 hour battle.  everything you do matters, your town layout, how much roads you put between buildings army composition, if you fed them before battle, all effect the outcome. you won't see this level of difficulty in most modern RTS games. the game is easy to learn, but difficult to master.

												A truly boring game with little purpose. The AI is terrible, the economy a pain, and it takes absolutely forever to do anything. Don't expect to keep your attention long enough to actually beat a skirmish mission. You also can't play to build gigantic towns. If you do, your town will eventually choke on its own size and your units will get confused and die of starvation (think Oregon Trail sort of impossible gameplay).If you like slllloooowwww RTS games with a hint of sandbox, give it a shot. It's great for when you just want relax and burn time while not really going anywhere.I've played for 30 or something hours and I haven't beaten more than a couple of missions (and never a skirmish).If there was a middle ground between recommending and not recommending this game, I would select that. It is a very niche market.The graphics and voices are pretty good for their time, though.			"

												The game has two elements: town building and combat. The process of town building is virtually identical to town building in The Settlers II. You must build a variety of special purpose buildings, then connect them with roads so that your peasants can transport goods and materials back and forth over your burgeoning kingdom.Combat: Your primary goal, after all, is the military conquest of the lost provinces. In order to build up a powerful army, you need to assemble ax fighters, pikemen, archers, and a variety of other potent troops. These units can be trained in your castle, so long as you have the recruits, the weapons, and the armor necessary for the desired unit type. Once trained, you can group like units, move them about, and change their facing and formation.			"

												9/10 - This classic strategy was remade to HD, which also improved the performance and the game is smoother than older version. The game itself gives you the storyline set in England. I can not tell anything bad at this game as it was my most favourite game in childhood and though this new HD version has got a bug with rotating the army, I can manage to turn them otherwise. I know a lot about this game so I simply recommend this game to everyone who likes solid strategic game.You can build the infrastructure, your own army and some missions are pretty challenging and at the end rewarding. But enemy AI is sometimes very stupid. Your own units will be stuck when the city is crowded so you must think in front. Make gaps between buildings, roads. Set inn at the corner of the town, castle outside the town. Do not forget to supply your people with lots of food and you can raise great armies. You can also download map and mission editors which are functional.I could play multiplayer only with legal game (you download KaM Remake), that is why I bought it and since then I admire the game even further. Playing against other players is more challanging.			"

												It is a nice classic game, actually, that has some really good management strategy to make. You have to buld a lot of constructions essential for your empire. You also have to ""build"" specific units, like a baker, so they can manage these buildings. This simple fact is pretty nice, actually, seing the units doing their job. The units also have to eat. A nice factor, but can be a bit irritating sometimes by a simple fact. This game is pretty slow. Your units move at a pace not really good and they are kinda dumb, getting a bit stuck sometimes. They just simply fail to be quicker. This is most the constructor and the serf unit, specially the lattest, which can be pretty dumb. Also, the food goes to your units one by one. Bread by bread. I kinda get it that it must be necessary in a latter state of the game, so you can get the gist of what is happening in the game, but at the first stages it is pretty bad.But the game is cool, it actually looks cool also, for a cheapier price it may be a pretty good game to buy and immerse yourself into for a time.

												I used to love this game when I was a kid. The pace of the game is rather slow (untill you discover you can increase the game speed!) but I like that. I really takes quite some time to build a little town and gather an army. Obviously the graphics are outdated by now, but the gameplay still stands as strong as ever. Maybe it's nostalgia talking, but I got goosebumps first time I booted this game again!			"

												This game reminds me of my childhood, and although it isn't the best strategy game ever made, it is worth a try, specially on sale.Gameplay mechanics is different from everything I've played, from the roads you have to build so you can expand your city to the annoying need to regularly feed your troops (AI is horrible).Unique is the best word to describe this gorgeous, inventive, classic game.

												Guys, the game is very very good, ESPECIALLY after applying KaM Remake mod (it's unofficial but makes the game much, MUCH better). "

												The game is quite time-consuming but it's worth a lot. K&M has simple and decent graphic but well-designed storyline. Plus I love how you have to plan your natural and human resources, build an army and deploy them efficiently to fight your strong enemies.I was kind of surprise when I can buy this game on Steam. I had played this game quite a long time ago and it reminds me of my childhood with my older brother (we played this game together).			"

												Simply one of the best RTS games ever. It might look incredibly old if you never played it before, but it holds the essence every strategy game should have.Get KAM Remake and enjoy the game without problems on up-to-date hardware and play it with your friends, there are interesting and quality fan-made coop campaigns out there!

												This will always be a favorite of mine. I've been playing it since I first got the German disc around 15 years ago. It's nice to be playing in English and have additonal missions and features. As always, this game contains so many glitches that will sometimes make gameplay impossible and you just have to restart the mission. I can't even play The Peasant's Rebellion because of a major glitch in the first mission. However, other people seemed to have gotten past this. Overall, it's a really fun game whether it's building the town and supplies as efficiently as possible, or going to war. For me, it's so much less of a war game than about maximizing efficiency and strategy. I'm a girl and I don't really like any other typically male game. Also, my play time is definitely not accurate considering I've also downloaded from GOG and play from another steam account.			"

												I only reccomend this game to THE PEOPLE that had played the game previously. Mind that if you are used to modern RTS games, this game might be a bit.. clunky for you. But it's still a good choice if you're looking for nostalgia, especially with some deals during sales.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Medieval strategy game.Interface/Menu/SettingsMax Screen resolution is 1024x768. unless you took the HD Version in the menu.No main menu options.Multiplayer is IP BASED.It has 2 Campaigns and a tutorial.About the game.You are playing in the medieval age and you are fighting against the AI in each campaign mission. You will have to construct different kind of buildings, Like a farm, Weapon workshop, Guard Tower, blacksmith, Mines, Castle, Store house and many many more. You will have to build up a food economy to sustain your workers and army. Your workers and army units have a hunger bar which means they will eventually die from starvations if there are no food around. Workers that are working inside of a building will no longer continue with their work until they are fed. Which could lead to problems if they have an important role. You will have to get resources from the Role-workers. Some resources are raw while others are needed to make something bigger. Has Ingame options.Game is easy to understand. Ai Usually gives you enough time.Decent graphics for this old-timer.Army and workers has a hunger bar and they are able to die from starvation.Has a save and load game with multiple save slots.Each campaign has like 20 missions.Medieval Relaxing Music. (The original ones were alot better).Game is pretty addictive and relaxing.Other things.Computer Ai usually have Unlimited supplies in their storehouse.The music isn't the same as back then from the 1990s, i dislike this and the original KAM music was alot better and not this remixed/replaced version.There are a skirmish kind of maps to play on but the maps will never change or rotate so they are always the same. There are a couple of Skirmish Maps to play, You will just a play a single map and once that has been completed you will go back to the main menu. There are no such thing as ""advancements"" through levels.I have truly enjoyed this game back in the 90th's. I have started to play this game around when i was around 14 years old. Sadly the steam version is causing crashes and other freezes which is making the game unplayable.-------------------I Give this game a 6/10 (it's 9 in general, 6 is the steam version of KAM)			"

												One of the best RTS game ever made. The building/strategy game is awesome, you need to take care of everything (even small things like roads and building position matter!). The fight system could be improved, but still one of the RTS masterpiece			"
