												I would say 50% strategy, 50% luck. Which for a board game that's pretty good. + good music. + the AI is not faceroll easy, but also doesn't cheat+ I didn't feel like I didn't have control. You do feel like you have choices and that your choices matter. The game doesn't play itself for you.+ the ability to play against other real life people :)- would like the ability to skip AI's turns. The AI in comparrison to other games is quite quick, but if you're playing a 5 quest match with 3 AI opponents it drags out.Enjoying the game and would recommend it to anyone that likes board games :)			"

												This recommendation is conditional.  If you were interested in getting the physical board game, as I was, I would definitely recommend this as it could save you $60 if you decide that it's not for you.  Another condition is to have friends you could play this with if you don't plan on getting the physical game.  If you do not meet either of these conditions, then this game gets a little hard to recommend at the moment.  The AI is fairly stupid which, for the first game or 2, is fine.  But after 1 game for me, I was able to face-roll the AI.  I think I won by almost 45 victory points.  It's always possible that the devs could improve the AI.  But as of right now, that's where other people would come in to play.  Ultimately, this game was fun enough to convinced me to buy the physical game, but I can't imagine playing too many more games against the AI.			"

												I would have liked to give this game a good review but I cannot. The singleplayer AI is absolutely horrible so offline mode isn't any fun after you learn the game. Online is horribly unbalanced due to Triss being able to teleport around acquiring 2 leads per turn compared to the other characters 1, thus completing the quests 2x as fast as the other characters. Every 3 game match I get into with a halfway decent triss player completes the third quest in 14-20 turns while everyone else is finsihing their first or getting onto their second. This would be an easy fix to simply allow the teleport card to be used before travel only or limit only 1 lead from travelling per turn.Its also quite annoying how you can't directly hinder an opponent, You might draw a card randomly by chance to slightly hinder them but it's nothing significant and will likely hurt you just as much. Other than the balance and horrible AI it is a pretty fun game though			"

												This is a good realization of the board game. It is playable as hot-seat or online and may give you many hours of enjoyable experience.But there are some flaws that need to be fixed to make the game perfect:1. When a player have to do a choice, he/she can't access to the game map and/or any player hero sheet and resources including his/her own. This may easily lead to wrong decisions and waste fun. The board game is obviously free from this limitation. So, the possibility to ""minimize"" the choice and take look at the game state will make the game much comfortable.2. Some choices are not clearly described. For example, Triss Merigold has a spell to look at the two top investigation cards then put one on the bottom of the deck and the other back on top. When this spell is used, the game show two cards and say to the player just ""choose one of them"". What will be happen next with the chosen card is unclear.3. The rules of the game says that proofs can't be exchanged back to leads. So, the investigation successes of a hero converted to proofs must me ""protected"" from any bad events that force the hero to spend leads. But in the computer version proofs ARE exchanged back to leads every time a hero must spend more leads than he/she have.4. The AI is wery weak, so the single-player games are dull and not enjoyable at all.5. There is no russian language, sadly to many and many russian-speaking Witcher fans.6. In network games, when a player quits at the characters selecting stage, all other players are forced to quit and try to start network game again. That allows one player to abuse many other.7. Triss ""Teleport"" spell is mightly overpowered. It allows Triss to collect two leads in a turn without any risk. I think, this is not the board game disbalance but the wrong implementation in computer game. Some other abilities with the text ""when you perform [stated action] {do something in addition}"" also work weird in the computer game.			"

												The Witcher series is known for its fantastic storytelling, interesting characters, and solid action, all of which have permeated not only the stories by Andrzej Sapkowski, but also the hugely popular video games developed by CD Projekt RED. The lore is strong, the characters are deep, and the land is lush. Now the Witcher universe has been tapped for board gaming. And in a strange, but intriguing, turn of events, the board game has been developed as a video game. Like any good adventure game, gameplay revolves around quests. In this case, each player has a distinct quest that they choose at the outset of the game. Each quest also has side-quests and goals that garner victory points. Depending on what length of game the players want, they will denote an amount of quests that need to be completed in order to trigger the end of the game. When the game ends, players will compare victory points and the player with the highest amount will win.The mechanics aren’t all that complicated, as the game mainly consists of traveling around a map and collecting clues that will turn into hard evidence and end up completing your quest upon arrival in a specific city. There is also a war track that essentially updates the monsters and obstacles in different regions. Die rolls determine victory among most challenges, with card buffs and special abilities that can modify the results. These die tests can spell the difference between taking down a prized beast and losing one of your abilities until you nurse your wounds via a rest action. Much of the gameplay is fairly reminiscent of Eldritch Horror, another Fantasy Flight game, and, unfortunately, this becomes a detriment to the Witcher theme and experience. I enjoy the mechanics of Eldritch Horror and can see how and why the designers would decide to incorporate elements of them into The Witcher, yet I feel like the implementation makes the game feel more like a checklist and less like a rousing adventure.Part of the problem lies in a misunderstanding of what makes The Witcher exciting. Take combat, for instance. I don’t think the unpredictability of die rolls makes for good Witcher battles. Geralt is wily, studious, strong, and knows a number of fighting techniques. However, in the game, it seems as if none of this matters, because it all comes down to rolling some dice and maybe playing a card or two, hoping that the battle goes well. Despite the fact that there are four characters, each with semi-distinct abilities and dice, it all feels characterless. I think this symptom stems from a very basic design misstep.The Witcher is very much a story-driven franchise that holds dear to plot development and character integrity, while weaving a tapestry of quests and events into the action. I don’t feel that weight and detail while playing this game. I feel as if the mechanics are meant to serve this notion, but they don’t cycle well together and everything feels like a series of other games that have been patched together in an attempt to make a cohesive design. There is no doubt that the game feels smooth and methodical; that there is a sense we are in a world of intrigue and danger. Yet, I couldn’t help but feel like the things I was doing didn’t really matter and the things my opponents were doing didn’t really matter and that we were all just playing semi-interactive solitaire, with a swingy vibe.I think what this game needed was a different identity from the outset, or perhaps a mechanic that took the main gameplay and made it more impactful and interesting. A campaign mode immediately comes to mind. Something which ebbs and flows and allows for a little more logic and strategy – studying monsters, utilizing specific combat strategies, and slaying them with a finer attention to unique qualities rather than hopefully getting a good combat card and some decent rolls. I really view this game as little more than a whirling dervish with very little player decision.The Witcher: Adventure game is a tough nut to crack. It’s not as if the elements to a great game aren’t there. It’s not as if there isn’t a somewhat compelling scheme. I found myself enjoying certain elements, such as seeking out the best path to completion of a quest. It’s just that everything is so distant feeling that there is difficulty being immersed and involved in the action. I suppose part of this is the natural outcome of playing a board game in a digital format, but nevertheless, I never quite felt the satisfaction of moving pieces around and developing a strategy or imagining an adventure the way I was probably supposed to.

												+ Beautiful design+ Good tutorials+ The rules are clear after a single game+ Hotseat+ Multiplayer+ Well polished (I had only 1 bug: the dice results doesn't display right away after a re-roll - you need to move a glyph)+/- All achievements are easily obtainable, if you play long enough (REALLY LONG)- The fun doesn't last long. I was bored after a few games. But maybe it's just me.- Only 4 characters and one of them is Yarpen :(Overall rating: 6/10. Nothing special. Good enough to buy with a discount. Otherwise, I don't think this game is worth the full price.			"

												Turn-based tactical board game with fascinating art and the story, based on the (finally) world-famous fantasy universe written by Andrzej Sapkowski. You have four playable characters, each with own strong and weak points. And you've got some quests to do, by travelling in the dangerous world, fighting and tricking monsters and politicians, helping and betraying other good guys around, to make a better final score for yourself.Surely, card game is looking better when you have 3 pals around, free evening and cozy place to gather. And maybe pizza to fill the list... But! Funny thing is that this Adventuring Witcher game is more suitable to the PC, than to such gatherings as a gaming party of good friends. It's a bit more on the digits side, than I'd really loved to see in my basement (or garage), when I meet my people.On the other hand, for the multiplayer little session, game feels quite alright: fast, challenging... If only a bit too cold, though, during a little amount of real interactions between players. Still, for its current price, this game is must-have - if you ever were about turn-based games where you gotta think and calculate your steps miles ahead.My mark is 8/10. Not the thing I'd take with me on the space flight to Alpha Centauri... But quite fine as a card game, a gem among many others there on Steam. And - yeah, I'm biased, as I'm really love the setting.			"

												This game seems like a top-notch digital conversion of the boardgame, so if you enjoy the physical game and want an online copy, don't hesitate to buy this.  The price is right.TLDR: The game isn't terrible but also isn't great.  There's no meaningful interaction between the various players.  Constant status ailments can become frustrating.  3/5 stars.My negative review is of the game itself.  It's a simple four-player ""collect various resources until you have the right combination to cash them in for victory points"" type of game, coupled with basic dice-based combat (versus the environment, not versus the other players).  The main problem I have with this game is that there really isn't any interaction between the different players.  For example, I might draw a card that affects all of the players, but it happens automatically, whether I want it to or not.  At no time in the game was I able to choose to influence the other players in any way, either to help them or to hurt them.  So basically it boiled down to four players, each playing a single player game on the same board.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't very enjoyable either.  I originally bought the game in the hopes that multiplayer would be fun, but considering the lack of meaningful interaction, it kind of seems pointless now.And this game is dark.  You will be negatively afflicted with status ailments every freaking turn.  Because of this, the game becomes a long, grim slog to complete your quests.  This is all very true to the witcher universe, I just don't know that it lends itself toward making a game fun.On the plus side, the artwork is fantastic.  Having read the various Witcher stories and played the excellent RPGs allowed me to appreciate the lore that is depicted in this game. "

												This is a simple but suprisingly entertaining game, made for fans of the Witcher series and who also enjoy casual board games. I'll start off by saying this: don't expect too much from this game; the system has been developed competently enough so that it offers more than an average amount of replayability, with gameplay duration lasting somewhere between 70-120mins depending on how many main quests are necessary to win the game - the number of quests to determine the victor can be chosen at the beginning of the game. However, if you are expecting the next X-Wing or Arkham Horror, you'd better look elsewhere. But if you can put such hype aside and play it for what it is: a decent board game that, if played with friends either online with this digital version, or face-to-face with the physical copy (the way I believe all board game SHOULD be played if you're able to do so) is worth your consideration. The Witcher Adventure Game is, in certain aspects, similar to Arkham Horror and Talisman - in fact to me it feels somewhat like a mish-mash of the two. Is it as good as Arkham Horror? In my opinion, no; Is it better than Talisman - if judging Talisman without all the expansions and basing the comparison simply on the base game itself - yes, to me at least it made for a more enjoyable experience, both online and face-to-face with the physical copy. In terms of gameplay; it's kind of a mish-mash of Arkham Horror and Talisman, so, like I said, this game has a level of spontaneity, with random spikes of difficulty throughout the game - but it makes for an interesting story as you're playing. Taking into consideration all the different events (foul events and good fortune), monsters (leveled as bronze - easy, silver - medium, and gold - hard) and the war track, it really isn't suprising how you might find yourself at the bottom of the pack if hit with too many unlucky cards a few turns in a row; but if you play it smart you generally defy the odds and hold out for these few 'bad' turns and bring yourself back into contention for first place. The characters are pretty well balanced. Having played with all but Triss, I've yet to find anything overpowering or game-breaking with any of the four playable characters. Each have their own pros and cons - not that I'll spoil their abilities; learning the playstyle of each character for the first time was half the fun! Last but now least, the artwork is pretty topnotch - and it should be, considering CDPR and FFG have sourced most of their material from the concepts done for the three witcher games. Overall I reckon it's worth a grab for witcher fans who also enjoy BOARD GAMES. This isn't a hard game to wrap your head around; you can learn the system within the first 10minutes; but it is enjoyable, and that, at least for me, makes it worth the buy.			"

												Pretty decent game which was ruined on the early stages of production by awful online session support. Almost all online games resulted in disconnect sooner or later. That why a lot of players were repelled. That and a poor AI. Nevertheless I still recommend this game, especially since disconnection problems were fixed. AI is still far from brilliant, but it is really much fun to play with friends. Or you can find someone to play with on the forum, because regular online is pretty low. So, if you like board games and have some friends who share your opinion - buy it.  :)			"

												Here's the thing: the gameplay is good. It's fine, it's fun. The UI is not that good but functional. There should be a tiny popup that shortly explain every single iconography in the game so we don't have to open up the rules everytime we forgot.Here's another thing: There is no reconnection feature. There's no way to resume a multiplayer session if one of the player dropped out of the game due to various connection issue. That is a huuge problem for me and my friends because without this feature we just can't see a way to finish a single session since the standard game takes quite some time to finish let alone the epic game.Despite my love of the franchise, and me being a fan of FFG boardgame in general, I have to give the digital version of Witcher the Adventure Game a thumbs down. No matter good a game is, it's worth nothing if you cannot play it to completion.			"

												Do you like The Witcher universe?  Do you like board games?  Well then you are in luck.  Game is well designed and pretty easy to pickup.  The game looks great and sounds great and takes a lot of the sound effects right from The Witcher 2.  There are built in rules in case you need to bone up on something while playing.  Playing online with friends is a snap.  The only two issues I see are you cannot adjust your sound settings at all while in a game, and if you disconnect from the game by accident it is not possible to rejoin, as far as I have seen.  Also I find it weird that Zoltan is not a main character you can play as.  Anyway, despite it's drawbacks it is a lot of fun!			"

												This game is surely interesting, but I spent about 2 hours to figure out what's the game about and how to play it. I've never played any game like this before and English isn't my native language. I wish they could make step by step explanation during your first game play. Not just tons of plain text instruction in a discrete ""RULE"" section and boring videos. These game is nothing like Hearthstone, but rather resemble to those DND adventure card games ( just guessing). All your planning can be futile if you had a bad stroke of chance in the throwing of the dices.Pro: - Mac Version is suprisingly well optimized.- Great music. Ps. there are some BGM taken directly from Witcher 3, love them.- Combine fortune and tactic.- Massive amount of cards with great art design.- Non-repetitive gaming experience.(At least for some solid time)- It's The Witcher Series.- Since this is CDP's product, I'm hoping more of free updates on the content of the game.Con:- You can't optimize the AI's speed. It's either too quick for some people to understand or too slow for some people to tolerate.- Personally I think AI only speed up the game progress, it add nothing to the fun but reduce it. I recommend that you play all roles by yourself or play it online.			"

												Oh my! I just bought this game at a 70 % discount and I think that must be the best Steam buy I have ever done!For fans of the Witcher games and books, this game is a must have! Here you get to experience other sides of Geralt of Rivia and his stories, in a distinctly different fasion than the other computer games. The characters, lore and combat tactics from the Witcher universe is well adapted into this pc version of a boardgame! I love the strategical elements, and it is a lot of fun to fulfill quests, travel the map, prepare for big battles by healing up, developing Sign cards and brewing potions, and the dice based combat is exciting and fun!But, after some playthroughs weaknesses in the AI choices and strategy become apparent, and the replay value suffers somewhat from that. - A good game to relax with after some intense hours of playing The Witcher 3.

In offline mode, if you play with more than 1 PC AI, they tend to help eachother more than you. I've gone like 20 turns and they still haven't done my first support quest, yet I've done at least 2 of each of theirs. Also the tutorial SUCKS. It doesn't teach you a damn thing. It's just a bunch of videos you sit there and watch. Needs to have a tutorial that's hands on and actually teaches you what to do, not require you to go and googe/youtube how to play the game.			"

												A faithful recreation of the actual board game. If you're a Witcher fan, and enjoy good objective based board games, this is definitely one to grab.Gameplay itself is straightforward, but there's a lot of depth and strategy involved. Deciding which quests to go after, weighing the difficulty of completing them against the points they award. Choosing what path to take, what upgrades to go for, as well as when you work with other players or to focus on yourself.It makes for a great game to sit down with friends with. Highly recommended.

												I have played a few decent matches of this game with friends. The game is stylishly beautiful, full of twists and turns, tearing hair out and laughing at your friend's pain. There are flaws in this though that need to be mentioned. There are four characters, each with their own playstyle. The issue is Geralt has an unfair advantage in combat and pretty much indestructable, whilst Dandelion is less powerful and can only spend money to progress and can lose badly against every monster. The game is mainly luck oriented, but keeps the suspense.A game breaking bug that may or may not be intentional: once the quest objective is reached, each other player should have another turn to potentially finish their own quests and surpass the winner to win themselves. Instead though, it finishes the round which could skip the last person and cost them a potential win. This happened to me. I lost by 2 points. No big deal, but something to consider.Overall, i do recommend the game as it is a fun, unique adventure with friends, but expect it to be annoying for those with bad luck.			"

												Reminds me the old Magic game cards, thought i was not fond of it.Being a fan of the Witcher franchise, i decided to to try it, the game being cheap and discounted.The first game makes you pretty much understand how to play, by the second time you own easily the AI in offline mode.It's really well done, having a lot of quests, bonus and minuses effects, powers and potions etc, and the lore is well represented. But it's gonna be pretty much repetitive once you played it for a while. The big problem is, the AI is so bad that the only interesting purpose of this game is to play it with friends or online. Got no friends having it (check), and it's taking a hell of a long time to find a match, but it's not really surprising, people wanting the Witcher universe will be playing the Witcher 3.It deserves a shot thought, if you can catch it before summer sales are over, but i will recommend it for fans of the franchise like me, or players of this kind of games.

												Enjoying the game so far. Although, I wish they'd update the game with more characters to choose from. Would love to play as Regis.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a game they can play with friends. It allows players to be engaged, hopefully sharing a mutual love for the Witcher world, and gives time to chat. Useful when you have someone you haven't seen face to face in years and lack activities you both can do together.			"

												This game is technically solid. There's good music, there's a nice atmosphere, the encounters are cool and the interaction is nearly well excecuted. It's a very well thought out board game, with minor flaws and weird 'fast travel' systems that just robs you of your money.With nearly well, I mean that the AI is A) dumb as hell, B) cheats.As for the dumbness - the AI tends to just spend all their development cards for 1 fight, while s/he should only need 1. Then there's the endless 'fast travelling' that they're doing and making things harder for themselves.Then there's the fact that they simply refuse to complete their main quest. Dandelion for example, had 6 purple proof items and kept spending gold on 1 more every time he could, while avoiding the main quest area.This didn't happen once or twice, this happens nearly every game I'm playing.As for the cheating, I'm convinced that they don't cheat with the dice rolls, but there are cards like Dijkstra's thugs, that makes you have to cash in 2 investigation tokens. Or, if they lose a fight, to hand over 1 or 2 tokens. The AI doesn't have to do this for some unexplained reason. I've also seen instances where they become 'delayed' and still perform 2 actions, while not having a good fortune card to ignore the delay.All in all, it's not a masterpiece, but deffinatly worth spending 1 hour per day for a round of fun and the price tag isn't too bad either.Here's to hoping that the patch removes these weird AI issues.****************I'm going to ADD to this review, rather than edit it with strikethrough.A new patch came out recently and fixed every single bit of gripes I had with this game. Now it's a challenge, the AI doesn't cheat with Dijkstra's Thugs, they don't derp around for an eternity and makes this game a HUGE challenge.Thanks CDRP, for listening to your customers!			"

												This is amazing. Has the book vibe. Music is great, little snips of story are also great, and the way you play can change quite a bit. It's a bit easy to beat, but then, no one forces you to do the main mission just because you already can. Oh and the art? The art <3			"

												The game itself is nice and fun but the online functionality and interface are too flawed. With matches lasting several hours it is crucial to have a means of continuing a game after a player lost his connection. Since this is currently missing I can not recommend this game. There is the option to play locally but the bot AI is rather extremely poor and won't provide much of a challenge.Bottom line: Hope for improvements or get the board game.			"

												Neat adaptation of a board game. Especially good since the board game costs about five times as much. As a PC game all of the rules are in the program. This is pretty fun. AI can run some of the characters if you want more of a challenge.I played Triss in a three quest f\game and it took awhile to figure things out but had a great time. There are tutorials as well. Game looks and playes well. Since this is based on a board game it playes rather simpistic. The cards are neat and they all have nice information on them. It is also neat that you get to choose from among several cards most of the time. I do not think this is a hard game but it is a bit of a race to score victory points. Neat game.			"

												I'd recommend this game if it is on sale (like $1 or $2.50) and play it with other friends.  Online function is virtually dead and even if you are lucky to get matched up to someone online, you are liable to get disconnected or the match forfeited easily if the other player gets upset.  In essence, stick to friends or offline play with bots.  At first, offline play may seem tough but once you understand each character, their strengths and weaknesses then the game becomes incredibly easy.  Each character (there are 4) have different playstyles and when playing against other humans, the challenging part of this game is the decisions each turn you make.  Do you decide to develop until you get a certain card?  Do you try and plow through quests as quickly as possible in hopes of making quest goal first? Etc... If you're looking for a decent time killer that is fun, get it on sale as it does play decent solo with bots.  However, the game shines with more human players.*Note* I also own the physical board game and this PC version does differ slightly.			"

												... Finally tried this game.Cannot say I am a witcher die hard fan since i only played 2/3 of witcher 1 and my pc cannot handle 2 and 3 at the moment. This game is a 4 player party game that set background in the witcher world.You choose familar witcher Gel, Hot Sexy red hair witch Trish, Dwarf that loves to gamble and drink with witcher, and that handsome bard. Each character have unique set of development(ability cards) that complete different character specific quest to race for victory point based Victory...Quite well designed.. with nice visual and repetitive music... AI player are very smart and does make it very challanging game play.Very luck based and character are not super well balanced since some character are good at fast game yet some character are great at long game.Achivements are quite a grind and will take you forever if you want to try.Still quite hard to find player to play with for this game since it's background are not very family friendly (Honstly... how many of you have 3+ other friends that love witcher games and have this small game?)My other problem of this game that.. there are not many target based action that you can do to screw other player up for better action and reaction based game play...Everything is luck based and with very few action that one player can do to the other player. (you cannot PVP or steal things from other player since everyone are heros of the witcher world).8/10.. maybe extra dlc for more cards to improve?			"

												Fun little diversion!Sadly, other than cards the other people draw that affect all players, your interaction with other players is almost nil.  Therefore when playing offline, just set AI gamespeed to x5.Teleport is totally broken, making Triss OP af.  Seriously.  Played one game, my very first one, and DOMINATED the AI as Triss.  Didn't even matter that I lost every combat, because every turn I just used teleport to gain twice as many leads as anyone else.  The only thing that will hold Triss back is if she doesn't get the Teleport spell for a long time.Despite this, it's very fun.  Get it on sale (currently 75% off!  WELL WORTH $2.50!!).  Is it worth $10?  Mmmm... if you enjoy both boardgames and the Witcher, it is.  It's a very simple, relatively fast-moving game (as long as you don't get 3 people who take forevs to make decisions).Just know that Triss WILL win.			"

												For an adaptation from a board game, this is a far cry from poor. The game's replay value is very high, and is a lot of fun to play with friends both locally and online. This game is very easy to learn, and introducing someone to the game is very quick, as short instructional videos are included in the game itself. If watching videos to learn isn't much your fancy, the game can be learned fairly easily through gameplay. The game successfully captures the darkness and the bad-to-worse story development of the Witcher literature and games, making the experience familiar and fulfilling to those familiar to the franchise while also fun to those who are not so familiar with the Witcher world. It also includes a feature allowing players to vary the length of the game by changing the number of requirements to be filled in order to achieve victory, making the game last anywhere between a twenty minute spree to a night-long affair depending upon what is desired.There are occasional bugs that crop up, such as results from dice rolls momentarily disappearing from the screen or development cards not glowing when they are usable, but such glitches are so few and far between that they do not hinder the experience much. The only other complaint worth mentioning about the game is that, to some, the experience may grow repetitive after successive playthroughs, as the gameplay is much the same from game to game. As such, many tend to take breaks in between playthroughs.I would rate this game an 8.5/10 for its fulfilling play yet repetitive nature.			"

												$3.15, an okay price for the game. This is an unfair review as I am slightly partial to CD Projekt Red's Witcher series. There are some flaws with the game design, such as multiplayer solitaire. I tried using Triss Merigold and she seemed fine. However, after playing multiple games, I've decided to vote it down, mainly due to the insane random events from dice rolling and card drawing.PROS1. Follows the Witcher SeriesVery accurate, all the main characters are inside. I was actually looking forward to using the Scoia'tael (Elves), Philippa Eilhart (Mage ♥♥♥♥♥) or Saskia (Dragoness) in the game.2. IntuitiveIt's easy to learn. I didn't play a single tutorial to be able to understand the game.CONS1. Multiplayer Solitaire *****You don't really care about any other player as none of actions matter to you. There is hardly any player interaction.2. Advanced Snakes and Ladders *****It is just personal racing like advanced Snakes and Ladders. You just roll dice and play the game on your own. 3. Random Monsters and CombatThis is so boring. The random monster generation doesn't capture the fantastic monsters that I experienced playing the Witcher 2. To defeat SINGLE monsters, you roll Swords and Shields. If you roll a sufficient amount of Swords, you kill the monster. If you roll a sufficient amount of Shields, you block its negative effect. It lacks the skilled planning and excitement that the normal Witcher game brings since it all boils down to Sword and Shield. 4. Random Bad Fortune and Investigation CardsSome just make you lose 2 VP just for drawing them and some just do nothing. The randomness is horrendous. The investigation cards are also full of negative cards called Setbacks which have no redeeming value. If you draw badly, you are screwed.SUGGESTIONS1. TrapsIf you arrive in a location, you can play a card that leaves a surprise for the next player who crosses (not land) its path. It might be a nasty surprise or a simple challenge. That way players will look at where other players are moving to.2. Learning Other Player's AbilitiesCurrently, each player has their own unique development deck. No one will care about what another player develops.Based on the abolve design, one deck will likely be superior to the others. It would be interesting to take 2-3 developments that belong to other players as your own. This could create crazy combos and make player's more interested in what the others are doing.3. Global QuestsThis will give something that everyone will fight over for VP. E.g. Save Ciri. Pay 3 Blue Leads, 3 Purple Leads and 3 Red Leads for 12 VP. Only completable once.			"

												I have never really gotten into board games but I am a massive Witcher fanboy so I decided it would probably be worth the $10 and I was correct. The game may seem daunting at first but it is very easy to pick up on and if you are still struggling, there are nice tutorial videos for you to watch.Although many reviews say that it is a 50/50 mix between luck and skill I would say that it is around 80% luck and the rest skill as you mainly depend on the role of the dice to be able to progress. I am not saying that this is a bad thing either.Here are my pros and cons for the game so far (from what I have played)Pros: - Enjoyable music that sets the mood nicely for the game - Easy to pick up on - Nice tutorials - Graphics are quite nice as well for a board game - Auto save games for later plays - Based on The Witcher - Different from majority of other board games - A little bit of The Witcher story is told through the cards etc. Cons: - Daunting at first - Games take forever although this is too be expected for a board game so not really a con - If you are unlucky, you're going to have a bad timeI will update my review later.

												For a digitized board game, The Witcher Adventure Game is pretty fun. It's a great mix of strategy and luck where you will essentially battle the game itself more than the opposing players. The object of the game is to complete objectives in as few turns as possible to collect Victory Points. Whoever has the most VP at the end of the game wins.The mechanics of the game are handled well. Battles, random events, and consequences of cards make the game tense without making it a chore. My only complaints are 1) that the computer AI is too easy overall, often seeming clueless as to what they should be doing and falling behind rapidly and 2) AI opponent turns can take forever (wait-fest). Since both of my complaints are leveled at AI opponents, you can avoid these hassles by having friends. Otherewise, 1v1 with an AI opponent is not too bad.			"

												For a digitized board game, The Witcher Adventure Game is pretty fun. It's a great mix of strategy and luck where you will essentially battle the game itself more than the opposing players. The object of the game is to complete objectives in as few turns as possible to collect Victory Points. Whoever has the most VP at the end of the game wins.The mechanics of the game are handled well. Battles, random events, and consequences of cards make the game tense without making it a chore. My only complaints are 1) that the computer AI is too easy overall, often seeming clueless as to what they should be doing and falling behind rapidly and 2) AI opponent turns can take forever (wait-fest). Since both of my complaints are leveled at AI opponents, you can avoid these hassles by having friends. Otherewise, 1v1 with an AI opponent is not too bad.			"

												Sat down with a few friends to try this out... Started the game having no clue about how it works.6 hours later, we laughed bout as much as it was humanly possible, figuring out things as we go, calling each other overpowered and broken, as we finally got to read what the quests are :) Needs a lot of work, else I do not think its going to be fun for more then 2 - 3 times, but still... I didnt have this much fun for 10 e in a looong time :D			"

												Why do I enjoy this game? For one very simple reason: it runs in the background when you alt + tab, therefore allowing one to browse the internet. The key to this trick is to listen to the audio - which, isn't half bad. Tab back over to the game and make your move when no more sounds other than music are playing. Rinse and repeat. I'm an avid board gamer, and I'd say this game is not worth owning in the flesh, but for something extra to do whilst browsing the net it is rather 'enjoyable.' I only recommend this game if it is on sale.			"

												I have read one of the witcher novels, and played the other games, and I can confidently say this game captures one aspect of Geralt perfectly:  I don't care at all what triss, dandilion, and the dwarf are doing.This is a board game, not really an adventure game.  So if you like board games turned into videogames, this is the game for you.  What games is it most like?  Beowulf and Eldritch horror.  Except there is almost zero interaction between players and there are few decisions to make.   First time playing, I skipped the tutorial and easily doubled the AI's score.			"

												This is a fun little game to play with your friends, or against yourself if you are good at shifting from one personality to another at the click of a mouse. The flavour text of the cards, the music and the look of the game board and the unique abilities of each of the characters make for good immersion that makes you feel like you are THEM and THERE.While some characters might seem totally imbalanced and unbeatable in one game, this is ultimately a game where a lot depends on luck, so you might find that that darned OP dwarf that totally pwned your poor sorceress in the last game is faring a lot less well when hordes of legendary monsters are eating his face as he is only capable of shooting (or rolling, really) blanks.One feature that would make this game more multiplayer-friendly would be a combination of local and online gameplay - say I have a friend at my house and one in another city, the two of us could play my copy of the game locally while the third person joins in online. But I'm guessing not a lot of people will be in this situation so it's a minor issue.Overall, it's a fun way to make friendships end, akin to a fantasy Monopoly.			"

												I love board games, and I love video games -- so I should love this, right? I mean, I loved Talisman... and this looks even cooler! Sadly, no. This game PRETENDS to have three equal mechanics to it (diplomacy, magic, and combat) but the only thing that really matters is combat. Game ends when any player completes a pre-set number of quests, but the person who finishes the most quests isn't the winner -- the winner is the person with the most victory points. What's the most reliable way of making victory points you ask? Why in combat of course! Every turn there is likely to be a combat, and many of the combats give VP... because of this, it is possible for the combat characters (really just Geralt, because he's the best fighter) to lap all adversaries on VP even if he doesn't come CLOSE to finishing as many quests. This game is like going to a dance contest and realizing you're also going to be judged on your attire, which is okay I guess BUT WAIT... you're ALSO going to be judged on a juggling routine... and somebody else is an expert juggler. Seriously? Keep walking.			"

												The music is exceptional, and the graphics quite vibrant; if you zoom in a bit then you can see various animations such as weather effects on the board. The game itself is a bit hard to wrap your mind around, at first; ""Leads"" and ""Proofs"" and ""War Track"" are rather abstract concepts. In addition, it lacks the direct player interaction (PvP, really) of Talisman, for example. Then again, the characters are not antagonistic.Overall, I think that as far as a digital version of a board game goes, this is a very good buy. Actually, I can't really see myself playing the tabletop version because having the computer manage all the tokens, keep track of when quests are eligible for completion etc. is just so convenient!

It is horribly boring and has no real depth; lacking in both content, character/story development and relevancy... The ""adventure"" isn't really all that different each time you play. There is no satisfaction in completing a quest, gathering ""leads"", or traveling to another person's location to ""support"" them.I'm sorry, I really am... but I got a refund for this game. It is not worth the time.No offense to anyone who enjoys it... Mebbe local multiplayer is fun, idk... but I don't recommend it.Try Infinity Wars if you're looking for a really good card-based game.

												Whilst I like the feel of the game, think the whole thing is presented well, and believe this is one of the better board game type offerings currently available, I'd suggest it's only really suitable to be played in online mode. First full game I completed, I won with a score of 64 to the AIs 21 and 2. I'd never played this board game before, so had no particular strategic approach to it (beyond the basics), so to me this is a sign of bad AI, the huge gap between my ability and theirs.Additionally, the character balance seems off. I'll probably play the game a bit more as other characters to see, but for now it seems as though the strengths of Geralt far outweigh those of any other character.So while it's a no to recommend this game, it's not an outright no... it's more a 'be aware' of what you are getting. If you want it for the online mode only, then fair enough, you'll probably enjoy it.			"

												The Witcher Adventure Game is a fun little digital board game which has a resemblance to Elder Sign.While it may look difficult and at the start also feel difficult, it's easy to learn and once you get into it you barely feel the difficulty any longer.The game has a multiplayer mode. Although it needs a lot of work.The multiplayer mode lacks a lot of key features you would connect with multiplayer. For instance, you cannot start a public multiplayer game and then invite your friends. This is a huge minus. Same goes for creating a private game. There is no way to create a private and invite a friend and then open it up to the public. So playing with friends abroad is often a challenge just to get the game started.It's a very interactive game in terms of collecting items, quests and spells and spending gold. Along the way you will face obstacles, evil monsters and other nasty things out for blood. These can at times be a little challenging and make it feel like you're being set back a little. As the game progresses, you will become stronger and stronger.The game is based around questing. Currently you can pick between doing 1, 3 or 5 quests in order to finish the game. Who ever has the most Victory Points (VP) at the end wins.The game lacks character player interacting. With the extreme weak AI it is often more beneficial to play against or with other real people, but even so it still feel like you're playing against the a slightly stronger version of the AI. It lacks some interaction elements with other players instead of an action tab where you can see their roles. While you get to see what monster they're fighting, you don't get to see the monsters strenght and benefits. This makes it a little tedious and most players just sit around and wait for their turn without really having to pay attention to what the other 1-3 players are doing.The community is a little dead and it can sometimes take a while to find other players.There's a HUGE lack of information on the forums in terms of what direction the game is going to such an extant that there's not even any sticky posts from the developers. It makes the game feel dead and when I take a look at other digital board games forums (on steam) their forums usually thrives of activity.The 4 classes you can pick between are all different in terms of play style, which is a great thing. Downside is, there's just these 4 and there are no news about them adding more.As much as I want to recommend this game to people I just simply can't.It feels dead and tedious to play and I regret not only buying a copy for myself but also gifted a copy to a friend before I knew what hassle the multiplayer would be. Along we're having random disconnect issues to deal with as well, which is not making all the bad things look any better.This is a game that you can acquire on most platforms but without cross platform, it should probably just have stayed on tablets.

												4/10 I played exactly 1 game and already encountered several bugs (especially with the dice) which were not game breaking but annoying. Don't they playtest their game before releasing?On top of that the UI has a few design flaws, for example you can't look at your cards when making a decision.The game itself is not very strategic and too much luck dependent for my taste.

												Not that great of a board game unfortunately. I like long adventure board games (such as Runebound and World Of Warcraft the Boardgame) and this was just kind of boring. Half way through the game I was just wanting the game to end and when it finally did end all I did was look to the ceiling and sigh heavily saying, ""finally!"".Some issues I specifically had:-Tutorial, it has you watch the first tutorial and that is all it tells you, next thing the game asks is if you want to play offline or online. Turns out there is like a dozen more tutorial videos in the main screen's menu though I didn't know that as it doesn't really make it easy to know.--At least the rule book you can access in game isn't that bad.-You can't tell what is going on in opponents turn. AI opponents take their turn really quickly with cards and effects happening all over the place but it still takes the 3 of them at least a minute to get through their turns, So the game might as well be single player game with 1-2 minute lag between turns because that is what it amounted to. What the opponents were doing didn't really matter other than the automated ""bad stuff"" that happens to you on the beginning of your turn from their Foul Fates and you don't have to pay attention for any--The activity log always being up on their turns would help, the monster that an opponent is fighting always being up on the left side of the battle screens would help too to know what is going on and what just happened to them. Especially on the battle results screen so I don't have to specifically try and remember what his negative effects for losing were.-SO MUCH bad stuff happening to you every turn, feels like you have no control over it because so much happens every turn.--It actually got to a point in my game where I had something like 10 turns where I was stuck unable to do anything but rest every turn from all the bad stuff I was suffering every single turn. Foul fates laying down more foul fates, wounds, deadly wounds. Foul fates from other players constantly. Monsters that have bad effects from just fighting them (more foul fates and wounds). More monsters spawning. On and on and on.-----90% of every turn was dealing with bad stuff happening from foul fates or other player's foul fates.-A few little glitchy spots where music cut out for a few minutes and sometimes the game wouldn't detect I had something I could do, had to restart the game once since it literally wouldn't let me take an action. And several times where I had a witcher sign but the game didn't think so then all of a sudden 30 seconds later it would say ""oh, you do have one, ok you can use it now"".-AI are really dumb at times, I'd see them use a spell/card that gives them more defense dice...then not use the dice and somehow fail the combat's defence section. Rather often too. I won my game but it took over 2 hours for a game that the main screen said should be 45 minutes, some of that may have been me not knowing how to best play but man is that a difference.Wouldn't recommend the game. Maybe I just had a really bad first game but it certainly wasn't no 45 minutes long 3-quest game. Second half of the game really felt like it was dragging on. And the game didn't feel much like an adventure game, you don't really power up your characer other than from development cards and those you can just get every turn without doing anything (literally the only way to get them is using an action to draw 2 keep 1), no gear from quests or looting monsters, no new powers really from leveling up type of stuff. Just spam development cards to get what powers you want then move around trying to collect a dozen investigation tokens of certain colors and hope the piles of bad stuff happening to you ever turn doesn't hinder you tooo much.And hey, I only played a single-player vs 3 AI game, maybe when playing multiplayer with actual other people it will get better. Though I worry about downtimes greatly increasing in that case.			"

												Edited 5/8/15: So, even with the rise in players due to the witcher sale i'm having an extremely hard time joining any online games. As a result of the dying/dead online community, i'm going to change the review to a not reccomend. It's still a fun board game and you CAN local co-op the game but is the solo experience worth 10 bucks? I'd say no when there are other options. I also looked at the steam charts and while the player-base has risen to 200 players, i'm still having trouble finding games. If you have friends to play with, this game may be worth the money. otherwise i advise saving the money for something else.so i just played a match against the AI as Triss and here's my detailed-revew-after-1-game for those of you that have that feeling that you just can't wait to play the game but are worried about the game being some sort of con.TL:DRThis is a fun board game and anyone that likes board games should probably pick this up and support it.The actual explaination of the game in my experience during 1 round, since the info given is kinda bare-bonesThis board game involves you playing as 1 of four characters and completing various objectives on a quest card to score points. The objectives often are either:1. go to some area and spend resources to get points2. Just go to some area and you get points3. just spend resources and get points4. go to another person and spend resources to assist them with THEIR quest and get points while they get half as many pointsIt's simple enough but what makes it difficult is the board itself and two kinds of setbacks.the first setback is drawing a misfortune card. There are 3 ways to get misfortune cards.1. An effect of another card/monster2. fast travel (moveing 2 spaces for the price of 1!!!)3, move to a space and be forced to draw a misfortune card.The misfortune cards have various effects from getting hurt, monsters and bad guys spontaneously spawning out of your rear to paying some sort of toll or even choosing between the last two options as I never really encountered the first with either of the other two.The second setback is monster cards. Monster cards are ranked from bronze, to silver, to gold, each with increasing lethality each time. Monster cards can have various, previously mentioned effects as well, but they mostly just injure you. When you're injured you're incapable of using the action that's injured until it's healed. Some cards can heal you or you can heal yourself for the cost of one of your 2 actions. some monsters can make a quest much harder to deal with, with an example being a troll that kicked the AI's butt and I conciously avoided until i got strong enough to deal with it. You fight monsters by rolling a hero die, and a number of regular dice. the hero die tends to resonate with your development cards (next paragraph) while the regular dice have either a defense, an attack, or a blank face. meet the required amount of attacks or defenses and you succeed in either attacking or defending. attacking a monster successfully takes it off the board and can possibly yeild rewards while defending averts a bad effect from taking place. Monsters need to be killed in a single roll, their damage does not stay on between turns.Speaking of getting stronger, you do so by drawing development cards. Development cards have various effects as well, in my case they alll had to do with rolling a hero die just right during combat, (i didn't encounter any development cards that ouright added the number of dice i roll or anything). you can choose, for an action, to draw 2 development cards and keep 1. Some development cards are much stronger than others and their effects seem to vary, (though as triss i only drew development cards that aided me in combat, which was lucky for me in this case, but each character has their own development cards by my understanding, though i think other characters CAN use other character's development cards. I'll edit this later if i'm wrong). Development cards need to be charged before they can be used and you can put a charge on a development card by using an action to charge it.You cannot use the same action twice on one turn.Finally i'll touch on resource gathering. you gather things called clues which come in the colors of blue, purple, and red. you get clues by either:1. moving to an area and drawing 1 clue of one of the colors on the area2. investigating for an action and drawin 1 clue of 1 of the three colors3. getting cards which boost the number of clues you get. These cards tend to happen when drawing clues and can sometimes have negative effects but often have traits which resonnate with other traits and get you lots of clues in 1 go, if you're lucky enough.There's also some war tick thing that never came into play when i used it either that or i didn't notice its effect... sooo i guess i'm lucky.I don't think i missed anything, so i'll now move on to the impression the game gave me.I enjoyed the game. somewhere along the line the whole thing started feeling very natural to me and i started making strategic decisions on where to go, which rout i should take to get to a destination, and what actions i can afford to spare preparing myself for what's to come and which actions i needed to use to collect resources or get the hell out of rivia (where the freaking harpy just landed!) Overall it's a very fun game and if you're a fan of board games i think you should get it. it's only about a day old so i haven't found a multiplayer match yet but I dabbled in the multiplayer options and i found a small chatbox on the top left of the screen, which is vital for games like this where playing the player can be just as important as playing the game.The downside to this game that i can see so far is that the tutorial consists of a bunch of videos as opposed to a hands-on experience, so that may make it just a little annoying for some people to get into it but i found that once i started playing i eventually got the hang of it.Also the visuals aren't too impressive. it's really just a board with pieces on it and some music in the background which actually bugged out on me once and just stopped. it didnt hinder the game at all, it was just less musical.I could give some arbitrary numerical score but overall i reccommend it and i definately hope a community grows around it so it can see further development.arbitrary score:pi x the square root of negative x where x is the number of sex cards available in the first game / something of slightly higher value... like actually getting laid.... dang this revew ran long, hope it was helpful...

												Pros:- great artwork and design- good music- interesting monsters- challenging gameplayCons:- the game is based too much on luck/RNG for my liking- the game mechanics are confusing and unintuitive Ultimately, I just didn't enjoy this game as much as I hoped I would. It's really hard to get where you need to go and do what you want to do. At first, this challenging gameplay was new and interesting. However, it quickly became annoying and stressful due to all the bad luck. It's not fun to struggle through the map to meet your objectives while watching the AI breeze its way through their own objectives.			"

												yeah i am the guy that played one game, went 'seen it all', and i'm out with a neg review.  there are no options to speak of so its click, read, click, read, miss the roll, click, read, die again, click... i respect the effort and genre port entirely, its just lets be honest you and your friends have 1 hour of mp gaming to play for the week -- are you going to spend that time reading, click, click, reading, miss the roll, click, remove obstacle and miss the roll again but now lose your cards, click, End Turn just to witness the other players also click, click, reading, and ending their turn.  since its a dice roll game it means who cares.  1 in 6 is 14%, just remember that.  1 hour for the week of mp pc gaming with all that is out there makes this tought to recommend.   i played for $1.50 and if someone i know gets super excited i am back but otherwise its a buy, install, play, and half an hour later figure out what you would need to do with no surprises and you're out.  talisman actually had more of a feel imho and would be a recommendation if this is your thing.  (btw, whats up with that die roll thing where the die pretends to be on the edge, shake a little then finalize the roll?)(DEV team:  in Options let me tweak colors, die types, et al?)			"

												Awful. Shame on FFG and Ignacy. The only thing worse than this game is the physical version, which I've also played; at least the digital version is faster. But anyways, this game has two of the worst traits of modern board gaming: too much randomness, and no meaningful decisions. It's always obvious where you need to go next and what you have to do for your quests...it's just a matter of whether or not the dice and the cards are kind to you. I do NOT recommend this crap at all.			"

												As far as a digital implementation of a board game, this is fairly good. It's a nice PC interface. Everything works fairly well. (The dice are a little funky, but eh... whatever).I love the Witcher series. I was excited when this game was announced. I was excited to see this game hit the store.If you you love The Witcher Adventure Game, and want a digital implementation, then stop reading and just buy it.If you haven't played The Witcher Adventure Game, let me stop you right there and say ""Don't"". Go buy Merchants of Venus, Xia: Legend of a Drift System, Steam, Merchants & Marauders, Istanbul, or even Firefly: The Game. Those are all vastly superior Pick-Up and Deliver games - which is all this is. An unnessessarily complicated, frustrating, painful, lengthy Pick-Up and Deliver game.It's a mean game. And I don't mean that in the way that Diplomacy or even Munchkin is a ""mean game"". Or even how ""Ghost Stories is brutally difficult"". I mean this game stabs you in the liver, and then deducts points from you because you're bleeding like a wimp.The designer is a wonderful designer. He also owns the game publisher ""Portal Games"". Go check out all of his other games (Robinson Crusoe, Imperial Settlers, 51st State, The New Era, Pret-a-Porter). This doesn't even measure up to the worst game I've played from Fantasy Flight.The interaction between players is awful. It's mostly a solitare experience. Which doesn't help when the game points how you don't have any friends.The turns are very repetative. Especially when the game finally gets you into the fetal position, and all it leaves you to do is to rock back and forth as you bleed from your severed ankles.Ever played Bunco? Where you just roll the dice, hoping to roll three of a kind? No agency. No decision making. Just luck of the RNG. This game wants you to roll a 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 of a kind with 3-4 dice - and that's not really an exaggeration. When when you fail, because - well - math, you take damage.Nothing good really happens to you. And when it does, like finally completing one of your quests, you STILL get punished. For a good ol' fashioned ""Good job. ♥♥♥♥ you."" - like mom use to say.The monsters seem incredibly out of balance. Rolling the dice usually seems like a wasted effort. There ARE things you HAVE to get in order to over come the dice, but those dont' seem well balanced either.This is easily one of the worst board game experiences I've had in the last few years.The only value this game has had for me is that I only spent $8 on this before foolishly spending $60 at my local game store. And for that, I'll look very favorably at it.10/10.			"

												I spent the entire time I tried to play this game in the vain attempts to learn how to play it. Let me put it to you another way. I played with another person. The turns in this game are so damn long that I started sewing whenever it wasn't my turn. I could have potentially made a sandwich and eaten it in the times it wasn't my turn to do anything. I like board games. I love The Witcher. I do not like this game.			"

												As a 4-player boardgame, this is pretty fun and a step up from Talisman. However I cannot give it a positive review because of the AI. Having any number of computer players in the game ruins it completely as the AI is terrible. The worst I have seen in any boardgame port. It almost never completes its main quest, and doesn't keep its actions clear or use its developments properly at all. It regularly ends the game with less than 10 VP. When the player wins with 80 VP and the 3 AI opponents all have less than 10, it's not a fun game.So....positive review for a 4-human game, but overall negative till they fix the AI.			"

												As much as I love the Witcher Universe, I have to be honest, I can't recommend this one.The game consists of quests, traveling and dice combat. That is the biggest no no. Dice combat.Combat should be skill based, not the result of a random dice roll.What should be dice or randomly based is traveling. Because when you travel, anything can happen, anything can make you stop. It makes sense. Very often Geralt and Triss get wounded by a drowner card. Which makes not too much sense since they are very skilled fighters. I mean it can happen but that's where the skill of the player should come in just like in the actual games. That is more fun.It is a nice idea of making The Witcher universe expand into board games, action figures, comic books and other forms of media but this board game should be analyzed further. Maybe it needs a sequel that addresses the problems on combat and travel so it can make more sense and not frustrate you.			"

												Where to begin? The game does an excellent job of creating the theme to The Witcher games. Characters, environments and monsters all give it that excellent feel that the games have. Detailed and impressive art work can be found from it's map to the monster cards. It has the look and feel of an actual board game.I've invested a few hours of the game and have played a few of the ""Complete 3 Quests"" games. The pacing of the game is alright, though a bit of downtime between turns towards the late game. Be prepared to do something in the background while you wait your turn. A signal to anounce that your turn has come would be very helpful. One major complaint I have with this game is it seems you are penialized for doing practically everything. I understand that the universe of The Witcher is a very unforgiving thing, but having to draw a fate card for almost every action (while having a fate token on an action) seems excessive. Most games I have played I have spent either trying to remove Fate tokens from my actions, or healing from wounds. I don't know if this is a major part of the game, dealing with Fate tokens, but it became more of an annoyance. The quest system works well. Having to do investigations to gain resources works well and having side quests helps along the way to acheieving your quests. Side quests can give a bit more flavour to the game and is a great way to earn some extra Victory Points. The battle system is alright, though it reminds me more of Elder Sign than anything else. Roll dice, match symbols, if you have enough, you win! If you don't! Bad stuff happens (if you don't defend).The game has a lack of save system, which I find odd. So if you're wanting to play a long game but don't have the time to invest, prepare to be disapointed or to have the game run in the background. For me, the game does a very good job of emulating a board game, but the mechanics are either ones I've played from other games, and does much better or just flat out annoy me for existing. I cannot really recommend this game.  "

												I actually haven't played The Witcher series yet but I thought the board game looked cool so I gave it a try and glad I did.   You do not have to have any type of knowledge about the series to do well in this game.  There is basically the same learning curve regardless.  You will spend the first couple of games making some mistakes (unless you do your homework) but it's really that as difficult as it looks at first glace.  Don't give up within the first 15 mins, it will all come together after a couple games.  I haven't played against random online or AI, so I cannot comment on that, however; if you have people to play with then it goes very smooth for the most part.  I disconnected once, which can be frustrating because there is no save and you lose your progress in the game.  Overall, a really fun game game to play with your friends.  Animation looks great, gameplay feels like an actual boardgame, would love to see some more games like this.  Keep in mind this game does generally take at least a couple hours to play per round and can take longer.			"

Despite that I've already put in over 11 hours into ""The Witcher Adventure Game"".This game is fun regardless of your feelings towards the rest of the franchise.So if you ever find yourself at a friend's house and feel like playing something locally, but Heroes of Might And Magic or Disciples would just take too damn long, then give this game a go.

												The game is ok, it's my kind of board game.. But.. Yeah but.. The game does not offer nothing new. Its similar to Eldrich Horror.			"

												Board game transformed into PC is exactly what you thought it would be. The best way to play it is with some friends, although it would never be as great as with actual board game. Nobody plays it online, so gather few friends around the computer and play it here. This game will mainly interest the people who like Witcher games and books, for other people it will just be board game with character, monster and places they know nothing about. I am sucker for everything Witcher related, so Yes for me.			"

												An awesome buy =D It takes a little while to get used to, and the AI is merciless while you're learning (and even when you're not :P ) . But this is a great game to play with friends. Usually I prefer the physical version of games, but there's just so many cards and tokens and things to keep track of that I'll make an exception for this one.			"

												If you're a fan of The WItcher series, or if you're looking for a turn based 'card game'. then I would recommend The Witcher Adventure Game. As stated in previous reviews, the tutorial needs work, as it does tend to gloss over some of the game mechanics. The tutorials do cover quite a few important features though, so it isn't completely redundent.If you're looking at this title hoping that it would be similar to Gwent, it isn't. It's far more involved than Gwent, and requires far more time to pick up and to play through.For it's price, it's worth picking up, and when future updates are released (hopefully expanding the tutorial and adding a few more playable characters) it should give you plenty of reasons to sink a fair amount of time into this game.TL;DR:It's not Gwent. It's a board game that most users who enjoyed The Witcher would enjoy. It takes a while to pick up and play, but it's worth it.			"

												Essentially, this is a board game RPG based on The Witcher series of games, utilizing cards and dice to determine outcomes.  The implementation is fairly simple to understand, particularly since you can play a game without any opponents.  This allows one to get a feel for the game goals, mechanics, and character abilities.  Overall, it is a fairly simple game, but for the price, is a unique game implementation.Playing against the AI tends to get old quickly, but this is a great game to play with one's children if one is an older gamer with children such as myself.  The rules are relatively easy to understand, and the implementation of cards can be a useful tool to help children with their reading abilities.  The game encourages them to think ahead, and consider the probable outcomes.  Playing alone gets old, but given the price and nature of the game, I highly recommend it as a ""family game"" to play with the kids.			"

												High learning curve if you are dumped into your first game, but pretty fun, and challenging once you get going. I've only played one game with one friend so far, but I liked it.			"

												Ok - 3.5 of 5 In the Witcher Advendture Game you play as 1 of 4 main characters where you complete quests to gain hero points and at the $2.99 price tag who can beat 20+ hours of entertainment.What I liked Playing with friends and family gives you something to do to pass time.  Some things that has seemed to help me collect your devolp cards first, then you can move on to investagating. Geralt strengths are in his fighting ablities and the fact that when he brews he gets a point on all Develop cards.  Triss has 2 cards that are a must adding an extra point when you prepair spells and the move again spell, this allows her to gain those extra magnifing glasses.  Zoltan seems to be somewhere in the middle.What I didn't like Maybe I'm wrong but it seems to be a huge disadvantage for whoever pickes  Dandelion.  Also I have been unsuccessful at playing an online multiplayer game where all I get is looking for players.			"

												I should mention that I also have the physical board game and have played it with friends.As a singleplayer experience, this is a decent game. It's meant to be role-played, you have to read the quests to feel any kind of depth. The formula is actually very close to the actual Witcher games: you have a main quest and some side quests. As you try to finish the main quest you get sidetracked with tasks and character development and do other things. Being a computer game, you don't have to keep track of the game rules that much, the game does it for you, so you have more time to concentrate on the fights and quests.As a multiplayer experience I feel that it's not that fun, though. There is very little player interaction, so there's no point in it being a multiplayer experience really. You might as well play alone without even any AI players.Some of the mechanics could have been improved, there are no keyboard shortcuts, which prevents effective Steam Controller use (mouse only).But overall I think it's a quaint little game, Witcher fans will enjoy it.

												Not a bad game on it's own, but as it is a converted board game I would probably have more fun playing with friends. The AI isn't bad, but there is a noticable lack if you play it solo. If you have a group of people whom you can spend time playing with then feel free to pick up this game.			"

												I will start off by saying I have the boardgame, it is fantastic. I think the game does need work, but as it stands it is an enjoyable experience. The boardgame does have its advantages over the computerised title due to different rule sets that people have made for the witcher which fixes some 'issues' (opinion) with the lack of player on player interaction, as it is more of a solitary experience.That being said, there are some glaring issues with the pc version. I have come across some very odd encounters that I can only explain as bugs.- There is a creature that tells the player ''before rolling place a foul token in an adjacent region'' What happens instead is the game forces you to place a foul token on your own player. --EDIT--This happens when all of your adjacent regions already have foul fates on them. That being said, the game at the time does a poor job of explaining that, and glosses over it immediately, forcing you to place a token on yourself.- There is a card that tells you if you have a 'vauble information' card you can trade it for 3 leads. The problem is that this doesn't appear to be a choice, despite the text. If you do have a valuable information card, you have held on to for other reasons, it will take it away from you and assume its the choice you wanted to make.- I swear I have had an instance of a card telling me 'x' or 'y' but it has done both, but I cannot recall 100% so maybe it didnt happen (I swear it did)I will be reporting these issues with picture examples when I get the chance and will update this if there are fixes.As it stands I would still recommend this title as it is fantastic to play. especially on sale currently for £2.09!Great boardgame from great developers			"

												The game is great. The music is good, the story involvment is nice, the art is also good. Heroes are (close to) ballanced with small exeptions of a couple of OP cards.			"

												Fun game to play for a while. Little confusing at first, but you'll learn it in a game or two. Never had any crashing or performance problems (30fps cap is kinda annoying tho) like many other reviews say so im lucky or theyre fixed.			"

												Game was kind of difficult to learn at first because so many things happen on each turn and it does not explain what's happening during the computer's turns. But after a few rounds I was able to pick it up really well and it became very fun. Only thing I would change is I would have a difficulty setting for the computer becuase I have yet to lose a round against all computer players. Very good game for just kicking back and relaxing.
