												This review is dedicated to my friend Gary who died of cancer.He introduced me to this game and I have a big soft spot for its simple mechanics. Its easy to pick up and difficult to put down. This game only came on Steam a year or so ago. We played the retail release. This new version adds Twitch support and is a lot more friendly to modern systems and resolutions. I've not clocked long on it mainly due to the bitter sweet memories. I like the units in this game. My only complaint with this has been that there could have been more nations to choose from. But that is minor. Its right up there with Age of Empires et al. Goodnight Gary. I'll keep winning for you.			"

												Rise of Nations has been my ""go to"" game for many years when I wanted a challenge without a lot of story line investment. It's great to kill an hour or an afternoon, and has so much variety that even after years of playing I know I haven't come close to doing a quarter of the combinations available. When the Extended Edition came out I was skeptical about spending money on a game I already had, but it has been well worth the price. The graphics are crisper, there is more variety in maps and nations, and it is at least as much fun as the original.So when I don't want the emotional investment of DoA, or the horror of ME3, I just sit down and crank up my old faithful to see if I can blast the Mongols to ashes with my nuclear warheads before they develop nuclear missille shields. Boom.			"

												One of the best game revivals.RoN became very fast my favorite strategy games once it got released at 2003 and later with its expasion at 2004. I love it as it consists of gameplay of all eras. Starting with your slignshots and swords, and improving until you get missiles and stealth bombers.It's story is quite good and reminds you of the glory days with some great battle. Multiplayer is one of its best elements. Playing with your friends co-op versus with AI or just an all out battle! Customise the teams as you want and also the battle's options like map size, technologies and winning methods.Now let's talk about Extended Edition. <---Skip here if you just want to learn the differences.The game graphics look quite similar but definitelly smoother. You can feel the overall gameplay and animations of the charaters being so smooth while moving and fighting.Multiplayer is here once again with leaderboards! As gamespy is dying the game now has multiplayer once again and better than ever! I am hoping to see an ever bigger map though and more units instead of just 200/300. I bet it wouldn't be much of a problem nowadays with the new updated and powerful computers.Twitch! Do you like streaming and showing off your gameplay? This will be very handy for you. Log in, hit the record button and show your fans all your strategy tactics on how you beat your opponent!The only downside for me is that the game looks quite similar, yet some small very handy improvements will make it quite better.Bigger maps, yes bigger than Big Huge. People using the editor can remake their countries and some of their battles with a proper big terrain.More units! Setting the unit price to lower and having more units in battle will totally increase the fun of the game.More players? With bigger maps, more players can be added as well. 12 or something like that.Overall?If you liked the original, you are gonna like this one as well.If you haven't played the original, then if you like real time strategy games, you are gonna love it too!

												+ Border lines help to navigate differing territories, plan new settlements with a more informed approach, and investigate spheres of control; the restrictive aspect of this feature also serves to deter early rush tactics and general griefing+ Zoom feature helps to navigate terrain and keep track of movement over large swathes of territory+ The diplomacy options play out as more than a gimmicky feature, and are both simple on paper and functional in practice+ Time restrictions during campaigns add to the challenge in a way that is rewarding if successful+ Have seen some before and after stills, it's clear that the visuals and textures are noticeably improved; this should further appeal to veterans of the franchise+ The re-release now supports Twitch integration; I don't use the feature myself, but this is still a significant boon for the streaming community+ Features a satisfying variety of playable cultures, each with their own defining traits+ The trategic overview map is a nice feature, and consists of a simple, turn-based Risk-style map; some notable features include: bonus cards you can apply, resource bonuses, diplomacy, and varying types of battles that hinge on several factors+ Impressive array of options and game-modes available for multiplayer, many of them quite novel for an RTS game (although they're not quite as alien for other strategy sub-genres)+ Attrition and supply features are a nice addition, and do well to keep one prepared and on their toes during offensive engagements+ Excellent sense of balance in all aspects+ Special units are presented well in the game and don't feel overpowered or cheap in their use- The overworld strategy part of the game feels a bit watered down compared to other staples of the genre; it isn't necessarily bad, but it's also clear that this feature was never meant to be the bread-and-butter of the franchise- The AI feels a bit underwhelming, and I had expected more of an improvement for the re-releaseLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												Game has one of my favorite late game features: The Armageddon Clock. Nukes are slow to build and expensive, but can be utterly devastating. The problem is each Nuke fired reduces The Armageddon Clock by one. If the clock reaches zero everyone loses, as the world is destroyed in a nuclear firestorm and a thousand year nuclear winter. The clock ticks ever down, and people quickly become scared to fire their nukes, lest a ""defeated"" player fires all their nukes and dooms everyone. A stalemate emerges. The game then becomes centered around the late game techs Missile Shield & World Government. Missile Shield stops people firing missiles into your territory, and each time it's researched instead of ticking down the Armageddon Clock ticks up, offering a brief chance at peace. The Missile Shield only stops people attacking you with Nukes though. Someone can still fire nukes defensibly if you try and attack into their land, or they can nuke their own land with a dozen missiles to trigger Armageddon. Cities when attacked normally take a few minutes to be annexed by the invader. World Government makes the countdown timer instant, and also means you instantly conquer any nation if you can take their capital. The Armageddon Clock might be low, but if you can make a surprise attack on your opponents capital and take it fast enough, they won't have the chance to fire them. However the most important thing is. When you play a massive free for all game always play with open diplomacy. Because at the end, there is a chance that the Armageddon Clock will lead to such a stalemate of MAD, the only solution is for everyone to ally up and have peace.			"

												When I played RoN for the first time on around 2004/5 I was really impressed with the number of upgrades that this game offered to me. I was doing building of many types of units which have their own abilities and specialties. The number of research that I could do was mind boggling and are very effective while winning a game. This game , to me, redefined the genre RTS. So without any further delay let me review this game quickly.... Game Play :As anyone can understand the game play is fairly complex due to number of different units , number of different resources and the number of different buildings with different research items. But RTS is all about complexity. You build up your game slowly and nicely (the way you see it fit the objective) and then in a single master stroke your complete your objective(s). Most of the missions are timed which means that you have to achieve victory within a stipulated amount of  real time (say 90 minutes). Usually I find this time to be more than enough but at time to time (specially with rising difficulties) you may find it a bit more challenging.In SINGLE PLAYER Campaign you can play different scenarios (more in number in extended edition) or you can play the age old classical world domination. MP is also there and somewhat active in nature - but you must play good and I mean REAL GOOD to win MPs. The statistics from the game engine that comes out after the game is pretty impressive, you could even get a stats about your right and left clicks in the entire game as well....Graphics:Even if the game is from 2004 the graphics is stunningly detailed. If you zoom a bit you can see - the seas are having waves , the crops in the farms are swinging with the wind current and what not. From RTS perspective the details is very high (some people may not say its good but I actually liked it). The different models have their different behaviors.Over all this detailed graphics adds a nice touch to the entire gaming experience.Controls: Controls are fairly easy to understand and its better to have the shortcut keys known to yourself - they will help you greatly in the MPs. mouse clicks are pretty consistent but in my slower GPU the scroll rate for the map was a bit jaggy. For a comprehensive basic guide I recommend   this. .Misc:In other features - the game now have integrated Steamplay, Twitch,  Steam Achievements and Steam Trading Cards to increase the game experience even more. The Extended Edition also includes the Thrones and Patriots expansion , the HD models.Overall the game gets a thumbs up from me.Hope you will enjoy the game as I did.~ Conqueror of the world ~			"

												So.  Back in 2003 I played this game.  My brother and I managed to hook up a dial up internet connection, and would spend quality time annoying each other or fighting alongside each other. (Often in the same match) and would build these massive empires and crush the opposition.  With the slow death of GFWL, and the modern computer making older games hard to play I lost track of this game.Enter the modern age.  Some wonderful person decided to rip the GFWL garbage out and make it play nice with Steam.  Once again my urge to drop nukes on my brother took over.  Once again I watched in horror as my brother dropped nukes on his own cities just to wipe out my army. 10/10 would create the holocost again.			"

												A solid, enjoyable, and accessible RTS with equal playability for combat and econ/tech.RON is a multifaceted real-time game with well-implemented resource gathering and tech dimensions, in addition to the industry-standard combat elements. It's customizable enough so that a newcomer or veteran who would rather not worry about tech, econ, or combat can disable those elements in the starting menus.There are six economic resources in the game (three of which appear after appropriate research). Most combat units, buildings, tech, and upgrades cost one or two types of resources. They also tend to increase in cost the more of the same unit/building you have already built, which encourages players to diversify their buildings and units rather than just rebuild one type over and over.Combat units usually adhere to a rock/paper/scissors balance mechanic, although at later ages there are a decent range of specialized units that accomplish unique functions in warfare. Controlling a battle group is relatively intuitive - command buttons on the console also show shortcuts for the more-familiar player, and extra modifiers such as facing, General craft powers, and terrain also allow modest benefits for the detail-oriented player.Each nation has its own special powers, which lead to interesting matchups (although at higher levels of play, certain nation powers mandate a narrower choice of strategy than others).Those already experienced with RTSes can expect to jump right in and get playing against the AI competitively, and then jump online to test their skills against humans. This game may be a steeper learning curve for newcomers to the RTS genre because of its breadth of econ, tech, and military.Players who like modding their games will also find this game rewarding and versatile, including the ability to mod entire campaigns and to create new units in the game's .xml files.An excellent balance of accessibility and complexity. My favorite RTS game.			"

												Rise of Nations: Extended Edition is a real-time strategy game from SkyBox Labs and previously Big Huge Games, published by no other than Microsoft Studios. It's a perfected version of Rise of Nations and Rise of Nations: Thrones and Patriots, all with new Steam features like achievements, cloud saving and more.Like many Microsoft games remake, Rise of Nations: Extended Edition retain exactly the very same gameplay and features from the previous 2 games, everything combined into a single game. If only like Age of Empires 2: HD Edition, the population limit is increased, this game might worth more. At least we get to see the old Conquer the World campaign along with the Thrones and Patriots new campaign such as the Cold War. For you who haven't play Rise of Nations before, the gameplay of this game is very good, start with a single city, build a library, college, market and expand your city, then build more cities and expand your empire into a great nation. Victory can be achieved through conquest, science or in this game called tech race, building wonders and there are more win condition for custom play.Rise of Nations: Extended Edition graphics are, well, it's said that the water and textures has been improved, and there is a new anti-aliasing effect, but me personally didn't see that great differences from the previous Rise of Nations, or maybe it's just been far too long. The graphics are classic, but good, very good, I'm not saying it's bad, it's just kinda still old. The performances are good, no lags or any kind of problems.Rise of Nations: Extended Edition however, have many room for improvements, if Microsoft really care. Maybe a DLC? Bad idea for most but at least there is an addition, maybe new unique units, new unique unit models for each nation (seriously, Russian launching F-18 Hornet from their carrier?), new campaign maybe the Roman campaign or something, even maybe new nation? Expansion Packs?Like many other too, Rise of Nations: Extended Edition has the Steam workshop support for community made custom content like maps, scenarios, even mods.But overall, Rise of Nations: Extended Edition is a great game, very fun and with the new Steam features, even better. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

Considering the Ron offers better unit control even with full population, doesn't restrict players with medieval age and allows you to make more strategic moves both in economy and military; i have difficulties finding a reasonable explanation for not to choose Ron in this and almost every other RTS comparison. Only con of this game is the lack of players in online otherwise it is highly recommended to everyone who loves playing strategy games!			"

(well one, Nemesis of the Roman Empire, but that was way back then)  I've played Civilization V and probably some other Civilization when I was younger but I forgot which one it was. :P Anyways, this game is almost PERFECT for me. Almost because they could add some small features here and there, but it's not a big deal. The only bad thing that has yet to happen was my laptop shutting down mid-game, but I think it over heated haha.  What is this game like? If RIsk and Civilization were to become RTS games and have a potato, this would be that potato. If Windows 95 became a RTS I would eat that potato. Potatos are good for your health. Thank you based potato. Great game don't see why you shouldn't buy it. Multiplayer has ranked matches, even a lobby chat on the game browser. It's pretty active if you're a multiplayer type of person.Thank you based Microsoft.			"

												A fun and challenging RTS with a very good price while on sale. It offers challenging play, gameplay that differs from other RTS, loads of civs to play, nukes, and amazing soundtrack (seriousky, I would buy this game just for the music, it's that good), multiplayer, streaming for all you streamers, a wide tech tree, a 'risk-like' world domination mode, campaigns, quick and useful tutorials, a huge amount of game setting customization, wonders, huge battles and many, many more features. Also it comes in a huge bundle pack so you can get other great games like AOE2 and AOE3 with it!BOTTOM LINE:Buy it f you enjoyed other RTS games like AOE2, preferably when on sale (because who doesn't like a great game for 5 bucks), get your friends to buy and nuke them to awesome music9/10			"

												I played this game when I was very young, so I undoubtly am biased to the game due to nostalgia. The gameplay itself is still very challenging and complex, especially managing the resources and multi-tasking armies, like most other RTS games. Rise of Nations won many awards and presents execellent gameplay strategy and tactics due to it's realistic resource/market system. There's not many things that bring me more satisfaction than managing to get my resources going really well, and building up huge armies to invade enemy lands. The game itself is very complex, and with higher difficulties vsing the computer, it becomes very hard to win. The online in this game isn't very great, so I'd suggest playing 2v2 with bots when playing this game. Although you might think you'd feel like a loner, you definetely won't when you're managing an entire country, negotiating with your ally and crushing the enemies. The five main campaigns in this game is also superb. You could play as Napoleon, conquering europe by playing very fun and interesting scenarios, such as when you gain a few armies to invade a whole heavily guarded Egypt (10/10 historical). The graphics aren't that bad either, considering that I'm very picky on graphics. There are over 40~ countries to play as in Rise of Nations, each of them with their own set of unique powers and units. Overall, this game still remains a great RTS, with challenging and rewarding gameplay. There's no better feeling than managing to take over two countries via a huge campaign of sieging while the AI on your team does nothing but take the brunt of the enemy's force.			"

												The question on most of the minds of people who played this game: Does it hold up?Yes. Unlike Age of Empires II which, in my opinion, sadly doesn't stand the test of time, Rise of Nations is every bit as fun and engaging as it was more than ten years ago. It's also still a bit of a mess in its late game moments, which I'll address a bit later. First off, for any new players donning their commander cap for the first time, what is Rise of Nations? It's best described, I think, as a cross between Age of Empires and Civilization. It is a real-time strategy game, first and foremost - worker units are recruited and instructed to gather the expected resources in food, wood, gold, iron, and later oil. They'll also construct military barracks, universities for gaining knowledge (which you'll spend to research technologies and advance through the ages), castles and forts for locking down territory, and perhaps most importantly of all - cities. You'll begin the match with one city. Structures like temples and forts will push your borders out a bit for you, but the only way to really expand your territory effectively is to build new cities. You can then recruit from your new city more villagers, which will proceed to build all the same farms, temples, lumber mills and schools you constructed at your first city - and eventually, you'll start the whole process over again. There's a great sense of satisfaction in watching each of your cities grow from a humble huddle of townhouses to its full sprawl of market, temple, barracks, school and more. Cities, as I mentioned, expand your borders, which are important primarily due to unit attrition. You can move your workers and military units within your own territory unfettered... but set foot on enemy lands, and you'll notice a red glow pulsing at their feet and a health bar that will slowly begin to dwindle. Supply wagons can be built, and as long as your units are within its effective range, they can pass into enemy lands without fear of damage. Should your wagon(s) be destroyed by the enemy, your units will immediately begin taking damage over time. In this sytem of attrition and supply, Rise of Nations creates a very unique combat game that can force the retreat of a march larger force or encourage players to slug it out along borders where they can effectively fight without fear of attrition. As stated above, you'll progress from the sticks and stones of the ancient world on through the crossbows and knights of the middle ages - the tanks and bombers of the World War II-era modern age, ending finally in the information age, where stealth bombers and ICBMs run amok. It's exciting and interesting to see what units will open up to you in each era, and every civilization has several unique units available to it throughout time that inject enough variety to encourance players to give them all a try. As I also stated above, the end-game of Rise of Nations is definitely its greatest weakness. One would expect the introduction of fighter jets, bombers, nuclear warheads and rocket artillery to be pretty exciting, right? Well, it mostly ends up creating a huge mess of a battlefield where's it's almost impossible to keep track of what's going on, who's killing who, or what's best effective against what. As nuclear warheads begin to drop and level cities, and certain technologies completely remove the wait time for recruitment (meaning you can keep clicking the ""Rocket Artillery"" icon and it will keep building them click after click after click instantly), the game loses any sense of cohesion and almost feels like a test of who can control complete and utter chaos. Luckily, the custom options in the game allow you to not only set a limit on how far the game can progress (IE: you can stop all further advancement at the Gunpower Age, so no one can build anything more advanced than a musket), but also how quickly you can advance. At the slowest settings, you'll likely be able to fight several battles with each age's loadout of units - though you'll also be waiting around quite a bit longer for your research to complete. Overall, I'm happy to report that Rise of Nations is still a whole lot of fun. It lacks the depth of a game like Civilization V, and the combat will feel pretty basic compared to more tenacious RTS fare Starcraft II and Company of Heroes 2 - but there's really something to be said for a game that can marry the territorial expansion and slog through time of the Civilization with more bread and butter RTS mechanics. It you enjoy strategy games, it's a steal at $20.			"

												You're looking at a game which I've had the fortune to play since it was released in 2003, and which has never lost it's capacity to create superb gameplay. It is, naturally, better with friends - as most things are, except perhaps murder. Multiplayer on this game, especially with a tight group of close friends with whom you can have plenty of banter, just about beats every other RTS hands down. The thrill of armed combat across an enormous map (or Big Huge map as the game calls it) is gripping, and the delicate but simple mechanics of the Rise of Nations economy, and the associated feeling of a build up towards ""greater things"" (the Modern Age, where my favourite nation, Germany, receives all of its major bonuses) only intensifies.The game has a population cap of 250, which isn't acceptable in this day and age when most people posess relatively decent PCs can thusly run the game on much better graphics. In the community guides you'll find easy, quick techniques which will allow you and your friends to up the pop cap to 1,000. I highly recommend this - if you wish to play with up to 8 friends, all of whom you know, not only does it increase the enjoyment of the game but prevents any ""ganking"". If you have: 1. a superb economy, 2. the will to fight two enemies at once, 3. the micromanaging powers to maintain your homefront during any fight, you may well win! Being able to balance out an optimal amount of over 750 units (not including your civilian population, depending on how large it is) across the map, as well as being able to cover your frontiers, makes for an interesting as well as much more enjoyable game.TL;DR, this game is fun. Buy it, play with friends. But upgrade the popcap.			"

												Age Of Empires and Civilization had a baby.It's everything you could wish for in both franchises, tired of how aoeII has you going only through the medieval eras? Annoyed with waiting another turn in civ when you could just tell that f*cking worker to come here? RoN is the logical extension of that, it goes beyond the tried and true modalities of standard rts fare and achieves something hardly any other rts or for that matter game has tried. With the tech tree removed, the player doesn't have to wonder what logical pathways the authors followed when they had you go from wheel to the binocular to the atom bomb. What you've got here is streamlined: Pop cap bothering you? Military upgrade. Wanna expand? Civics. Commerce cap? Economy. Production too low? Science of course! And then you advance to the next age. Which does look substantially different. The architecture, the playstyle (in part), the units all look like they're really from the future compared to the loincloth wearing barbarians you started with.There are races, and they do get bonuses, which feel more like personalized cheat codes. What else would you call instant worker spawn (china), extra city expansion (zulus), 3 free horse archers per stable (mongols), 2 extra max farms (egyptians), no borders (some indian tribe), double capital (persians) etc.? WIth so many nations it's not hard to find one to suit your playstyle depending on what you feel in the morning.Little caveat: The game is ideological, the two types of government have a clear bias, one ""libertarian"" (democracy/republic/capitalism) against one ""authoritarian"" (despotism/monarchy/socialism). But it's not as visibly overbearing as what civlization does, where the difference between being LITERALLY FASCIST NAZI HITLER and a snarky liberal late night talk show host is wether you pick assembly line or the scientific method.What's more like age of empires is the warfare, it's the good old rock paper scissor we all love to hate: cavalry beats archer, archer beats infantry, infantry crushed beneath the treads of a tank, tank is nuked by the science civilization. The difference between one age and nother is evident, especially in gameplay, if you don't catch up you're dead behind. Castles and towers and barracks and siege workshops all work exactly like they did in aoe2, with the thing above as well as expanding and contracting borders.Especially with the HD re-release, everythign is polished and overpolished, with one click you can get into multiplayer or stream on twitch or start a mod up.

												One of the greatest strategies ever developed. If you like games like Age of Empires or Empire Earth this is the one you don't want to miss. A game where you gather resources, research technologies, improve units, fight, command and conquer! This is a dream!. Rise of Nations comes with exciting campains where your goal is for instance to conquer 330 BC known world as Alexander the Great or conquest of the world during cold war for either CCCP or USA. For instance, I've played Alexander's campain for a while and it was very entertraining because every location on the map had it's own special rules and ways to win, so it kept the game interesting and not repetitive. The game offers much more than classic beat your enemies modes such as Assassin (FFA with special rules), Musical Chairs (every few minutes player with the lowest score looses) or Sudden death. I loved classic version and this -extended- is even more entertaining. 8,5 /10 "

												I always like to think of this game as a gathering of many good aspects of some strategy classics from back in the day, such as  Empire Earth, Age of Empires, Total Annihilation, and Civilization II. It is a gem of the strategy genre that many are yet to experience, and should soon.Difficult to point out special virtues in RoN. Perhaps the 18 technologically and aesthetically delineated civilisations, or the fast-paced urban improvements and clever use of the Academy as the core of a settlement's upgrades. Perhaps the military attrition that has just the right rhythm, allowing both the player and their opponents to constantly and progressively advance in warfare capacity and strength, and in a match each invasion feels like a whole new emotion - much harder to bring down an adversary in one shot here. It is also commendable the way BH Games found to display a balanced, yet challenging temporal advancement system that takes you from the classic age to contemporary conflicts and geopolitics. You improve your technologies and expand your settlement across the neighbouring territories (and yes, the territories are another exciting feature in RoN) as you are justly rewarded with the chance of gripping at the next moment in human progress. I've seen few strategy games in which age advance is so balanced and perceptible through the player's actions and upgrade management (a system very similar to Empire Earth II, by the way).The Extended Edition looks fresh, especially visually. However, and this could be something particular to my system – I’m yet to find out –, the buildings and upgrades icons are missing, and I hope a future update shall remedy this little issue (edit: it is apparently a first-launch issue; for those having the same problem, just quit and restart the game, and all icons should be back on). Apart from that, looks like good old RoN to me thus far.Rise of Nations can snatch many an hour out of your weeks, a strategy masterpiece with which I have a history, not in vain, since its replayability factor is always able to drag me back to it and renew that history bringing to it more pleasurable gaming experiences. Besides, I can finally say that Steam has come miles closer to bringing all my dream games to its repertoire.			"

												Ignore hours played on Steam, I've dropped way more in well before I had Steam. That said...Rise of Nations is an astounding rts that has aged pretty well both on the technical side and game play. It looks good, any potato of a PC can play it and the game appears to be optimized for Windows 10 as well. Absolutely zero issues. Great streaming economy which is easy to understand for anyone new to real time strategy games or people coming from other titles like Starcraft or Empire Earth which rely more on resource field collection over static streaming resource fields. As for combat, it requires a bit more attention than most other rts games, but that's part of what makes this game truly unique.Numerous campaigns, nothing of amazing length but fun no less. Varying scenarios such as the Alexander the Great campaign, the Cold War or a campaign to conquer the world. Playing against the AI can be a good challenge on the vs/AI maps and the multi-player is fun, but to boot I'm not a big fan of multi-player. But that's beside the point, it functions and functions well.Pros:-One of the best older rts experiences out there-Game appears to receive periodic updates after over ten years-Intuitive gameplay-Well honed younger brother of the Age of Empires seriesCons:-Nvidia GeForce game sharing UI does not like this game at all, screwing with hotkeysI really can't pick any flaws out of Rise of Nations. It's rock solid as far as an RTS goes.			"

												Wonderful game! Even though the graphics really do show that it was made a long time ago, with the steam extended edtion they're much more bearable and hardly a problem. Gameplay is fabulous and is a one of its kind that keeps me and my friends coming back to it consistently. Definitely worth the price 10/10 would recommend again.			"

 Rise of Nations: Extended Edition  The game from my childhood and the only strategy that I love to play even now. This is a remastered version of the game from 2003 and one of the most popular strategic games. Extended Edition contains the full contents with the addition of Thrones and Patriots. Rise of Nations offers a lot of nice campaign where our goal is to lead our nation to dominate the world. During the game you have to take care not to be destroyed by other nations but also develop a number of aspects such as economy, science, technology, diplomacy and military power. Each of these aspects will give you the opportunity to develop troops, build new buildings and to develop new opportunities in old buildings, but also move to a new era. With each progression of the game is changing the look and statistics buildings, military units and other things. Each nation has its own unique army as long as the nation still exists. In the game to expand, we have to use wood, stone, food, science, and oil at a later stage of the game, not forgetting that each of these resources can run out of. There is also an advanced diplomacy through which you can contain very beneficial agreement with other nation. In the game you can also play scenarios and multiplayer, but only with friends because no one plays. The game in terms of gameplay has hardly changed, improved graphics and added more resolution size. I like this production and do not regret a single hour spent at the game. Great soundtrack, an old but still nice graphics and a lot of things to do while playing the game. In my opinion this is the best strategy game I've ever played, many hours of fun for me. The game I am able to recommend, however, the game also has a bug that irritated me at first because I could not change my resolution because the game was crashing. However, it was manageable change in a text file. "

												Rise of Nations is one of the only RTS games that puts strategy ahead of micromanagement. The design was extremely innovative when the game came out in 2003, and nothing since then has even come close.It takes the pacing and tactics of games like Age of Empires and Starcraft and combines them with the depth and strategy of games like Civilization. The result is something truly awesome.There are a lot of different ways to customize games, so each player can set up games to suit his or her style of play.The competitive play is very rewarding and challenging and really puts an emphasis on strategic decision-making. The balance isn't perfect, but the game has random maps that are different every time so that players are forced to adapt instead of memorizing build orders.Playing casually is also rewarding and fun. Unlike other multiplayer RTS games that can feel like hard work instead of enjoyable entertainment, Rise of Nations doesn't require constant attention and giving orders all over the map at insane speeds (although you can control  your units like that if you want to). It's the ideal RTS for people who don't have the speed, energy, focus, and free time of teenagers.Most RTS games are a miserable experience unless the matchmaking is perfect and opponents are very close in skill level. Rise of Nations is different. The design of the game and the different modes ensure that fun and exciting games are commonplace instead of being a rare event.The game has an extensive tech tree and lots of depth, but the learning curve is excellent as it lets you gradually discover what you need to know. There are lots of different civilizations with unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. All of this makes the balance less than ideal, but it ensures that the game doesn't get stale or repetitive, even after thousands of hours of play.Rise of Nations represents the best strategy gameplay in the RTS genre. It's not a perfect game, but it comes closer than anything else. It's entirely possible that we will never see a game quite like this again. If you are a fan of actual strategy in games, you'll want to experience this gem while it still has a player base.			"

												I first played this game after buying it off a bargain PC game rack. I loved it.But I lost the code to reinstall it, and I thought I'd never play it again. Until Steam released it.This game is a great, old-fashioned RTS. It's pretty basic, and most wars are won by overwhelming the enemy with hundreds of infantrymen and nukes. But it's a hell of a lot of fun. Its even got multiplayer, a ""conquer-the-world"" campaign, and even a map editor, in which you can draw maps, terrain, and cities.This is a great deal on sale. Let me me repeat that; ON SALE. I love this game, but I'd never pay $15 bucks for a game from 2002. But again, I love this game. For 2002, it's fantastic. VERDICT: 7/10			"

												The game itself is a nice strategy game. I won't write much about the game itself. An old classic game re-released with some polishment (not worth mentioning) and especially reworked so that it will run on modern systems. In addition Steam functions like workshop, Cloud save, Achievements and the Steam network has been added. This is very good and players can profit from this easy to use functions (e.g. ""I want to have this mod; I just need to click subscribe and the game will do the rest. No manuel file download and copying"")....But ;(This is not bad but the current state of silence regarding support is a shame! They don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about issues people are having sice release of the game. The last update is one year old. As soon as you ask for updates because the problems with the sound, music and multiplayer still exists - no answer. The publisher/developer is answering in the forums but only to unimportant stuff. This is a shame and a no go!This makes me sad because they re-released some games already which have not been sentenced to capital punishment. Age of Empires 2 HD e.g. or Age of Mythology. I see work from the developers there. Why not in this game?If those annoying errors won't exist this would be definitely a recommandation.			"

												Rise of Nations is by far one of the best RTS games i've every played. The fact that you progress through every age from slingshots to anti-tank shots. The best part? It's extremely fast paced. While you do have enough time to feel the strain of living through each age, it's not too long so that you feel like it takes an forever to advance technologically.The graphics of this game are actually pretty good for such an old game, even with the remastery. Overall a fantastic game with an amazing campain system, your own senario editing (including script writing), and a fantastic multiplayer; this game is well worth the price and has amazing replayability especially with friends.

												I remember playing this game all the time back in the heady days of the early Aughts. Maybe it's nostalgia talking, but for someone who's not super into strategy games this one still stands up as one of the best.It's an RTS, but has a great deal of depth to it. The most accurate way to describe it, I think, is that it's the RTS version of the Civilization series.You can play as any one of a huge number of real civilizations throughout history and you play them as an expanding empire throughout history, starting out as cavemen and going on to develop space age technology.The nations you can play as are all functionally the same besides some minor differences in a few unit types and inherent bonuses based on the history of that nation. So the best way to go about it is to play a few matches to figure out what sort of play style you prefer, and then pick a nation that helps out your play style.Each match takes roughly an hour and a half, which makes it centuries faster than a standard Civilization match, but you still go through all the same motions as you would in a Civilization game. Trying to burn through technologies, pushing out resources, setting up border cities in order to claim territory, and then finally ending the world in a barrage of nukes because the match has been going on too long and you're bored.If you like the idea of the Civilization series but always hated how slow-paced they are, you'll love this game.I've been playing this edition with my brother over Steam for a couple months now and I gotta say, I'm pleasantly surprised with how well it holds up after all these years.Definitely recommended.

												The most basic way to describe the game is a cross between Age of Empires and Civilization; it takes the best features of both series and put them into one game. To date, no RTS game has surpassed Rise of Nations in how well it has incorporated typical mechanics/features of 4X/turn-based strategy games. Rise of Nations features many unique factions, procedurally generated maps, 8 ages (many more than Age of Empires), MANY creatively implemented mechanics, naval warfare, and much more. The game is extremely fun to play with friends. If you have friends that play Civ or other strategy games, Rise of Nations: EE is a great game to add to your repertoire of games. For single player, I have not seen a better AI. This is not to say it is perfect, but only few can hold a candle to RoN AI.This is a game that is truly excellent and reigns as king in its game design. I've played many RTS games including the Warcraft series, Starcraft BW, CNC series, Company of Heroes, Age of Empires series, Kohan series, Total Annihilation, and an assortment of 4X/turn-based strategy games. I am not exaggerating when I say Rise of Nations is truly one of the greatest strategy games of all time. Game design: 5/5Graphics: 4/5 (for its time of release)Single player: 4/5Multiplayer: 5/5Sound: 4/5Overall: 5/5 (Game design has the heaviest weight on this for me)One last bit of information for those that already own the game and want to spice it up: you can download new textures that a Russian modder has made in the link below: http://www.moddb.com/mods/terrain-flora-and-fauna-v-2/downloads/terrain-5-extended-ynk/#4832034 Instructions for installation are in the comments there.

												I only ever watched this game from afar when it first hit the scene all that time ago, so I had a fresh perspective coming at it here and now.I have played Age of Empires II/III a lot, and Civilisation V, which has led me to the opinion that Rise of Nations sits somewhere inbetween, which is an interesting mix. It's Civ V but real-time, and Age of Empires but with more micro-management, wider breadth and slower pace.If you enjoy either of those games, you'll likely enjoy this one.			"

												It's a great game, a classic. Works fine, game play is still there, no bug when i played on released. Well worth the nostalgic of when RTS was a big genre for the PC market. But if you noticed I only played 3.5 hours, because I always found this game really repetitive and boring after mutliple games, i can't really play for more than one game at a time. I feel the same way in games like Civilization. I'm more of a three or more faction kinda of guy for RTS, three or more very different factions.The game is a bit pricey for its age. You're pretty much paying for the online and thats it. I'm really sick of developer re-releasing these old games as HD or Extended editions. They're sugar coating this game for it's fans really, game looks the same it did when i got the game years ago. OMG TRADING CARDS!Instead they should actually add stuff to the game or release a new version entirely. Like i didn't buy AOE2 when they HD it, i bought the forgotten expansion and it was bundled. If they do something similar with RON i think it'll be well worth any asking price.Also they need to re-release ROL on steam, that game was a master piece.			"

												Of course, with so much of the game's design rooted in the Civilization model, it's no wonder that Rise of Nations' research system also stands head and shoulders above the systems featured in other real-time strategy games. Although it isn't as comprehensive as the technology tree of Civilization III, Rise of Nations' research fields are still broader than those of just about any other real-time strategy game yet. There are four main areas of research: military, civil, commerce, and science. Each area has eight levels, as well as a top-level technology for each area once you reach the eighth stage. However, each of these technologies is balanced fairly well against the others, so you're free to choose the technological path you most prefer without worrying that your unbalanced research might leave you vulnerable in some way. Additionally, you'll conduct most of your research in a single building: the library. The consolidation of most of the game's technology under one roof is a breakthrough in logistics--you no longer have to go hunting for different buildings to conduct research. Like Age of Empires, Rise of Nations features eight different ages: classical, medieval, gunpowder, enlightenment, industrial, modern, and information. Even though game's timeline begins in the Dark Ages and ends in a futuristic era, it manages to strike a perfect balance between the different ages and the breadth of technologies available in each. And despite all that depth, Rise of Nations is paced well and isn't overly complex--the game's interface makes it easy to understand what you need to do to advance to the next age, and the resource costs of advancement are challenging to meet without being ridiculously expensive. The only really serious complaint that hard-core strategy fans could level at Rise of Nations is that the game doesn't have a story-based campaign like so many other recent real-time strategy games. Instead, Rise of Nations features a single-player ""conquer the world"" campaign in which the world is divided into sections, like in the classic board game Risk. You start out as one nation on this map and attempt to literally conquer every other country in the world. Controlling your nation on the world map is turn-based, but when you enter into territory you don't control, the game changes to real-time mode. Interestingly, the campaign offers different scenarios for different territories. In one territory, your mission might be to withstand a barbarian raid for 30 minutes. In another, it might be to race across a map to destroy a barbarian encampment. In a contested territory, you might have a normal conquest game in which you must eliminate the enemy. Capturing and holding additional territories gives you benefits, such as an extra army or resource bonuses you can take with you into every tactical battle. However, this campaign, which is really just a glorified version of Risk, isn't as developed as the actual real-time game. Still, it's enjoyable, if a bit simple, and it adds a substantial single-player component to the game.  "

												This game is one of the best concepts for a strategy game i have ever played, while it isn't realistic to go from knives to nukes in an hour of gamepay it's sure as hell fun. The vast array of countries, units and maps mean no game will be the same, once you add in the multiplayer aspect of battling a friend it becomes even more fun. I couldn't begin to describe the satisfaction you get from advancing through the ages quicker then your opponant, being able to fire V2 rockeets into small medieval settlements and generally dominating the battlefield. 10/10 would be an understatement, but it's a review i should pick out one bad thing so lets go with old graphics, but even those add a little quirky feel to the game, and you don't pay attention to the graphics when your commanding an army accross the seas anyway (not to mention the graphics aren't half bad anyway). I would highly reccommend this game, it's well worth the money			"

												So, basically, think age of empires, but extended throughout recorded history, so you get a wide variety of combat, from slings and arrows to stealth bombers and nuclear icbms, Then throw in deeper concepts from turn based strategy games like borders and an actual (albeit simplified for real time play) logistics system.  Plus a campaign which pefected what we would now call the ""metamap"" system. I would honestly rate this as one of the best rts games of all time, with the only other real contender for the top spot being maybe the original starcraft.  Certainly the best rts in a histroical setting.  Even if you already own the original, it's might be a little harder to justify, but it does have working multiplayer through steamworks(the original used gamespy, which was terrible and now defunct), and then there's just the convenience of having it in your steam library.  Worth getting during a sale anyway.  If you're a strategy fan who somehow never played this when it first came out, This is absolutely a must buy.			"

												This is one of my all-time favorite games, and this game also means a lot to me since it's one of the earliest game I played with my best friend that's 9000 miles away from me now. Even though I played a LOT of different games during my time playing Rise of Nations, I always spent some time playing this game. I am no expert even though I spent hundreds of hours playing this game, since I only play games for fun, not to be a master at it. I did use the cheats for fun (cheat nuke on Classical age LOL) and it results to my lack of the skill to play the game. So pardon my incapability to speak about the technical details of the game.The reason I spent so much time fooling around back then rather than seriously trying to master the game was because the fact that Rise of Nations is very fun to mess around with. You have a sandbox mode where you can pretty much create any scenario you want or make any kind of battles. The built-in cheats are also very fun to play with. I play games for fun, not to win.Now about the game type, Rise of Nations is a classic old RTS game. You gather resources, build buildings & upgrades, build an army, attack your enemy and destroy their cities. It's just like Warcraft III's multiplayer (not dota, dota is a mod), Age of Empire, Stronghold Crusader, StarCraft, etc. These kind of games had its golden age back in early 2000s. Now, it's mostly dominated by Total War series, which are way more complicated and detailed since it's more focused on realism and strategy rather than the old RTS games, which are focused on the balance between building and combat. Old RTS games tend to be much more simpler due to limited technology at that time + they must have doubt people will like complex realistic strategy game, until Total War showed its success with Total War Medieval. Rise of Nations started to implement some complexity in-game by giving the effects of the terrain on the unit's performance, attritions, upgrades, more resources types, etc rather than a simple build-and-attack RTS game, but its gameplay is still kept simple and easy to learn.Rise of Nations offers a lot of choices in the game by giving you a lot of nations, ages, game mode and maps to choose. You can fight on air, sea, and land with a lot of unit types. Each nation has their own unique units, which are usually the iconic units of the country (e.g British's Scottish Highlander, US's Continental Marines, Russia's T-80 tank, German's Tiger Tank, etc). The ages is a really good system that rarely got implemented in other RTS games. I only know Age of Empire also implemented this but it was very limited, and Empire Earth, just like RIse of Nations also implemented a large amount of choices for ages. Each ages has their own unique strategy and play style, offering way more variety to the gameplay.The game itself is without question, heavily unbalanced. For example, Chinese's ability to instantly generate citizens itself is already very OP, allowing rapid constructions all over the territory and rapid resource gathering. I doubt the devs will do anything about this in the future since there are A LOT of elements in the game that are tied to one another but it's still definitely fun to play. If you're looking for a simple, fun, and easy to learn RTS games, Rise of Nations is definitely a good choice. You can also check out Empire Earth if you don't mind ugly graphics and small unit count for the same amount of fun. Rise of Nations is like the upgraded version of Empire Earth, it looks much better and the gameplay is much better too. TL;DR It's simple, has a very large variety of gameplay, very easy to learn but hard to master, mediocre but acceptable graphics and animations (it's a 2003 game give it a break), and super fun gameplay.

												First of all. I may not have many hours this far on RON. I just purchased it on steam but I've had it for years on CD. Therefore few hours in steam.Rise of Nations is a real-time strategy game. You start off in Ancient age where you build yourself some farms and gather wood for future uppgrades.This game is all about uppgrading from Ancient age into the much familiar Modern age, and ofcourse the more you uppgrade ages the better your units and overall income will be.In RON you have "" territory "" being the area around your camp/settlement. You are limited to this area and can only build in this area. One exception being the small city ( a new city ).You can expand your territory by building a new city somewhere close to your current one.Having more cities will allow you to maintain some gold income and start the trading business. There are also limits to how many farms, scholars, and trade caravans you can have each city. Therefore expanding is a must.I want to add that in normal mode the game has a sudden death mode. If a player reaches a goal in territory. Having an extreme lead in territory percentage, that player will win in 4 minutes.There are ofcourse several ways and modes to play in RON. You can choose wether you want a fast game where you get resources faster and you rush the enemy, you can choose economic game where you gather lots of resources before the big battle, sudden death by wonders and many more.In RON you build wonders. Like the great pyramide and statues. Theese wonders will grant you benefits like more income from mining, lumber, higher population limits.What I like about Rise of Nations would be the evolving battles. At first you start off with a handfull of men throwing rocks, using bows and spears. Then after a little while you get horses, catapults and attack ships.You uppgrade and suddenly you have riflement, tanks, battleships and airplanes.The huge battle after you have found oil and starting to build nuclear weapons and bomb planes. Having units with flamethrowers and bazookas. The feeling when your gigantic formation of soldiers  destroys the enemy city and you claim that city as your own.Rise Of Nations is inexpensive and fun to play. The best strategy game I've come across this far.I would recommend this game to anyone being a fan of strategy games!			"

												Back in the mid-late 1990s and the dawn of the 2000s, the RTS genre was living in it's glory days. Command and Conquer series, Age of Empires, Total Annihilation, Warcraft, if you look up any list of the best games of the past decades, there's a pretty good chance you'll find several RTS games occupying high spots on said lists.Rise of Nations came out almost 13 years ago and I believe it was a brilliant final page on the now defamed RTS genre. Personally there's been a steady decline on real-time strategy games with the rise of the FPS and the overall microevolution gaming has been through. That's not to say that there are no great RTS games today; quite the contrary but the golden age is well behind us. Rise of Nations is quite probably one of the last great additions during that time period and that's why it is one of my favourite games ever made.I'll even dare say it is much better than Age of Empires 2, since it is in fact by the same studio and it features a lot of improvements on an otherwise outstanding game.So the game is played like this:Pick a nationGather resourcesAdvance through the next ageWatch your opponents fall behindSent your tanks to fight the enemy's pikemenSpam voiced tauntsJokes aside, the game really shines through by properly forcing the player to manage their resources and their new technologies properly. You choose where to build, how to build, what to build and battle against opponents who each have their own unique style. The beauty of the game is the variety of ways which you can play and what sorts of strategies and doctrines you can use in order to secure victory.Each of the 18 nations to choose have unique advantages and drawbacks; some nations have specialized units during a specific age which can sort of dictate your aggressiveness or even create mind games with the enemy. The game will punish poorly managed resources and poorly managed armies. This is one of these game where you build a bunch of units, click on the enemy base and you win. Like Age of Empires, certain units will counter others and thus this will create the need for good army cohesion and management. The game features more than 100 different units each one with their unique stats and produced at different structures.Now I'm not saying that being bad at micromanagement should deter you from getting this game. If anything that would be an incentive to practice since there's very little unit micro that can be done but lots of resource management, city building, technologies researched, upgrades for the army and lots more.The extended edition features better textures, better multiplayer and cloud saves and both single and multiplayer experiences are really entertaining.You can play several of the different scenarios in the World Domination campaign which also has a few different and unique mechanics integrated in the World Map which cannot be found on the multiplayer aspect like getting cards to reinforce your troops or hamper the enemy.The several degrees of freedom of gameplay in Rise of Nations, by creating vast and uniquely different armies, an excellent balance between resource and army management and a really nice soundtrack, all contribute into making Rise of Nations a classic that has withstood the passage of time and naturally of the best RTS titles ever made and certainly worthy of your collection.

												Just before you buy this game just remember it is NOT Rise of Nations : Rise of Legends. Legends was done a lot better in my opinion but came at a later date.None the less though expect a European Wars Cossacks style of play. The only difference here is you cannot build wherever you'd like. The campaign plays as so : you are given the choice of scenarios or are allowed to choose your own map to conquer (I chose the world map to conquer). You have different races to choose from with each their own tactical ability. What separates this game and what I like about it is that the more research you do, the more you are allowed to build (no duh right), but you are allowed to build cities a certain distance away from one another and establish trade routes. Serfs are needed to harvest food (5 farms per city), or can be told to gather wood (need to build a wood cutting camp), and iron and oil can respectively be collected. Buildings such as lumberyards are available to make your lumber gather skills better (likewise for food and iron).The fighting is an RPG style of play and the formations the units line up in are awesome. Preparing your units for battle and lining them up accordingly and to which angle is made beautifully. They followed the idea of Knights and Merchants when it came to telling units in which direction to point - except this one does a better job of it. After a fight (or before a fight) you have an overview of your world map and from here can use strategic cards to your advantage or tell units where to move. You may also upgrade your current country's wealth. Back in the day this game would have received a higher rating from me, but as we are living in the present day and have quite the variety of games I will have to give it a 7.0/10. It has a fun factor, but it's re playability is sporadic. Multiplayer with friends is fun though.RATING : 7.0/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ "

9/10+  This is one of the all time best real time strategy games, period. If you're new to the game, it holds up very well despite its age (originally released in 2003). If you're a fan of the newer Civs I think this game is fairly similar but with real time rather than turn based combat. -  The ""Extended Edition"" really doesn't extend all that much over the original. Luckily the original is a solid base and the steam integration combined with updated visuals is more than enough to make a fan happy.			"

												Before you read this have this in mind I'm a huge fan of Rise of Nations so this review is from a guy who has played this game alot.Rise of Nations: Extended Edition was really really buggy in launch i basicly despised Skybox for destroying the game but at this time 30/06/2014 the game is working 95% (keep in mind that 95 is not 100, it still dosent function everytime) of the time. Rise of Nations is probobly the best remake I've seen so far, the game looks absolutely stunning just look at the water! To make things easier I'm making a pros and cons list.**PROS***Skybox made the game beautiful without destroying the games charm.*It's as good as the original with working multiplayer.*There is always a new Nation or tactic for you to master in the standard mode and when you feel tired of standard mode (which is great) you can play scenarios which is basicly role play created by users for an example there is a scenario where you pick a country in europe the year 1936 and you play as it.**Cons***The multiplayer is not completley solid sometimes each 15th game crashes and if you're playing ranked you loose elo.*There is no reconnect feature so if you would get disconnect by accident you cant reconnect and it counts as a loss.*If you are new to the game it might be hard to get into the game since there are alot of old players (like me) that will kick your♥♥♥♥♥but the AI is working really well and you can always play with a friend and it is even fun to play alone!Pardon my english it's not my first language but i hope this helped you!

												Rise of Nations is a very fun historical RTS, one of my personal favorites. The campaign mode was the highlight for me. You can play as Alexander the Great or Napoleon and forge your own path as you attempt to conquer the world. You can also play as Russia or the US in the Cold War. Or, create your own empire in the Americas/Global Map.There is a lot of variety to be found in the 24 unique civilizations, 8 Ages, and 5 campaign modes. It's awesome watching your people rise from a humble town to a powerful empire: whether it be via the campaign map or in-game scenarios.I highly recommend this to any fan of the RTS genre!10/10			"

												From ancient times all the way to the information age, Rise of Nations allows you to lead 18 different nations thru either the epic-scaled 'Conquer the World' gamestyle, or the classic 'quick game' style which is your basic RTS setup (1 base start, X-amt of resources, knock yourself out). Rise of Nations uses the tried and tested rock-paper-scissors method for unit counters but also adds in each individual nations bonuses and the abilities of Generals which combines overall for a decently complex multiplayer experience. Also given the fact that the most common playstyle in RoN (Rise of Nations) allows for not only military takeover wins, but also territory % wins,  and Wonder (massive buildings with unique bonuses) victories, RoN delivers quality strategy without sacrificing quantity (different nations and units to pick from). The Tech tree is straight forward, and is easy to pick up on (even for a rookie rts player), and rushing and economic boom strategies are both possible and competitive depending on which nation you pick.This game is a classic rts title that got revitalized on Steam for a reason: It's just.... brilliantif you're an rts fan,              get this titleif you want to learn rts,          get this titleif you're a collector of classics, get this titleENVOY RATED: 9/10			"

Sometimes it seems that you go from throwing stones to flying jets too quickly.  However, by setting the price of age advancements higher and slower, this problem can be somewhat overcome.The campaigns are a little lacking, and the conqour the World mode didn't really play out like I was hoping, but that doesn't matter anyway, Skirmish matches is where the real fun is, and playing with and/or against other humans is what makes RTSs fun!

												Absolutely amazing. I've been playing since it released back in the day and I am so incredibly happy to see a working Steam re-release! And no, this isn't just another fanboy thumbs-up. The game does have its flaws (especially lack of DX9 support) but overall it's still worth a looking into if you love RTS games.PROS:    Gamespy's been replaced.    Steam Workshop support incoming. (If the last two games are any indication, at least.)    Innovative RTS gameplay you still can't find in any other title.    More ways to win and/or lose then a game of Civ V!    (With the exception of no-DX9) Amazing system requirements letting even internal Intel HD graphics enjoy the nuke rain. It's Rise of Nations.CONS:    Where'd my lobby chat go?    ELO isn't really that appealing to most non-hardcore gamers. Seriously. Lack of DirectX 9 support and/or WinXP... (I can understand not supporting XP itself as an obsoleted OS, but it's still on approximately a third of computers worldwide and DX9 should be supported at least...)    Microsoft Studios offers essentially nil support. (...or OpenGL or some alternative, to consider porting outside Windows. But, then again...)    A few glaring bugs on release. At the time of writing this the most pressing (alt-tab sound vanishing) has been fixed in a day-two patch but there's still a few big ones that the original RON didn't have. Overall however it doesn't make the game unplayable.			"

This game is over a decade old at this point, so I'm not going to even attempt at commenting on the gameplay - other than saying that it's exactly the same as you remember it. Instead I will focus entirely on what this Extended Edition brings to the table, and if the promoted features are of any importance to you: the consumer. So let's go.Rise of Nations: Extended Edition is a re-release of the classic RTS from Big Huge Games. But rather than just slapping a ""Works on Windows 8"" sticker on the packaging and calling it a day, the developer of this ""Extended"" edition decided to get creative and add some improvements on the original game. That's a fine idea in of itself. It's an older game, and can't quite compete with modern games from the genre. But was it necessary, and did it actually add anything of value to the game?No. In short, no, absolutely not. The visual improvement added to the game were - in no way - a neccessity. In fact, I'd go as far as saying that they lower the value of the product. The enhancements include (but are not limited to): Faster animations for units, new smooth shadow effect for 3D models, blown out brightness, colours and contrast in menus, animated backgrounds replaced with static images, a subtle bloom effect, and ""terrain depth"". What does any of this mean? The game looks, and feels, very different from the game you remember. And no, it's not just from my rose-tinted glasses. Boot up the original game and have a look for yourself, the original - unextended - still works just fine, and then compare it with some images from this one. The EE looks... cheaper. I can't say I care much about the menu being broken, but the ingame improvements takes a bit getting used to. Luckily a few of them can be turned off, but many cannot be changed back.However. Having said that. It still plays the same as it always did, and that's really all we should care about. Yes, the changes are weird, useless, and somewhat overpriced, but it's still RISE OF NATIONS on Steam! With gamespy-free multiplayer! And workshop support! (And built-in streaming through Twitch, if you're into that sort of thing). So in the end, this ""Extended"" game is worth it - if you want it to be. No more CDs. No more multiplayer through Hamachi. No more ini-tweaks for higher resolutions. Just press Play and go.			"

												Rise of Nations: Extended Edition10/10A side note: I am extremely biased. I loooove Rise of Nations. Played it back when I was a kid almost all of my free time. This is one of those games that got me into gaming. Rise of Nations is what I would call an in-depth Real-Time Strategy. You have four major things to manage - resources, technology, structure, and military. Any RTS fan will love this classic title. The Extended Edition brings updated textures and Steam intigration, but there's not much new. The multiplayer works just fine; I can't complain. My favourite game.			"

												This RTS game is way more complex than you might think at first. For example the economic system consists of 5 different ressources + knowledge, which is for research only, but not less important. You can also trade your ressources and the price depends on supply and demand of all players. So the games complexity motivates for a long time.			"

												I've been waiting for this game to get a digital release on Steam for so long since Gamespy was closed down. The game is a combination of Civilization and AoE. Do yourself a favor and buy this game if you're a fan of Real-time strategy.If you have never played RoN get this game.If you already own it, get the Steam version anyway. This is simply the best RTS ever, I still remember 6-7 years ago when my friends and I used to do LAN parties on this game at their place and play for hours. I was known in the Gamespy community as one of the best RoN players, and now it's back. Nothing has changed except the graphics. What more can I say?Get it now, and prepare to get nuked. 10/10 would recommend.			"

I also heartily recommend this game to those who want to add it to their collection of solid ageless games, this one is a classic.  When I heard that BHG's was auctioning off this game in their bankruptcy sale, I was hoping that it would make it to Steam.  This game still rocks as it did 10 year ago.  I still have the box from the old version of the game, but for the Mac and wish I could've used that license.  But alas, it was only $20 to get the game I've wanted to play again and again.			"

												The true followup to Age of Empires II, Rise of Nations incorporates some nifty complexities from empire-building games like Civilization while reducing the amount of micromanagement you need to succeed. If there's a complaint I can level against the game, it's that all the civilizations start feeling pretty samey once you reach the Modern Age and the chariots, Roman legions, and war elephants give way to tanks and howitzers. But even that complaint sort of disappears when you can drop a nuclear ICBM on a bunch of medieval peasants.It's a good game!			"

I got this game during the steam sale and already have 11 hours soaked into it, and as a RTS gamer I can conclude that this is an all time favorite, and I recommend this game to anyone who loves this genre of gaming.

												Alright, as far as I know I can keep this review pretty short.This is just Rise of Nations the Original with the expansion ""Thrones and Patriots"". They didn't change any gameplay formulas, nor did they change anything for multiplayer games. Which means you can just as always play through direct connect if you want to; which has always been an important feature of this game in my opinion.The only thing they actually did change is the resolution setting. You can run this game in High res HD from now on and it looks just as the old thing, just a tad better.So, if you liked the old Rise of Nations, then you gonna like this version also. It's the old familiar Rise of Nations for modern systems.			"

												This is one of my favorite games of all time. My adventures with RoN started back about 6 years ago. It was one of those games I'd go back to year after year, I managed to get several friends in the meantime hooked on the game. It was contagious, as they'd occasionaly let their friends in on it. However, many of us had to rely on Gameranger for it to work, as not only was Gamespy a POS, different versions of the game didn't work with eachother correctly. For example, buying the gold version which was the normal game and its expansion didn't work with someone who had the expansion but didn't get it via gold version. So multiplayer was a weird hassle on this, and difficult to acquire legally. Then it showed up on Steam, answering all these problems.It's an amazing RTS, and has some elements of Civ V that aren't really seen in other RTS games. A very amazing game that is deep and complex, a must purchase.			"

For now it's about making the biggest army i tought we will get to nuke each other but it wasn't as i tought			"

												10/10Ooooooooooooooh yeah!This is a re-release of a classic RTS of long standing. For 10 years this has been the high-water-mark of the genre, and most of us who had it on day 1 are veteran players of those 10 years. For those of you who don't know (and I guess that's why you're reading this after all) Imagine if Total War had a lovechild with Age of Empires. There's a turn-based global map where your civilization expands and fights on their way to world domination, and each turn there are battles for the territory you wish to gain or hold.Each nation has an innate advantage, and with the building of world wonders on the global map, can be enhanced further, while resources from captured territory are available in later battles too. All of this might make you think that the RTS part is less vital, but in fact the action is just as hot down there. A wide range of units and technologies in each historical period are on hand to take down enemy settlements, and a variety of defensive structures to hold them off.On a downside, there are a number of known bugs right now, but the devs are releasing regular patches to deal with those.

												A friend wanted me to get this game during the Christmas sale so we could play. I bought it and we did a 2v2 match, despite me being new to the game, he ended up destorying my German empire and brought a new order to the game. Our second match we were on a team, I was Dutch this time. I advanced farther than anyone and got to the information age before he even got to the gunpowder age. He was under attack. The dutch made 20 nukes and ended the world. GGThird match, we were both controlling the Indians. I massed produced everything and we came more advanced than our oppenent. The indians made nukes. We ended the world.What I really want to say about this game is that it's extremely fun, but you can also make peaceloving countries and nations make nukes. You can also make extinct nations have nukes. Nukes are the best.			"

												This game holds up so much better than most AAA releases 4 years ago. I love this game, it is like the best parts of age of empires and the civilization series combined into one. Plus add on top of that there is essentially a hands on version of risk. It might sound like the game is trying to take to much on at once. Its not. It does everything perfectly. The graphics hold up really well. If it came out today just like it is and people had never heard of it before, I beleive it would still get praised today just like it did when it came out. The price isn't to bad when I bought it for $15 compared to age of mythology at $23. Its worth it. It has multiplayer. I know this is a re-release, but it doesn't feel like one. Its just good.			"

												This is by no means a new game, it's an old classic that has been given a facelift of sorts and re-released. Thankfully it is also one of the best RTS games ever made, so re-releasing it on Steam was always going to be a great move. The overwhelming majority of buyers will already be very familiar with the gameplay, nothing has changed there. The only changes are graphical, which to be honest haven't been done that well. The graphics are a bit glitchy at times, as is the somewhat crackly sound, and these could really do with being addressed as they are spoiling things slightly. Other than that, it's the classic RTS game we all know and love, only now i can finally play it at 2560x1440 and put my CD to rest. Better yet, my old Thrones And Patriots expansion CD was knackered, so i couldn't install it... Now i have it again. This game is well worth buying and if they address the graphics and sound glitches, will become an essential purchase.			"

												A perfect mash up of Civilization and Age of Empires. Fun to play, deep, strategic, challenging, and, if you play on the default rules, will end in no more than an hour. The extended edition has a few bugs that were not present in the original release (Music not playing for awkward lengths of time in game, hotkeys not saving, some minor graphical tweaks) but it's still the RoN we knew and loved.

												I've played a lot of RTSs, and Rise of Nations is definitely in my top 3. Sure, a lot of this may be nostalgia, but RoN has a lot of refined RTS mechanics. All resources are renewable, so you don't end up mining all the gold and stone while chopping down every tree on the map that late game Age of Empires can turn into. The UI is amazing (top left corner tells you the income rate for each resource) and the control group system is better than any other RTS out there. You can set a unit to be the waypoint of buildingss, and newly created units will join the control group(s) of that waypoint unit. The attrition/border system, the wonders, and the fact that the time frame of RoN spans from the Stone Age to the Information Age will make RoN feel like a Civilization game in RTS form, and that's definitely not a bad thing. I strongly, strongly recommend RoN: EE is you're a fan of RTSs.			"

												In a nut shell this game is similar to Civilization V but in a RTS form instead of a turn base game.You will need to upgrade your ""technology"" just like Civilization VYou will get to play different unit from the stone ages(man welding stick) until modern age(man welding guns) just like Civilization VYou will get to use nuke just like Civilization VThere is countries like Germany and Britian just like Civilization VThe similarity with Civilization V did not hinder my purchase as it's a totally different concept. I always wanted to play a game similar to Civilization V but in a RTS version, this game was great in that aspect!Although the graphic is not really that great but it did not affect the game play at all, it may have actually enchance the game play.TL;DR Best S$5"" I ever spent.

												It's just as good as I remember it, so for those who've already played RoN, skip the first two parragraphs. RoN is a brilliant game which reqires just as much brainpower than it does firepower. Each nation has its strengths and weaknesses, the goal is build your strengths and hide your weaknesses. For example, letting the British bomb you with their lancaster bombers is a terrible idea, but their groud forces are no match to the Americans. It's a diverse balancing game which works extremely well. Througought the years I played the game, I hadn't played one multiplayer game, it was all spent in conquer the world, which is an incredibly fun game mode. You take control of a nation, and your goal is conquer.. Well.. The world. There are several different scenarios you can play though, including the reign of Alexander the Great and conquering the Americas as the Spanish. I touched on the multiplayer, it needs signficant improvement, although that was to be expected with such a game. The game starts to flicker at 1920x1080, although that's likely the fault of my integrated graphics over the game itself. All in all, a great buy. For the lovers of the franchise, it brings back old memories blissfully. For the newcommers, it will be a new, unique journey.			"

												I have no particularly negative opinions about the company that brought this game and another favourite AOE2 to Steam - I haven't battle tested either game's multiplayer - but the single player aspects are spot on in this re-release, and I was more than happy to invest the preorder funds to play this long lost classic again - and it stands up well. So familiar and ingrained is this game that I spent more than 5 years away from it and was able to get right back into the swing of it within minutes. The graphics are gorgeous, the performance is almost flawless (I did experience some odd unit disappearances in my first game) and the modern resolutions are a welcome addition.			"

												Rise of Nations is a classic. A must play for fans of the strategy genre. The games allows you to lead a nation to glory. You can choose from 18 different nations and you begin your quest to advance throughout the ages. Begin in the stone age and advance all the way to the information age. Determine the Government of your nation and how it is run. Create massive armies and wage war against neigboring nations. Each nation has their own special abilities and special units you can command on the battlefield. Rise of Nations truly stands the test of time as being one of the greatest strategy games ever. I highly recommend this game to any fan of the genre. If you are still skeptical about buying it (Because let's be honest, the $20 mark is a bit dis-heartening) at least pick it up during a sale.

												As much as I'd like to give this game a good review I can't. The devs have deemed it necessary that every battle in all the campaigns has to have a time limit. I personally hate being stressed out to complete anything within a given time. I like to take my time, explore my options, think about my strategy. Might as well be playing an arcade game, spam your armies, rush your apponent.			"

												Rise of nations is like a combination of age of empires and civilisation. You start in the early ages of wooden sticks and tools and slowly (or quickly if you change the settings) to the industrial age of muskets and redcoats and then even all the way up to the modern day age with nuclear weapons, tanks and machine guns.This games has some features that I really like that other RTS's of this type don't have. These are things such as territories based on cities and castles you make, attrition damage to enemy or neutral nations in your territory and the ability to cause the game to end as a draw by the over use of nuclear weapons on a map.There is a conquer the world campaign that can be done but requires hours and hours to complete which might leave some players bored but great supporters of the game to enjoy. It, in the simplest explanation possible, is a turn based map in which you chose to invade each time, another location to attack which leads into a RTS battle each time in which the winner takes the territory. This can cause some players to get bored of this but many game types are added into the battles to cause a variety of gameplay.Overall I think ""Rise of Nations"" is an amazing game which takes some of the greatest bits of other strategy games and combines them with unique ideas to create this masterpiece. 10/10 recommend this game.

I am still playing to day and I was very excited to see it remastered and released on Steam. I could never get the original version to work on Windows 7 but this new version works great!I have played a lot of RTS games (C&C collection, Warcraft 1 & 2, Starcraft 1 & 2, Company of Heros, World in Conflict, Star Wars: Empire at War, etc) an Rise of Nations is the best of them all. I can't get enough of this game.			"

												So why should you buy a game that's over 10 years old?Because Rise of Nations remains, to this day, one of the most unique RTS experiences you'll find.Think of Rise of Nations like Civ in real time. You research four different categories Military, Civics, Commerce, and Science to progress from Ancient Age to Information Age (full on stealth bombers and nukes). There are tons of different civs to choose from, each one featuring its own unique units and civ bonuses. Where Rise of Nations really shines, though, is in its Conquer the World Risk-style campaign. This is hands-down one of the best single player experiences you are likely to get. Not only is it the best implementation of this style of campaign gameplay but each overworld encounter can lead to a multitude of different scenarios in the RTS proper. It's still my favorite campaign style ever made and it's a real shame it never caught on in other games.So really, why should you buy this? Because even with the slightly outdated graphics this is still one of the best RTSes made of all time. This Extended Edition re-release simply makes a great game even better, with tons of multiplayer improvements across the board (especially as this game was originally hosted by now defunct Gamespy). This is one of those games that, even before it was re-released, I threw in my computer about once a year (from my original CD) and happily played.Buy it, you won't be disappointed "

Posted: June 15, 2014
												An epic classic that combines the elements of a more complex game like Civilization, with the less management based feeling of games like Age of Empires. A strange blend that somehow works for the better. If you're an RTS fan looking for a new stallion for the stable, or a Civilization fan looking for something a little bit more fast pased, then short answer is you'll probably like this.Now, the long answer is that this game is a blend of the empire management features from Civ, such as working about captured 'rare resources', expanding the available territory you own, and harvesting resources without them being harvested away completely.From Age of Empires, the game draws the faster pased action of the mixed unit combat, and the tactical rock-paper-scissors between units, along side the actual building of cities and structures, and rapid pase of gameplay to advance through the ages.However, Rise of Nations brings fresh concepts to the table, such as units in foreign territory having to deal with 'attrition' which slowly drains their health unless kept in supply with wagons. As well as a VERY customizable single AND multiplayer game hosting which allows you to adjust a fair few options to better suit your playstyle, and nations to support this without being cripplingly overspecialized.The biggest negatives I can point to in this particular incairnation of the series are that the water reflection graphical option seems to cause severe lag issues on older, more middle range computers, and that the game itself does NOT like to be alt-tabbed in any sense, I myself have had issues where doing this causes my entire computer to lag severely, and re-enlarging the game has causes the in-game audio to drop out. Also, the largest maps seem to perhaps have issues with not playing well when hosted, often causing players to drop. Perhaps the worst though is that there is MINOR desync between players when the matches get particularly heavy, with multiple nations and massive armies squaring off, but even then it's minor at worst.If you're willing to put up with a game that's got a few warts, being pretty much a re-release of an existing game, then Rise of Nations is a definate consideration. If you're looking for a unique, very underappreciated gem in the RTS genre, then by all means consider the game. If you're looking for a perfect diamond that fixes all the existing issues, then please consider something else, or just don't complain when it isn't flawless.			"

													Absolutely brilliant in every way, shape and form.  Radically different but also intuitive, Rise of Nations represents a clear evolutionary step in the RTS genre years after its initial release.  Excellently balanced between military and civic development, the game is perpetually a race to bigger and better things in lieu of the typical zerg rush of modern strategy trappings.  	In the vein of turn based strategy games, the civic portion of your society is equally important to the aspect of military dominance of your opponent.  Moving at a constant pace seems like a frantic addition to a real time strategy, but it's handled expertly by categorizing the different parts of your society, such as military developments and economic additions.  As your society expands, you research different epochs of civilization, moving from simple trappings to a modern society.  	A starting civilization has a city, library, and a couple of farms and wood cutters.  It quickly grows to encompass a mighty empire, but does so in a logical way with resources evolving to fit the times.  At first, food and wood are the primary resources, but quickly this morphs to ore and knowledge, and then moves to finally to ore and iron.  The progression succinctly reflects a modern society, and is intuitive.  	From the humble worker to the greatest sea vessel, upgrades are represented visually and functionally, as fire ships eventually become submarines, biplanes become jet fighters, and cavalry turn into fearsome tanks.  Tactics lean slightly towards rock paper scissors and wolf pack tactics over strategic play, but largely a well governed force will overcome superior numbers if targeting is well managed.  This becomes apparent during the later epochs when submarines wreak havoc in engagements with larger ships.  Buildings follow a similar ascetic, reflecting your advancement through the ages.  Beyond being a visual treat, it serves as a visual aid for your progress in the game without having to hunt through menus.  	Following the ascetic are upgrades that are logically suited to both the locations they're available at as well as the time they're in.  Libraries act as a central research hub, and offer the multitude of civilization advances you'd expect for a modern society.  Mining organizations grow to improve operations, barracks improve soldiers, and so forth.  It's a simple design choice, but welcome due to the massive amount of improvements available.  Being appropriate to the age is an added bonus, further adding to your immersion.  	Excellent gameplay extends to the multiplayer arena, with excellent optimization for online play making play a breeze.  The options are somewhat limited for multiplayer, with only a handful of maps offered.  More variety would have helped, but the game excels where it counts.  	Unique and enthralling, Rise of Nations is a treat to play.  A brilliant reproduction of the history of modern societies, it captures the choices of a civil enterprise with the expanse of a military empire.  After all this time, it still stands as a strong testament of design and aesthetic which will keep you coming back for countless hours of empire building.			"

												As someone who typically doesn't get into RTS because of the steep learning curves, I love Rise of Nations. It's a classic example of a game that's easy to learn and hard to master. A typical game starts in a medieval era and ends in a post-modern age, giving you a real sense of progression and escalation as more players unlock access to planes, submarines, and nukes. Oh, nukes. Love 'em or hate 'em, nukes are perhaps the most iconic part of Rise of Nations. I've mostly played multiplayer, so I can't say much about the Conquer the World campaigns, but they do look pretty cool.As far as what the ""Extended Edition"" offers, not much. It's basically the original RoN you know and love (and its expansion) brought into the Steam platform with achievements and all that stuff.If you've never played it before, it's definitely worth checking out. If you still own the original, it's still worth getting if only for the sake of playing with your friends over Steam, but perhaps wait until it's on a nice sale.			"

												If you like Civilization 5 or those types of games, you'll love this! Civ 5 is my most played game on steam, and I think this game is better. Without expansion packs Civ 5 begins to feel repetitive and simple and even easy. This game is incredible! It makes strategy work! It's not turn based, and it's much more satisfying when you win. Also, a lot of it is real time so you don't spend a lot of the game on pause (although you can) but you feel much more involved in your cities.			"

												Great old school RTS, it combines the best elements from Age of Empires 2, Age of Empires 3, Empire Earth, Red Alert 2, and the Anno series. It is highly configurable with a variety of different game settings, which gives a high replay value. The AI is great, it behaves with brain and puts up quite a challenge, even on moderate difficulty. The multiplayer works and is very easy to use, both with friends or in public.However the game is not worth 20€. Get it for 5€ when it goes on sale.			"

												The memories... ah. This game was the pinnacle of my gaming childhood, and it still stands strong today. Started playing this game around 2006-2007, I still have the CD and its case and manual as well for the original game, I now have 3 copies of the game:Rise of NationsRise of Nations: Thrones and PatriotsRise of Nations: Extended EditionOh yeah baby. Anyway, why do you want to buy this game?It's immersive. It sucks you in, spits you out, and you rebuild, start over and then do it all over again. Its unique, not repetitive, and just simply amazing gameplay. You can create your own scenarios, and now, you can download other peoples scenarios through Steam Workshop! Even better! You don't have to join through IP anymore, just invite your friend and off you go. Are you a beginner to strategy games? Don't worry, this is the perfect beginner strategy game, and is also for the hardcore strategy players too! Also with the Conqour the World scenarios, you can change history to suit you, such as being the Aztecs and taking over the whole of America (Spoiler: They didn't). This game is unrivaled by other strategy games, and is easily the best game I have ever played, my absolute favourite game in the whole world, even more than Halo 2 (But just a bit more)! Buy this game, join the community, we're waiting for you!			"

I know many people have issues in MP, but I can only complain about...- ... some performance problems both in SP and MP. Some FPS-drops when playing on ""big huge"" maps.- Unfortunately, the pop cap has still not been raised to over 200. Especially for late game this is a real bummer...Overall: 8/10 Points. "

You NEED to tweak your settings though when you first play the game. Initially I encountered massive lag in just a four player game. After turning off V-Sync and adjusting some other small options it played just fine. Really great game for twenty dollars.			"

												A real-time strategy with depth to it. I'm personally a fan of the Age of Empires series, and this is like all three of them plus the modern era, which I like. There are a diversity of possible strategies and upgrade paths, and the large swath of history and geography covered could enable all sorts of interesting custom maps. The only complaint I really have about it is that there isn't a heap of diversity among the available military units; which, to be fair, is to be expected when you have approx 20-30 different nations available. The graphics could be considerably more flashy, but they're okay, and graphics aren't everything about a game anyway - the gameplay makes up for it about thrice over.There are a few little oddities and glitches, but nothing game-breaking - they all mostly correct themselves.Then you realise that this game was originally released more than ten years ago. It's aged very well - I honestly didn't notice from the game itself (except maybe the 2D graphics) that it was of any significant age. RTS fans, this is good value right here.			"

												I might dont have a lot of hours but this game simply is great, even if its old.If you like series like AOE - AOM etc ..... buy this.It use the same structure and add more unique things like cities and how you should build few of them and connect them to each other, and the allies\foe ability is good addition, while many ages can keep you hooked for along time in each match.8\10 and i recommend it for sure if not at full price surely at sale.

												I've spent 100s of hours on this game off of Steam, and all in all it is one of my favourite RTS games. There is a ton of variety, whether it comes to civ choices, map choices, victory conditions, etc, there is just a ton of customizability for each game you play meaning that the replay value for this title is immense.My only complaint, which isn't really a complaint but more of an observation, is that late-game multiplayer can often end up being a stalemate unless a team fails to research Missile Shields and gets themselves nuked. I find this is mostly due to the static resources, where unlike games such as Age of Empires, your resources are unlimited in the sense  that you never have to worry about moving that citizen and finding another oil well, forest, or mountain, because they will never run dry, be completely cut down, or mined of all its minerals. Overall, I'd have to give this game an 9/10. It's a superb game, with superb replay value.			"

												I first started playing Rise of Nations in 2005, and boy this game was great and still is 'till this day. In Rise of Nations, you control a Nation, each Nation in the game has its own unique units(e.g. troops) and a special power, with the Nation you must adapt to the changing world, gather resources, research technolgy, expand territory, build and army and defeat other Nations. This game's concept is so simple yet so fun! I highly recommend this game if you favor RTS's or are just starting to get into the RTS genre because this game is good for both beginners and RTS veterans(such as myslef).			"

												I loved this game back in the day because there was no such thing as STD matches. Yes you heard me, STD. It has become the standard game where everyone starts nomadic, tech is expensive as ♥♥♥♥ and you always start from the ancient age. Just like STD's, this STD spread through the rise of nations community turning people into rushers and making the people new to the game hate it. Not one game i have played where there hasn't been a damn horsearcher prancing through,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and pillinging my village full of women and children. I send my one unit of hoplites after the horse archer but he just shoots them from a distance and ends up killing them. Then another horse archer comes and soon my village is being ♥♥♥♥ed! by these damn men shooting their arrows from their horses! Oh and my teamates just watch and dont help. So ♥♥♥♥ you rushers, ok? ♥♥♥♥ YOU. But if you can get past this cancer of the RIse of nations world i would reccomand this to you.			"

It's much more fast-paced and resources are easier to collect, allowing for more strategising. I haven't noticed any bugs, but the textures are starting to look a bit dated after 10 years.9.5/10 buy it now.			"

												A very fun RTS that can easily eat up 1 to 2 hours per game.  Single player is enjoyable as there are multiple game modes that can be played including Team vs Team, Free for all, and several historical Campaigns that can be played through.  If you don't like a particular win condition or tech level, switch the game type to Custom and set your own rules. Multiplayer is the same as single player but it is difficult to connect and stay connected with games hosted by others.  Skill levels vary greatly, but as a secret to getting good I suggest building several cities as quickly as possible to generate more wealth which can be used to purchase a variety of resources.Build quickly and may the best nation win!9.5/10			"

												As soon as i saw this game, It lured me in. My roots playing videogames date back to when I was 8. I remember asking my father what he was doing. ""I'm playing a video game, son"". From that point on I've been gaming. Anyway, when got steam in somwhere around december 2011/2012 I immediately jumped to the first 4X game I could find, Civ V. And now im here, reviewing what could be better or worse than civ, in my opinion.RoN draws many similarities to AoE, wherin you control your units in realtime, building cities, marching armies, and advancing through technological ages, all simultaneously to the A.I. It start to differ from AoE however, in the content category. It spans the entire time humans have been on earth instead of the middle ages, it has air units, nuclear weapons, advanced battleships,  big freakin' Tiger tanks, you name it. I simply cant reccomend Age of Empires II HD over this game, it just has more content. as for how it looks, its not amazing, but you have to expect that, as this game was originally from '03, and got remastered. It's not NEXT GEN ULTRA PHOTOREALISTIC, its more EARLY 21st CENTURY POLYGONAL GRAPHICS.The A.I. isnt as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as it is in other RTSs either, its actually a challenge on hard.This game also has a ""Conquer the World"" gametype, that fused the RTS elements with some turn-based gameplay, similar to Total War games. Its cool, but the turn-based gameplay needs polish.Overall, I can see why it was GOTY 2003, great game.9/10			"

												I might dont have a lot of hours but this game simply is great, even if its old.If you like series like AOE - AOM etc ..... buy this.It use the same structure and add more unique things like cities and how you should build few of them and connect them to each other, and the allies\foe ability is good addition, while many ages can keep you hooked for along time in each match.8\10 and i recommend it for sure if not at full price surely at sale.

												Overall a really good RTSOne of the old ones microsoft brought back from the grave with some upgrades like DX10 and DX11. It includes the expansion pack from the original so there's a lot of content. Gameplay is basically a mix between the real time strategy of Age of Empires and the upgrades through differn't time periods of civilization. It's a ton of fun to command hordes of units and just watch massive battles unfold.			"

												Rise of Nations, one of the best RTS' out there. I've played thousands of times with my father, though I recently lost the disc and we can't play multiplayer anymore, which is why I'm buying him this for Father's Day. This game is amazing, there's not much more to say about it. I like the new graphics the EE brings, though I haven't noticed much else from it, and that's a good thing. I loved the original game, and I want it as close to the original as possible. I will say one thing though; I suck without my da. He's amazing at offensive, but I'm really only good defending. I try to set up my soldiers very neatly, might be OCD, I don't know, but my dad doesn't really care. Anyways, back to the actual game. The game itself is alot of AoE, but, in my opinion, alot better. It's a good game for fans of AoE, and people who are new to RTS games, as it's quite easy to learn, and the learn-to-play tutorial doesn't take that long, about an hour not counting the learn as you go.Anyways, might just be the nostalgia but. 10/10			"

												Rise of nations is the best strategy game ever and I am a strategy game lover ! Lots of nations to choose from and a sense that you have an impact on the evolution of your nation (and the ones around it) to reach your strategic goals (which could include world domination). The solo campaign (a Risk-style conquer the world) is absotely genius (each battle is a game instead of a dice roll). The multiplayer is epic. There's many game modes (and therefore many ways to win a game).I had the original version of Rise of Natons, and the Steam version is ever cooler !

												What an interesting game, it is awesome. Basically it is like a working, interactive detailed encyclopedia of sorts that offers a tough thorough challenge. One that flows meticulously and smoothly takes you transitioning through the centuries whilst ''turning the page'' culminating in the modern 'Information Age', which is in my opinion somewhat of an unique element to this game and a rare techno-thriller-esque aspect in this particular genre as well as is in gaming overal..Game has a lot to choose from, a lot to do involving a variety of Nations.. that 'rise' through the ages. There is a lot to explore in this context alone and baring such design choices as to have it reflect realism, be in real-time and having great detailed amount of depth are a few reasons for me besides the engaging combat to really like the game (love it). Many possibilities here, you can basically adjust any of the settings and parameters to go and have a fight in any of the 8 ages for instance. The game is Huge and has much potential in regards to gaming and where it manages to take it.Action wise gameplay has RTS-style micromanagement system set in place that is very detailed and refined. Kinda important considering that this is a classic (or rather; a remake thereof). The game is controllable in real-time and is not 'alien' to these types of games consisting of a vast variety of military units to choose and to build from with various roles to engage in with regards to their application on the battlefield: the game has a lot of variation to offer based on the factions and thus the (various) units alone. Combat wise game consists of Sea Air and Land units that are upgradable as you go on, advancing through time as you build your cities growing your nation and thus expand thy borders. This building/advancing is done through the in game 'tech-tree' which I was amazed by because it is like an 'RPG'-mechanic well integrated into the game. Very smart.On top of this action phase the game has a base building mechanic (cities) that adds such a strategic layer to the gameplay on top of the already rich and detailed tactical combat elements with an adjustable A.I. difficulty to choose from that make it ''come to life'' when playing against the computer opponent or opponents that are tweakable a-lot, advanced and in this way quite detailed and customizable like the rest of the game is. This is important because it makes the learning and getting into the game easier and holds it 'alive' and relevant ''even'' today as it were, in a sense making it ''never'' get repetitive boring and 'old' but rather grow into something that is like a fine wine and thus ages as such, getting better with time (relative to ones skill advance).A point to note is that when in the heat of the moment, in battle engagements; the action feels very accurate and tactile sort of like a simulation would be and thus the 'build-up' can get very intense and is great fun.. as far as 'slaughtering your opponents' goes or counts (in a virtual sense of these words), I guess. It is the part of issuing commands and assimilating others that is so fun. One point about the game is that it isn't overly complicated once passed the initial learning threshold and gained insights that come through experience will aid you might you choose to bend, rather to brake that is.. It is familiar and that's a good thing I think (considering classic RTS-games). A bit dated, it is and this is noticeable but in my opinion not a 'biggy' as in a negative. Positive thing about the game (depending on your preference and ultimately patience/skill) is that the in game 'rounds' tend to last for a long time, like in hour or hours so in this sense the whole experience is exhilarating. The source of resources grows steady from within your cities allowing for more freedom of time thus more space to spend on planning, building your base and preparing your troops once you get the correct build order you can then work on your general strategy and on your tactics as in what to do and how to actually execute an offensive plan. In the mean-while in this regard; remember these few things: Despite having these resources available to manage and fine-tune it is imperative to ''catch'' the 'pendulum swing' at the right time with regards to attacking in the rounds or otherwise you'll be having to play catch-up when it comes to your army and depending on the difficulty base defense won't always work (specially considering enemies swarming at higher difficulties and later in the rounds the 'Nuke'-factor). In this regard: Attacking is key as offense is best defense and as you can't really defend that efficiently unless you attack and capture opponents territory that's exactly what they'll be doing to you. In this regard a lot of it is all about right timing as in: when to act (attack & expand) opposed to when [not to] act (defend and react). Enemies are persistent and smart therefore making these rounds filled with intense long-lasting and rich tactical combat, where enemies will flank you using multiple armies and basically throw everything and the kichen sink at you which is in my opinion another added bonus from the gameplay itself; that it: isn't short, that it is detailed, tough, varied and extensive; that it is basically so similarly true to life in regard to the nature of the lore itself (conflict; war).This 'tick' or knack (for timing) is something that is prevalent throughout the whole game and might add yet another layer to the depth of the whole because of the various timers and counters involved. This is a game that is admittedly 'all in all' difficult to master, but manageable to get into and appealing to stick with because of its layered structure even though at first play-troughs it might come as overwhelming and confusing 'Rise of Nations' is like a somewhat more advanced game of chess (in 'real-time') with similar ''basic'' true & tried mechanics that work but what otherwise feels far-reaching and having so many more possibilities within the gameplay rooted in the graphics design, sound esthetics along with the games mechanics (and the 'A.I.') that make the complete game experience lively spectacular and engaging even for such a great classic.

Hence, everyone needs plenty of training before competing in online games, or even against bots. Steam did a great job on relaunching it.			"

												One of the greatest RTS games ever created. It captures the massive scope of a Civilization game, while keeping the action moving at a faster pace. I would highly recommend it. I've been playing this game since it's launch in 2003, and I still haven't gotten bored.			"

												It might be an old RTS game, but still very fun than most of new RTS game.Rise of nations is about how you manage your skill in time management, judgement, and exploration. What tech you need to research first, what enemy that u mush crush in the first, where you should build your next village, when you should start the battle and conquest, how you will beat your opponent. I really have a good quality time with this game.If you want to try this game I advice you to grab this game on holiday sales... :)			"

												Rise of Nations is an older RTS with a gimmick few others have dared attempt. Rise of Nations permits players to advance through eight ""ages"", representing all of human history from the classical Greco-Roman empires all the way to the modern day. Critically, Rise of Nations manages to be engaging every step of the way.Only one other RTS I know of shares Rise of Nation's gimmick - Empire Earth, a game with an inarguably stronger focus on detail and historical accuracy (And the addition of cool future ages). However, where Empire Earth excels in its detail and its mimicry of the sweeping changes in warfare which occur between each great technological age (and the complete uselessness of obsolete units), Rise of Nations is more accessible and more streamlined for the sort of gameplay both games forward.The traditional RTS formula is a worker unit is sent to collect resources, it collects until its capacity is full, and then it returns the load to a central gathering point. This continues until the worker is killed, resources run out, the gathering point is destroyed, or the worker is given a different order. This is the formula used by StarCraft, StarCraft II, Age of Empires, Age of Empires II, Empire Earth, Empire Earth II, and nearly every other RTS game. It's a good system - it forces players to keep expanding to acquire new resources, attaches a hard limit to the amount one worker can help the economy, and gives the OPFOR plenty of opportunities to interrupt supply shipments.Rise of Nations breaks from tradition in this respect. In Rise of Nations, it is necessary to construct specialized gathering points for each resource - Mines for metal, Farms for food, Woodcutter camps for Timber, Universities for Knowledge, and Oil Wells for Oil. Farms, Oil Wells, and Universities produce a set amount of their respective resources per worker garrisoned in them, and each have their own unique rules. Mines and Woodcutter camps have different maximum garrison capacities depending on exactly where they're placed - a small mountain may mean a Mine can only have three workers, but a huge forest may let a Woodcutter camp have ten. Once the gathering point has been constructed and the workers garrisoned, the gathering point provides a set amount of resources every 30 seconds until destroyed or the workers are given other tasks (Resources never run out).In Empire Earth, the core gameplay is about the military-industrial complex. It takes so long to replace dead units and destroyed buildings that the game becomes about forcing the enemy away from those things. With resources scattered across the map, elements of risk are inescapable and it's just a reality that there will be no effective central organization of any army since walling a settlement in is so expensive. Everything you do in Empire Earth relates back to protecting your military buildings because if they are destroyed you won't get an opportunity to replace them.In Rise of Nations, core gameplay is about map control. Map control is represented by ""territory"", multicolored lines drawn on the land itself to show which player has control of what. Territory grants a lot of benefits - it increases the firing rate of your artillery, damages enemy units, lets you place down buildings, and can grant other abilities depending on your nation specialty. The earliest, and most significant, provider of territory are cities. You begin the game with one city, and it is by cities that Rise of Nations is won or lost. If your capital city is taken, you have a limited amount of time to take it back or every building you own defects to the player who took your capital and all your units commit hara-kiri. Needless to say, you're defeated. The city is more than just a gaping strategic vulnerability, however - it's the biggest sole provider of territory, and the biggest contributor to a player in Rise of Nations.Cities have a radius, called an ""economic radius"", within which they provide extra health to buildings and can supercharge the gathering rates of resource structures by up to three times. Additionally, some buildings can only be built in cities (Universities, Markets, Oil Refineries, Granaries, Lumber Mills, Smelters, Senates, Temples, Libraries, Farms). Most of these buildings are huge contributors in Rise of Nations, so cities are very important. A city can be upgraded, with its economic radius and benefit to building health growing as more types of buildings are constructed in it. On top of that, cities heal units garrisoned inside them and themselves fire on enemy units if there are units inside the city. Accordingly, a city and its civilians can stand off military units acting alone. Cities also provide small incomes of Food and Timber.Cities are automatically named after historical cities of that nation, but can be renamed. Everything you do in Rise of Nations goes back to your cities, back to the complicated web of buildings you've constructed in them. Ultimately, even special world wonders can be constructed in cities to provide unique bonuses to your nation.And that brings us to the military aspect. War is very much a part of Rise of Nations, and it is the best way to win matches. In Empire Earth and most RTs games, it is necessary to order every individual soldier, but Rise of Nations offers us something called an ""infinite queue"" which causes a building to repeat its build orders until the building is destroyed, resources run out, or the population limit is reached. The infinite queue changes RTS warfare by letting a game as macro as Rise of Nations be about the macro. With enough resources, it is not merely possible but practical to overrun an opponent with sheer numbers or keep an airbase constantly supplying planes to a beleaguered front. But merely because I am a fan of the hammer that is a horde of thousands of soldiers charging doesn't mean there aren't other, more tactical options available. There are. Generals passively increase the survivability of your soldiers and offer special abilities useful for outmaneuvering and outguessing opponents while spies can make enemy units spy for you or actively turn them to your side and explorers kill enemy spies, blow up buildings, and snipe vulnerable military units. Missile silos can blow up any specific enemy building with a cruise missile, or devastate the economic radius of a fully mature city with a nuke. Airbases send out fighters to pick off enemy units, kill generals and shoot down bombers or launch brute waves of their own bombers to batter down enemy buildings. Attack helicopters pick off ridiculous numbers of tanks and submarines for their cost while being immune to any return fire. Ranged cavalry and armored cars can pick off generals and supply wagons to let enemy soldiers die from territory damage, or conduct deep raids to kill enemy workers and weaken their economy. On top of all this, special generals are available from the Senate who provide unique benefits in addition to game-long bonuses to your nation.In addition, strategic resources are available which both provide additional income of basic resources but offer special abilities (Some of which are more or less overpowered). Basically, who your nation is and precisely what its good at evolves dynamically through the game based on what opportunities are available, what is exploited, what you started with, and what your opponent(s) do. On top of all this, there's a highly amusing ""conquer the world"" mode which serves as the game's campaigns. Basically, this mode links all the battles you fight to tell the story of a great empire from the beginning of its history to the day it conquered the world or failed to do so.But the best part of Rise of Nations is how it all comes together. I'm about at the character limit, so take the fact that I'm not even close to done talking speak for itself. I highly recommend it if you have any room in your heart.			"

												If you enjoy Classic RTS games like AOE, this is a must have. Slightly more complex than Age of empires but not as challenging as games such as civilisation, this game is a great play for both solo and multiplayer. If you are not a fan of strategy games however, this is not for you. Though it is dated now, it won awards such as PC game of the year in 2003. It's a must have in a library of classics. Just don't expect modern graphics and physics.			"

You liked AoE2, Empire Earth and CIV? Well, I have very good news for you!To be honest I never heard much about 'Rise of Nations' - but when I saw it on discount I had no doubt that this will be my next real-time strategy game! It looks like a mix of 'Age of Empires', 'Empire Earth' and 'CiV'! Although it has more depth than 'Age of Empires', looks better than 'Empire Earth' and is real-time strategy instead of round-based like 'CiV'.You are able to play with 18 nations, while each has special abilites, build 14 world wonders, which give your nations advantages and create dozens of different maps with a huge variety of game modes!reasons you should buy this game:++ one of the best RTS!+ different ages of time (industrial, classic etc.)+ much more complex than AoE!+ fast managment of troops and cities required+ (possible) strong enemies and allies!+ good multiplayer (ranked possible)+ steam workshop (-> unlimited population limit)+ nice szenarios and campaigns+ huge variety of everything!+ polyphonic soundtrack+ acceptable and updated graphicthis could've been better:+/- city concept can(!) be annoying- forgot to upgrade my infantry- bit more military units would be have been nice- time-consuming achievements- nukes op manI recommend buying this amazing game for everybody who liked similar RTS-games like 'Age of Empires', 'Age of Mythology' or 'Empire Earth' but also for strategy lovers! Especially in a sale their shouldn't be any doubt :)'Rise of Nations' I give you 8,5/10 nukes ♥ "

												If you're looking for a classic RTS experience that surely won't disappoint, you should pick this one up (especially if it's on sale).This game was my go to as a kid and still is today. It introduced me to the RTS genre, and in my eyes remains superior to many modern titles. The game has great replayability, honestly hasn't gotten old for me yet (and I've had it since 2006). Additionally, there's a relatively lively modding community for a title that was originally released in 2001. Still, even though the game’s a classic, it’s not perfect. The in game diplomacy system needs to be reworked. For example, if you start on a team with an AI player and the victory condition is conquest of everybody else, you can expect them to betray you. This will happen especially if you are doing exponentially better than every other player (or if they’re the one who’s doing much better), despite the fact that they win if you’re team wins. Overall, that’s my only big gripe with it.  "

												I tried, I really tried, to get into this game. Just couldn't. I can't figure out why, either. Tried all sorts of modes, tinkered with maps and scripts, used different countries and play styles. I always lost interest and left long before I finished a campaign or battle.I love RTS, turnbased strategy. Strategy in general. This one is just a miss for me.			"

												Rise of Nations is a classic title dating back to my childhood. I fully admit that RTS games have evolved and moved far beyond what you find in RoN, but it still remains a thoroughly enjoyable experience for me to play it again.I’ll skip a detailed review because it is identical to the original form except for the new Steam based multiplayer and Workshop added on. It is still all that it used to be and having native HD resolutions available is a great plus.I admit there were some bugs when it first launched, especially the new multiplayer system, but those were soon patched up. As of the posting date of this review the game runs as advertised for me and I can say it’s still great fun.			"

												Woot more rise of nations. The most polished classic RTS of alll timmmeeee(Company of Heroes is my other favorite RTS). 5/5 would reccommend to anyone who likes RTSs. Very beginner friendly due to automatic worker placement and the macro cap(maximum income system). There is too much to say if you are new to the genre for this game, go watch a specific review for that- this is just to say how it holds up:Graphics and UI:This RTS had a bunch of modern features already- ignoring workers when selecting a whole screen full of military units, autocasting special abilities, not sure what else but it probably has whatever feature you are thinking of(including guarded artillery attack moves).Graphically it does not look amazing, but at least the UI scales decently- I can still see all of the units and buttons fine on my screen and it does not hurt my eyes playing 1680x1050.Multiplayer:Multiplayer works through steam stuff instead of gamespy/gameranger/hamachi headaches.No problems getting into multiplayer matches with 3v3 and etc.Other than those 2 changes, this is the same game it was 10 years ago: still has the interesting tech system and many nations that play differently and have advantages and disadvantages at certain points in time or on certain maps.Well worth 15 dollars.

												A fairly good game, but sploit when the Industrial Age is reached, and the game turns into a pointless rush for oil and weapons. The ""real-time"" aspect adds little to turn-based games such as Civilization, which I still prefer.The Steam version has several bugs, for example relating to music and graphics, and it's now obvious they won't be fixed.I'll still recommend the game, but I suggest you try it out in time to be able to ask for a refund if you find the bugs too annoying.I give the game 7 out of 10, minus 1 for the bugs. so the result is 6 out of 10.

												I used to play the original Rise of Nations when I was really young and loved playing the AI. The tragedy is that only die hards of this game still play it and will be shooting missles at you while you just figured out how to shoot an arrow. What I am saying is, this game is very hard to learn and then compete with people online. Especially given it is a revamped HD version of a game that came out a decade ago. I recommend this game if you're okay with1) sticking to playing against AI for a long, long time2) enjoy getting stomped online very easily3) okay with playing a revamped game from a decade ago and willing to learn its high learning curveThe game truly is a blast from the past, if its on sale and you have friends willing to play with you I think you'll have some real fun with it as its a very cheap $4.99 on sale. I still think civ v is much more worth it and when civ v is on sale its $12.00 for the vanilla game and all the DLC. I know comparing strategy games to civ v is sacrelligous but it had to be said!

												This is what Age of Empires should have been.  The world conquering map is much like RISK, but gameplay is just like AOE.Single, multi, scenario, and various other campaigns.  You can play this game for months and still be surprised by it.Unlike AOE, in RON you can go from a being goat herder to a being nuclear power.  each age has different soldiers/technologies/upgrades that are relevant to playing and beating your opponent.  Luckily the game allows you to build enough defense soon and early in the game while still allowing the tech tree to progress.  This keeps the computer and players from rushing you so much.The game scenario editor allows you to change almost 100 game settings to custom craft your game, leading to a near endless possible games.I recommend this game and hope that you do too.

												I wish I could hit the ""Yes - Recommend"" button several times.  Rise of Nations is the best RTS I've ever played (and I mean this sincerely).  I recently tried ""Act of Aggression"", and yet again we have another RTS trying to get in on the MLG bandwagon that Starcraft started.  Even Grey Goo, which is a great game, is limited to 2v2 or smaller on strict maps to get into the MLG scene; it's just the way the industry is going. So I went through lists of every RTS, most of which I've played, and stumbled across this gem.  I can't believe I've never played Rise of Nations before!!RoN is like an awesome blend of Age of Empires, Civilization V, and Supreme Commander 2 (all my favorite RTSs [ok, Civ V is a TBS]).  In RoN you have unlimited resources, and with territory control and attrition damage defensive players are rewarded, so you can get some awesomely epic games going.  This game was made back before ""matches"" were meant to last less than 30 minutes to keep the ""spectators"" from getting bored.  It's a true RTS, and a classic game I'm ashamed I've never even heard of before recently.  I can't comment on the multiplayer connectivity since I've had limited experience with it so far.  From YouTube videos it seems like people don't have many issues, but I'm always worried considering how bad my experiences were with Civ V online.   I'll try to edit this review in the future if I find some people to play online with.			"

												Best RTS game of all time. I was playing this yesterday on my laptop. 2 hours of ultimate warfare. This is a very addictive game, your choices on the battlefield influences the way which the battle is won. I am very impressed with the different eras in the game from the earliest stages of history to the modern. Technology advancement of unit changes with the era. Amazing battlefield match ups. There was a point in the game where I felt I was going to lose instead, I used my flamethrower infantry to burn the opposition down.FAST PACED GAME. LOTS OF UNIQUE UNITS, MUSIC IS ALWAYS HISTORICAL, DIFFERENT ERAS IN HISTORY = EPIC GAME TO HAVE.Like I said before 2 hours of ultimate OWNAGE. Lots of strategical moves to win the battle. I would HIGHLY reccommend this game to anyone that is a HUGGGGGGGE fan of RTS games.10/10 RISE OF NATION = TOTAL DOMINATION.			"

												If you are a big fan of Age Of Empires and Civilization and never played it, you can quickly see the game provides alot of similarties of both (without the turn based nonsense that makes your games last hours upon hours). However it being a re-release of the orginal game from 2003, you might ask WHAT IS NEW? Well it has been given some polishing and tweaks to bring it into 2014, it features a ton of nations with a variety of units for you to play and advance through the ages of Ancient to Infomation age. Whether you just want to destory defenseless spearmen with your team of musket men or just be evil and launch nuclear armegeddon upon everyone, you should get this game for the love of all that is amazing and RTS.My only drawback of the release to steam is at this current time they haven't added any mod support/Steam Workshop integration, and Steam's invite to game feature doesn't actually invite your friend it just informs you to look at the server browser.

												If you enjoyed Rise of Nations when it first came out ~10 years ago, then you absolutely need to pick this up.  If you never played Rise of Nations, and you like RTS games, then you absolutely need to pick this up.First, remember it's a remaster of a game that, like I said, is 10 years old, so don't pick it up expecting it to look like Starcraft II.  The textures were updated to look like they did when the game first came out, but with today's higher resolutions, so they're not blocky, but you can't see the facial expressions on your citizens either.With standard settings, you start off in what's basically the stone age.  You have a small town, you can gather food and wood, but little else.  With some basic research, you're off and running into the Classical Age, where you can start getting better buildings, mine metal, have your scholars conduct research, and start building your army.Research takes you across eight ages, finally leaving you in the Information Age, complete with fighters, bombers, cruise and nuclear missiles, Space Programs, and Supercolliders.  If you've played Empire Earth, you should feel right at home.It's definitely one of my favorite, if not my favorite RTS games of all time.  My biggest gripe is the population cap is limited to 200, or 250 if you have certain wonders.  For $20 I don't think you can go wrong with this, but if it's on sale and you're an RTS person, you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you take a pass on this one.Just as a caveat to my review, though, I have only played this singleplayer, and that probably won't change unless I get some friends into it, so if multiplayer is your aim, might want to check the forums and see if they've patched out the ""bugs.""  I put it in quotes because I haven't seen any, nor have a lot of people, but just be aware that there are supposedly a few at tht time of this writing.			"

												Do I recommend this game? Well.It was the 27th of Febuary 2016, it was saturday... The battle of the warring states (thats the map). Korea 1 and Mongolia against Korea 2 and ChinaSo the game started off slow asf with nobody doing anything for about 10 minutes until the Chinese decided to♥♥♥♥♥♥and pillage the Mongols because it definitly wasn't the other way round in history.. Anyways Korea 1 which is me decides to turtle whereas my ally Mongolia gets bum rushed by crazy Chinese infidels from Chinaaaaa! While my ally gets destroyed and loses a city which I both cannot remember or pronounce the name off I decide to build a lovely statue in memory of classical era Kim Jong Un or the correct name for it is the Colossus but I wanted it to be the supreme leader therefore it is the supreme leader. After I built this incredible statue, my ally was able to push the blasted Chinese back and was then able to capture their city back. Where is Korea 2 you maybe asking? Well they literally just sat there watching China do all the work whilst they listened to PSI's Gangnam Style because that song is the true meaning of peace within south Korea. Eventually Korea 2 and China decided to double team my ally with an endless wave of firework shooter people things, this made me react with my supreme leader and his army of merry men! We pushed them back again only to have lost half of our army... ""Stupid Mongolians!"" The game went on for a good half an hour with constant border disputes which made our match be like the Korean War with both sides at a stalemate. Both teams were both expanding and colonizing islands whilst everything was going on, this allowed us to get more dumplings for our soliders to fight in battle. As both sides progessed to the industrial era, me or Korea 1 and my ally Mongolia were able to take the Chinese city Chengdu which created a foothold for our armies to give grief to the enemies. With the Forbidden City built by Kim Jong Un on one of my islands I was able to research nuclear weapons whilst my ally worked on fortifying the frontline with a giant army with the enemy doing the same thing. Eventually I was able to build several silos which enabled me to Korea the s**t out of everyone because I could press the red button and unleash thermonuclear warfare on the Chinese cities of Shanghi and Beijing along with 2 other warheads blowing up their military facilities which were luckily all clumped together. This finally allowed both me and my ally to push forward and take their cities with no hassle at all. While all this was going on I decided to choose my newly appointed president of north Korea, Kim Jong Un who was also the Despot and King of Korea several hundreds ago to lead this epic advance into the heart of China. With China uttely F****d, Korea 2 was the only one left standing with a useless army and low resources. Eliminating them was quick due to the ultimate ability to utilize nuclear weapons. F**K YOU KOREA 2! YOU SUCK MA KOREAN BALLS!SO! Would I recommend this game? Yeah I would! Its basically like Age of Empires only in my opinion its more in depth. The research tree is quite big and you are able to go from the stone age I think it is, all the way to the Information age allowing you to experience all styles of play. One age is full of swords, slings, bows, horses, crappy boats and pebble throwing trebuchet whereas the other age allows you to use rifles, bazookas, planes, helicopters, tanks, warships and everybodies personal favourite... Nukes! There's awider rang of unit types but there's a lot sooo if you get the game you can find out what they are!I would definitly advice you to get this game due to the fact that its just generally awesome.10/10 would Kim Jung Un again.

By bringing back old classics Microsoft are showing how much better the old RTS games are.This game has great unit variation between teams, plenty of upgrade choices and a great unit attrition mechanic.Looks great at 2560x1400			"

												I love this game, because you can got though the ages. you start off in the ancient age, and you work your way up to the information age. but you can also change what age you start off in and what age you end in. I would have say it is a bit like civ 5 (sid meier's civilization 5) because of the ages. the game can suport twitch streamming. which i don't use it, but it's nice that it's there, in case i want to use it. I have say it is a old game, but has been remastered to go on window computers. but it was one of the best RTS game of it's time and it still is. so if your looking for a RTS game, and you have 20 bucks, this game might be for you. i would rate this game a 8 out of 10See you next time			"

												Rise of Nations is a classic RTS developed by Big Huge Games and Published by Microsoft Studios that takes you through all the different ages in time from the Ancient Age to the Modern Age. Onto the upgrade, it actually works, compared to AoM:EE (</3) and AOE2 HD on launch. There are a few bugs here and there but it actually works online. RoN:EE is very fun and I honestly cannot help but recommend this version just because of the Steamworks Integration and the hope that Microsoft Studios will continue doing EE for their awesome old games!

												Microsoft lately has been on a quest to re-release every sucessful game they ever had, updated and modernized. I have mixed feelings about this. Although I love these games and the re-releases are good the prices have been an issue. I don't feel that $30/40 is fair for these games, and they are on the right path by decreasing the price of RoN to $15 pre-release and $20 on release, which would be a fair price for other re-releases such as Age of Mythology and AoE 2. Now to the game itself.Rise of Nations is one of, if not my favorite RTS game of all time. It blends various game concepts from games such as Civilization and Age of Empires and makes a masterpiece. This game is HEAVILY micro-management centric, where the nation with the greatest economic output, and the player who can manage that economic output efficiently, is going to win. Resources on the map are infinite, however productivity is everything, managing exactly how many woodcutting camps you need to sustain your growth without sacrificing, say mining metal for example. The combat in this game is also well balanced, focusing on a good mix of units rather than unit spam. Unique units are brought to the table just like in Civilization that each Nation has that can give them a slight advantage, however every unit always has a counter or way to be defeated. There's no ""stacks of death"" or ""zerg rush"" in this game, and that is one reason I also like it. I've been the smaller nation holding off spams of cheap units from bigger nations sucessfully many times. I wish more modern RTS games existed like this....I could only imagine the cores of this game being molded into a modern RTS...it would be grand. 10/10			"

												I love this game. I truly do. I played it when it originally came out for over one thousand hours and I was eager to buy the remastered edition.Little did I know what awaited me.They changed the AI functionality in this version of the game so that, when you win with an ally at your side, that ally will promptly stab you in the back and extend the game by, depending on the age you were in when the betrayal happened, possibly hours. This is an infuriating and needless change that does not ""feel dynamic,"" or any of the other buzzwords that people might use to defend its inclusion in this version of the game. It is a rage-inducing mechanic that was added only to extend the game because of the obsession of some developers and gamers with the length of the game. I got my value out of this game long before anyone thought to do a remaster, and I believe many other people playing this edition feel the same way. Maybe that's why they added this backstab mechanic-- to add challenge. I don't know why. All I do know is that I've had to win my last several skirmish games twice, and the first time was the worst, because I didn't expect it in the slightest. The moment the enemy capital gave up the fight, my ally for 80% of the game promptly canceled our alliance and immediately declared war, slaughtering civilians who had helped rebuild their cities in the wake of their disastrous war with the now-defeated nation that we had come together and struggled against. After struggling and slogging through an unnecessary second war against the betrayer, which nearly doubled the length of the game in a manner opposite of what I'd consider ""value,"" I...thought it was some kind of fluke. Then it happened in the next skirmish match, and the one after that. I wondered if the original RoN did this and I had either been fortunate back in the day or had not allied with enough nations during my various skirmishes to notice the trend, so I booted that up on my old laptop and tried playing a few rounds. In addition to noticing that the remaster's graphical polish was not so great as previously thought, the betrayals did not happen, and the AI was in some other ways a bit easier to defeat. I'm not entirely surprised by either notion, but I do NOT believe the way to mend the ailment of ease caused by the latter was to make the AI backstab you at the moment of victory. A stupid mechanic. Pick up the original game (it's still sold in a few stores, including Walmart) if you can. This remaster is questionable in its necessity and outright infuriating in its ""additions.""			"

												Decent, though they cut corners on the AI which is kinda sad. Probably an offshoot from the vanilla title, so no fuss with the present developer(<people in a company come and go)♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ p e r s e is censored? lol try it) however, it's a peve of mine for one to copiously give the AI some buffs. Enemy AI units teleport<(yeah they do I've watched it) and the computer has some resource buffing.These examples come from the ""moderate"" AI setting. A setting which claims the AI is level with you in terms of stats and abilities. I don't play RTS games online because I want to enjoy the game like a nice meal or a movie, not find the fastest path to ""victory"" like a spaz. It's a videogame, so it is my pleasure and fun alone that matters and being so it's probably best that I (like many others on here :) stay away from the multiplayer scene. The game alone is pretty entertaining, especially without people so I'm glad I picked it up.If you like multiplayer, I believe this game has it. I don't know.Though twenty dollars is kinda steep for me, yeah I'm cheap, I got it for fifteen dollars on pre-release. One could indeed wait for a sale and have fun for a dozen hours or so with the title and not feel like he lost anything.P.S I don't read comments.			"

												Rise of Nations: Extended Edition gives the same feeling I had playing this game 10 years ago. Now, with remastered graphics and steam multiplayer support, it is better then ever. The main reason it is better is that nothing has changed. This is the same game we all know and love with simple graphic tweaks to make it look better.

												My all time favorite RTS Strategy game. Highly recommend it, never gets old, and I've played it since I was about 4 years old. It's cool how there is both a militarristic aspect as well as a well built civilization. Tons of countries with unique features, thats cool, and military units ranging from ancient slingers to stealth bombers. On top of all of this there is a great multiplayer where you prevale or get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥XD. Really makes you think about different strategies and what works best. You won't regret your purchase of this game, best $15 I ever spent.			"

												This is one of THE most fun, and intense RTS games out there! From the beautiful mind of Brian Reynolds, Rise of Nations is an amazing game with an even more amazing OST. When I Watch the new Extended Edition trailer, I sit there and stare at the screen, jaw dropped, mind blown, Every. Single. Time. Of course I've loved this game for 5 years and am simply blown away by this remastered edition! I am so glad I found Rise of Nations, by itself with just it's sleeve, at that Good Will circa 5 year ago... it's changed everything.EVERYTHIIIING.Long story short: Game. Life change. Amaze. Wow. Much buy. Very now. Go. Wow.;) Highly recommended!			"

												Picked up this game yesterday on 6/15/14.  Fired up immediately with no issues or errors.I expect some patches along the way with everything else that developers release, I guess in some cases that would be asking for too much.The game plays just as I remembered it back in 2003 when I got it for graduating 8th grade, boy what a mother f@#$%^g game it was, no regrets.The game also reads at 1920x1080p with no issues and the entire map looks incredible, on random map islands with ocean.I do have an aging machine and I did run my game with 7 other players for a good test run on mp, it ran ok for the most part.I achieved 60 fps and dipped down to no less than 30 when nuking the hell out of my allies because I was greedy for more land.Pick this game up, its great and awesome, its just as i remembered it when i was kid.  Specs:*phenom ii x4 940 black edition* mixed ram at ddr2 800mhz 6gigs worth*hd 6950 amd xfx card with latest beta drivers as of 6/15/14*couple of harddrives at a low 5400 rpm*single monitor supporting 1920 x 1080pSo if my aging rig can run this, I'm pretty sure most machines will be able to.  I normally do not post reviews at all, I just buy the games and play but as of late, developers send out the games with♥♥♥♥♥loads of bugs and someone needs to break a foot off up in their @$$holes.Long story short, this game runs with no errors.

Unlike other RTS games rise of nations has a age system which scrolls through time periods in the game which means you can be the british common wealth or the romans.

												Pretty lackluster remake.  Yes, they made it work on modern OS's but not nearly as impressive a port as AoE2HD was.  Nothing new here nothing really improved on the original game, poor networking support, crashes a lot.  Nothing worth writing home about.  Go get AoE2HD instead.			"

												RTS strategy games are my favourite genre and have been since I was a child, and I think this is the closest I will ever find to being a magnum opus in my eyes.Of those I can remember, I have played:Warcraft 1-3 + all expansionsAge of Empires 1-3 + all expansionsAge of Mythology with Age of TitansEmpire Earth 2 with Art of SupremacyLOTR: Battle For Middle Earth 1 & 2Star Wars: Empire at War with FOCStarCraft 1 & 2And none of these I thought were worth a 10/10, but oh my they came close. Yet only by playing for a handful of hours I can see that this is the game for me and the best RTS I have ever experienced.I mean, it has everything good from other RTS games and perfects them: the region system from EE2 and it's advancement from tribes to massive civilizations being a huge factor, in fact I'd say much of this game is in the stride of EE2 even though it was released 3 years before EE2. I love how buildings increase in price as you build more of them and how worker units go about their tasks automatically and that other nations aren't so focussed on military progress, as I rarely stray from an economic path, so when the AI see that I have no army they don't invade, they just remark on how they hope for a peaceful relationship with me. I love it!!And not since something like Civilization V have I feared nuclear warfare more, they truely do warm my cold, calculating heart with devastating beauty like nothing I've witnessed before.The only downside for me is the lack of constructing walls; generally I prefer being an isolationist, hence the focus on economy over military, but other than that I can find very little fault in the game, it is absolutely fantastic and has been expertly remastered for a new age in gaming. And the Steam Workshop is just icing on the cake.This is a masterpiece, nothing less. 10/10. "

												I recommend you pick up a copy of the standard version of this game (including Thrones and Patriots). Whilst this version integrates with Steam, I feel it isn't a genuine improvement over the original. Yes, the models appear to be anti-aliased now, but this renders them blurry instead. It has annoying bugs like not respecting the volume of music for each track (you literally have to go and interact with the volume slider every track change - and I like the RoN music, thanks). This is the same game, and this is a low price. As someone who loved the original, this was removed and the original reinstalled. Go and get a budget branded version of this game on CD, it's the original, superior experience. But that is somewhat akin to saying this is Pepsi and RoN original is Coke - on a hot day, it doesn't really matter.			"

I will give this a negative, just because multiplayer is broken and community in forums is not helpful at all.Other than that if you want to have some good single player time, you must get this game.

												Rise of Nation (RoN) was a great game of its era and had me glued to the computer for many many hours in the past. Although I was nostalgic about the game and bought the extended edition just so I can fulfill my desire of world conquest, alas it wasn't so. The game doesn't feel much different from what I remember, and there are many bugs in this edition that I came across and have been in it since its launch. There's no support for the game and it feels lousy running on my pc.Pros:Feels good on the new graphics revampAI is more tough and diplomaticCons:Can't run on 1920x1080 or similar resolution due to screen flickeringWorld conquest campaign and some other campaigns are broken and crash the game when launchedGame crashes on its own with no error or problemNo support website or bugfixesErrors/ bugs persisting since game launch (2014) and nothing fixed what-so-ever "

												I loved Rise of Nations on the original disk, however I would not recommend this version to anyone:* Game frequently goes out of sync on multiplayer (both players using a 50mb+ fibre connection and direct ip connect)  Fixes work temporarily at best.* FPS is locked at 60, but you'll be lucky to get that consistently. I'm running with a 970 and an i5 2500k and the framerate will sometimes randly drop to 8 fps even if there is nothing going on.* Minor issue in the scale of things - but the audio is completely bugged and will always reset to the loudest volume. The only fix is to press esc and click the volume slider every time the music track changes - or just disable sound completely.The game also has no noticable improvements from the original game.2/10 would not reccomend.

												I feel this thing needs a bit of an AI tightening.  My armies do not move in formation toward targets.  I will group a huge force together, set it to march and watch as the whole thing dissolves into a disorganized congo line by the time it reaches the enemy area.  The fast movers arive, get picked off, the opponent is now wise to your impending arrival so then the next group of soldiers show up and slam right into the hastily assembled enemy line.  Finally my siege shuffles in just in time to be destroyed by a counter attack.The game is fine, but I think that Civilization 5 or Age of Empires III would be a better outlet for a desire for historical strategy.

There is no reason to pay that for a 10 years old game which cant even provide stable multiplayer. Nevertheless I still play this. Better than Starcraft, Civilization for me.I hope there is a second edition of this game.  "

												Although my views of this game are mixed if forced to pick one over the other I would say: I DO NOT reccomend this game. Originally I was looking for an RTS in the Modern Era that had resource development potential and a city builder like premise. Something close to AOE2 or AOM(EE) etc... This game comes very close. So close. But yet no cigar. It fails for the following reasons. - Depreciation on the units' health in enemy territory correctly happens; but is TOO extreme.- Poor AI. Unambitious on easy. Impossible on Hard. - Difficulties are adjusted by giving resource advantage to you or the computer respectively.  Not adjusted on AI skill. - ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Random Maps. - ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Graphics. - Barebones Diplomacy.- Lack of Defensive Play Option. - Units automatically change from land unit to sea unit which is completely unrealistic. - For territory victory games land owned by computer player is completely over estimated adding unecessarily to depreciation.- Like all RTS Games the ability for the computer to do more than one thing at once over powers the human player too greatly. This happens even with speed adjustment. - Boring music. While as someone who grew up with AOE2 I appreciated being able to play with modern units these structural errors in game play were too great to compensate for the flaws mentioned above. If you still really want to play it buy it in a sale like I did.			"

												Right now this game gets a 0/10 until they patch it. I was so excited to play this after reading all the positive reviews. It wasn't until after I installed it and checked the forums that I found out the game hasn't been working for anyone in a few months. I don't want a refund, I want a patch so I can play the damn game.			"

Product received for free
												Short Version:Good if you like long period games!Please read both versions of my review.Long version:This game is very general with aging although incredibly slow compared to its rivals (being age of empires series) it can be very fun to play. The thing with Rise of Nations though is that it takes up A LOT of time making a normal 3-6 hour games and that's with age limits of like 2-3. A normal game for all 8 ages can take half a day to play not to also mention the damage and resistance all units and buildings have. It's only fun if you like time consumption.			"

												Now im sad that I have to write this review because military and politics is my absolute passion. When I Bought this game I was hoping it would be like age of empires 2 set throughout all of history. While it is quite similar it just does not hold up to age of empires in my opinion. Not just that but this version is broken. if you try to play some of the campaigns they will just crash. very sad. If you want to check it out go ahead. This is by my opinion and no doubt it will vary by other people. But be warned not everything works and the are quite a few glitches with this version.			"

												I don't know how, but Skybox ENTIRELY mangled this game. The game crashes every 10-15 minutes, and when you try to verify the interity of the game cache through steam, it spins your harddrive into a fire without getting anything done. It took me all of 10 minutes to download this game, it shouldn't take any longer to verify the integrity of the game cache, much less should it wreak havoc on my brand new hard-drive. You're better off buying the game through GoG or off of e-bay or some such. If you really want to play mulitplayer of this game, just use Hamachi.			"

												Unlike in other turn-based games, in Rise of Nations, cities are a focal part of your strategy. Each of your cities has a radius around it that constitutes your national border. You can build other buildings only within your borders, and you can build only a limited number of different improvements for each city (such as a maximum of five farms each). Since expanding your empire depends entirely on your cities, the game makes you think harder about how and where you should expand. This focus on cities also means that each one will become a distinct community, with its own farms, temples, universities, and so on--actual cities will populate your empire, unlike in other real-time strategy games, where most of your structures are at your main base, while your additional town halls exist in isolation near some resources.

												This is one of the first games I ever played on the computer, and it was a jewel case that I've kept with me all these years.  Now that it's on Steam, I can put this case on the bookshelf and know that it is safe for all eternity.The best part?  Not a thing has changed.  Sure it looks nicer, and supports larger resolutions, but gameplay hasn't changed one bit.  Thank you for this game.			"

												Classic. Very similar to Age of Empires only on a larger scale with a bit more of a complex resource gathering system.You can pick a civilization, each with bonus's to different aspects of the game that give them and edge over others. Example: Spain has already fully explored the map, Japanese get bonus to gathering fish and so on.Then you build cities that expand your borders. You can only collect resources that are within your borders as well as constructing other buildings. Units do counter each other like, spearmen are good agaisnt horsemen, archers against spearmen and javalin are good against archers. However, when you advance in the ages, horses and bows are redundant when you have guns and tanks.Nukes are also a thing in this. They're pretty fun but, have a ""how many times"" counter after the first one in the match sets off. You and everyone else can only launch so many nukes before game over and everyone loses. Very neat little RTS. I'd say if you're a fan of Age of Empires or RTS at all then give this gem a shot. It's worth it!			"

Even after a decade, RON continues to be fresh and interesting, especially with bonus of workshop support.The music is excellent, the AI is excellent, art is detailed and nicely done.Easy to learn, hard to master.

												This is without a doubt one of my all-time favourite games. I love the way it tests your multi-tasking skills, and allows you to be creative and play the game how you want to play it. Each game you play is different! I like to play with as much of my friends as possible to maximize the skill and effort needed to win the game! The longer the game, and the more people in the game the better! I'd say this game does require a certain amount of practice needed to maximize the fun you get out of it though. I have played this game for over 8 years by now, and while I obviously wasn't very good the first time I played, I practiced at it, and got to be pretty good at it. This game is also educational, and it's fun and awesome to boot! As soon as I heard this game was going to be available on the Steam market, I instantly made the decision to buy it as soon as possible. Though I bought the game for 14.99$ at the time, it's still quite a steal for twenty bucks. TL;DR: 10/10, it's a fantastic classic.			"

												I must say I have loved this game since the first Rise of Nations release. The addition ""Thrones and Patriots"" was a bless and increased the debth of the game. With Extended Edition hopefully multiplayer is livened up again. The graphics have never been important for me in RoN. True, the EE graphics are somewhat better, but that is not the reason to buy it. I would recommend to buy it for people who do not own RoN yet, as well to people who would love to participate in multiplayer. Hopefully the EOL system will successfully kick in and the amount of players doing PvP increases. There are some bugs introduced with this version of the game, but it seems that currently they are fixing them, silently (for example the ALT + Tab sound problem seems to be fixed). Multiplayer crashes from time to time, making the game also crash/close. Single player seems to be working well, at least I have not gotten any problems with that (true, I mostly do multiplayer/quick matches).Overall a recommended buy for RTS fans.			"

												I have not been able to play this game as it causes blue screens (which is and abrupt and complete halt of your operating system which will make you lose any unsaved work you had).My setup is gtx670 i7-3770k win10. At first when in game I would adjust with full screen and windowed setting (because sometimes I like to play in short lapses and quickly switch windows to do some other task). Default resolution that came up when the game started was a small resolution compared to 1920x1080 so I wanted to adjust because it would otherwise look pixelated. Upon saving game settings and applying the settings the game would cause blue screen. This was reproduced everytime until the game would just cause blue screen right on load after the intro videos.I requested a refund and this was my reply:Steamto meOct 3SteamHello BluZer0We have reviewed your refund request.We are unable to refund this purchase to your Steam Wallet at this time. Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum).

While Rise of Nations itself is a very good game, the extended edition is way too buggy to recommend. The game may not even start unless you manually install distributable files or disable the into cinematic in an .ini file, Which is simply unacceptable for a game that costs 20$. The music is entirely bugged to the point that it ignores the volume slider and doesn't dynamically change like its supposed to, Something that wouldn't be too hard to simply hotfix, But the developers seem to have abandoned the game.Buggy abandonware like this really shouldn't be purchased, unless you get it on a sale and don't mind needing to edit .Ini files and using external programs to fix the rest of the issues. otherwise just get Age of Empires 2 HD if you want an old RTS.The original developers, Big Huge, Seem to have relegated themselves to making a Clash Of Clans clone, and Skybox labs is now working on maintaining the Age of series of games. Both are simply too busy to fix this, i guess. "

												The last of the great Brian Reynolds (Civ 2, Alpha Centauri, X360 Catan) PC strategy games has finally made it to Steam. It plays like an RTS version of Civ 2, which is still my favorite version of Civ. It's amazing that 11 years later there is still not an RTS that is as well designed and fun to play as this game. This game lets you advance through all the ages of human history like Civ, but gives you the fast pace of realtime matches. For those who prefer to play turn-based, you can pause at any time in solo or setup online matches with free pauses. If you are looking for a fun campaign jump straight to Conquer the World and play the Entire World map.There are some minor bugs at launch (no sound after alt-tabbing in fullscreen mode, unable to uncheck and save fullscreen option, delays connecting to lobbies with no indication you are connecting, lobbies aren't autoupdating), but they are not enough to hinder enjoying the game and will most likely be resolved in a patch. Some people in the forums have reported issues launching the game, but none of my friends or myself have experienced this and we have spent several hours playing multiplayer.Being able to play this with friends through Steamworks has been a blast, and at $20 it's practically a steal. If you have never played RoN before, you are missing what is still the best RTS game you can play.			"

												I remember this game fondly ... well, aside from how much my real life faded away from the endless hours I would dump into the game.  The AI was fairly weak, one of the few games even I could master against even the hardest AI levels without too much trouble.  I had been excited since hearing about the Extended Edition with updated graphics ...... unfortunately, that excitement has lead to a bit of disappointment.  I honestly can't notice much of a graphics improvement over the original RoN, with the exception of unit turn and movement animations being just a little smoother.  The intro cinematic has definitely not improved one iota of graphical fidelity and they stretch from their original 4:3 to fill your monitor width (very noticeable disproportion on a modern widescreen monitor such as a 1920x1080 as I have), and the game runs slow with laggy and outright glitchy mouse controls (hovering a mouse over certain buildings will cause the mouse pointer to flicker badly between the appropriate contextual mouse pointer and the regular game pointer, for instance).  There are a couple new features, such as in-game Twitch Streaming support (its an option on the main menu -- awkwardly, the mouseover for Twitch Streaming contains a typo).I haven't yet tried to use old mods such as the popular DonTheDime's CTW campaign expansion, but I imagine they will sadly no longer work ... I hope it won't be long before we see good mods to the game for the Extended Edition.Overall, I'd said wait and see whether the bugs glitches unique to the Extended Edition are addressed, and hopefully some optimizations.  If you still have the original and have figured out how to run it at modern resolutions (google for help with this), for now I recommend doing so rather than jumping to the Extended Edition, as whatever graphics enhancements are present (again, I don't see much, except when zoomed in, and I generally play zoomed out) I don't think make up for the current glitches and slowdowns.

Campaign has good story line value to it (all 5 campaigns from Alexander the Great to Cold War) with hours of enjoyment and various difficulty levels making a challenge even for the vetren players.

There are two streams twice a week where the community can play with representatives from the game and voice their concerns about bugs and gameplay.  I think this game is really fun to play and will stay alive for a long time with the incredable amount of support from the community and the developers.			"

												The last of the great Brian Reynolds (Civ 2, Alpha Centauri, X360 Catan) PC strategy games has finally made it to Steam. It plays like an RTS version of Civ 2, which is still my favorite version of Civ. It's amazing that 11 years later there is still not an RTS that is as well designed and fun to play as this game. This game lets you advance through all the ages of human history like Civ, but gives you the fast pace of realtime matches. For those who prefer to play turn-based, you can pause at any time in solo or setup online matches with free pauses. If you are looking for a fun campaign jump straight to Conquer the World and play the Entire World map.There are some minor bugs at launch (no sound after alt-tabbing in fullscreen mode, unable to uncheck and save fullscreen option, delays connecting to lobbies with no indication you are connecting, lobbies aren't autoupdating), but they are not enough to hinder enjoying the game and will most likely be resolved in a patch. Some people in the forums have reported issues launching the game, but none of my friends or myself have experienced this and we have spent several hours playing multiplayer.Being able to play this with friends through Steamworks has been a blast, and at $20 it's practically a steal. If you have never played RoN before, you are missing what is still the best RTS game you can play.			"

												I remember this game fondly ... well, aside from how much my real life faded away from the endless hours I would dump into the game.  The AI was fairly weak, one of the few games even I could master against even the hardest AI levels without too much trouble.  I had been excited since hearing about the Extended Edition with updated graphics ...... unfortunately, that excitement has lead to a bit of disappointment.  I honestly can't notice much of a graphics improvement over the original RoN, with the exception of unit turn and movement animations being just a little smoother.  The intro cinematic has definitely not improved one iota of graphical fidelity and they stretch from their original 4:3 to fill your monitor width (very noticeable disproportion on a modern widescreen monitor such as a 1920x1080 as I have), and the game runs slow with laggy and outright glitchy mouse controls (hovering a mouse over certain buildings will cause the mouse pointer to flicker badly between the appropriate contextual mouse pointer and the regular game pointer, for instance).  There are a couple new features, such as in-game Twitch Streaming support (its an option on the main menu -- awkwardly, the mouseover for Twitch Streaming contains a typo).I haven't yet tried to use old mods such as the popular DonTheDime's CTW campaign expansion, but I imagine they will sadly no longer work ... I hope it won't be long before we see good mods to the game for the Extended Edition.Overall, I'd said wait and see whether the bugs glitches unique to the Extended Edition are addressed, and hopefully some optimizations.  If you still have the original and have figured out how to run it at modern resolutions (google for help with this), for now I recommend doing so rather than jumping to the Extended Edition, as whatever graphics enhancements are present (again, I don't see much, except when zoomed in, and I generally play zoomed out) I don't think make up for the current glitches and slowdowns.

While Rise of Nations itself is a very good game, the extended edition is way too buggy to recommend. The game may not even start unless you manually install distributable files or disable the into cinematic in an .ini file, Which is simply unacceptable for a game that costs 20$. The music is entirely bugged to the point that it ignores the volume slider and doesn't dynamically change like its supposed to, Something that wouldn't be too hard to simply hotfix, But the developers seem to have abandoned the game.Buggy abandonware like this really shouldn't be purchased, unless you get it on a sale and don't mind needing to edit .Ini files and using external programs to fix the rest of the issues. otherwise just get Age of Empires 2 HD if you want an old RTS.The original developers, Big Huge, Seem to have relegated themselves to making a Clash Of Clans clone, and Skybox labs is now working on maintaining the Age of series of games. Both are simply too busy to fix this, i guess. "

												If you're ever bored, or burned out of any other RTS games, this one is definitely one to turn to.Simple fun can be found in a game that remains one of the best in the RTS genre created over 10 years ago.If you can find it on sale, $5 ( CAD ) is even better. Though, I'd definitely say $20 is worth the price. I had the disk copy previous to owning the Steam copy, and I had spent many nights up too late playing through long hours in eight player games through centuries. Recommended.			"

												I have not been able to play this game as it causes blue screens (which is and abrupt and complete halt of your operating system which will make you lose any unsaved work you had).My setup is gtx670 i7-3770k win10. At first when in game I would adjust with full screen and windowed setting (because sometimes I like to play in short lapses and quickly switch windows to do some other task). Default resolution that came up when the game started was a small resolution compared to 1920x1080 so I wanted to adjust because it would otherwise look pixelated. Upon saving game settings and applying the settings the game would cause blue screen. This was reproduced everytime until the game would just cause blue screen right on load after the intro videos.I requested a refund and this was my reply:Steamto meOct 3SteamHello BluZer0We have reviewed your refund request.We are unable to refund this purchase to your Steam Wallet at this time. Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum).

												My favorite RTS. Very teching heavy, solid economics and some really innovative mechanics. Border push, wonders and diminishing returns (each unit/building of a given type costs more than the last) keep things lively and elimiate a lot of generic RTS spam strategies. Vistory can come from annihilation of the enemy, domination of the map area, or by building a majority of the wonders. Although essentially symetric, the numerous civilizations all have a healthy set of tweaks, bonues and 'unique' units (age specific upgrades to the vanilla units) so that you get a wide variety of playstyles and methods to victory. Good game setups with many maps and all sorts of options.			"

												Rise of Nations has been one of my favourite RTS franchises of the past and I am pretty happy to see a modern makeover of it with a fair pricing tag attached to it. My favourite gameplay mode is Conquer the World also called CtW. It combines Risk-like gameplay during grand-strategical phase while providing a unique RTS experience ""on ground"" when the actual fight for a territory happens. During the RTS phase you are able to progress one age further than that of the world's phase offering a different style of gameplay for each of the 24 nations as the world goes through different ages starting with the Ancient Age where units die fast but come cheap to the fast-paced Information Age filled with danger and nuclear excitement. Instead of building traditional bases players build towns which can be expanded with buildings providing specialized civilian units such as the caravan, the merchant for controlling and mining unique resources, as well as buildings specialized for the economic needs and strengths of the area around the town starting with their regional capital. Each town may also expand national borders which can then be fortified by manned or unmanned towers and fortresses. In short the economical side of the game is very fleshed out and has an amazing depth.The fierce fighting against an AI which is still ahead of most if not all RTS AIs I have had the pleasure to play against. The choice of units is not huge even with the unique units aside it's down to three types of infantry units per age, 2-3 cavalry/mechanized units, and one type siege and supply unit each and 4 kinds of military ships.  This is not counting special units like scout units, generals and yes, spies which do spy-ey things, fishing boats and transports. However the difference is that with each major age they get upgraded to a different type of unit also shifting their roles and importance.The game includes the addon Thrones and Patriots which adds government, all the remaining civs and wonders (only actively buildable in skirmish and coop but may appear as regional feature on world map still).Overall a recommendable game for those who want a different RTS experience and take a break from all that MOBA gaming.

												My favorite RTS. Very teching heavy, solid economics and some really innovative mechanics. Border push, wonders and diminishing returns (each unit/building of a given type costs more than the last) keep things lively and elimiate a lot of generic RTS spam strategies. Vistory can come from annihilation of the enemy, domination of the map area, or by building a majority of the wonders. Although essentially symetric, the numerous civilizations all have a healthy set of tweaks, bonues and 'unique' units (age specific upgrades to the vanilla units) so that you get a wide variety of playstyles and methods to victory. Good game setups with many maps and all sorts of options.			"

												Rise of Nations has been one of my favourite RTS franchises of the past and I am pretty happy to see a modern makeover of it with a fair pricing tag attached to it. My favourite gameplay mode is Conquer the World also called CtW. It combines Risk-like gameplay during grand-strategical phase while providing a unique RTS experience ""on ground"" when the actual fight for a territory happens. During the RTS phase you are able to progress one age further than that of the world's phase offering a different style of gameplay for each of the 24 nations as the world goes through different ages starting with the Ancient Age where units die fast but come cheap to the fast-paced Information Age filled with danger and nuclear excitement. Instead of building traditional bases players build towns which can be expanded with buildings providing specialized civilian units such as the caravan, the merchant for controlling and mining unique resources, as well as buildings specialized for the economic needs and strengths of the area around the town starting with their regional capital. Each town may also expand national borders which can then be fortified by manned or unmanned towers and fortresses. In short the economical side of the game is very fleshed out and has an amazing depth.The fierce fighting against an AI which is still ahead of most if not all RTS AIs I have had the pleasure to play against. The choice of units is not huge even with the unique units aside it's down to three types of infantry units per age, 2-3 cavalry/mechanized units, and one type siege and supply unit each and 4 kinds of military ships.  This is not counting special units like scout units, generals and yes, spies which do spy-ey things, fishing boats and transports. However the difference is that with each major age they get upgraded to a different type of unit also shifting their roles and importance.The game includes the addon Thrones and Patriots which adds government, all the remaining civs and wonders (only actively buildable in skirmish and coop but may appear as regional feature on world map still).Overall a recommendable game for those who want a different RTS experience and take a break from all that MOBA gaming.

												[AS]_Pimp-Masterflex said it best with:""So the thing about Rise of Nations, apart that it's one of the greatest RTS's of all time (that still get's major universal acclaim to this day on it's reviews) is the community that has fostered it's survival and growth over the years. There are players as old as 12 years running, to the first day noob, still playing this illustrious game that captivates multi-generational RTS gamers from around the globe.The dynamism of the mechanics of this game, the endless possibilities of game styles, the captivating skill of the professionals of this game, makes this community a force with something to offer of all players.With more people in this community, we can help continue for this game to inspire and entertain many fans of the RTS genre that would never be disappointed by such a time-tested, long-lasting, extremely addicting game.Now I've been playing myself multiplayer since 2009, and let me tell ya, I cant even play another RTS after playing RoN. There's just nothing like it, it's unexplainable. AOE2 and C&C were all well and good, but RoN just has a finesse of history + Risk + Civ + RTS that no game has yet to match.So yea, I would say this game is ""worth it"", very much so.""I wholeheartedly agree!

												Rise of Nations is a 2006 game that first came out in 2004 as one of the best strategy games of the year, this game was my childhood, I can remember the amazing detail put into the game, the great strategy aspect and the ultimate feeling of true TOTAL WAR. The game has an amazing music selection, amazing Ai, great Ui, and nearly perfect gameplay performance, this was to me at the time the best strategy game of all time. The only disgruntled part which was taken out was a crappy attempt to be funny by the dev team by making the credits of the game them singing... Not the best musical for ending credits but that was the only negative part. I highly recommend, actually the Syndicate highly recommends you all take this baby out for a spin.

												It's ok but it not like Age of Empires, thats for sure.  MY game style is more like  war craft the 1st and 2nd one the best nothing is as fun as it use to be and war craft 3 was ok but started to expane way to much in the build system.  Don't get me wrong l love build games but they just seem more fun when every thing is simple in the leveling up build not to many tabs to build all the differn't types of building all should just be in one tabe and easy build will lots  of resources to be had... Todays games just have to much micromanagement to do an not enough huge battles just to sending one unit after another is boss in a giant war. NOT forever waiting for more of this and that bull jdfkls.. Still a good game for those who like this kinda build an army and die alot and rebuild and slowly over to long of time to concoure a city. i say huge citys and huge armys is my fun this is not like.  if you have the time to waist  you will get to have the old time game play style. I sure miss those old time games.			"

												Game is horribly broken, attempted 15 online games, only 5-6 worked. For a steam game, this is terrible. I really like RoN, it's my backup to AoE, but it's becoming harder and harder to get around its faults.Although not a part of the games design, the online community griefs far too much and the game needs updated to reduce imbalanced tactics. I wish I could get my money back as this looked similar to Age of Empires, but it turned out to be somthing far less complicated. Ideally one person can fend off a multi-nation attack, but in this game it is not possible. Micro-managing is also not easily possible as I am constantly fighting the ai.			"

												Has alot more depth than Age of Empires, and is almost more fun. Unfortunatly, the game becomes broken and ends in a standstill when all upgrades are researched. Nukes are fun but become useless almost immediatly when nuke sheilds are researched. And those would make it alot easier to invade people when they can create units instantly.

												This game is the same as it was when it was released years ago. Unfortunately the multiplayer community is annoyingly sparse and the ones who do play it have their own crews that they're running with so you will spend a very long time trying to find a game (since the quick match option does not have enough games to actually place you) then the players you're playing with will likely leave and you will be curb stomped by a team of players that always play and play together. If you're looking to buy this game for the multiplayer aspect just forget it unless you're going to buy it for all of your friends too. Horrible!			"

												I really, really want to like this game. The strategic map is awesome, and the RTS component is okay, but you spend all your time fighting against your own troops. Attrition means your men take damage if they move away from a supply cart.Your men chase after anything they see in every direction and are always in an agressive stance, with no way to stop them.Supply carts often charge into the enemies.As a result, the RTS game is a combination of:- Desperately trying to make your guys focus on staying in a group with the supply carts, general and catapults they have to protect instead of running off after lone villagers and leaving the former 3 to die.- Spam clicking on barracks/stables to replace all the ones that die all the timeSo many good ideas, just ruined by the screwed up RTS component. Rise of Legends accomplished everything this game should have been, though lost the cool sandbox campaign where you could choose to play as any faction.			"

												Overall reviewRise of Nations is the finest historical rts ever made by far and also by far not the most successful. So why the negative review?  Read on to know.Multiplayer reviewThe ron community is more toxic now than it ever was.  I started by playing standard games and I ended up playing mostly rushers and/or raiders.  So I switched to playing no rush and I ended up playing mostly smotherers.  Yes the ron community wasn't perfect back in 2005 to 2007(approx.)(you could even say far from it probably) but it wasn't nearly as bad as this.  Mulitiplayer is where this game should really be shining.  If you can handle this environment then go for it.  If not wait for a sale because you might end up playing single player like me.Other things-never play against anyone called the diplomat-the conquer the world campaigns are a complete waste of time and probably even worse in my opinion.

How many times have I checked? 25? 100? How many times have I run dxsetup.exe? Too many?I've tried mucking with the fullscreen options in the .ini, but no luck.Something could be gleamed from the fact that the x64 executable in the vcredist folder doesn't run, saying it'll only run on XP SP1 or later - but I'm running Win7. The x84 .exe runs fine, but doesn't change anything.)			"

												It pains me to give this game a not-recommended. I played the original for countless hours when I was younger. It has solid RTS mechanics, only slightly below the titan RTS game of AOE2. On top of that it adds a ton. There are a large number of ages, giving the game Civ-like ""epic"" feel. On top of that, the game has Civ-style wonders that provide passive benefits. The campaigns are extremely solid, with a Risk-style strategic map that allows you to move armies between territories, mount attacks, secure bonus resources, strengthen your territories, sabotage others' and even place World Wonders in safe locations to boost your attacks and defenses across the globe. The game is incredible.Now... the relaunch. I was super psyched that this game came to Steam. I immediately launched the Conquer the World campaign, only to find it riddled with problems. From graphical and sound bugs, to unbearably laggy performance. I have the game alt-tabbed while writing this and for the first time in 10years I see my typed text appear asychronous with my actual input. I'll turn the graphic settings down next time, because I hadn't really noticed them anyway.This relaunch is a poor, poor effort. I was glad it came relatively quickly after its announcement, but that turned out to be a mistake.			"

												Hi all!As an avid player of Rise of Nations for the last however many years i was sorely dissapointed with the re-released version of this game! It is no better than the original from 2003, the ""enhanced graphics"" at first glance make you feel like you have cataracts and arent all that improved from the original. The multiplayer element of the game which was what most people were looking forward too was an utter dissapointment and has not been improved what so ever on the original. Now you might say ""give it a chance it has only just been released im sure it will be patched soon"" how ever its not like microsoft have had 11 years to make improvements now is it? All in all i paid £14.99 (if i recall correctly) for a game with half arsed improved graphics and possibly the most frustrating multiplayer game system since Gears Of War 2!			"

												I remember getting bored by this game when it first came out, and I wanted to see if my feelings on it have matured with age. Sadly, I was disappointed. Rise of Nations adds many new features that expand on the work started by its spiritual predecessor, the Age of Empires series, but sadly fails to create enough variety in gameplay to keep things interesting for long. Units die quickly and have annoyingly stupid behavior that makes them difficult to control, so combat lacks strategic finesse and usually relies on constantly building more units. This seems like this would require skills in economic micromanagement, but the economy is also overly simple and automated, so no part of the gameplay really carries much excitement. The civilizations are all generally the same, so the game gets old fast.Fans of the original Age of Empires series are better off with superior titles like Age of Mythology or Age of Empires 3 with all the expansions, which both offer more replayability and strategic depth. RoN's saving grace is its campaign maps, but games like Total War and Dawn of War have similar features with better combat to mix things up.			"

												Direct connect is broken, I don't know why but it won't let me connect to my friend's game, I have nothing else to say so the rest of this review will be Breaking Bad fanfiction.The woman who was named Skyler White walked onto the living living room where gun noises were being made. Her husband who was bald and named Walter was watching the movie Scarface with his son Flynn who was really named Walter Junior. However, he was not bald like his father. Who was named Walter. Not Junior. The bald man with lung cancer turned around and faced the woman who went by the last name White and the first name Skyler. ""Do you want to join us in watching the movie called Scarface"", asked Walter White. Skyler looked at him. She wanted to ♥♥♥♥ her boss who went by the name that was Ted, but he slipped and broke his skull. Because he did bad things. ""No"", she said, as she thought about dancing mushrooms in a forest that looked like Bambi's best friend Joe. ""Well you can SUCK MY♥♥♥♥♥♥YOU ♥♥♥♥ING ANGRY ♥♥♥♥♥"", Walt screamed as he pummeled his wife into the ground. Skyler screamed and tried to run, but her husband was too strong for her. ""WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU"", he screamed, ""WHY DON'T YOU LOVE ME ANYMORE"" ""D-d-dad s-stop"", screamed his son named Walter Junior who had a palsy of cerebral. Not celebrate. Like a birthday party. ""♥♥♥♥ YOU JUNIOR, SUCK MY♥♥♥♥♥♥YOU CRIPPLED ♥♥♥♥♥♥"", he screamed, as Walter Junior burst into tears. Walt then chucked his infant daughter named Hollie at his wife. The baby smacked her in the face, before hitting the floor and screaming. ""SHUT UP"", he screamed at the baby, then at his bloody wife. He pounced upon her and best her in the face a few times, before taking a break to squeeze her breasts. ""Honk honk"", he laughed. Then he grabbed Walter Junior by the neck, and also grabbed his wife Skyler there too. He dragged both of them to the oven, and set it for 360 degrees. ""SEE YOU IN HELL, YOU ♥♥♥♥♥UCKERS"", he screamed before shutting the door and ending his wife and son's lives, ""THEN YOU'LL LEARN TO APPRECIATE MY WORK"". Then he threw his daughter Hollie in there and sat waiting. Bored, he lit a match and poured some gasoline. He drove to the partner he called Pinkman first name Jesse, and burst through the door. Jesse was ♥♥♥♥ing his girlfriend, and her son was playing video games. ""WHERE IS HE"", Walt screamed at the kid. The kid stared at him for a bit. ""TELL ME OR I'LL GIVE YOU POISON AGAIN"", he screamed before the child pointed to the bedroom. Walt jumped into bed with Jesse and his girlfriend, and they did it. They had a surprise three way, and then a four way with Jesse's dead girlfriend's ghost. They dedicated the four way to Gustavo Fring, who loved doing four ways with the twin cousins and Hector Salamanka in the wheelchair. Jesse cried with angst, then screamed at his meth making partner. ""Yo Mr. White, why did you♥♥♥♥♥♥me ♥♥♥♥♥"". Walt licked him in the cheek. ""I'm hungry, lets get some waffles"". Jesse bit Brock on the nose and called him Poindexter. Walt became jealous so he carjacked Jesse and drove to find Mike. Mike was taking a dump at the park with his granddaughter. ""And this is how a rhino takes a dump"", the elderly man said to the child, before the♥♥♥♥♥♥came onto her face. Walt farted all over them and forced them into the car. Meanwhile at the police station, Walt's brother in law Hank Shrader was smoking cigars on the toilet and practicing his laugh. Suddenly, Steve ran in. ""Is it time for sex already"", he mumbled as he reached for the toilet paper. ""No honey, your brother on law Walt is Heisenberg! And he's kidnapped everyone for a surprise orgy!"" Hank put on his Superman outfit and ran to the Mystery Machine. ""Good work Scoob"", he said to Steve as he patted his Latino head. Walt then picked up Gus's corpse from the graveyard and used voodoo magic to bring him back to life. ""Yo that's cool ♥♥♥♥♥"", said Jesse. ""Get back to work"", said Gus. ""I already started"", Walt replied as he began a nauseating zombie orgy whilst driving near a cliff. Hank Shrader was behind Walt, but not literally. That only happened in Walt's dreams. ""Come out with your hands up Walt, I know everything!"" Walt said ""♥♥♥♥ YOU FATASS IM STILL DRIVING"". Hank taunted Walt and said ""I ate Hollie before you got a chance to!"" Walt screamed ""YOU ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥"", before swerving around and crashing into the Mystery Machine. Then Walt ♥♥♥♥ed everyone involved, and Marie too since she tried to steal everything at the scene. Then Gretchen and Elliot showed up and Walt ate them. Whole. They tasted like zucchini. Pleased with his massive twelve way orgy, Walt and Jesse tongue kissed while jumping off a cliff in a Tweety costume. ""I love Yogi Bear's dad"", they sang as they hit the rocks. ""♥♥♥♥♥"", Jesse said before his head went to smithereens. Walt ran back home, where his home was gone. Looking at the ready meat of Skyler and Walter Junior, he realized he could have gotten the names from Lydia. Then he farted poo water into his pants and ate it. The End.			"

												economy, research, advancing in age are what makes this game very good,Graphics are sort of Age of Empires 2 upgraded with smoother looks. the other part, the military part is something very different.Each unit type is useful against a very narrow type of threat, against other, extremely useless.Too much emphasis on hardcountering/vs useless units makes combat very uninteresting.Too much american liberal point of view mixing with reality, one of the worst things.Very weak anti-bomber counters - them being only fighters (american bias = lack of american SAM technology IRL manifests)Also stealth bomber is impossible to target from either sea, or land-based systems.Modern/information age lack anti-helicopter infantry AA missiles,Also, while you have only fighters to defend your cities and one-time wonders, those are pretty much impossible to use because aircraft controls are unintuitive and clumsy.It is old and while this game gives so much nostalgia to old-comers,  claiming its basically The RTS, it definitely isnt to me.Games in AoE line do not have such weird and stupid, sometimes even counterintuitive counter system. That means a huge blow to any sort of immersiveness. There are 8 epochs/ages, but WW1, WW2 and late cold war equivalents are terrible. Bad aircraft control even compared to its predecessors.Also, when you are past age 2, and have docks, all land units cross water by turning into transport ships so any sort water blocking access means nothing, except that subs sink each transport in 1 volley,The game is more complex and it is actually very good apart from combat. It is one of the worst games I played, if not the worst. If you enjoy the very narrow rock paper scissors with non-RL connections, then you might enjoy it.Do not expect that this game is as good as others say. It has its qualities but fails very hard in other ways. Unless you can succesfully install mods that work and change the downsides I mentioned, I do not recommend this game to anyone with tastes similar to mine, which you can understand from my text.So, no I did not wait to play this game for 12 years, I simply stumbled upon it, tested it long enough before it became extremely boring, so no, if you dont have the nostalgia infatuation, this game will quickly turn you down. The last 3 ages are just bad on top of all.			"

												I bought this game before it came out, excited to revisit an old friend. What I've received for that loyalty to the game has been a game that does not work at all. Through the various 'updates' the only change to a game that does not work and which will not close even after using the Task Manager to end it has been that the black box of nothing has gone full screen. Nothing different as it's all one non working mess. My profile shows 'hours' of the game being played. That is not true, I have never got past the first scrambled screen of the game. After each 'update' I've  tried to play the game and ended up having to restart my computer completely. It does not work. I am however able to play every other game I have in my Steam account. From Skyrim to DOTA to Crysis to DayZ. I  have a i7 CPU, a 780 Nvidia graphics card. So no it's not my computer. Everything else is fine except for Rise of Nations: Extended Edition.  You know, it's a shame. And of course, my issue is ignored. Save yourself some grief, I would not recommend you purchase this.			"

												This game brings everything from the old experience plus improved graphics. Single player suffered minor changes. I noticed that forts and troops do not disappear once an enemy is eliminated. Multiplayer is a bit disappointing. Steam usually works for multiplayer, but Rise of Nations Extended is an exception. Lobby chat was removed, so there is no way of knowing who is in lobby. You cannot communicate or invite players currently looking for games to join or plan teams. Furthermore, You cannot tell how good your opponent is or there is no way of knowing how many games he won/lost. Your rating is given by a large arbitrary number (ELO) that changes only when playing rated games. The few games I played, I had some lag, one synched out and another dropped, in which case, there's no way to load and continue, despite this being shown as one of the options.In addition, there are minor bugs two of which are really annoying: the invisible window that pops up when you run the game, for which you can only see the buttons; and the sound going away when you use alt-tab to switch to desktop and back.

												The original game was amazing, but when I downloaded the Extended Edition, I was dissapointed. The interface and graphics were all buggy, at one point I was being attacked by an invisible army, all my units look like they're in the shade and some of the buttons for techs and units weren't displaying their picture or working. I tried redownloading and had the same problems.Overall, I would not reccomend this game right now, wait a few weeks til they work out the bugs and hopefully they decide to integrate the steam workshop it would make the game a hell of a lot better.I do reccomend the game for its classic gameplay, but just wait til its fixed. Right now overall 4/10, its buggy and the changes seem a bit gimmicky. Hopefully this is fixed FAST so they won't make the same mistake like they did with AoM EE and AoE EE.			"

												How steam can sell games that are completely full of bugs is beyond me. I love RoN but the fact that it just constantly crashes is an absolute disgrace.If i buy a game on steam i expect it by playable, RoN is not. DO NOT buy this game until they have fixed all the problems, which from reading other reviews there seems to be a hell of alot. The fact that you can't get a refund is just another kick in the balls.			"

												I played this game back when it first game out when I was pretty young. When I saw this on sale I was pretty excited for a trip down nostolgia lane. But unfortunately this thing has not aged well, and it has revealed that it isn't a game so much as an chore to be optimized.Its overly complex in what you need to keep track of, you need to simultaneously be researching key technology at a library while expanding new cities, keeping your military updated with the newest weaponry, building resource-efficiency buildings, researching efficiency upgrades at said buildings, building new workers, building a military to begin with, and expanding your commerce with trading with your other cities. This isn't even taking into account the building of wonders or tactical combat, or the specialization of what troops to build in what quantities.It's a massive headache to play, even on easy difficulties. And even when you win, it's unsatisfying. In my most previous game, I ended up building wonders to boost my empire, and appearently that starts a timer which at the end of you just straight up win. And then you're back to the main menu. Now I know you can probably turn that off as a setting, but the anti-climactic end to about 45 minutes of pretty intense micromanagement of a realtime empire is frustrating.It's just too complex. Too much. I recognize that the individual features of the game are probably solid, but its inpenetrable. I do like other turn-based strategy games like StarCraft II, Civilization, and Age of Wonders 3, so its not the genre, but this particular realtime strategy game is getting a pass from me.			"

												Well, after playing the First 2003 it still has the same issues it did back then and far more issues (SkyBox Labs  is working on fixing the issues introduced in this version)Overall this game was designed on rather old network coding and it shows it's age this Title has Peer to peer or simular type of system where if even one player is slow even slightly, it will bring down the entire game.If your looking for a classic title that has complexity and tatical challenge this will certainly give you a good challenge as long as you host on a good internet connection.Overall, it's good but when you can find simular RTS out there, Such as Empire Earth 1 and Warzone 2100, Spring that are just as interesting. IF they resolve the network issues and some minor pathing issues then they would have a really enjoyable game. (it's still fun but 80% of the time some one will drop, if this did not happen then i would say Yes to recommanding this game.			"

												They really need to up the Minimum Requirements listed on this page. My machine is just slightly higher than what it says and I get 6 FPS on a 10 year old game. Because of this, I cannot personally recommend this for anyone with older machines.RoN is a great game and it bums me out that I can't play it. I do think its a great game to pick up if you have a modern machine, just stay away if you are near the bottom end of the ""supported"" spectrum of specs.			"

												Part one : englischPart two / Teil Zwei: german/deutsch_____I bought it in the Offsale for 9,99€. Some years ago, i was a huge fan of this game and loved to play this.So i decided to buy this ""extended-remake-Edition"".Graphics are till 50% better, Gameplay is still as good as before.But: It disappointed me in much things.The bugs: If you have troups, and mark them with ctrl+1, and another troup with ctrl+2,and try to change to another troup, and press 1 or 2, your monitor will swap in a mapcorner, and stuck for 2 seconds.If you try to fix it, and press again 1 or 2, nothing will happen.So far, there are 2-3 more bugs, which are not that important.I bought it, would buy it again, but for normal players, i wont recommend this game at the moment.You should wait till its fixed or gets cheaper._____Ich habe das Spiel im Wochenangebot für 9,99€ gekauft. Vor ein paar Jahren war ich ein großer Fan des Spiels, und hab es viel gespielt.Also entschied ich mich dazu, die Extended-remake-edition zu kaufen.Grafiken sind bis zu 50% aufpoliert, Spieltechnisch ist es genauso gut wie vorher.Aber: Leider hat es mich in vielen Dingen enttäuscht.Die Bugs: Wenn man Truppen mit strg+1 festlegt, eine zweite Truppe mit strg+2 ebenfalls festlegt,und man diese dann auswählen will, kann es passieren, dass die ansicht in die Ecke der Karte springtund dort für 2 Sekunden festhängt.Wenn man dann versucht, die Sicht zu verändern, oder die Truppe neu anzuwählen, passiert nix.Fazit, es gibt noch 2-3 weitere Bugs, die aber nicht so ausschlaggebend sind.Ich habe es gekauft und würde es wieder kaufen. Aber für normale Spieler, würde ich es zumjetzigen Zeitpunkt nicht empfehlen.Wartet lieber, bis ein Bugfix rauskommt oder bis es noch günstiger wird.			"

												I have played this game almost continously since initially purchasing the game on disk in 2003 or 2004.  In fact, I played the disc version up until 2015 when I upgraded my computer from Microsoft 7 to 10; thus losing the ability to play the game from disc in its original form.  I thereafter discovered the Steam version of RON Extended Edition and downloaded it asap after which I played the game for over 1000 hours.  All of a sudden the game quite loading in early or mid-March, much to my disappointment.   I cannot afford to upgrade my computer or its graphics, and thus am unable to play the game.  If this is a Microsoft problem whereby updates have rendered my computer essentially useless for playing the game-----TOO BAD. SO LONG.   ADIOS FOOL!			"

In our age 2016 almost 2017 this game sucks. But if we go back in time It is the best game in 2003 Indeed. But I tryed to refund this game but. When I looked I saw I played more than 2 hours. Soo I had this♥♥♥♥♥♥forever. I seriously do not recommend this game. I even searched for the Normal Version. But there was only Extended Edition. That made so ♥♥♥♥ing angry but I payed 15 dollars for this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Even a 1000 page book is not 15 dollars and this♥♥♥♥♥♥is 15 dollars. I do not recommend this. It is about conquering. Battle's are meh Campaign is the worst stretagy game campaign!! Overall I will give this game 47/100			"

												I personally dislike it due to several reasons. The movements of people (villagers, warriors, horses - all units) in the game are very slow and not smooth. The units and villagers in particular cannot even walk on the paths through buildings.... but they have to walk ALL the way around the buildings to get to the other side. The fighting animations are dreadful. I personally  think age of Empires is better. This game was decent maybe 7 years ago when it first game out. Although being just as old, age of empires has got better graphics to my perspective. I wish i could get a refund as i could have got something a lot better for 20 dollars. I mean no offence to the game creaters, it is just my honest opinion.			"

												Absolute classic of realtime strategies. It's mixed with little bit of tactical turn based strategy as well, but that is verz elemental. No matter, you have a lot of nations to choose from, technologies to invent and buildings to built. Advancing through eras changes the visual of your towns very nicely. Keep in mind that this is strategy from 2003 and all the changes done in remake were to make it playable now (userwise). If you enjoyed old strategy games, this may be right up your alley.			"

												This game was created by one of the main designers if not the main designer for Civ (look it up). Given the Civ formula is super popular as it is with Civ 5 as proved by the amount of people playing. I think this RTS needs to have a closer look based on that alone. It's for people who want gratification in an hour or two of playing time. The gratification payoff for a game like Civ 5 forces someone to invest way too much into the game before becoming too numb brained to be gratified. This has a sleek system - cool time periods covered.  - It has a take on 4 relevant time periods. I suppose its 'old.' But I think this is the best game ever made. It's what a video game should be in my opinion. If you want to understand the intangibles of what makes this system so great and so rewarding. Put down some money and see for yourself. I reccomend buying the strategy guide as knowing a little about the system will engage and reward single player experiences. It's a neat algorithm. Chess, at the end of the day is just an algorithm. People fell in love with it and they believe it is the intelligent man's/ strategy gaming man's Eden. I vote for The Eden of Rise of Nations. You're good impressions you see in this game that tell you to give it a try are the right ones!			"

I loved it when I was younger and when I saw it on sale I bought so I could play it with my buddies which is about the only reason I think I would accept to buy it. The graphics are a little better but not worth the upgrade is you don't want to use the multiplayer except if you are desperate ofr better graphics ( they are the same but sharper).This version also seems less prone to bugs.

												HIGHTLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO RTS FANS,MUST BUY.READ BELOW THE REASONS Last time i bough something from Skybox((AOM) i was deeply disapointed by a multitude of problems.but the one of them was the price of the game which i complain about extensively look like they saw my bad review of the game about the price and the other features. ill list the good and the bad.THE GOOD1-The price, is very reasonable for all the content of this game.2-The updated graphics.3-Very well balanced game.4-Multitude of nations to play by.5-Conquer the World campaigns.6-No bugs,glitches or freezing(at least by the time i have played)7-No need for steam workshop to make this game playable.(unlike AOM)8-lot of Replay value.9-All the perfect gameplay of when it firts released.10-all the unique mechanics of this game( way ahead of it time) territory control, unlimited resources etc etcTHE BAD(nothing bad about it.)1-No steam workshop which will make and expansion or new nations not likely.CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.1-Since you have the rights can you make and Expansion featuring some nations like in AOE2,for example some forgoten nations that really had and importand impact on history like the nations from indochina which i am surpised the original developers dint add any of them For example indochina nations like Vietnam and Thailand had some very powerfull cultural impact even in modern times(vietnam wars etc etc) and a forgoten african empires of the West of africa the diferent Sahelian kingdoms that emerged on that area. if you did this whit out breaking the perfect balance and adding 3 more nations I WOULD BUY IN A HEARTBEAT AND I AM SURE PEOPLE WOULD BUY IT ALSO after all most of the guys who play RTS are history buffs and we glee at the fact of giving and less recognized nation equal status.  SKYBOX you nailed it this time very happy whit my purchase and i thought i was never gonna buy anything from this company again, you lisent to my BAD REVIEW of AOM and really work towards it. "

There are still many bugs but it is on the whole playable and fun. It's the same old RoN (as I wanted) just reskinned. Multiplayer is decently active.			"

												RoN is as fun as I remembered it to be many years ago. I always loved the city capturing mechanic. It added depth when other strategy games of the time simply expected you to wreck enemy cities like you're leading a Mongol horde. Conquer the World mode is the star of the show for me. Again, as above, having one global map forces the player to think strategically, unlike most games of its time where you just went from one scenario to another with one battle having no consequence on the other. You need to win the right places at the right time or you will expose yourself to enemy attacks that will take large chunks out of your empire. The campaign battles themselves aren't really big on variety, but there's enough of it to make you return to each campaign to see if you can beat the AI more quickly.Multiplayer is also lots of fun and it's quite a challenge if the AI is set at a higher difficulty.Overall, highly recommended. Buying it on Steam after all these years was a no-brainer for me. RoN deserves a place in every strategy gamer's collection.			"

												HIGHTLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO RTS FANS,MUST BUY.READ BELOW THE REASONS Last time i bough something from Skybox((AOM) i was deeply disapointed by a multitude of problems.but the one of them was the price of the game which i complain about extensively look like they saw my bad review of the game about the price and the other features. ill list the good and the bad.THE GOOD1-The price, is very reasonable for all the content of this game.2-The updated graphics.3-Very well balanced game.4-Multitude of nations to play by.5-Conquer the World campaigns.6-No bugs,glitches or freezing(at least by the time i have played)7-No need for steam workshop to make this game playable.(unlike AOM)8-lot of Replay value.9-All the perfect gameplay of when it firts released.10-all the unique mechanics of this game( way ahead of it time) territory control, unlimited resources etc etcTHE BAD(nothing bad about it.)1-No steam workshop which will make and expansion or new nations not likely.CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.1-Since you have the rights can you make and Expansion featuring some nations like in AOE2,for example some forgoten nations that really had and importand impact on history like the nations from indochina which i am surpised the original developers dint add any of them For example indochina nations like Vietnam and Thailand had some very powerfull cultural impact even in modern times(vietnam wars etc etc) and a forgoten african empires of the West of africa the diferent Sahelian kingdoms that emerged on that area. if you did this whit out breaking the perfect balance and adding 3 more nations I WOULD BUY IN A HEARTBEAT AND I AM SURE PEOPLE WOULD BUY IT ALSO after all most of the guys who play RTS are history buffs and we glee at the fact of giving and less recognized nation equal status.  SKYBOX you nailed it this time very happy whit my purchase and i thought i was never gonna buy anything from this company again, you lisent to my BAD REVIEW of AOM and really work towards it. "

If you fancy spears and swords, have yourself a medieval battle, just do it. Or, like me, if you prefer the era from WWI until current times, you can do it also.Good nation choices, from Russians to Persians, it's just an amazing compilation of what a RTS should be.			"

												Addictive RTS game-I also own the game off-steam and have ~100 hours of playtime. Game is very time-consuming as there is hardly a break-point to be found to stop. The formula is known but played out well.Gameplay is similar to Age of Empires-type games with some unique aspects like attrition (damage over time in enemy influence sphere) or buildings grouped around the cities which convert to your side once you occupy the city for a certain time, world map strategic overlay risk-like where you can choose your battles to claim bonus resources, armies or world wonders.Campaigns included are: standard world domination, Alexander the Great, Napoleon, new world and cold war.It's really fun and you should check it out as it is cheap too.

Battle options that can change the game entirely, and of course make your own scripts to add more in. It's great.Only downside is at $20, the Extended Edition is a bit costly for a basic port, especially when you have to convince people you want to play with to buy it too.

												I can wholeheartedly recommend this game!Before being introduced to RoN, I had resisted RTS games somewhat; friends from my MMORPG were really into them and I had seen Age of Empires, but was not all that enthralled by it.  Starcraft, for me, lacked the visual appeal and while I appreciate the sci-fi element, it never really hooked me.  I prefer games that the player can elect to pace him/herself and just have fun rediscovering the game mechanics and creativity displayed by the designers.Rise of Nations hooked me immediately and I am thrilled to see it in STEAM.

												I really love the game so far because there are so many options - it'll take a long time before you get bored, so it's $20 well spent. For any Civilzation players, in particular I loved this game because you can play it in less time. There's always the option to take longer, but sometimes Civ could get exhaustingly long and eventually somewhat repetitive. This game can be as long or short as you want, it seems. That's a plus for me but I'm sure it's a bit of a disappointment to others so take that for what you will.There's one caveat though - if you're after card drops and achievements you might be in for a little frustration. This is the only game I have that says I have card drops left but won't drop them, and even though I've beaten the game multiple times now it won't give me any achievements that I can clearly see I've earned.

Posted: August 1, 2014
												Thank you Good Game.Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.Thank you for reminding me why I wanted a demo of this game just over a decade ago.Two of my absolute favorite franchises are fused together in this fantastic rendition of the old classic; Rise of Nations. When you put the marco-management of cities and a commercial system you get in the Civilization series with the action and structure found in much of the Age of Empires series, this game is the result; the game is such an incredible experience that I feel I could play as much as Civilization V right now, and at this point I've racked up over 1000 hours on CiV. For me the game is the best of both worlds.Even though I'm largely no good at the game I'm a big fanboy of Civilization, me and my siblings have followed the game since the very first. At first it was a pursuit to victory but as I grew up and at around the third game a strange thing happened to me; while just about every other genuine gamer would go 'Cool. I'll pick Genghis Khan. He looks cool.', I actually started to ask 'Who's he? Why's he here?' I began to take a real interest in history. To me then Civilization holds a truey massive place in my heart as both an excellent game - which in the last few years seem to be exploring a new world in what a Civilization game really is, and as an agent of who I would become - my interest in global history started with a LAN game of Civilization III with my mates in high school, and it hasn't stopped. Now I've gone full circle, working as a civilopedia writer for the More Civilizations team of modders, I now get to completely indulge in my constant interest in world history and in an albeit small part contributing to the community.Why am I rambling about Civ? Oh yea! For a real time strategy this game has a surprizing amount of content that seems to be influenced by Civilization. Firstly is the sheer size of playable nations - you have a chioce of 24. 24!!!!! Not even Age of Empires III: the Asian Dynasties have this many different nations playable in total. 24 is a very large number, it's larger than the catalogue of Civilization II civs. Then when you start you begin with a capital at the ability to build city buildings, when I first play this years ago the very idea of cities in RTS was so weird and cool and awesome I remember immediately wanting to pick the game up and being much too young to get to myself. Yea, that's me. I'm a guy who likes a gimmick or two. Then there's the trade system which bares only a slight similarity to Civ; you connect two cities to a trade route by building a caravan from your market and tell it to go to a city that's elsewhere from the market's city. Lastly, one final CIv-inspried concept are resources and to an extent how you use resources, similar to Civilization resources found in your borders add to your yields and you can improve them with a merchant to gain a special bonus attached to the resource. And you know what? I think Sid Meier, creator of Civilization, must have been inspired by Rise of Nations. How else do you explain embarking in Civ5? Rise of Nations has the same idea, when you reach an early tech your units can turn into a transport seacraft and carry on across the water. Niffty!When it comes to Age of Empires, naturally Rise of Nations comes out trumps taking on............more or less everything; units, buildings, wonders...........being an RTS.............well, think RTS and that's what Rise of Nations has. It's hard really to sum up the Age of Empires influence in an RTS game with a historic context, primarily because Age of Empires IS an RTS game with a historical context. For the moment let's just say that Rise of Nations is Age of Empires, better. Much better.I've been working on a tribute review for Age of Empires and Esemble Studios, the original developers of the series, and I've tended to compare the evolution of the games to the evolution of the modern supercar; Age of Empires original as the Lamborghini Miura, Age of Kings as the Porsche 911 GT3 RS, Age of Mythology as the McLaren F1, the New World as the Bugatti Veyron, and Age of Empires Online as.........how can I put it?...........a Bugatti Veyron, slamming into a wall. If I could describe Rise of Nations as a car, I fell the Lamborghni Aventador might suit best; it's not the most pretty thing in the world, but it goes like a bugger!And on that bombshell, it is time to end. Thank you so much for watching. Good night!...>><<What just happened?			"

												I remember playing this for the first time on my dad's computer like it was yesterday. Blew me away at the time--it was like Age of Empires, but instead of being limited to knights and trebuchets, you could go all the way to aircraft carriers, mechanized infantry and ICBMs, as well as everything in between. Even more, you could Conquer the World, similar to Risk. The Thrones & Patriots expansion added a bit more polish to the game, sort of evened out a couple of rough edges, as well as added a wealth of content--new nations, campaigns, and systems of government. Probably the biggest thing besides being able to cover various historical periods is the way that cities are handled--they're valuable control points, not simply a building at the middle of your base (think more Civilization (but with less micromanaging) and less StarCraft). RoN holds up just as well today as it did then. Its mere existence may not blow my mind like it did when I was a kid anymore, but I don't think there'll ever be a day that I dislike the idea of firing up a quickmatch for old times' sake, or accidentally staying up all night seeking world domination in one of the several engaging singleplayer campaigns (then feeling like hell the next day but knowing full well that I'll have totally thrown my resolution to never do that again out the window). This game has everything when it comes to old-school RTS games. I highly recommend it, no matter who you are.			"

There is an issue however with the multiplayer where if you play a game or two it starts every game with the message game out of sync. Sometimes if you click the option it will work, other times it will keep coming up.I still reccomend it though			"

												I played this game when I was 10 and adored it. I've come back to it now 10 years later, and nothing has changed. I can still greatly appreciate level of detail and the additional dimensions of gameplay that you don't get with games such as AoE, and lose myself in a good few hours of game play. A game I have always recommended and one I will continue to do so!			"

												If only Steam could show my hours played on my disc copies I'd be in the thousands of hours!And yest I still enjoy this game, not only my favourite RTS but also in my top 5 favourite games.This game can be considered the illegitimate protege offspring of clandestine relations between Age of Empires and Civilization.The basic gampley is fast and combat isn't necessarily a simple matter of outnumbering your opposition. Many factors influence the grand outcome. As well as wars being just that, you're unlikley to overcome ypur opponent in a single rush attack and instead will have to win several battles to overcome them.This game has a perfect replayability about it. Procedurily generated maps, based on your chosen style for ""Quick Battles"" will make every battle unique. You can play a battle with the same nations on ""East Indies"" map type a hundered times and will never have the same one. as a result you cannot memorize and become exceptionally good at any one map. A definent plus for new players trying out online.As far as the Campaign(s) go. They are extremley free form and allow the player a great deal of free choice, for the historical campaigns you may follow in the foot steps of history or break away and forge your own path.This game is worth every cent and will keep you entertained for a very long time.

												One of the most underrated RTS games i've ever played. I loved C&C games with the exception of red alert 3 and c&c 4, but RON far exceeds C&C when it comes to gameplay and depth. If you don't mind minimal story lines and you just want to jump in and command a civilisation to victory, RON provides a complex RTS with the option to add elements of grand strategy to your campaigns, as well as providing super customizably complex skirmishes. Even at full price, RON is a bargain.			"

If you fancy spears and swords, have yourself a medieval battle, just do it. Or, like me, if you prefer the era from WWI until current times, you can do it also.Good nation choices, from Russians to Persians, it's just an amazing compilation of what a RTS should be.			"

												Great RTS for the casual and serious. It has more elements now than when it was on disc and there are some balance changes that only help it. It presents both as a on and off the battlefield sort of game as research is very important and so is building. I compare some elements to the better games of the Command and Conquer games (Tiberium Wars, RA2). You have a lot of things to manage, but it allows you to manage those things easily or take full control. The mechanics for fighting are reletively straightforward and easy to adapt to. The multiplayer, whether against the AI or others is great and allows for many things.			"

												This Game has ate up so much of my life since 2003 (1000s of hours!) and the only reason i bought this reboot is because i can no longer use my origional disks copy(I actually wore the disk out haha). I was never a fan of the Age of Empires games because of the lack of national borders, which i felt were quite an important aspect of nation states! This game tho takes the style of AoE and adds many features that make it imo far better. The creator of this game was a team member of Civ2 and Alpha Centari and that was a selling point for me when i first bougt it as im an avid fan of both of those. This reboot by SkyBox is wonderful and i love that they left the core code and gameplay intact but brought up the dated textures. My only point of discontention here is that Big Huge failed to capitalize of this great game and make another(i know RoN:rise of legends but dont like the fantasy aspect) All in all I will highly recommend this game as one of my top 5 games of all time!!

It's like Microsoft took every good aspect from every Age of _____ game and added everything that needed to be added to make something beyond amazing.  Historical accuracy aside (and seriously, who cares?),  it's probably the best straight-forward 'historical' RTS out there. Give it a try. Probably even worth buying when it's not on sale if you're at all inclined to playing strategy games.			"

												This is an excellent example of an enduringly good RTS.  Fast paced, strategic and with a wide array of units.  Super impressive that a game this old can still be so fun.  My main critique is gonna be the AI because it does so many stupid things regardless of the difficulty setting...like declaring war on a nation they havn't met yet.  Sometime the AI will declare war randomly, and then immediately sue for peace...really though it is a minor thing that doesnt affect my enjoyment much.10/10			"

												This is my childhood revamped to a better look, thoughasmuch it does not display much of a difference, I enjoy how I am able to play this game, again, despite having two CDs of the same game that doesn't have a product key with it (I lost the cases it came with, in this case). However, there are some flaws that need brushing out:- AI might be a bit flawed based on when to pull back upon player's discretion. Basically some units don't draw back even though I directed them away from combat.- Screen tends to go blank for some unexplained reason during the tutorials, as well as the fact that it kind of just crashes my graphics card's drivers. I don't know why this is happening, but it really shouldn't, as my GPU is very reliable and it barely stays any warmer than 40 - 50 degrees Celsius. EDIT: It crashes regardless of what mode I choose. This should not be happening, regardless of what my hardware specs are.EDIT 2: It crashes to desktop after playing the game for a while, as my operating system points to my graphics drivers as the problem, which shouldn't be. This is just ridiculous, Skybox. Fix it! I cannot play a game that has to constantly crash no matter what I do.- When the narrator mispronounces ""Britain"" as ""Brighton"" and then proceeds to correctly pronounce it on the next tutorial scenario. This isn't Skybox's fault, but Big Games had this completely messed up and it sincerely bothered *and* confused me, because either way: ""Britons"" and ""Britains"" are pronounced just about the same way as ""brit-AN"".Otherwise, I can say it's a pretty good game, and I recommend it for anyone that wants to give it a shot.

												This game was created by one of the main designers if not the main designer for Civ (look it up). Given the Civ formula is super popular as it is with Civ 5 as proved by the amount of people playing. I think this RTS needs to have a closer look based on that alone. It's for people who want gratification in an hour or two of playing time. The gratification payoff for a game like Civ 5 forces someone to invest way too much into the game before becoming too numb brained to be gratified. This has a sleek system - cool time periods covered.  - It has a take on 4 relevant time periods. I suppose its 'old.' But I think this is the best game ever made. It's what a video game should be in my opinion. If you want to understand the intangibles of what makes this system so great and so rewarding. Put down some money and see for yourself. I reccomend buying the strategy guide as knowing a little about the system will engage and reward single player experiences. It's a neat algorithm. Chess, at the end of the day is just an algorithm. People fell in love with it and they believe it is the intelligent man's/ strategy gaming man's Eden. I vote for The Eden of Rise of Nations. You're good impressions you see in this game that tell you to give it a try are the right ones!			"

												Definitely recommended!  I used to play the original when it came out all those years ago, then I played Thrones and Patriots.  This is a great upgrade to that, now with glorious 60 frames per second!  We had small problems, though.  My friends and I all wanted to get on the same server, and the interface isn't the best (plus, the steamworks integration is basically a lie, you can invite people, but they still have to find your server on the browser, but luckily there aren't many games open at a time).  I (not anyone I know) also had a problem with the menus not working, it might be because I have Windows 10, but I also had this problem with Thrones and Patriots, it's a simple fix.  All in all, recommended!  Everything I remember it to be, and more.			"

No matter, you have a lot of nations to choose from, technologies to invent and buildings to built. Advancing through eras changes the visual of your towns very nicely. Keep in mind that this is strategy from 2003 and all the changes done in remake were to make it playable now (userwise). If you enjoyed old strategy games, this may be right up your alley.			"

												It's like a combination between both Age of empires 3 and Company of heroes, the game is very addictive and a fun competetive multiplayer RTS. At a sale price of only £10 you cannot go wrong with this little strategy game. Only negative comment I can say about the game is the graphics, these have barely being upgraded from the original game even at the highest settings, with that said however they are still reasonable and what you would expect for a game of this price.Pro's:- Easy to use interface.- Addicitve and Competetive Multiplayer mode.- Challenging campaign.- A great RTS game at a reasonable price!Con's:- Graphics are very similar to original.

												I don't think it is a very good rts, but if you've got a group of friends who really like civ but you hate civ because its so ♥♥♥♥ing slow you can feel yourself dieing while you play it well RoN:EE is the game for you. It is basically real time civ, and the multiplayer works REALLY well considering the game's age. The pathfinding and unit controls are very bad, but they -funcion- and the gameplay is unique and heavily varied. The late game is not fun, it becomes a completely unwinnable stalemate if all the civs reach their full potencial, and unless you win a wonder victory the game can take a very, VERY, long time. The early to mid game sections are actually pretty fun, and the amount of little details the game has is actually incredible. Rush tactics lose you real life friends, but win games. I wouldn't reccomend playing with randoms from the internet, the community is not very nice and in the 3-4 games I played by myself I can't remember really feeling up to speed with the current player base, so I got ♥♥♥♥♥tomped. Now, if you ARE up to speed with the player base, or you like 14 year olds rushing you 5 minutes into the game you'll probably like this, and I might like it too if I wasn't addicted to Dota2. The game has a good enough campaign and some cool singleplayer, so if you like old rts games you'll probably like this. I'd recoomend it to someone who has a big group of friends that likes to play games together.			"

												I just want to start that I LOVE this game, this game brings back memories to me, and I was to let you know you will get your moneys worth with this game if you are a fan of strategy.Gameplay: You first start buy building towns that gives you resources (you will get everything from the very detailed tutorial!) get units to protect your town, and your goal is to defeat the enemy nation (the options are GREAT you can play by your rules!) and that is basicly it, speaking of basic, the combat of the units are basic (ex: heavy infanty beats horse infanty, horse beats light infantry, and ships is rock paper scissors.) so the gameplay is some what basic... and you have to advance through other periods of time, like from the Ancient age to Modern AgeAI: The AI on Easy difficulty is basic, but if you play on Tough, you will be socked on how good the AI is (most of the time) but DO NOT play on EASIEST DIFFICULTY! moderate will give you a good challenge! So the AI is extremely good in this game!GameTime: Somewere between 40-60+ minutes mabe more than 1 hour depending on your game.Multiplayer: pvp is a little bit long, but practice by AI before you start multiplayer.Final Verdict: 8/10 GET THIS GAME!!!!

												I can wholeheartedly recommend this game!Before being introduced to RoN, I had resisted RTS games somewhat; friends from my MMORPG were really into them and I had seen Age of Empires, but was not all that enthralled by it.  Starcraft, for me, lacked the visual appeal and while I appreciate the sci-fi element, it never really hooked me.  I prefer games that the player can elect to pace him/herself and just have fun rediscovering the game mechanics and creativity displayed by the designers.Rise of Nations hooked me immediately and I am thrilled to see it in STEAM.

												I really love the game so far because there are so many options - it'll take a long time before you get bored, so it's $20 well spent. For any Civilzation players, in particular I loved this game because you can play it in less time. There's always the option to take longer, but sometimes Civ could get exhaustingly long and eventually somewhat repetitive. This game can be as long or short as you want, it seems. That's a plus for me but I'm sure it's a bit of a disappointment to others so take that for what you will.There's one caveat though - if you're after card drops and achievements you might be in for a little frustration. This is the only game I have that says I have card drops left but won't drop them, and even though I've beaten the game multiple times now it won't give me any achievements that I can clearly see I've earned.

												Years ago I played this game on some very crappy computers with friends. It was fun then and it still is fun now, always been my favorite RTS.Lots of types of kingdoms with different advantages. So many strategies to build out, expand cities. Battle options that can change the game entirely, and of course make your own scripts to add more in. It's great.Only downside is at $20, the Extended Edition is a bit costly for a basic port, especially when you have to convince people you want to play with to buy it too. Nab it if it goes on sale!			"

												If only Steam could show my hours played on my disc copies I'd be in the thousands of hours!And yest I still enjoy this game, not only my favourite RTS but also in my top 5 favourite games.This game can be considered the illegitimate protege offspring of clandestine relations between Age of Empires and Civilization.The basic gampley is fast and combat isn't necessarily a simple matter of outnumbering your opposition. Many factors influence the grand outcome. As well as wars being just that, you're unlikley to overcome ypur opponent in a single rush attack and instead will have to win several battles to overcome them.This game has a perfect replayability about it. Procedurily generated maps, based on your chosen style for ""Quick Battles"" will make every battle unique. You can play a battle with the same nations on ""East Indies"" map type a hundered times and will never have the same one. as a result you cannot memorize and become exceptionally good at any one map. A definent plus for new players trying out online.As far as the Campaign(s) go. They are extremley free form and allow the player a great deal of free choice, for the historical campaigns you may follow in the foot steps of history or break away and forge your own path.This game is worth every cent and will keep you entertained for a very long time.

												For me RoN is the leader in a category of RTS that just doesn't exist anymore. It isn't nostalgia that makes me recommend this game, it is that is still stands up today in both amount of content and pushing its genre forward with new features and gameplay facets. This edition just cleans up the game and makes it compatible with modern day systems. My co-workers and I have had zero issues playing on LAN. I'm not much for the singleplayer but the conquer the world campaign is a good idea.I recommend this to a person looking for what historical RTS games used to be; when unit AI was non-existent (although this game adds stances and formations), competitive economy games were viable, and you could tailor multiplayer sessions to be exactly what you wanted them to be. A testament to this game's impact is that every player still remembers individual games from back when they used to play it.			"

												Easily my favorite historical RTS. The sheer amount of civilizations you can play as and the pace at which you develop your nation isn't speedy, but it's a lot faster than games like Empire Earth. The combat isn't as visually appealing as games like Age of Empires (due to the fact that RoN combines 3D and bitmap graphics) but you have the ability to wage massive battles on land, air and sea. You can launch missiles and nukes too. How cool is that? The game even adds a twist where you combine turn-based world conquering spanning centuries with RTS battles for territory. I personally thought it was fun to conquer the world as the Greeks.I will say, however, if you played this game in its previous release that you probably won't notice much in the ""improved graphics"" area, but I didn't find this to be too much of an issue because I love the game so much.

If you don't mind minimal story lines and you just want to jump in and command a civilisation to victory, RON provides a complex RTS with the option to add elements of grand strategy to your campaigns, as well as providing super customizably complex skirmishes.

												Great RTS for the casual and serious. It has more elements now than when it was on disc and there are some balance changes that only help it. It presents both as a on and off the battlefield sort of game as research is very important and so is building. I compare some elements to the better games of the Command and Conquer games (Tiberium Wars, RA2). You have a lot of things to manage, but it allows you to manage those things easily or take full control. The mechanics for fighting are reletively straightforward and easy to adapt to. The multiplayer, whether against the AI or others is great and allows for many things.			"

												One of my favorite games ever! I originally bought it in 2006 and played a lot until around 2011-2012. I kept up with the modding community at ron.heavengames.com (not sure if it still exists). I recently started playing Civilization V because it featured many of the same aspects. I was hesitent because of the turn-based gameplay, but I ended up loving the game. So to my surprise, I saw that this game was on Steam slightly re-worked. I instantly bought it and downloaded it. When I started playing, I realized that I didn't lose any of my ability in those three years and that real time strategy is way better than turn-based. TL;DR: A must-buy. RTS>Turn-based			"

												This is easily one of the best and most entertaining games I've ever played, and a must-play title for anyone who considers himself an RTS fan. For strategy fans, the easiest way to describe this game is as a near-perfect combination of Age of Empires and Civilization, leaning more in the direction of AoE. This is a real-time strategy game with deep but easy-to-manage economic systems and tech trees. Mechanics like territory, attrition damage, bonus-granting Wonders, and combat that rewards combined arms make this game a macromanager's dream come true, and yet Rise of Nations still rewards skilled micromanagement. The game is a delight to play in single-player against AI opponents and the Conquer the World campaigns add elements of persistent gameplay and another layer of strategic complexity. As with most strategy games, however, Rise of Nations truly shines in its multiplayer. A variety of customization options allow you to tailor your gameplay experience. If you only want to play from the medieval period to the early industrial age, you can do that. If you think nukes spoil the late game, you can ban them outright. The ability to customize your game and to form or break alliances on the fly help make this an unforgettable multiplayer experience. For those who have played Rise of Nations in the past and are wondering if the Steam version is worth it, I still absolutely recommend the Extended Edition. The biggest attraction is Steam-integrated multiplayer. With Gamespy now defunct, this is for all intents and purposes the only way to play this game online. I have had some hiccups trying to play online with some of my friends and the interface leaves a bit to be desired, but on the whole the system is a relatively pain-free way to get the multiplayer experience from this game. The ability to download the fully-patched version of the game anywhere through Steam is also not to be underestimated. The graphical updates were also a pleasant surprise to me. I had largely written them off when I considered buying the game on Steam, but the first time I fired up a game I noticed smoother animations, more consistent frame rates, and an overall much-improved graphical experience. To sum up, this is one of the greats of the RTS genre that has lost none of its appeal in the decade since its release. Thise game holds up against any other RTS game before or since, and is undoubtedly worth the $20 price of admission.			"

												Fantastic game. Rise of Nations is my favorite RTS of all time and with Steam servers it is now even better. Even the AI provides a challenge, set to the appropriate difficulty AI opponents are intelligent and no pushover. Advance your civilization from the Ancient and Classical Ages to the Information Age, all while waging war on your opponents and trading and forming alliances with friendly nations. I would call Rise of Nations the greatest RTS game of all time. Well worth any price, I would buy this game for any amount of money.			"

												One of the greatest RTS I've ever played , I remember when I was little I use to play this everyday.                 (BASICS)In this game you pick a nation and you start at the very beginningThen you start to advance to the modern age (rocks , to guns) the strategy in this game is to hold control of territoryWithout territory you cannot build there (unless watchtowers).Wonders can be made and increase your income or give you a bonus in a certain way.Anyways I remember when I played this game from 2003 - 2010 , when the multiplayer servers in 2008-2010 have been closed I was kinda discourage on buying this game since I couldn't play with a friend , but once I bought it I found out that there is multiplayer supported into this game. Which brings me good memories , now I can play with my friends or even one of the most avid fans I've ever known who loved Rise Of Nations ... my dad :DGreat memories , amazing gameplay , supported multiplayer 100% Worth it10/10 "

Even though some my consider it ""old"" and even if newer games such do give better graphics, this RTS is the only one I know that gives both real strategic and tactical advantage to the ones that know how to use them and further more, leaves you addicted to the both gameplay and environment. The 'maturing' process of going though ages gives further objectives for players that like long and intense games and the dynamic way of using your resources still lets you win in early-game with enough knowledge.Put it simply: A MUST HAVE IN THE RTS GENRAAmsome game, awsome game play, addictive and dynamic.And my first video game <3-K-			"

												Love this game. Graphics are nothing to boast about, though it is a decently old game, so I'll let it slide. Beautiful RTS style game. Combat could be improved. One thing I do like about it is the balancing of the races. You don't find it in many games, but I really have trouble deciding what to choose for nationality every time I play. The bot difficulties are lack-luster as moderate seems to difficult for me but anything easier doesn't stand a chance, then again it could just be me. Love the multiplayer co-op/vs, makes playing with my friends amazing as I can truce with them, then break it and nuke them. :D Nuking feels really rewarding as your market will refuse to sell for a while. The armageddon counter is beautiful. You don't see that often. I give this game a cool 7.5/10, wait, make that a normal 7.5/10, I'm not cool.			"

												I remember playing this for the first time on my dad's computer like it was yesterday. Blew me away at the time--it was like Age of Empires, but instead of being limited to knights and trebuchets, you could go all the way to aircraft carriers, mechanized infantry and ICBMs, as well as everything in between. Even more, you could Conquer the World, similar to Risk. The Thrones & Patriots expansion added a bit more polish to the game, sort of evened out a couple of rough edges, as well as added a wealth of content--new nations, campaigns, and systems of government. Probably the biggest thing besides being able to cover various historical periods is the way that cities are handled--they're valuable control points, not simply a building at the middle of your base (think more Civilization (but with less micromanaging) and less StarCraft). RoN holds up just as well today as it did then. Its mere existence may not blow my mind like it did when I was a kid anymore, but I don't think there'll ever be a day that I dislike the idea of firing up a quickmatch for old times' sake, or accidentally staying up all night seeking world domination in one of the several engaging singleplayer campaigns (then feeling like hell the next day but knowing full well that I'll have totally thrown my resolution to never do that again out the window). This game has everything when it comes to old-school RTS games. I highly recommend it, no matter who you are.			"

												Attacked an enemy. I nuked the battelfield. Everyone died.Gr8 b8 m8 I r8 8/8This is basically an ""advanced"" version of the Age of Empires franchise with more strategical elements such as national borders, science, wonders, and... NUKES! Since Rise of Nations is a game developed by the same studio who developed Age of Empires (which is a great game too) I will be comparing the two in some aspects.Since Rise of Nations is a RTS (Real Time Strategy) game it is all about multitasking, and the player who does that the best, wins. You start with a single town in the ancient era. You begin with a few citizen who are the ""builders"" of the game, as well as a bunch of farms and a lumber camp. (NOTE!!! Resources cannot be drained like in AoE, lumberjacks do not remove the forests, farms do not get exhausted and mines/mountains do not get mined to ground level. This is to bare in mind when you place new cities so you can place them in strategically good positions.) You start by increase your resource income, expanding your territory by building new towns and researching techs at the library. When you have reached the classical era and researched the neccesary techs you will be able to build troops and fight other nations.The tecs are one of the core elements in Rise of Nations. You will have to research certain techs to be able to build diffrent structures. There are 4 tech categories:Military - Increases population as well as allowing you to upgrade your troops so they match the current era.Civic - For every civic tech researched you will be able to build a new town (granted you have the resources and space). This tech also increases national borders as well as allowing you to research attrition, taxation, religion etc.Commerce - In Rise of Nations you have a so called commerce cap. If your commerce cap lies on 70, which is the default when no commerce techs are researched, you cannot gather more than 70 food, wood, gold, oil, metal or knowledge per minute. This means that a strong economy means that you will have to research a lot of commerce techs.Science - Science allows you to build certain economically important structures (such as granaries, lumber mills, smelteries, and refineries that boost the resource gathering) , as well as researching faster construction, healing, troop construciton etc. When you have reached the maximum level of the above noted techs you will be able to research Future Tech. These will greatly improve your chance of winning the game since they provide a great tactical and economical advantage.The combat in Rise of Nations is diffrent from many other games because of the national borders. If you are at war with another nation and attack with just tanks you will take attrition damage. The attrition constantly damages your troops and the only way to prevent attrition damage is to take a bunch of supply units with you. This is a way to prevent rushing and requires you to be tactical when attacking. (NOTE!!! You will also take damage when crossing the territority of a nation that you are in PEACE with and this attrition damage cannot be removed by supplu trucks. This is to prevent placing troops in a neutral country and then declare war to have an advantage.)There are much more to talk about but I think this sums up the core lements of the game. As I said in the beginning of the review, I strongly recommend this game. Thank you for taking your time to read this and I hope you decide to by Rise of Nations. "

I owned this game when it was originally out and I will say, the extended edition isn't too much different but the online multiplayer system seems a lot more flawless. I'll let you read other reviews for a full synopsis of the game but I can tell you - you have to play it to understand why the reviews are Very Positive. I think they should be Overwhelmingly Positive mind ;)			"

												Rise of Nations (R)N)was developed in 2003 by Big  Huge Games. It was probably the best Real Time Strategy (RTS) game of its era and it won awards. Agree with the comments of some of the other Steam players that nukes are unneeded in this game. The person with the fastest  computer and Internet connection will be able  to build nukes the fastest. the Steam version is similar to RON Thrones and Patriots version because it has a Patriot leader, an extra wonder and and extra nationality, the US. Prefer to play as the Russians because I'm familiar with technology and their tactics from my USAF days.  Because it's an older game, you don't need a game computer to play it.  Have posted a more complete review of game on my blog. If you prefer to play against the computer, you would  be lucky to play above the moderate level. see http://rightardia.blogspot.com/2011/06/rise-of-nations-one-of-better-rts-games.html "

												For me RoN is the leader in a category of RTS that just doesn't exist anymore. It isn't nostalgia that makes me recommend this game, it is that is still stands up today in both amount of content and pushing its genre forward with new features and gameplay facets. This edition just cleans up the game and makes it compatible with modern day systems. My co-workers and I have had zero issues playing on LAN. I'm not much for the singleplayer but the conquer the world campaign is a good idea.I recommend this to a person looking for what historical RTS games used to be; when unit AI was non-existent (although this game adds stances and formations), competitive economy games were viable, and you could tailor multiplayer sessions to be exactly what you wanted them to be. A testament to this game's impact is that every player still remembers individual games from back when they used to play it.			"

												This game is fantastic. Overall, game play is quick and easy to get used to, and the graphics are awesome. I didn't really spend too much time [so far i've played 65 hours] on the campaign missions. I found that choosing any kind of ""quick game"" I wanted was easy enough, and I had the most fun with this part of the game. The fact that you can click [enter] and type CHEAT ADD (type anything in the game) and it appears wherever the mouse is makes the game so much more fun. Yes, it may be cheating (since I'm the only only one playing the game who cares?) but when you can quickly add 30 infantry on the battlefield to help destroy any enemy in your way, it's always gonna be a good time. I recommend this game for all those who like having a free and open space to build a nation, build an army, and to take down all the opponants around you.			"

												A really nice RTS game. It's really fun to progress and I enyoy the whole game and I just don't stop in mid game which you often do in these kind of games . I really recommend it and now when it's on sale it is kinda of a ""must have"" for a strategy game lover. A mixture between Europa Universales and Civilization = A good and fun gamePros : Nice pace, easy to learn , nice management , enyoy the whole game not just one era , characteristic graphics , many ways of playing it .Cons : Diplomacy (it's hard to learn about it ) , after many hours of playing it you get a bit tired of it (not much though) , not so strategic combat it's more about how big your army is , lack of factions ( There is not so many factions that I would like but it has the most famous ones , but there is still a lot of nations that should have been there )It's a really fun game and it's easy to learn .  If Eu4,Civ V and Classic graphics  had a baby togheter then it would turn out to be like this  (positive ;) )			"

												Remake of one of the best RTS game that was ever made. The resource gathering and military building is very much like Age of Empires, but there's concepts of research, wonders, cultural borders, etc. from the Civilization series that integrate very well. This is a game where in one two hours you go from a nomadic tribe to post-modern nuclear power. Grin as you outrace your opponents and roll in some WW1 style tanks and artillery against their meager horse-back cavalry and canons, or if you're losing in the last stages of the game perhaps you'll flippantly let enough nukes fly to push the Doomsday clock to midnight and end the world (and the game). Many nations and tons of unique units and unit looks with both grand campaigns on world maps like Risk with played out battles, smaller historical based campaigns, or the endless fun of multiplayer make this a must own for anyone that likes the genre. I just hope the popularity makes a proper sequel to the original game.			"

												If only Steam could show my hours played on my disc copies I'd be in the thousands of hours!And yest I still enjoy this game, not only my favourite RTS but also in my top 5 favourite games.This game can be considered the illegitimate protege offspring of clandestine relations between Age of Empires and Civilization.The basic gampley is fast and combat isn't necessarily a simple matter of outnumbering your opposition. Many factors influence the grand outcome. As well as wars being just that, you're unlikley to overcome ypur opponent in a single rush attack and instead will have to win several battles to overcome them.This game has a perfect replayability about it. Procedurily generated maps, based on your chosen style for ""Quick Battles"" will make every battle unique. You can play a battle with the same nations on ""East Indies"" map type a hundered times and will never have the same one. as a result you cannot memorize and become exceptionally good at any one map. A definent plus for new players trying out online.As far as the Campaign(s) go. They are extremley free form and allow the player a great deal of free choice, for the historical campaigns you may follow in the foot steps of history or break away and forge your own path.This game is worth every cent and will keep you entertained for a very long time.

												In my top 5 RTS games of all time.  What sets this game apart from other RTS is that you upgrade your technology as well as individual unit powers.  So for example, you start out with slings and clubs and eventually have tanks and stealth bombers.There is also the ability to script things like preventing nukes, or increased resource gathering.  Graphics are a little dated but hold up fairly well.I wish they made a new version with upgraded graphics and tech and more players than 8!			"

												Easily one of the best rts ever made. The territory mechanic, auto gathering when idle villagers and a really streamlined interface that tells you pretty much all you need, such as how many villagers are gathering X resource, makes this really easy to get into.The ""campaign"" is at the same time amazing and awful. It's pretty much a more complex WAR table game where the battles handled as skirmishes instead of dice. This means you have plenty of control of how the campaign goes, but at the same time feels somewhat anticlimactic as there is no dialogue, no special objectives and units, and the skirmishes are always 1x1, so it gets boring rather fast. And it is always funny defeating the romans as americans.There are plenty of nations in the game, and they actually encourage very different play-styles, so this is a huge bonus as well.There are plenty of modes to play, and most of them are fun too, so this is a bonus as well.

												What is this? another RTS from 2003? This isn´t age of empires II, why is this on steam? well, let me tell you all, that this, it is an awesome game. although my play history on steam shows a pity amount of time spent on this game, I have played the hell out if Rise of nations on the cd fromat, since it was only recently added to steam.What is this ""Rise of nations"" then? well, Rise of nations is your usual RTS game (Real time strategy) and it is the old ""gather materials, Make people and soldiers, advance and conquer"" quite the normal rooster of mechanichs. what really differs this game from other games I have played (keep in mind i haven´t played all RTS games) is that the game has alot of mechanics and features that make the game really feel like you´re creating and advancing.E.g. is that the game has a feature with reasearch, basicaly, there are multible routes to develop in, economy, warfare, popuation and sience . this really changes the way you ""advance through the game. that means you don´t just upgrade your army and then destroy the enemy base in one go with only kind of troops, instead you might find it better to upgrade your economy and simply ""starve"" the enemy out by being able to consistently attack the enemy.A very nice feature that i found amazing, was the idea, that when ""creating"" a offensive unit, it gives you a platoon instead of a single unit, which makes the end game end (lol) in a enoumrus fight against highly numbered armies.Going back to the advancement, the game lets you advance from the culture age all the way up to modern age where you fight with rockets, tanks and jets. also, the game has a feature, where you have a relation to other nations/players. this means that you can be netrual, allied, friendly or in war with other nations and you can, during a game, ally with another player. The game, of course, isn´t flawless. E.g. is that the game is from 2003, which means, that the game has it´s limits, althoug the steam version is better, so the grapichs isn´t explecitly amazing. futhermore,  the terrain might seems a bit dull and it is quite easy to do a fast rush if you play a certian nation. All in all, this is, imo, a really great RTS game and it hold a certian nostalgic fealing to me. I hope that you found it just slightly useful - WIlhelm			"

												If you like games that are a little less micro heavy and alot more crazy insane battles, this is your game. For those of you looking for a game that can take anywhere from 30 mins to 3 hours, this is your game. Frankly, this is one of the few RTS's we still play at our lan parties and even online.For those of you wondering why you should buy it? maybe you have a copy, or the gold amazon one, or you stole a copy...With this, it just works... You fire it up, you can play with people over the internet (Aus to California) and there is just no problems...I hated the issue with game versions listed the same number yet couldn't play together. Worth every cent!			"

												I allwaysed loved sending a war party of 500 men at my opponents and seeing the panic spam clicks skyrocket as they attempted to fend off my forces but quickly realising that they cant win, however i only had it on a old mac computer, so once that died i felt a void grow in my stomach because i havent launched a armageddon againsed my father and see it get orn to pieces by his strategic mind (i was 8) or sending a sneeky counter attack againsed my brother tha he was not expecting, but once i saw this had been revived on steam i imediately started remembering the strategicly places armada to allow my counter attack force of 50 men to pass and the chaotic mass war of 1000 men colliding in a mass lag spike. This is a fantastic revival of one of my long time favourite games since i could press a button (im still only a teen). It looks exactly how it used to if not cleaned up a little. it is well balanced especially for cruddy computers like mine. I am very greatfull for the re release of a legendary classic but i wish someone would attempt to make a sequal or dlc to spice things up for veterans like myself.			"

												This game is absolutely incredible. This game plays exactly as it did on the original disc. This is my absolute favorite old school RTS game. Command and Conquer Red Alert 1 & 2 are also my favorite. This one more for realism in a sense and C&C Red Alert for the alternate timeline of history. Back to Rise of Nations. If you're wary of purchasing it on Steam for fear of it not living up to what you expect, have no fear. This game is all the original was and more. It plays so incredibly smooth and I haven't had not one instance of this game not working or starting and it has never lagged on me once. This game is absolute perfection for what it is. I mean, it being on Steam doesn't change anything at all and it actually seems to run even better and it also looks better. Not by much mind you, but it is still quite impressive to look at and it holds strong today. This game has aged extremely well. If only they'd make a Rise of Nations 2 or an all out remake. That would make the 15 year old inside me incredibly excited. If you enjoyed the original CD-ROM disc of Rise of Nations this is the closest thing to that you will find. It is also a plus with the achievments which add a whole new level of replayability and trying to best yourself to get them all. This game is a solid 10/10 for me. Mind you, I never score games in reviews but this one is perfect for all intents and purposes.			"

												For me RoN is the leader in a category of RTS that just doesn't exist anymore. It isn't nostalgia that makes me recommend this game, it is that is still stands up today in both amount of content and pushing its genre forward with new features and gameplay facets. This edition just cleans up the game and makes it compatible with modern day systems. My co-workers and I have had zero issues playing on LAN. I'm not much for the singleplayer but the conquer the world campaign is a good idea.I recommend this to a person looking for what historical RTS games used to be; when unit AI was non-existent (although this game adds stances and formations), competitive economy games were viable, and you could tailor multiplayer sessions to be exactly what you wanted them to be. A testament to this game's impact is that every player still remembers individual games from back when they used to play it.			"

It really is a great game for LAN's as you can play on massive maps and with lots of players and it always devolves into a game of betrayals and general warmongering.  It is a ton of fun.			"

												As far as I'm concerned, this is the best RTS in existence. You have kind of a tech tree of sorts, and combat that's close enough to realism to be considered realistic. You have to siege cities before taking them, You can convert buildings instead of tearing them down, and even have a border mechanic. It's cool to zoom in and see the individual fights going on, and it's always amazed me how they can manage to make the fights so authentic-looking, at least in context. Also comes with a scenario editor, fun for making doomsday mods!			"

												I have to say out of all the Real Time Strategy games I have played this one sticks out from the rest. I remember playing this back when it first came out and when I found that it was revived I simply had to buy it. Sure, it may have been around for a while and it is an older game but this one has an authentic feel to it. There have been others who have attempted the whole ""Advance through the ages"" thing but this one by far is the easiet one to get into. Empire Earth was great also but I like this so much better. This isn't your standard Starcraft or Warcraft, though, the core elements are identical but you get to amass larger armies and march on the gates of your enemies with a bunch of units and siege weapons to make the taking of their lands easier on you. This game does offer plenty of challenge to the seasoned RTS veteran and lots of fun for those looking for a semi-casual experience.If you are a Real Time Strategy fan, and you are looking to expand your library of RTS games, I would reccommend scooping this one up.

												This game combines the best elements of Sid Meier's Civilization series and the Age of Empires series.  Built on a modified version of the Age of Empires II engine, the game was starting to look dated.  These developers have enhanced the graphics on the game with updated resolutions and textures and really give the game a more modern feel.  The gameplay is the same as it always has been and amazingly, no game has tried such a brilliant concept since.  I highly recommend this game to fans of the Civ and AoE series and RTS's in general.  If you're a newcomer to the RTS genre, I would recommend starting with more basic games such as Starcraft or Age of Empires II.  5 Stars.			"

												This is one of the games that was responsiable for my childhood (the others being Civ III and Starcraft, original and Brood Wars). This game is the best RTS that came out this last decade, and with good reason.PROS:-Great gameplay mechanics-Nice visuials, even though it is over 10 years old-Conquer the World campagin. If you get tired of just playing an RTS, play this rather intesting Turn-Based gamemode, in which many quick and small battles are spread out over an afternoon-Many different Nations, maps, and difficulties. Really good replayability value!-The music is very niceCONS:-As of posting this update (6-21-14), the game appears to only run on Windows, sorry all you Mac and Liniux users-This game has a rather steep learning curve, but has interactive tutorials which are very handy.This is a very nice game, and might be very nostalgic for some of you.

												This game is a long time favorite of mine. I played it when it was first released and continued after it debuted on the steam library. This game has improved graphics from when it was first released, however, substantially different compared to other games such as Civilization. I highly highly recommend this game to my friends, because although Civilization is a terrifically addictive and fun game we don't all have time to spend the extravagant amount of time it requires. This game is very similiar and can be completed within a couple of hours. The main difference I noticed between the two was that Rise of Nations is based in real time and Civ is turn based. I'm sure we all appreciate games not lasting up to 8+ hours, although they are supremely fun.			"

												This game is fantastic. Overall, game play is quick and easy to get used to, and the graphics are awesome. I didn't really spend too much time [so far i've played 65 hours] on the campaign missions. I found that choosing any kind of ""quick game"" I wanted was easy enough, and I had the most fun with this part of the game. The fact that you can click [enter] and type CHEAT ADD (type anything in the game) and it appears wherever the mouse is makes the game so much more fun. Yes, it may be cheating (since I'm the only only one playing the game who cares?) but when you can quickly add 30 infantry on the battlefield to help destroy any enemy in your way, it's always gonna be a good time. I recommend this game for all those who like having a free and open space to build a nation, build an army, and to take down all the opponants around you.			"

												Played this game for years. Decided to buy it on Steam. The game's Worksop integration and (slightly) updated graphics make it a great buy. If you like RTSs and haven't played RoN before go ahead and buy. Then sit down and get nukes before anyone builds missle shield.			"

												This game is outstanding. After finding it in a local Staples store about 9 years ago, I have found so much entertainment and fun in this game. From Pikeman to Tanks this game has all the ages you have been wanting to play with. From the amazing online play to the Great Scenario maing tool to make historical battles come to life, this game hands down is one of the best RTS games out. This is worth your time and money. 20$ to experience all out warfare and economy Infrastucture.			"

One of the best strategy games ever!I was a huge fan of the Age of Empires series growing up. Logging hundreds of hours on the original and Age of Empires 2. When Microsoft released Rise of Nations on PC in the early 2000's I fell in love with the game. The gameplay is similar to ""Aoe"" such as gathering resources. The attrition health depletion whilst moving in enemy territories and upgrading an army through the ages from spears all the way through to tanks really drew me in. Rise of Nations is one of my absolute favourite strategy games. I still own my retail disc version of the game. Steam's version includes achievements to unlock along with Steam Trading Cards and allows for HD resolutions to display in widescreen which is hugely beneficial to me. I'm now able to enjoy the game all over again and will do for years to come :)			"

												RoN is one of my best childhood games ever.If you like Age of Empires, I'm pretty sure you will like RoN too.However, RoN is more complex than Age of Empires, you might need to learn how the game works throughout playing the game.			"

												I love this game it would have to be one of my all time favorites. I really enjoy playing civ like games and rise of nations takes this type of strategy game to a whole new level. I would recommend this game to any one who loves a good strategy game, has a lot of free time or wants a fun and easy way to fight your frriends with your massive armies. Happy playing!			"

												Probably the best HD remake to come out on Steam. For those who didn't play Rise of Nations back when it first came out in 2003, it is a game that successfully mixes the strong aspects of the Age of Empires and Civilization games. This edition contains both the original game and the decent enough expansion pack that came out in 2004 (Thrones and Patriots).			"

												Rise of Nations is by far the most entertaining RTS I have ever played. It is easy to learn, fun to play with friends, and the AI can be quite challenging.The Steam Extended Edition is a nice update that helps bring Rise of Nations to a more modern standard, while still retaining the orginal feel of the game.

												At first I started playing this game and I was totally lost, but after a few hours the game controls become much clearer. Now, I play this game with a bunch of friends (6+) over a teamspeak and it really makes the whole experience more enjoyable. I would definetly recommend this game if you will be able to have a group of friends to play with because it adds much more competition to the game and makes the choice of launching a nuke much more difficult. Solo gameplay does get a little boring and repetetive after a while. I have so far had no technical problems like what was being said in the negative reviews. Although this game may be a little old I would recommend it to anyone that likes RTS and would find a group of friends that could get together for a game once in a while. 9/10			"
