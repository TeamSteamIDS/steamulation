												Excelent game! Time just flies playing it. It's simple, fun and insures hours of gameplay. Theres also several different scenarios with different challenges to try and complete.One thing must be noted however, if there is too many train tracks/trains/stations out in the world, the game is going to crash to desktop since it only supports upto 2gb memory no matter how much memory is installed on your system.There is a simple fix for this however, download the Sid Meiers Railroads 3GBEnabler[smrsimple.com] and follow the instructions. It removes the 2gb limit and my game hasn't crashed once since.Definitely recommend the game after the crash fix is applied. 9/10			"

												Very nice Tycoon game. Its similar to the Railroad Tycoon series. Maybe a little bit more casual gaming.You need to produce goods and deliver from A to B and have an eye for the Money.In the internet you would find more maps for that game. For a game released in 2006 it has nice lovely graphics and wonderful melodies.It's worth it.Attention: On Windows 8 64 bit Edition it will crashed and only work with a modified GameDate file. And the online multiplayer does not work anymore!			"

												Sid Meier's Railroads! is the first train tycoon game I've ever played. I don't know why; tycoon games are one of my favorite subgenres of simulation games, and I love any games having to do with transportation of any type, from cars to ships to farming equipment. In saying that, know that this review is from someone who loves the genre and trains despite being relatively new to the railroad management subset.Sid Meier's Railroads! is a game that kept pleasantly surprising me. I went into this game figuring I would be building trains and connecting the tracks to various destinations. I hadn't known it would be this in depth, and yet so easy to learn. The game and its userface is extremely user friendly, and it has a short tutorial to teach you the basics. Everything else is figured out by playing scenarios. Since I was brand new to this type of game, I began by selecting a multiplayer map but electing to play first on my own so I could figure things out. That's when I realized that even when not playing competitively, this game is a ton of fun.You start out by having a city with a small track already built that you can build off of (also, all maps can be randomized, so playing through on the same maps over and over again is different every time). You need to then decide where to go from there. Different cities request different products, and you can deliver it to them from either suppliers or other cities. This gets to be a little more in depth because you can end up having a multiple step process to have one train deliver products to various cities (for example, Train A can be set up to pick up corn from a farm supplier, deliver it to City A, City A will then convert corn to food, Train A will take food to City B, etc.). You can also have trains deliver passengers and mail from city to city. Over the course of history, trains are unlocked that have better performance. It's extraordinarily simple to upgrade these trains to better trains that have been unlocked, and all without hindering its route. This is essentially the type of gameplay you can expect. To make things more interesting, however, depending on what cities and products you decide to utilize, cities and suppliers will grow to supply your demand and vice versa. By growing, suppliers can supply more resources and more quickly, while cities may be able to hold stock of more resources while space opens up where you can build your own industries. Cities will also request supplies from time to time, offering a cash reward for a certain product. These are some of the reasons that playing a fairly long game refrains from being boring; options are constantly opening up for you. Competitive mode with the AI is also fun, though I prefer the single player building aspect better myself. With the AI, they will do all the things you do, building tracks, causing cities and suppliers to grow, etc. The difference here is that you are obviously competing for the goal you have set, while also having the option to buy stock in your competitors and eventually merge or liquidate their company by completely buying them out--provided you have enough money.While this game has been a blast (it makes me regret not trying a railroad management game before this), it does have its problems. On modern systems (I have Windows 7 64bit, for example) the game begins to crash once a good amount of railroads and trains have been built. The game is set by default to restrict itself to using only 1 GB of RAM, and once you've been in a game for a half hour or so, it will surpass this and begin crashing to the desktop. HOWEVER, there are fixes for this (see the community forums). I downloaded a .exe file from http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Sid_Meier%27s_Railroads! that fixed everything, and haven't had a crash since. Also, the game is set by default to autosave, which saves your game every 60 seconds. Needless to say, even when it was crashing, I'd simply start it right back up and be just seconds away from where I was.In summary, this game is an amazing game that I would recommend to anyone, particularly simulation, tycoon, and management fans. I haven't been so instantly engrossed in a game in quite some time. I'm so happy I found this!			"

												Upon installing Sid Meier's Railroads, I was immediately taken by the game's intuitive design and the straightforward interface. This way, players are given a chance to enjoy the game and its numerous traits, regardless of their previous experiences with train sims. So, all it takes is going through the simplified 5-minute tutorial, and you should be ready for the challenges that come with the game's single-player and multiplayer modes. Sid Meier's Railroads boasts a unique way of allowing the player to get into the game as quickly and easily as possible. In addition, several single-player scenarios are on offer as well as a range of well-designed multiplayer maps.Firaxis managed to disregard any aspects of the gameplay that could burden the player or create unwanted micromanagement issues. Also, there's a choice of over 30 different industries to purchase and organize, 20 resources to manage and over 30 unique train models to produce and utilize. Each scenario revolves around completing a wide range of tasks, after which you can look forward to many cool bonuses - thus improving your cash balance and instituting a more stable economy for future endeavors.Looking at the graphics, Sid Meier's Railroads includes just about everything you can hope to find in a train-sim. Realistic and colorful surroundings and detailed locomotive models manage to capture the player's eye almost straight away. As your very own mass transit system begins to take shape, you'll be able to acknowledge the developer's admirable attention to detail. In closing, this game is catchy and has a little something for everyone.			"

												This is an enjoyable game, in principle, but it's just too crash-happy.  In five hours of play, it must have crashed over 15 times for me, and it can get itself caught in such a state that even though you can re-load autosaves, it'll keep crashing at the same point, effectively ending that particular playthrough.Edit: As pointed out below, the game issues are likely primarily an age rather than coding/QA thing (although there are still issues with train routing that are a code, not compatibility thing).  That said, would recommend a high degree of caution before playing this game on more modern system.s			"

												SMR! is one of my favorit games. I had bought a copy way back in 2005 or 06 and played the crap out of it until the disk was destroyed. I was pretty excited when I found it on Steam. And then I discovered that 2K Games decided to throw a ""classic"" up with out patching it to work on modern machines. While there is a patch created by a player to make it work (most of the time) I still cant recommend purchasing this game.			"

												Being a big fan of simulation games and a model railroader, games which combine the two interests are often quickly added to my collection. Soon after Sid Meier;s Railroads! came out, I purchased it on disk, and played it a pretty good bit. I enjoyed it, but found it rather cartoony and unrealistic, especially compared to earlier titles in the series (Railroad Tycoon 1, 2 & 3.) I also found that your railroad builds up way too quickly and you end up making more money than you could use after about an hour or so on a map. Also the maps are incredibly undersized, and in a matter of a couple hours, you can't build another line because there's nowhere to build it to, from, or across!Railroads! is rather fun, but I completely lose interest in a map after a couple hours because there's nothing left to do. The scenerios are easy, quick and too few, steam locomotives never have tenders (which just looks wrong on most engines), and there are many features from older versions that are completely abandoned!So a quick breakdown:Pros:-More approachable for beginners-Good for quick games, unlike older versions-Great opening cinematic-More approachable for non-railroaders-Very approachable stock marketCons:-Little content-Unrealistic-Over-simplified-Maps are far too small-No tenders on steam engines-Poorly balanced-Maps take less than a couple hours to lose their entertainment valueSo my feeling is that if you want a casual Tycoon game, this is for you, but if you're a hardcore Tycoon, try Railroad Tycoon 2 or 3. (My favorite from the series is 2)			"

												Sid Meier's Railroads! is old - but still one of the best train sandbox games that there is today.  If you've played games like Transport Tycoon (Deluxe) and Railroad Tycoon (or any of its 2 sequels), then this is a must game for you.  It's a typical Sandbox style build up a rail empire type game with many fun and challenging scenarios.  There is an issue running this game on 64 bit operating systems where the game will crash with an exception error, but this can be easily fixed by applying a 3 GB memory patch which is very well documented on fan sites which exist for the game (use Google) - other than that, it's a game which will give you many hours of entertainment.I need to point out that this is not a train simulator - you do not get to drive the actual trains.I also prefer this game a lot more over Cities in Motion (if you've played it) because it doesn't require as much micro-management.  You build the track, add the trains, tell it what routes to take and what cargo, and off you go! The only additional management you need to do is upgrade your trains as new engines become available.Most enjoyable, and worth the few bob.  I am yet to find another game which is this game's equal or successor.			"

												I've always loved business simulations and the kid version of me loves trains. Even though I have both of those things in me, I just didn't like the thought of a railroad tycoon type of game even if it is from the great Sid Meier.After playing it though, its an enjoyable little game with a competitive element (if you chose). You chose the era to start and era to end the game. The game basically consists of you connecting resources, supply and demand. Resources get generated, such as oil, grapes, crops, livestock, minerals and so on. Then you connect them to towns that need them. A town will have one of three things demanding these resources. You setup the tracks, then make a train route to bring them in. It is just that simple. The towns will grow into cities. When they take the resources, based on what buildings they have, such as livestock and crops will turn into food. Minerals will turn into gold and so on. Then you export them to other towns that need them. The towns will grow into cities and get more buildings and need more resources for you to bring them. New towns will generate too.The real twist here is a competitive element (if you have AI opponents). Even in single player, you can have up to 3 AI opponents (or no competition). A game of Monopoly really. You can buy stock in the other companies. You can sell your own stock for money. You don't just get money doing routes. You also get money buying facilities in towns and cities. However, when you try to buy them, you'll end up bidding against the AI competition if you have any. You can also construct facilities yourself for a flat fee if there are any available lots in a town or city. This means, you can play Monopoly and never actually build a railroad. There's a buzz buying out your competition, but I never really felt all that threatened by them, even with all of their tracks around me. The twist of having stock and buying buildings makes the game a lot of fun in a game that wouldn't warrant replays. It is always the same map, BUT there is an option to randomize the land and cities which is very nice.With all of that said, its a fun, relaxing, yet competitive game (if you have AI or do multi-player), but the only downside is, there's not much variety here. Once you've played one full game, you've played it all. There are victory conditions, but they're not front and center, so there's no focus on it. At $10, if you're into Monopoly style games, or railroading in general, give it a go. Otherwise, wait for a sale.			"

												This game is fun, especially with kids.Unfortunately, it is absolutely ruined by the instablity in late-game when the system of bridges/tunnels/tracks gets more complex. The game runs track layout simulations in real time to indicate what the completed track would look like and cost, and that's usually when the crashes happen. It is absolutely game-breaking.Do not buy this game until they fix the instability.			"

												EDIT - THERE IS A FIX FOR THE CRASHING BUG.... IT'S NOT HARD TO FIND. IF YOU ARE REALLY STUCK, ADD ME AND I""LL DO THE LEG WORK FOR YOU. Aside from a launching bug which (causes memory problems??) and can crash your system... this game, to me, is a lot of fun. There are fixes you can dl to repair the bug and it works flawlessly. Frankly I don't understand why fan's can and have patch the game to make it playable, and why the publisher can't just contact the author of the fix, ask for it, (give them some love, ahem, money for fixing their broken game) and then patch it in to the offical steam file. Anyways, that ♥♥♥♥♥in aside. As you can see, I've spend a few hours (300 plus... oh my) on this game. It's not complex. It's a fun little blow some steam off after work or great for late at night when you just want to play a fun little game that doesnt require thinking or people. Right now it's on sale for $2.74 CAN, which prob translates to about $2 US. It lakes achievements, but other than that, whats the problem? If you like train games, management style games, this is a fun little pick up. If you want gran master strats and AAA graphics... keep looking. Honesly though, i don't know why this game has mixed reviews... other than the launcher problems, the lack of achivements and multiplayer... is horrible. Oh, and the depth... there aren't alot of levels. Still, thats why you hit RANDOM people...Honestly though, here are my ratings.Fun Factor - 8/10Graphics - 7/10Music/ Sound - 3/10Bang for your Buck - Top of the Line, Las Vegas Escort Bunny Ranch value for cheap motel backlot stripper club with 50 year old plus ripper prices... 10/10It's $2... seriously...

There are a lot of train games for the PC, but few are as lightweight and approachable as this one.I’ve heard it said that everyone has a little fondness for trains and this game is sure to appeal to that little bit in a big way.Contrary to Sid’s flagship Civilization series, ease of use seems to be the secret ingredient behind Railroads and its engrossing gameplay. Setting up your first station is pips and in no time at all you’ll have an entire network of trains delivering everything from passengers, coal, food and automobiles to the various towns and industries looking to reward you for your efforts.The scalable difficulty in Railroads is a real winner too as it allows you to tailor how in-depth an experience you’re after. The easiest difficulty will allow trains to pass through each other without delay whereas a harder mode will demand you route trains carefully, punishing you with delays should you mangle your track layout.Once the money starts rolling in though, things get surprisingly addictive as you sit back and watch your trains dutifully trundling back and forth between stations and annexes, generating you cash with a very satisfying ka-ching! sound effect in accompaniment.For less ruthlessly minded players at least, the multiplayer component in Railroads is somewhat muted, with not a whole lot of interaction on offer but the whole aspect of buying out other players on the stock market gives it some real teeth. I remember once hearing it described as a corporate deathmatch more than a train simulation; something that might not be too far away from the truth!Railroads was well received on release and enjoys a small fan base to this day, but it’s a shame that the move to 64-bit computer systems has hampered this title’s ability to run effectively on newer computers. Just be sure that you check the online guides on how to get this title working properly!Even so, it’s still a great way to waste a couple of hours on a Sunday afternoon that’s for sure.Read the full retrospective at my blog »[www.celjaded.com] "

												I'm playing under Win8.1, sometimes it does crash, but it's not frequent.The game itself is a very addictive one, and the custom maps from http://smrsimple.com/ make it even better.I would recommend it for those who want to play with a tycoon game, but do no want to deal with complex game systems.This (i.e. lack of complex game system) is also a weakness of the game: since you can not control the signals on the tracks, trains sometimes get stuck by their own fault (e.g. they change rails when they could go straight ahead).All in all, despite some errors, it is a very lovable game.

												If you're a fan of OpenTTD, Railroad Tycoon 2, RRT3 or similar games: I do not recommend this game. It's style over substance.Having just played Railroads (I stopped when it crashed) I can't believe this has so many positive reviews on Steam and magazines via Metacritic. It came out in 2007, but OpenTTD was more than alive at that time and far superior. This game is brain-dead. It's a train network game, except you can't properly adjust the train network! The auto-track placement and the complete lack of manual signals ruins this game. You get signals where you don't want signals and you can't remove them. The signals do nothing more than claim the section of track from here to the next signal, but that doesn't work when the game is placing a million pointless signals. It doesn't matter if you always make sure to use the green 'extend' rather than the yellow 'fork' placement. The game still produces insane signal placement. I had one stretch of nice smooth track with a signal at either end. I use the ""double up"" button and double up the entire length and now suddenly I have 6 signals right next to each other in the middle of the track, which was pointless and just messed everything up if I wanted to try and share that line. Creating passing places is also extremely difficult and trains will often just blunder their way down the track until two are in a head-to-head deadlock either side of the signals. There's no way to reverse the train so the only solution is to nuke the train and buy it again.Also: the fully stocked train is usually the same length as the track between the resource producer and consumer! There's no room for maneuver, which further exacerbates the no-passing-places and signalling problem.Because of the stupid signals and the uber long trains, you basically have to dedicated a line to each train. Trains cannot share track. I find that pretty demented and it basically reduces the game down to laying a track, build some stations, placing a track to exclusively dominate a section of track and then simply sitting back and watching. There's no real decision making. You can't sit their endlessly tweaking a track for extra efficiency as you can in OpenTTD.Also: The track-layer is also really finicky. When trying to create branches I often ended up with lots of tiny bits of track that took me ages to delete because it perfectly overlaps the other bit of track. Given that ""lay track"" is one of the 3 primary things you can do, it gets annoying fast.			"

												It's fun, takes me back to the 90's when I used to stay up late at night playing the first Railroad Tycoon. If you want a good throwback that runs on modern systems (I haven't experienced any issues), this is it right here.Don't let the screenshots fool you, this game runs at a full 1920x1080 (or 1680x1050).Enter bidding wars for new technologies, buy and sell stocks, watch your towns grow as your trains supply them with passengers, mail, and freight. Buy depots and upgrade them, build industries in your town for supply-chain economics. Upgrade your engines with the click of a button. Edit routes, lay tracks, get creative. Sometimes this game reminds me of building circuits. It's not always easy to set up routes for maximum efficiency, because at the highest realism settings, trains will stop if they run into each other on the tracks. You have to be careful how you lay your tracks, but that's part of the fun!			"

												I played this game when I was younger.I originally found this game at a Half Price Books on their clearance shelf. As a young kid, I loved trains, and dropped the $2.50 it was for the game. Came with the CD and all and I fell in love.I think i've played a total of 1,000+ hours of this game with that disk. Unfortunately, I could never find another copy of this game anywhere. My disk broke when we moved houses and I forgot all about this game.The other day, this came up in the steam store under recommended (Because I had purchased Train Simulator) and it brought back old memories. Picked it up and fell in love all over again.There is a known issue, the game crashing with newer systems, and there is a steam forum post with how to fix it, so dont let that deter you if you see bad reviews about the game crashing. They just dont want to fix a fix.As for you, I 100% recommend you pick up this game and give it a try. Very simple, very minimalistic and easy to catch on to.Game review - 10/10Also, Sid Meier & Company, I'd love to see a newer version of this game, If you could please.			"

												Three reasons why you should never waste your money on this game:1. It crashes constantly.2. Even when it is not crashing repeatedly and unexpectedly it is extremely bug-infested and problematic, particularly when the train routing difficulty is set to ""hard."" Trains will continually fall idle because the game mechanics are not intelligent enough to re-route the train onto another track.3. The game itself is very simplistic and hokey (e.g., automobile factories in 1830?) and not detailed or prolonged enough to be enjoyable with other online or AI players.Considering that the title bears a Sid Meiers marquis makes this game a tragic disappointment.

												So, the first thing you need to know about this game is that this is in fact the original Railroad Tycoon, it's just been renamed and updated to play on modern OS such as Vista and Windows 7 (see other reviews about compatibility with newer).  There's a version of RT1 on Steam that DOES NOT play on modern OS.  But don't buy it if you're not working on an antique; you don't need it.As for the ""RAM-filled"" crashing glitch, definitely dowload the patch mentioned in other reviews, but before that turn off autosave.  It saves every minute for some god-awful reason, which pushes you towards the ram limit quickly.  With that turned off, I've played for six + hours without a hitch (though I also downloaded the player-made patch, so I can't tell which did the trick, if not both).As to gameplay, as another reviewer said, there are about 15 maps, each with scenarios that take about an hour.  However,  you can play them on three different difficulty levels, with 0 to 3 AI players, and each has gold, silver, and bronze victory conditions, so there are quite a few permutations available to keep you interested.  You can also randomize the town locations, but even without that, each time you play a map, the msc resources (lumber mills, cattle pastures, grain farms, etc) randomly generate their locations.The most fun part about this game for me is efficiency of transport.  You can have up to four tracks per station, upgrade engines, stations, and towns to make them faster and with higher return values, and also buy properties in the towns for extra income.  This diversification of investments is more important when you're playing against AI---basically, you can own a piece of your competetor's pie! (Or they'll fight you for yours....)The game is one of Sid Meyer's best from back in the day, and it balances well the ability to play as a sandbox builder vs a super-competitve crazy land.  (Part of the point of the game from the competitve pov is clearly to make 900 foot high roman-arched bridges over your competetors' tracks.)  If you play it like that, it's downright zany.  Truly, early Sid Meyer.  But it's also got great mechanics and logic, as per par for SM games.The graphics are also super cute, which I particularly like.  They stand the test of time.A couple of tips to players: There's a feature that lets you go-to cities (bottom left of control panel), which is really helpful for maps that center around places you've never lived/been. (Like various parts of Europe, in my case.)  Too, you can press + or - to increase or decrease the elevation of your tracks.  There's no other way to get a tunnel when it wants to auto-build you a bridge.  Also, holding the mouse wheel allows you to swivel the map, which you can't do in RT2.If you're wondering wether to get RT1 or 2, I like both, but for different reasons.  I think RT1 is a better game, though I remember playing RT2 way more as a kid.  RT1 is more about building and logistics, whereas I'd say RT2 is more about making money.  It's also a way harder game.  The graphics in RT2 use the Tropico engine, which is actually rather frustrating for that game.  The camera also doesn't swivel; you get four fixed viewpoints.  I could never find a satisfying map angel in RT2, and I don't know about you, but that just drives me absoutely nuts.All in all, a very solid game, a favorite oldie, and definitely worth the tiny price.  It's one of my top favorites of all time, right up there with Roller Coaster Tycoon.  Go ahead and buy it!LONG STORY SHORT:Pros:+ Very logical gameplay+ Well-ordered+ Cute graphics+ Short scenario play so you can have fun but still go outside and live your life+ Multiple scenario difficulty options + Some randomization of every map+ Town Randomization available on any map+ 0 - 3 AI players+ Kids can play but adults will be challenged too+ Historic events and engine progression is sort of in the background but a lot of fun for people who are buffs/nerds of that variety :)Cons+ Need some initial fussing with it to keep it from crashing+ Game starts to freeze on my computer when I get close to having the entire map networked (I'm on a laptop though)+ If you're connecting existing tracks, make sure the arrow cursors are green, not yellow. You will get better at it, but initially you will lay track to nowhere that you can't delete because your trains are running over it and you will curse SO MUCH.+ Can't upgrade all train engines at once + Only about 15 maps; can't recall if there's a fully randomized map option.+ There's human multiplayer on this game but I'm not sure how to make it work these days; haven't tried to use it			"

												The track laying is cumbersome at times, trains don't stick to routes when you double-track well, the electrified track is missing so electric locomotives draw pantograph power from some magical electric source in the air, and you start to get annoyed hearing La Marseille every single time you zoom in on a city in France.And yet, much like every other Sid Meier game, it still manages to be addicting and fun.

												Great classic from Sid Meier. This game doesn't deserve the mixed reviews from the steam community as it is a very good game that passed the test of time and it's only flaw it's the compatibility with new systems, which can easly be solved in 5 minutes without any particular skill.I will post this easy procedure here, as I'm seeing in the other reviews that many people are having problems with the game constantly crashing: Download http://www.smrsimple.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/SidMeiersRailroads3GBEnabler.zip and extract it in a folder, which I'll call ""Patch folder"" from now on Go in your game folder (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Railroads) and copy ""Railroads.exe"" in the previously created ""Patch folder"" Now go in the ""Patch folder"" and run Startme.bat (NOT as administrator) A command prompt will show up, press enter and then press A. Some text will show telling you that ""Large Address Aware"" has been enabled. Press enter and then E to close the prompt Now copy the file Railroads.exe in the ""Patch folder"" back to the game folder (again, usually at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Railroads) Run the game from either Steam or Railroads.exe and enjoy this great game!I hope this fix will be of any help to whom is having issues with the game crashing.

												The thing about Railroads! is that it is simple, yet addictive. I played this shortly after release and couldn't stop, even though it had the strangest limitations - take the inability to build several independent railroads on one map as an example. Despite its oversimplified character and rather controversial artstyle (though beautiful it looks more like a Toys'R'Us display than a real railroad) it provides good exercise in imagination and the purest of joys - that of building your own tracks and setting your own trains on them to then watch how majestically they deliver cargo and passengers. That itself is enough to really have a blast with the game. Add some nice economic elements and not to shabby AI competition and you have got yourself a nice purchase. Definitely recommend.			"

												This game is very addictive. You choose historical locations and play through time periods. The achievements in the game match the historical development of the region as technology progressed as those countries grew. You build a railroad empire by connecting raw materials with prodution facilities and then spreading finished goods and passengers. The more businesses you own that produce finished goods the more money you make. The graphics are really good, its an old game and it still looks good. The terrain features and plotting of railroads work very well.Throughout a game, you upgrade your trains and stations to keep in line with technology and to control maintenance costs. You have stock in your own company to sell at first, but you have to buy it back or someone might buy you out of the game. You can also purchase other players stock. This can be a good investment stragegy as you can sell high, but a major goal of the game is to buy out all your competitors. The music is very amusing. You feel like you are gold digging in the Old West. There are several included historical regions that range form Southwest and Northeast United States to Germany/France and England. You can also generate maps based on certain scripts, such as no hills or mountains. There is a multiplayer but I don't think it is used much.Definitely a good game. The songs get stuck in your head.			"

												Got this game as part of the Sid Meier bundle from the Humble Bundle website. I was quite excited about this game as I've played Railroad Tycoon II when I was younger (and ended up buying Railroad Tycoon II Platinum on Steam a few months ago). This game has the same concept wheras you start off on a map with some money, and you are to build your first line between two towns/cities to satisfy their demands. As you gain more money from doing so, you can then start to branch out and really build your company. It's not just about meeting the demands though, it's also about doing so in the most effective manor. That way you can meet demands and make the most profits. Although the game is not exactly the same as Railroad Tycoon II, it carries over a lot of the gameplay features. Because of this, anyone who has played a past Railroad Tycoon game will probably be able to work their way around this game quite easily. The game isn't too hard for beginners to get a hold of either as it isn't an overly complicated game. I'm am writing this review after playing this game for over an hour, when I wasn't even planning to play for half of that time. Just goes to show how fun and enjoyable this game can be. Thumbs up from me.			"

												A gem of a transport/trade simulation game. Simple mechanics - build rail lines -run trains - transport things and people - earn money - manage your finances - grow your company . After you start losing to AI bots - you start seeing the finer nuances that the game packs below that obvious layer of simplicity.  The effects of terrain , random events ,the stock market , aggressive expansion slowly start to make sense. Like any Sid Meier classic- this one grows better with time.Sadly, the multi-player aspect is gone . The graphics are surely out -of-date but in no way ugly. I had to download a patched file from pcgamingwiki - for a memory bug to be handled. Heck this game is old - ok ? It needs some help from you to run well on modern systems. But for me, the simple tweaks are totally worth the experience.I wish this was remade today with Steam Workshop support and modern graphics - with no changes to the basic mechanics.

												Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon was the third game I ever purchased back in the 1800's, no, I'm kidding (Though it feels like it at times.) I actually purchased it in 1990 not long after acquiring my first desktop PC. I have played the series religiously since. I have roughly 100 hours in this game in the original 2006 disc retail box version. It certainly isn't a successor to the venerable Railroad Tycoon III, but it's still quite enjoyable if you realize this going in. The game is more of a ""beer & pretzels"" type real time strategy game with an emphasis  on attracting more casual type gamers. The game has a charming art style more akin to an HO or N scale model train layout than the ostensible real world look of the previous Railroad Tycoon games. Industry acquisitions and playing the stock market against other AI railroad barons seem to have become more important in this title with train consists and railroad track signaling unfortunately taking a back seat. Being able to build your own train consists is possible (and necessary), but the importance seems to have been watered down compared to previous titles. Manual signaling has been removed altogether. The scenarios and their variety are adequate, but pale dim in comparison to Railroad Tycoon III. Firaxis encouraged fans to build maps and scenarios to add to the scenarios available. These additional scenarios can still be found on fansites. The game originally included multiplayer. Be advised, this feature has been truncated from the game entirely. The Steam version of Sid Meier's Railroads! has no multiplayer feature whatsover. My boxed version would not run on Windows Vista without crashing to the desktop continually. It runs on my current iteration of Windows 7 64-bit, but there is a known bug concerning multi-core processors the game doesn't like. I noticed specifically when building long stretches of track I would get crashes to the desktop. I've played the Steam version for over two dozen hours as of this writing, and I rarely get a desktop crash anymore. I miss the previous versions of Sid Meier's wonderful railroad games, but oddly, this one has become my favorite of the series. Despite its lack of seriousness, it's still challenging. The game exudes Sid Meier's influence in every pixel. It's colorful art style blooms beautifully, and the sound design which has been lovingly crafted really adds to the ambience. Music from each time period sets the tone and changes along with the times. Zooming in to view the busy animations of each industry and city building is the icing on the cake.			"

												I have first played this game more than 10 years ago. When I saw it on steam I bought immediately. Never regret once. It is still fun to play with better graphics.Also there is an error that keeps quiting the game after 30-60mins of play. Dont know if it is because of me or the game. "

												Well, unlike some other reviewers, I've been lucky and it doesn't crash for me (not that I remember anyway).I think of it as an excellent game on a casual(ish) side. If you enjoy building railroads and watching trains go by carrying stuff from town to town, it's a very nice little gem. For me, it's one of those games that I enjoy when on holidays and feel like passing some time.			"

												i give this game a positive review (with reservations) because i love railroads and the general design of this game is a lot of fun. However, it does lack polish and seems somewhat unfinished. For just a few bucks, though, i think the fun value is definitely worth some of the annoyances. i definitely wish they had loved this one a little more.The Good: Graphics Music/sound AI is reasonable Easy and fun to get into and play Varied strategic options Animations; Lock Cam mode Gives the feel of a real model railroadThe Bad: Train routing logic/algorithmTruly horrible stuff here. Seems like the programmers outdid themselves making this difficult on players. You cannot specify one-way tracks in the game. Also, the track signals are nearly meaningless as trains regularly sit forever for no reason (it seems) at green signals while often ignoring red ones. This often creates traffic jams which cannot be easily resolved without deleting trains. Actually, what is usually happening is that trains won't move past a green signal until they see a clear route to a station and a 'free' platform track (part of the routing logic). The game will usually suggest creating another parallel track somewhere to resolve the problem. Better solutions seem to be: Create only point to point tracks limited to one train whenever possible and avoid point to loop, loop to loop, and ""shared mainline"" routes (although the latter can be done if done properly) Always have at least two station platform tracks at shared stations  Avoid adding 'extra' signals between stations Game interface/ease of play conveniencesSorry, but they didn't spend much time working out how to make the interface user-friendly for ease-of-play. Even the original Railroad Tycoon is much better here. There's only about a hundred or so improvements which could be made to make the game play easier (like adding opponents stations and cargo to the routing/consist interface, putting the opponents stations 'colored dots' on the mini-map, having various messages come up about events (such as opponents building into new towns, etc.)), etc., etc., etc.As a result, unless you want to get far behind your opponents (who build track INSTANTLY) you have to pause the game a lot to look around and see what's going on, gather information, etc., which wouldn't have to be done if the interface provided better information. Game scale and paceThe game is most fun if played in REAL-TIME (without stop-and-go pausing) but, though it starts slowly, as the players progress and there are more trains and stations to manage the pace of the game increases DRAMATICALLY which makes it harder and harder for the player to study and manage all the changing variables. This occurs because as the players' incomes and earning power go up, the costs to build go down.Best thing to do is keep your routes as simple as possible, don't put many trains on shared sections of track, and prefer creating new routes rather than fixing old ones (which is costly in terms of 'game-time'). Financial and stock market models simplistic and silly Track building (especially bridges and tunnels) probably not costly enough No track or station maintenance, only on engines All industries cost the same (and probably too little) No local market rates (i.e. as in RRT3), only global ones Costs go down rather than up No borrowing or interest rates Can't protect yourself from being bought out no matter how many stock shares ownedAs a result of this last, every game ends pretty much the same way - a race to stockpile cash to buy out your opponents.  Only 15 scenarios, 8 of them multiplayer (is there multiplayer somewhere?)The Ugly:Game crashes a lot due to memory errors and flaws in the construction mode when the mouse cursor is held over animations. Supposedly there is a fix for the memory problem.There's more, but i'll stop here.CONCLUSIONOkay, so if there's so much that needed to be fixed and improved, why do i recommend this game? Well, despite all this, when it isn't crashing it's SO MUCH DARN FUN!:)So, for a few bucks i say OK, but sadly, i wonder how good this one could have been if they cared to put out their best product.:(			"

You have to be saving your game every 3-5 minutes just to protect your progress before it ""Crashes"" & it will ""Crash"". The ""Auto-Save"" is a ""JOKE"". ..... However, if you have the patience to deal with a game constantly ""Crashing"" & can work around that, then I ""HIGHLY"" reccomend this game. ..... I play countless hours on it & it never gets boring for me. Some goals are very differcult to accomplish. You can still win without them, however if you are someone like me that thrives on perfection & accomplishing everything. Then you will enjoy this game. ..... The track laying is awesome. You can create & design any track as long as you have enough capital to build it. .....I rate it 7 out of 10. ..... Only reason I do NOT give it a 10 is because it loses 3 just for the HUGE & FUSTRATING annoyance of the consistant ""Crashing"".			"

												The price for 10.99 is just fare enough to try it out and I do recommend  playing the game, espcially if you're into table top train modles, world design and engine unity. I gamed for two hard weeks because I really enjoyed screwing around with the Gmod style track placement. (Which is to me the best part of the game.) The business system in the game is simple to follow though I do wish it was more in depth. Map's are neat and well designed but little bit to small for six players at a time. If you really uncertain put in your wishlist and wait for a Steam sale and give this game a try!			"

												This game is quite old, but still is one of the most fun games that I've ever enjoyed playing.  It has difficulties accessing higher amounts of memory in current operating systems, but these difficulties are easily overcome with a simple download from a fan site.  There are several fan sites out there, and they offer everything from new maps to historical livery for the trains.  The module which permits the game to address higher memory also adds coal cars to the steam driven trains.  Replay value is extremely high.  The only question in my mind, especially considering what the sales figure as were, is why Sid Meier's has not issued an update perhaps with some additional content in it as he has done with his other great hits, such as the Civilization series.  Maybe someday…			"

												Despite its age, there aren't many games that can be classified in the same category as Railroads. To describe the mechanics of the game, you start with a number of cities, each with a supply, demand, and number of industries. As a railroad engineer, you connect cities by connecting them with railroads, buying trains, and designing trade routes. By using industries to convert resources to products, and then selling those products to larger cities, victory can be achieved in a number of virtual decades. Mutliplayer, unfortunately, is dead, which is sad because it would be an intriguing concept to have several players working together (or against eachother) to build up the largest stockpile of funds as cities are connected in a web of railroads.This game is addicting, there's plenty of scenarios to play through, and plenty of maps to use. Furthermore, by randomizing cities descriptions and locations, there's a near-endless amount of ways this game can be played.For the current price, there's no reason why a fan of Sid Meier shouldn't have this in their collection. Get it!			"

												This has been one of my favorite Sid Meier's game of all time, I've been playing it now for about 9 years and even though I had multiple physical copies, bought the Steam version awhile back.As a child I loved trains to the point that my parents would have to pull the car over anytime I saw one so I could watch it go by. I also had a huge train set that we built that was about 24 feet by 8 feet . These little facts might be why I love this game so much, it triggers something from my childhood.Its not a complex game, but its fun and really draws you in. It is a litte qirky sometimes laying tracks and the track laying AI of the competition is at times questionable; but it is a 9 year old game.It is a game I keep finding myself going back to for a short game every so often. Now I have NEVER had it crash once on any of my systems and I've played the  Steam version with Windows XP, 7 and 8.0 (always Nvidia GPUs). I'm not sure what is causing some people to have it crash on them. I've layed tracks from one end of the world to the other, I had it pause for a bit but never crash.If your looking for a simulation, this game is not for you at all.  If your looking for a semi casual game then give it try, with the steam refund policy just put the game through a good test to make sure it works on your system since some people seem to have issues.

												Great time killer or for when your up and down alot. No real downside. Can even stick your own pictures on the trains. Best strategy I can offer is pause the game the moment it opens into the map and find out where your opponents are (1 player of course) and if you can afford it make a cheap stop and use your tracks to cut off the enemy train station(s), then build up money as your enemy flounders then buy him out and liquidate, can sandbox and build money/acheivements etc...

												I'm laid in a hospital bed after playing this game for 71 hours straight without food or drink. That's just how good this game is. It's always been my dream to relay Germany's entire rail system and with Sid Meier's Railroads, I can. I've been told there's a 60% chance I may not make it but I don't care. I'll die happily knowing that I connected Dresden to Hamburg via high speed rail. Knowing that the good people of Norwich can travel quickly and efficiently to Wrexham without a worry in the world. Knowing that the good men, women and children can travel between Paris and Calais without worrying about safety because, unlike life, safety in train travel is eternal. My friends, I just want you to know that Sid Meier's Railroads is the pinnacle of video game entertainment and has been undeservedly ignored for game of the year awards, etc. However it does not matter, to me I would say that this is the greatest video game of all time. I shed a tear, as I'm surrounded by my family and doctors, for those who have not played this game and for those who won't. Well worth the money. The greatest game in history.

												If you really, really dislike someone, give them a copy of this game."" by: pfk3I have edited my review here that I previously submitted on ebay 01-25-15 (by catwacker) where I had bought a new sealed copy of this game to compare or possibly replace the download from Steam that CRASHES, CRASHES, CRASHES constantly!No change in performance from the downloaded game to the newly purchased game.I've tried this on 2 different PCs running Windows XP Pro, 3.0 GHz Hyper-Threaded CPU, 4 GB DDR RAM, 256 MB nVidia FX5500 Vid card and on a Dell Inspiron 1521 laptop running Vista Home Premium, Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core TK-55 1.80 GHz CPU, 4 GB DDR2 PC-6400 RAM, ATI Radeon X1270 Video Adapter/ 192 MB Shared base Video Memory. (dxdiag Display tab says 1662 MB approx. Total Memory.)Never having experienced the crashing issue on such a grand scale with any other game that requires only a 1.4 GHz CPU, and 64 MB video memory + 9.0 DirectX, I would have to say THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE GAME and is NOT Steam's fault.Read on: Sid Meier's RAILROADS game has more crashes than all the world's real railroads combined. Problems with the game are well known and detailed in many places on the internet. The game suffers from not being able to use enough memory to run it.Fixes/ patches that are supposed to rectify the problem in many cases only seem to make it worse.Within the gameplay there will be MANY times while laying new track that existing track will disappear, and you will see your trains running on dirt. That isn't so bad except that if you wish to continue laying track to connect to existing rails in an area that has multiple lines running in a congested area, it makes it difficult to be sure you are connecting to the set of rails intended. As the game graphics become even more overloaded, (and they WILL), you will find that the terrain map will become ""layered"" or ""jumbled"", blocking the view of the actual terrain beneath it. Areas of water will appear where there should be none, further obliterating the view. Entire cities buildings will disappear, leaving only the train station visible. You CAN do a game save, escape to the desktop, and restart the game, and USUALLY most everything will be back to normal, but NOT always. Furthermore, as soon as you start laying new track again, there go the old tracks and it starts all over.Not all scenarios cause these effects on the same plane.The desert Mesa games seem to be the worst. Too bad. A fun game when it works right, which is not too often.One more note: When the game reaches the year 2070, it comes to a screeching halt, and if you were playing a glitch-free episode and having fun, well..... yer fun ends bud. Oh, and did I mention the out and out and unexpected game crashes when you, as the player are sitting back just watching the action, and did NOTHING to cause them? 1 Star Rating because this was poorly developed and after 7+ years you'd think new patches would've been issued to finally fix this wreck.

												My husband and I both LOVE this game. There's a lot of depth to the game that really makes it challenging! When you first start up, it's best to follow the tutorial just so you know the controls. Then, see how much money you can make by shipping the correct goods to the right city--but watch for in case a town develops into a city and wants new items! You can also build/purchase a company in different cities so that you can earn even more profits. Playing with AI or other players adds a whole new level to the game when you can't use or build onto others' railroads. Instead, you have to lay your tracks around or over their tracks to get to where you need to go. Playing with another human is fun as well; hubby and I quickly found that you can force players to pay an outrageous amount of money for something they really want--or something they don't want you to get. At the same time, if you buy a company on their rail tracks, they can simply stop shipping items to your company--and you lose all the potential profits you could be making. If you make enough money, you can purchase the stocks of other players, and potentially buy out their company. Be careful about if you choose to liquidate them or merge them.... Liquidation adds all of monetary value of their stuff the the monetary value of your stocks---not to your bank account. However, if you do choose to merge their company with yours (allowing you to combine your tracks, edit theirs, and so on), you'll find that the AI tends to be rather stupid and make money--somehow--from shipping a train full of magic nothing back and forth between two cities which requires a lot of poking around to make all their stuff actually profitable for you. lol.If you like management strategy games--this is definitely worth giving a try!The only downside is the game will crash a LOT when  you first get it. I circumnavigated this issue by simply saving the game every two minutes and then loading the game from the saved files everytime it crashed anyways. There IS a fix for this crash issue somewhere in the forums. Hubby has WIndows7 and I have Windows8, and the fix (which called for replacing the game file with another one offered in the forums--or, alternatively, simply typing in a few coding changes in the game file manually) resolved the crashing issue for both of our computers. Once fixed, however, the game will provide hours of challenging track-laying and course-plotting to hopefully make you millions (in in-game currency of course, lol)!			"

												I recommend this game for all of those train lovers because it is like a simulation of having your own railroad industry. When you see a town, hover your cursor to see what they supply and demand. Give them what they demand and give the things they supply to other towns that need it. For more information, there is a tutorial in the game. Anyway, I also LOVE the multiplayer because you get to build with other people. But sadly, on the multyplayer mode they no longer have playing on internet, now you have to play with people on your local network who have this game. But overall this game is one of the best games I ever played because I love trains and building a good industry. For only $9.99 you can purchase this game and have a fun time.

												Okay when I first got this game, it crashed within 30 minutes. I probably toyed with it for a few hours trying to figure out why the game was doing such a thing. (the best way to stop the crashing is to lower your graphic settings to medium rather than high... well it worked for me anyway.)Aside from my rather rocky start, Sid Meier did a wonderful job on this game. Controlling the railroad industry can be so entertaining (especially if you make it do really humorous roller coaster-ish looking tracks.)Sure the train's A.I. programming ain't the best on the earth but you can always adjust it so the trains move much more easily.All in all this game brings me back to my days as a child playing with those little wooden Thomas the Tank Engine toys I loved so much.These games major drawbacks are mostly Ai issues. But the level design for the most part is well edited and the track maker is just plain fun to mess around with. "

 A Game for Those Not Looking for a Tycoon-Level Game     I got this game as part of the Sid Meier's Humble Bundle. Having previously played Railroad Tycoon 3 extensively, I was looking forward to a modern sequel. However, this isn't a sequel.  This game is much less advanced in it's in -game economy, track types, consist editing, and locomotive selection. AI will also sometimes have issues traversing your track, getting stuck in loops, or not using low-congestion bypasses.  That's not to say it isn't fun. You can still enjoy playing against AI or others, but it's more causal train enthusiast level than armchair railroad president.  The graphics are nice, but neither advanced, nor detailed.  Textures aren't that high of a resolution, and steam locomotives lose their tenders for the game. Overall, enjoyable, but not deep. + Ease of Use+  Art Style+ Gameplay-------------------------- Poor AI Routing- Mechanics Lack Depth- Graphics Could Be Better  Overall Score: 7/10  (Good)			"

												I've enjoyed this game a lot, but it has its glitches, and they are considerable.(1) I crash to desktop (CTD) about once an hour, maybe once every two. Inexplicably. This is common.(2) Despite having multiple maps/scenarios, after about an hour on each map, the economy is simplistic.(3) Route mapping for the train tracks is... odd.Despite these issues, I really enjoy this game. I'm a sucker for sim/strategy games, though. And I guess I've got a soft spot for model railroads -- who knew?The CTD is apparently pretty common. Auto-save every minute makes this an annoyance rather than a non-playable issue.The economy being so simple is annoying, but is an essential element of the gameplay. i.e.: this city needs this good - send it there. That's the point! It would be oddly restrictive if the objectives swapped around.I cannot abide some of the weird and usually arbitrary route mapping issues. I don't understand why every route must exist alongside or connected to a previously connected Primary Route. What is the gameplay mechanic that necessitates building routes alongside your already-existant rail routes? This is strange to me; it seems that if you want to invest in a new depot in a new city and build a new line to a new resource, you should just be able to.Apart from these issues, I still recommend the game if you're a sim/strategy/builder fan. For $10? Puh-leeze. You'll spend more on your next meal at Chipotle. Spend 20 hours or so enjoying this little gem. You won't play hundreds of hours, but you'll enjoy the time you do spend playing it.			"

												I have had this game for a while, and its quite fun, though there are a few tricks to it, and now and again the computer seems to loose the plot, be warned it cheats, if it sees that you are attempting to connect to a city, it will race you to it and force you to spend more to build a bridge over its line or a tunnel underneith, One thing i do like about it is that it can be run in a window, while you watch or listen to music or videos as you play, build carefully as you go, work out where you can produce steel or paper and ship it to a newspaper or car/bomb maker, it will make you serious coin, buy up your businesses as well, they pay off in the long run. buying up a competator can get you a second station in some cities, which is great if you have a lot of traffic, i will sometimes let the enemy expand for this reason before i buy them out, then rebuild their railroad. dont be afraid to restart if you get a crap map placement, sometimes you will have nothing near you to use and make money immediately, its a near impossible position to win from, so restart another map, throw the dice and see if you get good industries near by.

My only problems with this game are: while it has a great amount of classic trains from all over North America and northeastern Europe, the amount of modern trains is somewhat lacking, and the multiplayer servers have unfortunately shut down. Other than the aformentioned things, this game is terrific!			"

The gameplay is too repetitive and doesn't provide you with creative chalenges. I'm torn realy, it's a nice toy box, but as a game not so much, IMHO.P.S. Search the discussions for the crash-fix.

												Ugh.  I'm a big Sid Meier fan, and played a great deal of Railroad Tycoon 1 and 2, but this thing is a grave disappointment.  The gameplay is excessively easy; run some track and trains, money pours in, woop.  There's little need to fine-tune your trains or manifests, or even plan ahead.  The graphics are dated by modern standards of course but not bad, but cartoonish; all bright colors and everything lit as if by a spotlight.  Mountains are vastly exaggerated, making it hard to see routes.  Economics is limited; there seems to be no limit to how much of a good you can send to one city, so there's little need to search out new markets.  You can't issue stock, merge with other companies, or even take out a freakin' loan!  There's no march of technology: auto factories in the 1830s?!  The UI is OK, but a little click-happy; basic keyboard shortcuts like Esc to close a window aren't always implemented.Quibbling aside, there are two deal-breakers: first, the maps are small, a fraction of the size of RR1 or RR2.  They're also cramped, packed with towns and industries.  There's no lonely prairie where trains rumble on for miles between stops.  Games are short.  It really lacks any epic feel.  This is killer because there are only a handful of maps to play, and a handful of goals to achieve on each.  Having played four short games, I've seen about everything there is to see.Second, the tracks.  Laying single track is fine; the program automatically adds tunnels, bridges, and overpasses reasonably well.  HOWEVER, hit the double track button and you get your own personal demon from hell to torment you.  The simplest operations now require careful planning and possibly some build-it-and-delete-it cycles.  Trains will take the wrong track and fail to recognize tracks that exist.  Nothing's more maddening than carefully laying out track, buying a train, setting up the route... and seeing that the train won't return to the first station, because it thinks it can only go one way on a certain arbitrary segment of track... somewhere.  Except maybe having that happen over, and over, and over again.Oh, and it's already crashed.So what's good?  Station management is simpler; you no longer have to worry about exactly catching all of a city's industries, build a station and it just works.  Trains won't get stalled to 1 MPH on steep slopes.  For an RR1 or RR2 fan, it's all very familiar, the learning curve is tiny (don't bother with the tutorial, just start a game).  Some maps have custom industries, like wineries and fromageries in France, a cute touch.  The ""patents"" system is kinda cool - you bid against the other players in a brief open auction for a ten-year bonus of some sort.  When laying track in a city, the buildings will rearrange themselves to make room, at no cost, which is hugely refreshing compared to the massive PITA that could be in RRT2, where you sometimes had to demolish chunks of a city at great expense so your railroad could catch the city and cross the river.This thing was half-baked when it was released, and never brought up to speed.  I'm tempted to try RR3; as long as it's halfway stable, it's sure to be better than this.			"

												This game is a massive disappointment to me. So much so that when it crashed (1.5 hours later) it was a relief.The most frustrating thing is the brain dead train routing. My trains spent most of their time staring each other down, neither moving, even though there was a perfectly good piece of track right next to them and one of them was parked on the switch.In a related frustration, signals seem to pop up like weeds. Only really thorny and with deep roots, so you can't actually get them out. These signals allowed my idiot trains to blissfully drive past the switch, resulting in the starting contest previously mentioned.It is also impossible to make a station longer, meaning if a train sticks out it will still trigger the station's signal causing the whole track leading up to that to stop.The stock market mechanic is basic and fairly boring. My biggest complaint is that you have to wait ~3 seconds between every buy/sell attempt, meaning you can't just totally dump a company if their stock starts dropping and you can't pick up a bunch when it's cheap.The lack of ability to form a monopoly was also irritating. If I own an industry, I should be able to tell it to not ship goods to my competitors, and even to not buy their raw materials. Or at least pay them a rediculously low rate.My final complaint is the size of the map. I had assumed that something the size of New England would contain more than a few cities and be large enough that I wouldn't encounter my opponents for a long time. Instead, I was surprised to find myself covering a full quarter of the board after having connected only two cities and my opponents building heavily in my territory.			"

												I loved Railroad Tycoon 3 and Railroad Tycoon 2, and I'd read enough negative reviews of this game comparing it to the RTC series that I held off on purchasing this game.  Well, since it doesn't look like we're ever going to get a true Railroad Tycoon 4 and this game was on sale for $5.99 I decided, sure, it's not any more expensive than a Big Mac Value Meal, I'll give it a shot.  Well, I can say this game wasn't even worth the $5.99.I knew the economic simulation of the RTC series wouldn't be present in this game - no fluctuating prices, no inefficient ""Tycoonatrons"" moving materials and goods independent of railroad to simuate how the real world works, no independent industrial growth.  That was fine.  But there are only 6 or so types of raw materials, and demand never ceases so all you have to do is hook up more and more supply facilities to the cities.  Oh and there's very few cities either, and no growth caps - Los Angeles and Tehachapi will both grow into ""Metropolises"" once you give them their materials.  The maps are TINY and build out very fast.At first I was pleasantly surprised by some innovations Sid Meier has introduced to the track-building mechanics:  Tracks and stations can go anywhere in cities, no more tedious weaving around or knocking down buildings to get your station into a city, or having to locate in a certain spot to cover as much of a sprawling city as possible.  Just plop your track and station down and the buildings automatically move around to get out of your way!  Wonderful!  Unfortunately, the double track mechanic is awful and making parallel tracks connect to each other takes an act of God.  I found myself constantly having to build switches between the parallel tracks, and even high priority trains stop every time they encounter a switch.  Even worse, there is no undo button AND NO BULLDOZER BUTTON so once you build a track, you're stuck with it.  My tracks looked like disorganized monstrosities because of this, with trains constantly bogging down at a dozen unnecessary switch signals.  At least there aren't any sanding/water towers required here...but it really doesn't matter.Once you get into a position to buy out your competitors, make sure to liquidate their assets rather than absorb them, because absorbing a well-established competitor will instantly bring the game (and I don't run a cheap system) to its' knees with freezes and eventual crashes, and that's what brought me back to this screen, completely fed up.I don't know how this game got through the play-testing phase of development.  The simplistic economy is a disappointment after the fantastic Railroad Tycoon 3 but I can handle it.... but the track building snafus are just awful, and overall I find this game just wasn't enjoyable even when it does operate smoothly.  I hope we get a true successor to Railroad Tycoon 3 someday.			"

												This game really isn't worth buying.Bought it on steam sale for £1.50 so thought it was worth a punt, but it's hugely buggy (perhaps not surprising for a game that is now almost 10 years old) with regular crashing to desktop and autosave doesn't seem to work reliably, meaning you invariably lose what progress you had made.Worst though, is the routing of trains.  There seems no limit on the amount you can ""double-up"" track - except for in stations where four lines of rail seems to be the limit - but trains do not automatically opt for the deconflicted route, and there seems no way to manually achieve this (i.e waypoints or forcing to change station).  Trains just sit there at loggerheads until you scrap them!  Also, you have to tediously create cross-overs between lines, which would be OK if the trains used these cross-overs sensibly, but they don't.Rant over.  Having got ~2 hrs of frustration out of this game I think it's time to call it quits.			"

												I have read many reviews about this game not working on new machines or that it crashes, i bought this game about 2 years ago. i have installed this game on 4 differant computers, including my newest one that have a nvidia 1080  graphics card and they all have played fine. On the game crashing I have had it crash one or twice over the lifetime of my purchase but never on a regular basis. I you can look and see that I have put in the time 140 hrs and still playing. I think it is a good game not a great game, I wish they would make a Railroads 2 in the future. I do miss the part of not being able to play the christmas map on steam. but overall this is a good game. if someone has a problem with it crashing or not working because your machine is 2 new all you need to do is update your graphic options for this game and it will play on windows 10 with no problem.

												The game crashes every single time I play. Wont run for more than 90 minutes without crashing. I have played the game at least ten times and I have never once voluntarily exited - it's always closed via crashing. Average times between crashes is about 10 or 15 minutes. Nearly unplayable, but the game frequently autosaves, so you can resume without too much loss. However, recovering from the crashes takes some time and is frustrating. Game is too simplistic; Signals, routing, track layout, enigne choices, money management - everything is made too simplistic. Once you set up a train route the game more or less takes care of itself and money comes rolling in. It can be made more difficult by tweaking the difficulty settings but it remains a basic and simplistic game. The game can be mastered very quickly and is too easy. Game mechanics are limited which means that you can't lay out tracks the way you'd like.Railroad Tycoon, despite being older with much poorer graphics, is a much better game than this. If you liked Railroad Tycoon and are looking at this game to offer something new/different/better you will be disapointed. The maps are tiny and after very short amounts of play you feel like you've connected all of the towns and resources worth connecting. Game speed advances too quickly, going from the erly 1800's to the year 2020 in like, an hour and a half of gameplay. Games are fast, over too soon, and easy.Overall a shallow game that is only a little bit of fun for a very short while. Glad i got it for only a few dollars during the big sale thingy.			"

												This is actually a damned good game. A lot of people who see this probably think, ""Oh that's just another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ simulator/tycoon game that nobody cares about."" If you've ever even began to think something like that about this game, before you play this ♥♥♥♥ you better head down to your local church, because you just sinned in the eyes of the LORD. Upon this game Christ has laid his blessing. In fact, Sid Meier is literally the second coming of Jesus Christ, and he used his powers to make games. To prevent me from using more religious analogies, I'm going to stop describing the game like this, and instead give you a play-by-play of how this christened game works:Alright, so you start off not knowing what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on. I mean, you start building tracks, and then all of the sudden you're ♥♥♥♥ing bankrupt, so you sell the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed tracks. So, now you just have enough tracks to connect the little ♥♥♥♥ city you start in with the little ♥♥♥♥ town nearby. So now you need to place a train on the tracks, right? Common sense, you little ♥♥♥♥♥. So, now you do that. Go ahead, I'll wait. I would tell you how, BUT I DON'T ♥♥♥♥ING KNOW. I simply don't understand why placing tracks is the easiest thing on earth, whereas you have to ♥♥♥♥ing master quantum mechanics AND astrophysics to place that little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a train on the track. Anyway, once you successfully divide by zero and get a train on your tracks, that little thing starts chugging along, pumping out black smoke and successfully producing large quantities of carbon dioxide long before the invention of automobiles. 'MURICA! So, once your train is pulling its ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ along the track at the speed of a ♥♥♥♥ing snail, you can start picking ♥♥♥♥ up. Just drive on over to the little town, pick up a few ♥♥♥♥♥s and hoes, and then drive on back. Then, grab some peeps and ♥♥♥♥♥es from that town, and brong them back. You just created a passenger train system, congratu-♥♥♥♥ing-lations. What do you want, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? If so, the next step is sticking your ♥♥♥♥ on the train tracks when one is coming. If not, build more train tracks. Connect a ♥♥♥♥♥on of cities and farm and oil rigs and mines and ♥♥♥♥ing everything with train tracks. Eventually you'll have a disorganized mess of rail laying all over the p0lace. You won' be able to see the groud at all, it's just 100% rail, and the money is ♥♥♥♥ing rolling in. You are the wild-west equivilent (assuming you picked the southwest map; if not, go ♥♥♥♥ yourself and stop reading this review) of a modern-day billionaire. You have all of the traits: ability to kill the locals with carbon output just to save a few bucks; the mentality that you can put your tracks whereever and whenever, and if anyone had anthing to say about it, you'll shove a train in their ♥♥♥; and, most importantly, the balls to charge people more, when you know nobody can afford it. So, you are a ♥♥♥♥ing LEGEND at this point. You have stacks on stacks on MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING STACKS you dirty ♥♥♥♥. You have so many train tracks that nobody can go outside without being hit by a train. YOU ARE A KING. What shall we do next? Well, I can add this track he- wait... what's that? Why is the screen black? WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥? WHAT DO YOU MEAN RAILROADS! ISN'T RESPONDING? Fine, ♥♥♥♥ it, I ain't even mad, I'll just try again.Alright, after a couple of hours, I got as rich as before, and I even have a more organized track layout now.

												This is a gorgeous, personality-filled, light-load, fun packed game.I first played this title a decade or so ago, and I knew from the moment I first opened a map and started building my own little railway network that this would be a title typical of the Sid Meier games (Pirates!, etc) - a polished, balanced, aesthetically pleasing game which takes the concept of relaxing gameplay into active consideration.You take on the role of a railroad tycoon, unleashed into various theaters and tasked with fulfilling certain rail objectives. You start with one town and a single station from which to grow your empire. You connect to another nearby town and start shuffling wheat back and forth. Soon you spot a third town and head off to it, gambling on a long stretch of track that you have to borrow to afford... Connecting to the new location and the huge herds of beef cows it boasts, you realise with a jolt that you have nowhere to sell the cows. Frantically you search around the map for a town which buys them, realising that the nearest market lies three or four cities away. The size of your task has grown, the ambition of your railway firm has grown, the scope of the gameplay has grown, the payoff in economic fun has Doubled, Tripled, Fourbled and Fibled! You can't reach the far cattle buyers just yet, but you are able to shuttle passengers between your little network of towns, so you build a secondary line to your freight route and get shuttlin'. You spot marginal gains in the buyers and sellers of nearby hamlets and pounce, connecting them to your network, watching them grow and provide more returns! You upgrade trains - such speed! Such pulling power! - and soon hills are as easy to scale as descents, and suddenly you finally deliver those 12 cars of cattle to the distant metropolis that is dying for them and your bank balance goes ka-ching!Dem monies, tho.This game is just solid gold fun. An elaboration on typical economic management sims, the ability to custom build your own rail routes and work out new and efficient track layouts and schedules makes you really feel like the original Isambad Kingdom Brunel. The formula wears thin once you have conquored all you can, once you have maxed out every advance and the finite maps are chock full of railway lines, but the race to this endgame is just so fun that you keep on coming back again and again. Then restarting. The wide range of maps is also quite nice, since each map is of varied difficulty and houses a goodly chunk of play hours and replayability.It's dirty cheap so buy it, and enjoy it, I love it to bits.9/10.

												That's sad, as I'd have loved to play a trains tycoon game.In short:- It's a game from 2006, so on modern PC and OSes keeps crashing- The train routing IA is terrible, so many of your train will spend a lot of time waiting just because they chose the wrong possible rail to start from the station. And you have no control over it, so you can just look and despair. The only thing you can do, assign a priority to each train, has no effect whatsoever. "

												There are better train simulators out there. Railroads is a very basic, fast-paced, easy to learn game that unfortunately doesn't get very deep. Train routes play out basically the way they do in most railway simulators, but with a simplified commodity system. The rail-laying mechanic is finnicky and buggy, which is particulary annoying as it is the primary action of the game. While increasing difficulty does offer more of a challenge, the mechanics simply aren't deep enough to keep me interested for more than a few games (which only take an hour or so to complete, which isn't an issue, but I mention in case someone saw ""Sid Meier"" and thought games would be 7 hour long civ-like games).In the end, there are much better transportation simulation programs out there			"

												The game is broken without 3rd party patches. Bad sign to begin with.But this isn't Railroad Tycoon, or even a really compareable knock-off. It's not a grand strategy, or even much of a strategy. It's a rather simple game, with rather limited options that just make it kind of... Bland.Because, lets be blunt. If you're playing a railroad game, you're okay with getting in depth, and micromanaging. It's a VERY dry medium, even if it can be quite enjoyable. This game doesn't offer that. And, the ai is just unbearable. It's (sometimes) competent at managing finances and turning a profit, but not reliably, solely because it builds really frustratingly. A combination of ugly, inefficient and sprawling, to the point where it will unintentionally block you (or itself) from expanding. Typically the latter.I was surprised I'd heard nothing about this game until years after it's release. Turns out there was a reason for it.			"

												This game is GREAT!  But multiplayer is BROKEN!I cut my teeth on Railroad Tycoon 3 which is also a very good economic simulator.  But it's missing one important detail: in RT3 the trains can't collide with each other - they just go through each other and there's no need to set up real railroad systems.Sid Meier's Railroads takes care of that.  You can optionally turn on trains colliding with each other (set routes to ""hard"") and then they'll just wait until you build more track or figure out the right way to get them to cooperate.It's also a fun economic sim.But after reading other reviews and trying it myself, it LOOKS like multiplayer isn't working.Pros:+ Has a ""tabletop mode"" to play as sandbox with no competitors.+ Good railroad building logic required (or you can use easy routing)+ There's a frog in there somewhere in the audio+ Nice cartoony atmosphere with all the historic millionaires to learn about+ Fast pacedCons:- It crashes.  HOWEVER, crashing is fixed using the 3GBEnabler.  I haven't had any problems after running 3GBEnabler on the exe file.  To learn more, read this http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/platform/server/PAE/PAEmem.mspx - Trains get stuck more than they should (hard routing only).- When placing track the lights will be buggy, have to delete track and replace until the lights are correct.  Unless you've played the game for a long time this won't be clear or intuitive.  Cluster-frack.- A little (maybe a lot) too cartoony for my taste.  The buidlings and tracks are enormous compared to the landscape.  Especially if you've played Railroad Tycoon 3.  In RT3 The cities are miles and miles apart, while in Railroads! the cities are only a few trainlengths apart.  Go look at my screenshots for an example.- no such thing as ""X"" shaped crossovers (diamond or scissors crossover).- while hard routing is much better than RT3, it's still much lacking.  You cannot set up more than a 2 pronged fork.- It looks like multiplayer doesn't work.  WTF			"

												""It’s been a while since I’ve loaded this little baby up and I can’t believe I had almost forgotten how much fun it could be.  Released in late 2006, “Sid Meier’s Railroads” puts you in charge of your very own railway company.  I’m not going to bother reviewing it due to its age and time constraints, but I will say that it’s still worth playing today if you enjoy business sims.  It also helps if you’ve religiously watched “Thomas the Tank Engine” as a child.""

												Simply put, if you can run this game, you're too smart to enjoy the game.After the long hurdle of actually getting the game to launch, you'll inevitably realize that you barely feel challenged even at the hardest setting. Sure, it looks pretty but the map is so small and disaproportionate-looking that, the more you play, all the pretty toy trains and tracks will look overcrowded. Sadly, the only alternatives worthy of recommendation to this game are Railroad Tyoon 2 and 3. For those, you'll be challenged both intellectually and graphically.			"

												I would really like to like this game. I loved Railroad Tycoon 3 and this has a lot of those elements. Unfortunately, it seems to crash for me about once an hour or so, especially when trying to do long routes between cities. There are other places where the interface isn't ideal. For example, there's no way  (that I know of) to undo track laying if it doesn't do what you want. I'm disappointed in the quality of production as I think there's a good base there.			"

												Written from the perspective of someone who wanted an up-to-date version of the Railroad Tycoon series...This game was okay, I suppose. It missed a lot of the joy from the older, similar games. Track laying was both a positive and a negative; it was incredibly complex, which could be good or horribly frustrating.Overall, I guess it was alright, but if you, like me, were looking for a Railroad Tycoon replacement, this, sadly, isn't it.

												I do not recommend that you buy this game.  The simple reason is that it is flawed.  Steam should NOT be selling this. It does not work on 64 bit versions of Windows.  Don't waste your money.It is temperamental when laying track and trying to run trains on the track.  The first time you play it, it can crash 20-45 mins into the game for no reason.Then when you try and play it again, It crashes before it loads.  You try and load it again and it gives you a blue screen of death.STEAM ARE YOU LISTENING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - YOU NEED A BIG DISCLAIMER SAYING ""DOES NOT WORK ON 64 BIT VERSIONS OF WINDOWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""No - most probably not.

												This is an overly simplified poorly built table top train game. There is no complexity what so ever, reasources mean nothing industry is two dimensional at best the train models look nice but the pathing they follow is so poor that late game railroads will grind to a halt as 5 trains are stopped trying to use one rail line ignoring the 20 other clear paths they could take. The only way this game functions when its not randomly crashing to desktop is when you create separate lines for each train but even then they will screw it up because you will be forced to link lines together at stations which only allow for 4 connections at which point your train will attempt to use the most congested line possible and your railline will come to a halt.. then crash to desktop.

												Buy Railroad Tycoon 2 or 3 instead. Whilst they won't look as gorgeous as this game, the game play is vastly superior. Firstly, pathfinding is broken for trains - they will often just sit at signals (which you can no longer set yourself) for ages, before simply passing through trains anyway. Secondly, it's buggy - senarios can span a century, and the game can't handle the number of railways you will build in that time. Trying to build tracks late-game can be frustrating - most of the time you'll wait a minute while it catches up and the rest of the time it'll crash.Avoid and play the much better RT2 and RT3 (latter is more complex and in my opinion more rewarding, former is easier to play)			"

												THIS GAME ONLY WORKS AFTER DOWLOADING PATCH - Google for it.I have mixed impressions about this game.  It is interesting to build one's rail network, but the trains sometimes get stuck and do not understand their routes.  For example I had a game with a railline from the NW, NE, E, SE, S SW areas first.  Then, to make it easier for two gold trains I added a new line connecting the nodes NW and SW in the game.  Some of these trains would take the first route (NW, NE, E, SE, S SW) instead of just the second (NW and SW), and some of the other trains then made their own new routes using huge loops and then even a second huge loop.Watch out this game can get tiring fast.

												The game is fun and quite strategic, but I would love for Steam to stop allowing games that are not playable to be posted.  I keep encountering games like Sid Meier's Railroads that allow you to play for a time before crashing.  This game is not graphically or audio intensive, therefore I should not have any trouble playing it fully.  The timing of the crash is not pinpointable because it happens at random times. Sometimes it's 5 minutes into gameplay or 45 minutes into gameplay. If you have Windows 8.1, you are more than likely going to encounter crashes.  It's especially frustrating when you've built up a big network or railways and have not saved them only to have the game crash.  I know I could have saved often to avoid the loss, but the point is a game should not be allowed to be sold no matter the price if it's not able to be played due to it being an older game.  Re-release a fully playable version or do not release it at all.  I loved this game in the times I could play, but the constant crashing drove me to a hard pass.  I know you can get fixes online and if you can get them to work then more power to you.  You shouldn't have to do a process of 'fixes', but you will more than likely have to.			"

I haven't played it in over 4 years, and can't believe its still for sale on Steam.Pros:Graphics are pretty.Cons:Its so dumbed down from the legendary Railroad Tycoon series, you basically have no challenge.Apparently from other comments it crashes a lot. (I never had that problem, but its so boring to play, crashing would be entertainment).There's only 4 scenarios to play. That's it. No random map generator, no ability to add your own.Do yourself a favor and find Transport Tycoon or Railroad Tycoon. You'll be much happier. "

												I've played the Railroad Tycoon games before and you can't play them first and then play this one.  It just doesn't compare to them.  It is a simplified version that can be quite frustrating when laying track.  That being said I still wanted to play it but the game is crashing too much on Window 8.1.  Oh well, thankfully I got it when it was on sale.			"

												Surprisingly, the game is still inferior to Transport Tycoon Deluxe (over a decade old) in building options (no signals!, little control over rail positioning), graphics (no overview at all), scale (very little room to build). I was hoping for TTD with a better AI and improved graphics/controls but am completely disappointed.			"

												Written from the perspective of someone who wanted an up-to-date version of the Railroad Tycoon series...This game was okay, I suppose. It missed a lot of the joy from the older, similar games. Track laying was both a positive and a negative; it was incredibly complex, which could be good or horribly frustrating.Overall, I guess it was alright, but if you, like me, were looking for a Railroad Tycoon replacement, this, sadly, isn't it.

												Unfortunately this game is a utter crap compared to the RRT 2 (which was the best) and 3. The fact that you cant slow donw time and that maps are VERY small is just gamebreaking. Downloading RRT2 and 3 as we speak to get my ""train fix"". Those 10€'s here were a total waste tbh.			"

												THIS GAME ONLY WORKS AFTER DOWLOADING PATCH - Google for it.I have mixed impressions about this game.  It is interesting to build one's rail network, but the trains sometimes get stuck and do not understand their routes.  For example I had a game with a railline from the NW, NE, E, SE, S SW areas first.  Then, to make it easier for two gold trains I added a new line connecting the nodes NW and SW in the game.  Some of these trains would take the first route (NW, NE, E, SE, S SW) instead of just the second (NW and SW), and some of the other trains then made their own new routes using huge loops and then even a second huge loop.Watch out this game can get tiring fast.

												It's an okay game, really needs to get optimized for newer Operating Systems, it BSOD's on anything newer than windows 7 SP1.  There is no Multiplayer, and in fact if you choose to play multiplayer, the game crashes.. With no real map editor, Sandbox mode gets boring real quick.  I tried running this game on Windows 10, not a good idea, it's just not ready for it.. The campaigns are dull as everything else in this game... This is a Sid Meier game I regret buying.. I got it for $5 so not that big of a deal, but still, spend that money elsewhere.. Railroad Tycoon 2 runs better on W10 than this game.. and has a map editor..			"

												For someone who's played Railroad Tycoon 3, I would recommend RT3 over this game.I would say RT3 has a better interface, which wouldn't require you to go through a complete tutorial before you are able to properly play the game. This game requires you to play the tutorial first before you get the hang of it. I wouldn't say this is a con but I get to enjoy RT3 much more compared to this.However, I would say that this game's objectives are much more realistic, in the sense that the goals are attainable. RT3's conditions to achieve gold is kinda harsh, which can be quite irritating sometimes when you played that map for hours.Yeap, the game crashes quite often too.I can only recommend this game if I'm new to this genre, but I'm not.

												If you like the classics.... stick with the classics! At any rate, don't pay more than $5 for this one! It is so dumbed down, buggy, and just plain unloved by Firaxis, it may taint your memory of the whole franchise.I know what u're thinking: ""This game LOOKS awesome!"" And it does! I give the art team an A+ and couldn't ask for much more out of them!But the designers and programmers should all be fired. (Sid too!) Again, it's dumbed-down to make it more accessible. W/E. But if you are seeking the deep, complex economics etc. of old RT games, forget it. And if you're thinking ""I'll just turn up the skill."", that will probably only make it more frustrating.Not enough in the way of innovation and LOTs of needless regression. No longer supported by the devs in any meaningful way. (requires fan-patch to run properly on >2GiB RAM; still crashes plenty, but not as bad as pre-patch.)I've played every RT game and RT3 is IMO the highpoint of the series; & 2 is close!Demo exists.

												Nice, sweet and simple gameplay. The game is held easy, I guess mostly to motivate younger players. Nevertheless adults can as well have fun with it. Its one of the games you can relax at because you don't need to think as much as you have to do in other games.The problem is: the game crashes every time you try to build rails just a little more complicated than one rail from one town to another. When the game didn't crash when you placed the rails it will surely crash when you place the trainstation. Really, Sid Meier? How could you give your name for such a technical piece of s**t? The games is unplayable! Unless you don't have a problem with restarting it every 5 minutes. When you google the problem you will realize, that you're not the only one with the problem, which means it's simply bad programming.			"

												Kind of have a love/hate relationship with this game.  For myself, it is an addicting little title.  It is fun to play for a few hours and come back to a few days later.  The game doesn't have much depth, however, and mastering it takes very little time.  It is a fun little Stratedgy/Sim but has a ton of flaws as well.  Being an older game, some of those can be forgiven.So, the Pro's.As mentioned, I find this title to be a bit addictive.  The map randomization allows for a different game each time you play.  The graphics aren't bad, considering this came out in 2006, and it's one of the newest Train management games out there.    The game runs very smoothly and is fun to watch.  You're always looking for new resources and at your existing track, looking for the best routes and tie-in's.Now, the Con's.Crashes on Windows 7 unless you get the Patched .exe from the forums.  Online multiplayer service is no longer supported.  Cheaty and annoying AI, which isn't very smart and tends to build track which would normally be impossible for you to do so yourself.  Very limited city management.  Games run on a timeline which makes everything feel very linear.  No real Sandbox mode.  Winner is usually determined by who starts out in the ""sweet spot"" with best resources near them.  Map edges are not very well utilized and you tend to have everyone too close when starting.Sometimes, the AI in the game becomes really annoying.  They'll neglect resources which they could use and instead lay track to a city you are already running a line to, hindering both you and themselves.  Also, like most AI, they do as they please and it makes me wonder if they actually have the $$$ to do what they did.In the end, it's a very simple game mainly about train management, routing, and gaining $$$ the fastest in order to win.  It would be nice if it had much more management, maybe maintenance costs or random events on your tracks.  Once you route to many of the resources in your area, the game can play on auto-pilot, somewhat.Is it worth $10 which Steam has it listed for??  If you like trains, like to play new Sim/Stradegy games, then probably.  However, it is an older game and a simple game, which can grow old fast.			"

												A good Railroad simulator.It is extremely user friendly compared to Railroad Tycoon 1 and 2, but it feels smaller (maps) and the rules are much more visible here. You connect towns, deliver goods based on suppy and demand. Towns can level up over time when you do so, which allows you building additional manufacture plant (up to 3). Game tells you which town supplies goods and how many, so it is really a simple task, compared to RRT 1 and 2, where you had to know which building needs what and had to check what ammounts are available.You can buy and sell stock to take over enemies if you play vs AI or multiplayer.Patents and new locomotives are unlocked over time. You can colour the trains, build tracks by drgging them.Overall I liked the game but SOMEHOW this feels more like a toy compared to old RRT games.7/10 for me. Still recommended, not many simulation games like this gets made and it was a decent job.			"

												Okay game, worth no more than 3$.Far from the real deal though. Railroad Tycoon 1-3 from PopTop still remains king of the genre. This is like a RRT for kids, it is very light and has just a feel of the first railroad tycoon. It is millions of lights years away from the real deal.It is playable, but you get tired of the game very quickly unlike the Railroad Tycoon series from PopTop. I think the designers should call the PopTop guys and have them make a RRT4 with the current technology, that would be so much better than this semi-failed attempt at making a train tycoon.On top of that, it is very buggy, crashes to desktop frequently.Buy only if you see it at 3$ or less, not worth more than that.

												I remember this game from when I was younger. It was my first real game on the PC besides solitare and pinball. I always remember building huge railroad networks and crushing my competition. Such a fun game. They should remake it and add more trains and even more areas to build networks at. Cool game.			"

												A good Railroad simulator.It is extremely user friendly compared to Railroad Tycoon 1 and 2, but it feels smaller (maps) and the rules are much more visible here. You connect towns, deliver goods based on suppy and demand. Towns can level up over time when you do so, which allows you building additional manufacture plant (up to 3). Game tells you which town supplies goods and how many, so it is really a simple task, compared to RRT 1 and 2, where you had to know which building needs what and had to check what ammounts are available.You can buy and sell stock to take over enemies if you play vs AI or multiplayer.Patents and new locomotives are unlocked over time. You can colour the trains, build tracks by drgging them.Overall I liked the game but SOMEHOW this feels more like a toy compared to old RRT games.7/10 for me. Still recommended, not many simulation games like this gets made and it was a decent job.			"

												This is without any doubt, the best train sim game ever made. I really wished more content dlc would have been published. This is my most played game ever (counted in hours). The graphics are really impressive, it is fun every time again, because there are many difficulty settings to choose from. People saying it crashes, yes can be, for me no, because you need enough ram and 64bit game. search google for SidMeiersRailroads3GBEnabler, this enables more than 3GB of ram. Now it crashed maybe ones per 24 hours, you can live with that. If you like sim games and like to build with all freedom and all kind of varieties within the train theme setting I promise you will like it. You can ride and zoom in the trains, the sound and music are great and not so easy as you may think when building real train track from simple one sided tracks to multi tracks, the possibilities are endless.

												The game is a definitve setback from the older Railroad Tycoons.* The routing of trains is awful. One basically has to build an own track per train or they will lock up (or one has to play with easy routing)* The 3D interface makes it very difficult to lay track as one likes it. And more often than one would expect switches will not work. I managed to had a whole track in a station unuseable for mysterious reasons. Routing wouldn't use it, Trains could not be set in there.* The 3D look is also more like a model railway than a real one. Especially the way height is overscaled looks ludicrious (the Western US seemingly mainly consists of peaks and valeys). Also one can only zoom out very slightly, giving no good overview of the landscape.* The economy model is quite simpel. Lots of X delivered somewhere => Price of X decrease slightly everywhere (if the fluctuations were even caused by delivery action). You can overdeliver a good to an industry (exhausting its storage capacity so it is thrown away) and still get full pay.* The differences between the engines are quite simple. One isn't even told their climbing abilities.* And finally if one wins a scenario (at least if one does it an age earlier than expected) the game crashes to desktop.The older Tycoons were better. A more realistic, albeit more abstract model of railway management is e.g. ""Rails across America"".			"

												What's happened is this: They took a previously very successful game (Railroad Tycoon) and brought it into the modern age. At the same time, to make it more accessible, many complex features were removed and replaced with very basic ones, if any. Pathing is awful, hence the addition of a ""pass through"" feature, where a train blocked by another can slowly phase through it. Even on the more difficult levels, you can't really go wrong. A lot of the industry feels pointless, the maps are too small, and the AI is awful.			"

												Circa 1991, I received the game Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon as a gift.  I was a big Sid Meier fan.  I started with Pirates, then came Railroad Tycoon, and his masterpiece fo Civilization.  Each game sort of built on the last which was nice and there were clearly graphical similarities.  I played the original Railroad Tycoon for countless hours in my youth.  It was a great game in spite of it's problems (""rate wars"" where the loser had to tear up his track and leave town never struck me as historically accurate).  Fifteen years later, Sid Meier's Railroads hit the scene.  Yeah, his remake of Pirates was kind of crap.  And yeah, all of the Civilization games beyond Civilization 2 are not so good (Civilization 3 is entirely unplayable).  But this is Railroads.  It's going to be awesome.No, it's ♥♥♥♥ too.  Somewhere along the line, Sid Meier lost his magic.Pwninator score: 3/10			"

For me it's a game I keep coming back to, the newer games have lost the simple functionality that made this game great.A little buggy on Win7+. May start crashing if you play a very long game. Also AI is too easy, if you can get into the best stuff (wine/cars/arms) early in the game it's all a win, if you don't then you probably be bought out half way through.			"

												Sid Meier's Railroads! is a great game for those who like simulation/tycoon games.   Now it is a simplified version of Railroad Tycoon 3, but it makes for a very quick to pick up game.  The game does crash occasionally, even with the community made patch, but the game autosaves every minute by default, and it shouldn't take too long to reload.I would highly recommend going to some of the community websites and downloading some of the fan made maps.

The cities and farms and mines and everything are very close. There's no effort in doing anything, just build the rails, create the lines, and well...go. RT3 at least had some structure and it took time to build everything and income wasn't as huge as it is in this game. I can't really recommend or not recommend this to anyone.			"

												With everyone being so negative about this game, I think i should voice my opinion of it. THIS GAME HARDLY CRASHES IF your computer is decent. Mine is halfway decent and I only had two crashes both because I ALT + Tab'd out which is a breaking point for any old game.Understand: This game is really fun!Pros:-AI's are smart. Very smart. I would go as far as saying they are ""Turnt af"". Yes, I did just use that in a sentence. -Making Railroads is very intuitive and once you learn the key-bindings, becomes second nature.- Finding the best ""Get rich quick"" scheme is a task and usually different with every play through. Example: one play it was gold that ♥♥♥♥ed the economy raw and another time it was food that did the trick.- ♥♥♥♥IN TRAINS! new trains, old trains, red trains, blue trains (Yes, train customization)Cons:- sometimes the tracks get all messed up and are hard to click on without selecting something else- Tunnels are very difficult to manage almost to the point where you would save more by just going around- AI's are smart as ♥♥♥♥. Like assrape you sideways smart.TL:DRGet this if its on sale cause you will spend lots of hours staring at trains trying to get the most cash and doing missions out the ♥♥♥. Its fun.			"

												Fabulous, once you get the hang of it.  Lots of different scenarios and variations, so you won't get tired of it.  Fortunately, the game has a built-in time limit, otherwise one might easily play for hours on end, forgetting the outside world.  The game involves connecting natural resources to the industries that need them, and transporting them efficiently.  You also will want to connect cities to profit from passenger travel.  If you can't get online players to compete with, the game comes with up to 3 built-in opponents with sophisticated A.I. (artificial intelligence).  The graphics and sound effects are really charming (and if you zoom in, you may see some people walking around).  I recommend this game and I definitely plan to check out some other Sid Meier games.			"

												I really enjoy this game - I'm especially a fan of the multiplayer. My family loves to play Ticket to Ride (boardgame), but my brother and I live on opposite sides of the country; we're able to connect playing Railroads.The single player campaign, if you can call it that, lacks depth. I found it was generally very easy to beat the computer, even at high difficulty, and there isn't much variation to the gameplay. I also found the maps to be, generally, far too small - there are no opportunities for long stretches of track. There is also no economic simulation like one would find in the older Railroad Tycoon series - here you simply pick up cargo where it's produced and hual it to where it's consumed and get paid.All of the above being said, I still come back and install the game every couple of months just to scratch that itch (or spin up a multiplayer round with my bro). For the price difference, pick up the Railroad Tycoon collection.			"

												This game is a cross between Cid Meier's Civ 5 and Roller Coaster Tycoon. I will admit, i'm not that big into trains, but this game is really fun. There are several senario missions to play or you could simply aim to be the last railroad company standing. Multiplayer is great and suprizingly, pretty busy. You beat others buy buying out stocks of their company untill you own 100% of all their stock. Each city has demands and supplies so you have to set up your rail roads acordingly. There are tons of different resources, and even more types of trains. Overall, a fun, casual game, that keeps you occupied for hours. As in any civ game, ""Just...one more train...""			"

												A highly charming yet simplistic strategy game about moving goods and people with trains. It lacks any of the complexity of transport tycoon, but has a great deal of charm and clever mechanics. Buildings and scenery will move out of your way automatically when laying down tracks and assigning routes it easy.  The scenarios and multiplayer maps are well designed, but it doesn't feel like there are as many as there should be. Graphics are slightly dated but is still very visually appealing.Many people disliked from issues with crashing, but the amount the game crashes for each person seems to vary greatly. For me it has crashed rarely so I can still say positive things. Overall lots of fun, but it could really use a patch and a map editor that it will sadly never get.			"

												Great classic. Tons of memories and I have had a blast playing it again.The Good: I mean, obviously, you aren't probably going to get this unless you played it back in the day (I remember being worried if my Pentium III was up to the task and it was). If you haven't played it though, definitely pick this up when it's on sale at the very least. If you get 3 or 4 hours out of it, you definitely got your money's worth. Its fun, its fairly easy to pick up and best of all, you learn quite a bit in the process.The bad: I know, I just told you to get the game, so why am I not recommending it? I've played 2 matches now and about half way through the game crashes. Its really annoying to play for 30 minutes and then lose the progress. I understand that patching isn't always the easiest, but if I were to wager a guess I'd say it seems they didn't do anything to get this working. The verdict:If you are a fan, you should get it. If you aren't, you should wait till it's on sale. Its still fun, just make sure you save early and often. I bet that running it inside a Windows XP virtual machine would help with stability, but I don't suspect many people are up for doing that.If the game gets patched, I'll change my review, for now. Sorry guys.[UPDATE 1]I've played a little over 2 hours now. I've actually lost track how many times this game has crashed on me. Probably around a dozen.			"

												Standard pick up and delivery train game, with Sid Meier flare. Nothing amazing but a relatively relaxing sort of game. If there is a negative I have to say the lack of a map regenerate option at the beginning of the game similar to what Civ 4 etc have. Sometimes the resources and town production are totally out of whack when doing random generation. Would be nice not to need to go all the way back to the main menu and start over.			"

												As far as I know, there are three Sid Meier railroad games out there.  I like each one, but this first one -- simply entitled ""Railroads"" -- is my favorite.  I guess when it comes down to it, it's the simplicity I like; #2 & #3 are definitely more complex and are really geared for people who like to mess with numbers and markets and such.  To me, #1 here is more about the building of railroads, which is really the point, right?  There is a market system, yes, but it's clearer and more manageable than the two successors' are.  And I have to say the actual building of a rail system is a lot easier and clearer as well.  Building a railroad in #2, for example, seems to be taking a step back in terms of graphics and ease of controls.The one (MAJOR) downside of this first game is that it seems to crash quite often.  I've tried it on three computers, each one noticably different than the others, and the game just crashes at seemingly random points on all computers.  If it weren't for that, this easily would be one of my favorite games.			"

												Never played this before until now. Works on Windows 7 64-bit right off the bat but the game crashes after only a few minutes of playing the tutorial. Using AMD Radeon HD 6770m.There's a fix for the frequent crashes in Steam forum. Looks like the fix is absolutely necessary. Tried different compatibilty settings but the crashes persisted. Didn't try older GPU drivers though.Anyway, so far so good. The tutorial can be completed without a crash but the tutorial is a little buggy. Instructions aren't completely right or timed properly. You can get stuck at the tutorial because of a mistake in laying out the track. Unfortunatetly there is no way to undo or delete the track section so your only recourse is to destroy your train or restart the tutorial.Graphics, sound effects and music are pretty slick. Initially i was reluctant to buy this game because the screenshots look funny; trains are oversized while towns look undersized but in actual gameplay, they look alright.Correction Update: Trains still look slightly bigger than buildings but i guess it's alright since the focus is on the details and authenticity of trains. ...End of UpdateNo idea if the fix would allow all the scenarios to be completed or if there will be more bugs as the game progresses. Pros: Support for 16:9 aspect ratio Fully 3D enabled; zoomable and rotatable maps  Smooth curves in track layout Simplified track construction: no need to demolish buildings first to make space Adequate detail in signalling at junctions In-depth gameplay;  option to buy existing industries or create new ones option to buy your own stocks or rivals' option to buy time-limited exclusive access to patented technology Three game speeds; normal, double and half speed Adequate graphics and sound options Remappable key bindings.Cons: Buggy or rigid tutorial May still have crashes in late game Game can't seem to remember AA and shadow options on next restart Starts to lag as your railway network grows While corners and inclines are smooth, occasionally tracks appear non-paralell or squeezed into the junction.Score 6.5/10 for nowHere is the start-up, intro and options screens:

As you can see, there is no way to delete the tracks but i think this peculiar behaviour is due to it being a Tutorial rather than the full-game. This leads me to think it's bugged; it's actually a railroading behaviour. Update Mar 23, 2017I figured out that the reason tracks cannot be deleted is either because a train using it or on its way to its next destination. Unlike Transport Tycoon where tracks can be deleted at any time and trains simply stop and wait until a new connection is made.End Of Updade I had a lot of trouble proceeding after laying out the 2nd double track because of the exacting placement needed for the start and end points. And if you don't follow it closely it will seem bugged or glitched. For example the timing and position of the 2 trains facing each other isn't always where the Tutorial expects it to be. Another glitch is if you go into the train selection screen and come out. The Tutorial instructions stay inside and don't follow you out until you click the OK button which leads me to think the Tutorial is broken somehow and cannot be completed.			"

 TL;DR    this is a very fun although initially buggy game that I believe is for sure worth it----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Actual Review  This is a surprisingly addictive game in which you set up railroad tracks from city to city while also connecting them to different types of resources such as sheep, coal and oil to name a few. Your main goal is to transport goods from point A to point B while making a profit, completing some challenges, and beating your rivals. I'll start off with the negative aspects of this game which are: the game will crash on you about every 2 hours which is very annoying but there is a patch you can get online to fix that so make sure you get that or this game will be broken, the game can be buggy at times although rarely game breaking it can get annoying and games do start to feel a little repetative. The games in general don't take overly long to play there's a niceAlthough once you get some third party help to fix the random crashing the game becomes very enjoable even if the games can be a little short. Some positive aspects of this game would be: the graphics do look pretty nice, it's fun planning out where to place your rail roads to maximise on efficiency, slowly buying out your rivals, bidding against your rivals for perks that will aid you, getting new trains and planning the route you want your train to take. These are just a few examples of what make is this game fun to me.Although initially buggy and crashy at first once a third party patch is added it makes for a very fun game that you can sit down and play a nica simple game for short periods of time. This game may not be for everyone just because of how simple the game can be comparred to other simialar games.			"

												This game is a cross between Cid Meier's Civ 5 and Roller Coaster Tycoon. I will admit, i'm not that big into trains, but this game is really fun. There are several senario missions to play or you could simply aim to be the last railroad company standing. Multiplayer is great and suprizingly, pretty busy. You beat others buy buying out stocks of their company untill you own 100% of all their stock. Each city has demands and supplies so you have to set up your rail roads acordingly. There are tons of different resources, and even more types of trains. Overall, a fun, casual game, that keeps you occupied for hours. As in any civ game, ""Just...one more train...""			"

												With everyone being so negative about this game, I think i should voice my opinion of it. THIS GAME HARDLY CRASHES IF your computer is decent. Mine is halfway decent and I only had two crashes both because I ALT + Tab'd out which is a breaking point for any old game.Understand: This game is really fun!Pros:-AI's are smart. Very smart. I would go as far as saying they are ""Turnt af"". Yes, I did just use that in a sentence. -Making Railroads is very intuitive and once you learn the key-bindings, becomes second nature.- Finding the best ""Get rich quick"" scheme is a task and usually different with every play through. Example: one play it was gold that ♥♥♥♥ed the economy raw and another time it was food that did the trick.- ♥♥♥♥IN TRAINS! new trains, old trains, red trains, blue trains (Yes, train customization)Cons:- sometimes the tracks get all messed up and are hard to click on without selecting something else- Tunnels are very difficult to manage almost to the point where you would save more by just going around- AI's are smart as ♥♥♥♥. Like assrape you sideways smart.TL:DRGet this if its on sale cause you will spend lots of hours staring at trains trying to get the most cash and doing missions out the ♥♥♥. Its fun.			"

Crashes aside, I've played every imaginable train game and none comes close to this for fun, competition vs AI, generally easy to learn but with many variations and ways to win (coal-steel-cars, cows-stockyards-food, ore-gold, grapes-wine).  Buy as part of the $9 bundle.  Forgive the crashes, and have fun.  I just installed on my new Skylake based Windows 10 system and it works as well or better than it ever has. 10/10 for fun. 6/10 for recoverable crashing.			"

												I enjoy playing this game online with my friends (using a CD install, the 1.1 patch, the RailRoads.exe fix & GameRanger)  but its not my favourite game for making railway networks: Open TTD is (with its 32 bit graphics texture pack & the ""Pineapple"" trains texture pack enabled) because like in TTD, players can place signals for their trains to follow.Things I like about SMR:* Its 3D graphics and presentation.* Its train engine selection screen.* Its selection of trains engines with a different set of engines for different countries.* Its sound effects & music.* Its intuitive interface.* Its economy and share trading gameplay mechanics.* Its patent and town industry auction auctions.* Multiplayer games can be saved (like in Open TTD)Things I don't like:* The Steam and disk releases aren't patched to allow it to use more than 2GB of RAM: so players who have a computer with more than 2GB of RAM must download a fan provided .exe patch to prevent their game from frequently crashing.* A problem all the Railroad Tycoon series games have (except maybe RRT 1): Players can't make proper railway networks because they can't manually place signals for their trains to follow preventing them from making single direction railway lines and double line loops. Instead a train will always take the shortest route to its next station. So players must either make trains share bidirectional rail lines, stopping in passing places to pass each other (or driving through each other if easy/medium difficulty routing is enabled) or they can opt for the efficient, cost effective, unrealistic option of having one train per bidirectional rail line.Internet gaming requires the use of free third party software like GameRanger or VPN software like Tunngle: this game's developers could have given its players a ""direct IP connection"" option. I've not been able to make my Steam copy work with GameRanger but my CD copy does.The RAM fix:http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1090651 "

												Sid Meier's Railroads is a great game, it is just so fun to watch your little railroad company grow to a huge empire with giant cities, fast trains and everything getting really busy.It is easy to just pick up and play, the rules are simple and there is not much variety, this is both the games greatest strength and biggest weakness. It is really easy to learn but you get quite bored of it after a while, it is only fun to play for about two hours a day. But it is fortunately not possible to play this game for a long time because it crashes, a lot. It gets really annoying:-Remove wrong part of the tracks that doesn't exist anymore but still shows up : Crash-Accidentaly build overlapping tracks : Crash-Taking a ♥♥♥♥ in rl and then coming back : CrashSo you really need to save a lot, but it not only crashes, it has quite some bugs too:-Often the double railways don't really detect the stations so that no ""dropoff zone"" is being created-Trains clipping through each other-Trains taking unnecessarily long ways to the dropoff stationBut, do I still recommend it?Definitely!If you can get it for a really low price you will have quite some fun for a few hours, but important:SAVE!Or you will get really angry at the game.It is just really fun to watch everything evolve and something for a nice sunday afternoon with not much action and a really low difficulty.

												This game is fantastic in a lot of ways. The game brings me back to my 'Railroad Tycoon' games and is wonderfully fun with competitive stockmarket sharing and everything! The game incorporates several different maps, resources and resource types across maps. Releases new technology as time goes on -- the game is exciting and a lot of fun....BUT. I do not recommend this game unless you wish to sit there and have consistent disappointment for one reason. The game looks like it would be fantastic in multiplayer but I dare not even try it because EVERY THREE MINUTES -- the game just crashes. It seems to be a consistent problem across many of Sid Meier's games too. Fix this problem! The game would be recommended with the best rating I could give it if it was not for this REALLY annoying factor. Also, to add to frustration - the game claims it saves every so often. Where? I cannot find any mention of any save file. I could just save it myself but unless you wish to save every 15 seconds -- and I mean, literally -- then you will continually keep losing data again and again with this game. It's just not worth the time.[EDIT: If you download a patch that can be found online, and use it to override your copy of this game - it works perfectly. Like a charm. No more crashes and the game becomes awesome again. I'll change my rating to a thumbs up but BE WARNED all - you will need this downloaded patch to play the game, after you get it - it becomes awesome again].			"

												I really enjoy this game - I'm especially a fan of the multiplayer. My family loves to play Ticket to Ride (boardgame), but my brother and I live on opposite sides of the country; we're able to connect playing Railroads.The single player campaign, if you can call it that, lacks depth. I found it was generally very easy to beat the computer, even at high difficulty, and there isn't much variation to the gameplay. I also found the maps to be, generally, far too small - there are no opportunities for long stretches of track. There is also no economic simulation like one would find in the older Railroad Tycoon series - here you simply pick up cargo where it's produced and hual it to where it's consumed and get paid.All of the above being said, I still come back and install the game every couple of months just to scratch that itch (or spin up a multiplayer round with my bro). For the price difference, pick up the Railroad Tycoon collection.			"

 TL;DR    this is a very fun although initially buggy game that I believe is for sure worth it----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Actual Review  This is a surprisingly addictive game in which you set up railroad tracks from city to city while also connecting them to different types of resources such as sheep, coal and oil to name a few. Your main goal is to transport goods from point A to point B while making a profit, completing some challenges, and beating your rivals. I'll start off with the negative aspects of this game which are: the game will crash on you about every 2 hours which is very annoying but there is a patch you can get online to fix that so make sure you get that or this game will be broken, the game can be buggy at times although rarely game breaking it can get annoying and games do start to feel a little repetative. The games in general don't take overly long to play there's a niceAlthough once you get some third party help to fix the random crashing the game becomes very enjoable even if the games can be a little short. Some positive aspects of this game would be: the graphics do look pretty nice, it's fun planning out where to place your rail roads to maximise on efficiency, slowly buying out your rivals, bidding against your rivals for perks that will aid you, getting new trains and planning the route you want your train to take. These are just a few examples of what make is this game fun to me.Although initially buggy and crashy at first once a third party patch is added it makes for a very fun game that you can sit down and play a nica simple game for short periods of time. This game may not be for everyone just because of how simple the game can be comparred to other simialar games.			"

												Railroads could be a great game. The mechanics are great, the multiplayer is fun, and the overall experience is very well thought out. HOWEVER, and this is a huge however, the game was released in an extremely buggy state and has not been fixed.  The likelihood of it getting fixed is very low.  This effectively makes the game very difficult to finish playthrough in, and impossible to play multiplayer. Too bad, this could have been a wonderfull classic if it only worked.			"

												Great game. I recommend playing each level without AI competetors in order to get a handle on the economics, set up, and general game play of the game. Once you do that its pretty smooth sailing to win the other levels of the game (with or without AI). The game is GREAT fun, an easy simulator/tycoon game with less micro management than rollercoaster tycoon, but more than a simple simulation game. I recommend if you are looking for a fun railroad game, an easy going game, or a fun tycoon game! Also buy the tycoon collection to get all 3 railroad games. Its cheaper and the other games are worth it!			"

												Sid Meier's Railroads is one of the most interesting strategy building games involved trains, that exists out there. In no sence is it accurate to the real world in terms of year and geography is sometimes questionable. In general, its a entertaining experinece playing the game, as you will always attempt to beat your AI competitors. After playing for an hour or two, that when you realizr, you own all the railorads or nothing if you lost, and your ready to quit the game and play a month later. Its a nice leasure game, though through, for the most part, and worth having on a boring weekend to kill some time.			"

												This has got to be my all time favorite game. Its relaxing, its challenging and it has trains! Plus to me the interface is just a joy to use unlike a lot of similar games. The actual game consists of moving goods from one city to another via trains. You need to balance price of the train with potential income form the root. It a little dated and lacks maps (although looking at the amount of time Iv put into this game, no amount of maps would have been enough), it does run a little strange on windows 8, I get some clipping, slow down and a few crashes. But this does not distract to much from gameplay (if at all).  There are user created mods/ extra maps that you can download, little bit of a pain to install, but well worth it. All in all the is probably the best game ever made! I actually think the steam estimation of time is about 1/9 of the actual time! "

												Another excellent Sid Meier's title and good from a historical perspective. Although not as deep as the older titles in this series, I find the focus change to be more like a RTS refreshing. It keeps the games shorter. On easy, one can defeat the AI within an hour or so. On harder levels it is a bit more difficult. The game has great replayability and I am happy to have found it again on Steam.The game itself is aging and it would be nice to see something similar on a modern game engine. Most of the train games made now are more into the simulation of running a train and not the overall business from a historical perspective.			"

												Just a heads up, you will have to fix the crashing issue by adjusting the size of the .exe header. If you are not comfortable with troubleshooting crash problems, I actually wouldn't recommend this game. If I find the file to adjust the size and the instructions again, I will post it. Now for the second problem to get out of the way: the game automatically places trains on your tracks. Very often you will have open track for a train to use, and the game will unfortunately use track that already has a train on it, causing both trains to be stuck if set on the highest routing difficulty. There are also a number of smaller things to keep an eye on where a small slip might be confusing for a while at first. Sometimes you forget to put a depot somewhere at all, sometimes your track doesn't reach the depot, things like that. It will generally be frustrating at first. Finally, multiplayer is based on Gamespy, and thus doesn't work. However, once the crashing is fixed, and once you learn how to make up for the routing problems (which you shouldn't have to), it really is a fun game. At first I thought it was going to be too easy, as I quickly moved up the difficulty ranks until I was at all but the highest difficulty level. Then for whatever reason I started doing worse, so now I play on medium difficult (mogul). There is a fast forward option for the late game phase when you are often just saving up enough money to buy out another rr. You can also pause it, and do stuff while it is paused. It is generally very laid back, but not too easy. Somehow I want to compare it to a more skill-based version of monopoly, I suppose because you are trying to buy out your opposition. Unlike Monopoly, it is nice to have a certain amount of cash available instead of buying up everything right away, since other characters can start auctions at any time. The fact that you can keep an eye on your opponent's current cash can give you very helpful insight into their intentions, though. In short, this game is not recommended for those who are easily frustrated. With a little work, both in getting it to work at all and learning the unfairly bad train placement, this game works fine and is pretty laid back without being too easy.			"

												Sid Meier's Railroads! is a very fun simulation/strategy game that reminds of the Railroad Tycoon series. I have to say that the gameplay and graphics are cleaner and friendlier than RT2 and RT3. You deliver goods from production points on the map to/from cities and between one another. The scenarios take place across the US and Europe with a series of objectives to complete during each time period. I really enjoy playing against the computer players while trying to buy out their railroad as I conquer the map. Ultimately, this is an engaging title that will make you wonder where the hours went- just like many other Sid Meier's games.			"

												Not quite as good as Railroad Tycoon 3 - a bit over simplified when it comes to purchasing industries / share system etc... When playing on Hard (so that trains cannot occupy the same track) you tend to run 3-4 tracks per town, which soon gets crowded, and trains get stuck as the AI isn't intelligent enough to move the trains between the enterances/exits in each town.Still - worth a go, got the whole railroad tycoon set, with this, in a bundle.

I think this game is good for anyone interested in trains and the history behind it (young and old).Be aware to save your progress before attempting building complex tracks, it might crash the game.Building the tracks is really easy and you can play a level as long as you want and enjoy the sounds and movements of the trains.The scale of the levels are rather small and the trains might become lost when the rail network is complex.

												This is one of the best train games I have seen.The track building is easy, with simple train conducting and making.Although the scenarios of railroads are near impossible (as i have found with most train games), the sandbox is extremely good, and also gives you a sense of achievement, as you still need to upgrade cities and supply areas.Suggestions for the sandbox: Build lots of track and connect all cities before making trains; consider what I do, and set up districts of the map and connect them all with 2-4 fast-lane tracks; set the configurations to hard - though it's annoying when you have 5 trains fighting over 1 track and nowhere to build more, it's the most realistic and doesn't seem right when they all suddenly travel through each other.Probably the biggest downsides are the lag when you build more tracks if you have a lot of tracksand the glitch which lands trains into an endless loop. At this point, delete it and remake the train...it won't fix itself.Great game. =D			"

												Really fun game if you are into managment games. Planning routes to optimize production and efficient pathing is challenging, but the sound of the cash rolling in is very rewarding. I am giving this game a thumbs up because I can see that the game itself is terrific. HOWEVER This game crashes very frequently for little to no reason. I would tell you to save frequently except that even When I have game files have gone missing. Purchase with caution.			"

												Sid Meier's Railroads! is a very fun simulation/strategy game that reminds of the Railroad Tycoon series. I have to say that the gameplay and graphics are cleaner and friendlier than RT2 and RT3. You deliver goods from production points on the map to/from cities and between one another. The scenarios take place across the US and Europe with a series of objectives to complete during each time period. I really enjoy playing against the computer players while trying to buy out their railroad as I conquer the map. Ultimately, this is an engaging title that will make you wonder where the hours went- just like many other Sid Meier's games.			"

												Not quite as good as Railroad Tycoon 3 - a bit over simplified when it comes to purchasing industries / share system etc... When playing on Hard (so that trains cannot occupy the same track) you tend to run 3-4 tracks per town, which soon gets crowded, and trains get stuck as the AI isn't intelligent enough to move the trains between the enterances/exits in each town.Still - worth a go, got the whole railroad tycoon set, with this, in a bundle.

												Anyone who loves railroad games should love Sid Meier's Railroads.Now there are two negatives with this fun game;1) It was made for 32bit Windows so those on 64bit may experience problems.2) Since it is not cross platform, those like myself who do not use Windows will need to install the Windows Steam client in either a virtual machine or using something like WINE.This fan hopes one day Sid Meier will release a new Railroads game that is 64bit compatible and cross platform.

												This game is fantastic in a lot of ways. The game brings me back to my 'Railroad Tycoon' games and is wonderfully fun with competitive stockmarket sharing and everything! The game incorporates several different maps, resources and resource types across maps. Releases new technology as time goes on -- the game is exciting and a lot of fun....BUT. I do not recommend this game unless you wish to sit there and have consistent disappointment for one reason. The game looks like it would be fantastic in multiplayer but I dare not even try it because EVERY THREE MINUTES -- the game just crashes. It seems to be a consistent problem across many of Sid Meier's games too. Fix this problem! The game would be recommended with the best rating I could give it if it was not for this REALLY annoying factor. Also, to add to frustration - the game claims it saves every so often. Where? I cannot find any mention of any save file. I could just save it myself but unless you wish to save every 15 seconds -- and I mean, literally -- then you will continually keep losing data again and again with this game. It's just not worth the time.[EDIT: If you download a patch that can be found online, and use it to override your copy of this game - it works perfectly. Like a charm. No more crashes and the game becomes awesome again. I'll change my rating to a thumbs up but BE WARNED all - you will need this downloaded patch to play the game, after you get it - it becomes awesome again].			"

												I loved this game back when it was new, and was excited to rediscover it on a steam sale. It's great if you like simple train sims, but if you're looking for something with more depth this may not be the train game for you. It's unfortunate that there isn't any DLC, workshop, steam cards or achievements, but it's still a great buy if you can catch it on sale. Only downside is that it seems to crash a lot, but that could be my laptop, or a Windows 8 issue. Seems to come and go. I can play 4 games back to back with no issue, but then have it crash on the next 3.			"

It takes a simple topic of trading and vastly improves upon it.  People have said that the track laying system isn't very smart.  However I think this is a good thing, it's functional so I can always do what I want, I just have to actually put in more effort (3 or 4 mouse clicks) which makes it almost a puzzle to make the most efficent train tracks!The AI is acomidating to new players and simply adding more AI's can make simple maps much harder.------------------------------------------UIThe ui isn't wonderful to start out with, but once you play it for a little while it's very functional.  It is buggy a higher resolutions so I suggest sticking with the default.-------------------------------------------OverallI think this is a wonderful game if you're willing to put in a bit of effort, and it's very rewarding when you do.

There are several senario missions to play or you could simply aim to be the last railroad company standing. Multiplayer is great and suprizingly, pretty busy. You beat others buy buying out stocks of their company untill you own 100% of all their stock. Each city has demands and supplies so you have to set up your rail roads acordingly. There are tons of different resources, and even more types of trains. Overall, a fun, casual game, that keeps you occupied for hours. As in any civ game, ""Just...one more train...""			"

												Sid Meier's Railroads is a fun little game.  Basically you start off as a fledling railroad, with some starting captia, a starting railroad and station, and from there, the world is your oyster. Pros:- It is a railroad tycoon simulator, causing you to take time, pause the game, look around the map, figure out which towns/cities you want to lay track to to set up passanger, mail, and goods cars; all the while, looking around to find resources and facilities that process them to make a profit.- You are always looking for markets, and industries to claim ownership over, provide materials, and export the produced goods to make a buck.- Music and graphics are 7/10.  Nothing ground breaking but not horriable as well.  Also, the ability to be able to move the camera to ""ride"" the selected train is a nice touch.- You are able to buy stock in your own company as well as your competitors, allowing you to buy them out, and either liquidate everything they owned or seize ownership and merge them into your own company to make money off of their ""hard work"".- You are given the ability to build industries in cities and towns to help them grow, as well as expand your own industry base for your company- Always have to think one step ahead, especially if you are playing against max AI on hardest difficulty level, which really adds another depth of thoughtful gameplay.- New trains will always become available, causing you to think about which ones you can, need and must upgrade vs ones you can leave alone. - There are auctions for buying new industries, and patents, which will give you a greater amount of leverage for your company and it's success in the game.-Plenty of different maps, with different resources and industry chains to explore, plus time era challanges.  One map may be only for a gold rush in Californa USA, yet another would be weapons production in Britian. Cons:- If you want to upgrade all of your trains, you need to click your way down the list, no selection to change all all at once.- Gameplay can feel a bit stagnent after a while and repititive.All in all, I do enjoy this game.  It is a fun little game when you need a break from your main games and are looking to play a tycoon based game.			"

												I've been playing this crash-happy game for almost 9 years now.  The auto-save feature is definitely useful to get you back where you left off.  Crashes aside, I've played every imaginable train game and none comes close to this for fun, competition vs AI, generally easy to learn but with many variations and ways to win (coal-steel-cars, cows-stockyards-food, ore-gold, grapes-wine).  Buy as part of the $9 bundle.  Forgive the crashes, and have fun.  I just installed on my new Skylake based Windows 10 system and it works as well or better than it ever has. 10/10 for fun. 6/10 for recoverable crashing.			"

												I really want to love this game. It's a more casual version of a Railroad Tycoon game, but still has the enjoyment of considering which routes and supply lines will maximize profits. Competing again other tycoons adds an element of pressure to your campaign as well.But... it's incredibly buggy. I've never been able to play a campaign without multiple crashes hampering my efforts. What's more, the AI is poor and the track laying is at times completely rediculous. Weird bridges over rival factions rail lines are the norm, not the exception.Would buy a game like this if one was well made, but unfortunately, this is just tiresome.			"

												With everyone being so negative about this game, I think i should voice my opinion of it. THIS GAME HARDLY CRASHES IF your computer is decent. Mine is halfway decent and I only had two crashes both because I ALT + Tab'd out which is a breaking point for any old game.Understand: This game is really fun!Pros:-AI's are smart. Very smart. I would go as far as saying they are ""Turnt af"". Yes, I did just use that in a sentence. -Making Railroads is very intuitive and once you learn the key-bindings, becomes second nature.- Finding the best ""Get rich quick"" scheme is a task and usually different with every play through. Example: one play it was gold that ♥♥♥♥ed the economy raw and another time it was food that did the trick.- ♥♥♥♥IN TRAINS! new trains, old trains, red trains, blue trains (Yes, train customization)Cons:- sometimes the tracks get all messed up and are hard to click on without selecting something else- Tunnels are very difficult to manage almost to the point where you would save more by just going around- AI's are smart as ♥♥♥♥. Like assrape you sideways smart.TL:DRGet this if its on sale cause you will spend lots of hours staring at trains trying to get the most cash and doing missions out the ♥♥♥. Its fun.			"

												A highly charming yet simplistic strategy game about moving goods and people with trains. It lacks any of the complexity of transport tycoon, but has a great deal of charm and clever mechanics. Buildings and scenery will move out of your way automatically when laying down tracks and assigning routes it easy.  The scenarios and multiplayer maps are well designed, but it doesn't feel like there are as many as there should be. Graphics are slightly dated but is still very visually appealing.Many people disliked from issues with crashing, but the amount the game crashes for each person seems to vary greatly. For me it has crashed rarely so I can still say positive things. Overall lots of fun, but it could really use a patch and a map editor that it will sadly never get.			"

Once you do that its pretty smooth sailing to win the other levels of the game (with or without AI). The game is GREAT fun, an easy simulator/tycoon game with less micro management than rollercoaster tycoon, but more than a simple simulation game. I recommend if you are looking for a fun railroad game, an easy going game, or a fun tycoon game! Also buy the tycoon collection to get all 3 railroad games. Its cheaper and the other games are worth it!			"

												Sid Meier's Railroads is one of the most interesting strategy building games involved trains, that exists out there. In no sence is it accurate to the real world in terms of year and geography is sometimes questionable. In general, its a entertaining experinece playing the game, as you will always attempt to beat your AI competitors. After playing for an hour or two, that when you realizr, you own all the railorads or nothing if you lost, and your ready to quit the game and play a month later. Its a nice leasure game, though through, for the most part, and worth having on a boring weekend to kill some time.			"

												This has got to be my all time favorite game. Its relaxing, its challenging and it has trains! Plus to me the interface is just a joy to use unlike a lot of similar games. The actual game consists of moving goods from one city to another via trains. You need to balance price of the train with potential income form the root. It a little dated and lacks maps (although looking at the amount of time Iv put into this game, no amount of maps would have been enough), it does run a little strange on windows 8, I get some clipping, slow down and a few crashes. But this does not distract to much from gameplay (if at all).  There are user created mods/ extra maps that you can download, little bit of a pain to install, but well worth it. All in all the is probably the best game ever made! I actually think the steam estimation of time is about 1/9 of the actual time! "

												This game is a cross between Cid Meier's Civ 5 and Roller Coaster Tycoon. I will admit, i'm not that big into trains, but this game is really fun. There are several senario missions to play or you could simply aim to be the last railroad company standing. Multiplayer is great and suprizingly, pretty busy. You beat others buy buying out stocks of their company untill you own 100% of all their stock. Each city has demands and supplies so you have to set up your rail roads acordingly. There are tons of different resources, and even more types of trains. Overall, a fun, casual game, that keeps you occupied for hours. As in any civ game, ""Just...one more train...""			"

												Sid Meier's Railroads is one of the most engaging games for both train lovers and business simulation fans. You get to lay your own rail network in a scaled down map resembling some real world location such as the United States or the Great Britain, and eventually succeed at your own rail business.Most games usually (you can customize this) drop you somewhere around the early-mid 1800s and expect you to run your business all the way until the late 20th century. Ofcourse you can retire anytime or you can keep playing endlessly as the freedom offered in this game is pretty big.Over this period, technology will march on as you will get access to better locomotives, useful upgrades and plenty of cash-grab opporunities.PROS-1) Run your own rail empire. Lay tracks, set up stations, determine a train's route and purchase businesses.2) Customize the way your locomotive looks. Logos, colors and all.3) Real world History.4) Great music that captures the mood and setting.5) Possible LAN/Internet multiplayer with players competing to establish their own rail empire. AI opponents can also be used.6) Auto-save along with manual save anytime/anywhere options.7) Customize the way you want to play. Whether you want to relax and have fun or run business on a pressure is upto you. The game doesn't even track if you've finished the single player campaigns. Play as you want, how you want.CONS1) Game derails (pun intended) due to plenty of non-fixed bugs. Game crashes to desktop if the AI cannot handle complicated routes sometimes. Thankfully the auto-save feature somewhat mitigates this.2) AI signalling cannot handle more than two trains on a shared / interwined tracks sometimes. It will end up creating a deadlock on the hardest difficulty as trains are not allowed to pass through in the said difficuly.3) Practically dead internet multiplayer due to it being reliant on GameSpy Arcade. You must play with friends over LAN or use Tuungle / Hamachi or some other tunneling software for internet play.If you don't mind facing some annoying bugs, this game will suck your time away like no tomorrow. Get this, probably not at full price, but at a discount. It's worth that much.			"

												This game is awesome!  I had to find a patched .exe file to keep it from crashing constantly with Windows 10, But I am ok with that. It is an old game. WIsh they would make a sequel to this game. Multiplayer works fine through Hamachi as long as you change a few settings in the network config.The game is very addicting. But once you have it down on how to play it, it can get too easy to play and that can make things really worse than better. I still recommend playing it, just play it on hard to get more playtime out of it.			"

												One of my favorite games EVER. Not many hours on steam but I've logged hundreds of hours out of steam back when I still had a physical copy. That was also back when the game didn't have any crashing issues, not sure what the issue is but I've assumed that it just doesn't play nicely with the newer OS's. it will crash often, there is a way to fix it that you can find in the community discussion section on steam, or just google for a fix and you'll find a number of different forums with help. The replayability is outstanding, the graphics are good considering it's 10 years old. This game is my benchmark gold standard for business sims to this day. I've got a lot of nostalgia slapping me in the face when I play which contributes to my high opinion of the game. I would recommend this game to my friends but you will have to fiddle with the game to stop the crashes, no way around it at this point.			"

												Basically, what this game does is simulate your train playset. It's not like the Railroad Tycoon games, for that it's way to streamlined and simplified, but it works along the same principle. Sort of toonish as well, so it seems like the main object is to appeal to a wider audience, either that or they just wanted to make something more ""playish"" rather than a simulation.All that said though, it's a fun game and can give you alot of good times, but do not confuse it with or see it as a Railroad Tycoon series game.

												I don't have the crashing problems I see other people stating they have... I will say tho the game can get a bit boring, and it's limited. The cities and farms and mines and everything are very close. There's no effort in doing anything, just build the rails, create the lines, and well...go. RT3 at least had some structure and it took time to build everything and income wasn't as huge as it is in this game. I can't really recommend or not recommend this to anyone.			"

												If you excuse the semi-frequent crashing (easy to do if you set it to autosave every minute, so you never lose any progress), this is a rail tycoon game that has aged remarkably well. It's easy to set your own balance between building for profit and for fun, and the interface is really simple to use. You can also buy into and build up industries across each map and there are plenty of graphs and statistics handy for you to keep a close eye on your progress. The graphics still work well even in full screen, and the sound is great.It's just a shame that this game has never been updated. I think a version of this with better graphics, online multiplayer, and mods through Steam Workshop (for extra maps, engines, and industries) would do really well - it has the world renowned Sid Meier name on it, after all.

												A truely great game! I'm a long time fan of the Civilization series and many more Sid Meier's works, this game is no exception. I'm not a train enthusiast but I played this for the Empire building/Simulation experience. I was totally blown away, I bought this game on physical version in 2008 and later bought the steam version. There is a crashing issue on a lot of later versions of windows but the patch is easy to find and apply. There is a lot of content and maps with tons of replayability, spanning time and continents. As I said, I'm not a train enthusiast but I would say there is a very wide range of trains available with historical descriptions for each (as Sid is known to do). This game really fills the need I have for a business simulator. Great game 9/10.			"

												Sid Meier's Railroads is one of the most engaging games for both train lovers and business simulation fans. You get to lay your own rail network in a scaled down map resembling some real world location such as the United States or the Great Britain, and eventually succeed at your own rail business.Most games usually (you can customize this) drop you somewhere around the early-mid 1800s and expect you to run your business all the way until the late 20th century. Ofcourse you can retire anytime or you can keep playing endlessly as the freedom offered in this game is pretty big.Over this period, technology will march on as you will get access to better locomotives, useful upgrades and plenty of cash-grab opporunities.PROS-1) Run your own rail empire. Lay tracks, set up stations, determine a train's route and purchase businesses.2) Customize the way your locomotive looks. Logos, colors and all.3) Real world History.4) Great music that captures the mood and setting.5) Possible LAN/Internet multiplayer with players competing to establish their own rail empire. AI opponents can also be used.6) Auto-save along with manual save anytime/anywhere options.7) Customize the way you want to play. Whether you want to relax and have fun or run business on a pressure is upto you. The game doesn't even track if you've finished the single player campaigns. Play as you want, how you want.CONS1) Game derails (pun intended) due to plenty of non-fixed bugs. Game crashes to desktop if the AI cannot handle complicated routes sometimes. Thankfully the auto-save feature somewhat mitigates this.2) AI signalling cannot handle more than two trains on a shared / interwined tracks sometimes. It will end up creating a deadlock on the hardest difficulty as trains are not allowed to pass through in the said difficuly.3) Practically dead internet multiplayer due to it being reliant on GameSpy Arcade. You must play with friends over LAN or use Tuungle / Hamachi or some other tunneling software for internet play.If you don't mind facing some annoying bugs, this game will suck your time away like no tomorrow. Get this, probably not at full price, but at a discount. It's worth that much.			"

												Simple design, easy to learn gameplay, endless challenge.  If you like sim city, or any of the civ series, you will love this game as a break from the epic turn based games Sid Meier has become famous for.  Can be played as a quick 5-10 minute time killer or a longer quest to totally dominate of your competition.  The business aspect also makes for an intriguing strategy challenge.  HIghly recommend for everyone, epecially anyone looking for a more casual railroad sim than rail tycoon or Trainz.			"

												One of my favorite games EVER. Not many hours on steam but I've logged hundreds of hours out of steam back when I still had a physical copy. That was also back when the game didn't have any crashing issues, not sure what the issue is but I've assumed that it just doesn't play nicely with the newer OS's. it will crash often, there is a way to fix it that you can find in the community discussion section on steam, or just google for a fix and you'll find a number of different forums with help. The replayability is outstanding, the graphics are good considering it's 10 years old. This game is my benchmark gold standard for business sims to this day. I've got a lot of nostalgia slapping me in the face when I play which contributes to my high opinion of the game. I would recommend this game to my friends but you will have to fiddle with the game to stop the crashes, no way around it at this point.			"

												I can't get enough of this game. It's brilliant and massively addictive.I never played any of the other Railroads games and I'm certainly no train spotter, but the management style of this game is very easy to get into and difficult to master. Though beating the A.I. isn't difficult, trying to beat them *and* achieve the objectives in each map can be very hard and trying to go for gold is what makes the maps replayable.Obviously the biggest flaw is that it is UNPLAYABLE after buying it from Steam. Seriously Steam shouldn't be allowed to sell it like this. You'll need to download the enabler from somewhere, which will allow you to play it just fine. I am on Windows 10 x64bit and play without trouble. You just need to download that enabler.I should, on principle, give the game a thumbs down based on the need to get your own fix. But honestly, I can't thumbs down this great game and it's easy enough to get the 3G enabler yourself;http://smrsimple.com/2010/11/simple-guide-to-the-3gb-enabler/ "

												One of Sid Meier's best... and worst games to date. The graphics are very good! But the game itself is extremely simple, a far cry from his grand slammer Railroad Tycoon III. Also, there are glitches that pop up throughout the game, such as the rails twisting and warping on you from time to time, or randomly crashing in the middle of a game. All in all, I give this 3 locomotives out of 5.			"

												I've played this for 14 hours already, and I have not crashed a single time after applying the hot fix mentioned on the top review for this game. For a game from 2006, it's aged well. Plays perfectly fine, easy to make money, and total fun watching your railway... just work. Only gripe is that after you finish a scenario that the game forces you to end at 2050, then again I've pretty much built the most perfect system there is by then.

												The biggest issue with this game is that it is buggy as hell. It will often do a hard crash on you when you're attempting to layu out new track, so, ""save early and save often"" (it also has autosaves) Beyond that, it doesn't allow you to readily select things that might be markedly close together, with can be a pain, but you can work around/with this. I'm going to recommend it if you like the original Railroad Tychoon from ages long ago, but if you're not big on sims, pick a different Sid Meier-based sim game to play. This is notable for being distinctly different in overall play than the Civ games.I give it a 6 out of 10, offhand. Probably worth the money, if you can handle the crashing, and are looking for cheap amusement, it's certainly playable and fun. I'd give it an 8 if it didn't crash pretty relentlessly -- if you get through three hours of play without it crashing twice, you've been lucky.			"
