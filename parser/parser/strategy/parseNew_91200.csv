												This a reverse Tower-Defense game, the player controls the attacking units. I'll be honest, I went into this game expecting to hate it.  I'm happy that I was wrong and I offer my sincere apologies to '11-Bit Studios' for doubting you! A respectful bow and a tip of the hat to you! :)This gem flew under the radar for lots of people. If you're a fan of the genre, you'll not be disappointed! The UI is very slick looking and responsive. It's also easy to pick-up and play thanks to a simple control scheme and well-done tutorial system. You can feel the passion, time, and quality, that the developers poured into this game. The production values alone are impressive. If you're just looking to have a good time and kick-back with a genre you know and love, stay the course! But If you've got a wii-touch of Sadism inside you that craves a seemingly unfair situation, like me, then the game has plenty of challenges to quench that hunger, too. Especially during that last couple of Campaign Missions. That isn't to say, the game has no flaws. There are moments during the story, that are cliche and can be seen coming a mile away. While having a fully voiced cast can add a lot to a game experience, it only takes one person to ruin it. Certain cutscenes (seems like the unskippable ones?) move your camera/focus towards a scene on the other side of the map, without pausing the action. I've lost count of how many units have fallen in the line of cutscene-fire. A dislike of mine that probably doesn't bother anybody else, is the Commander's skill-set. The skills themselves are fine. It's the fact that the Commander is unable to offer any regular(gun) damage of his own. Even if it's just a tiny amount...every little bit, counts.Since I don't wanna end this review on a sour note, I definatly recommend this game			"

												ANOMALY WARZONE EARTH is surprisingly entertaining, with great tutorials. Its a top down somewhat tower defense game... only in reverse. You lead a squad of vehicles that must take clear cut streets through enemy defenses, but you select the route and your caravan just keeps following the path you set for them. So imagine a train that cannot stop on a tracks with multiple paths. If something blocks your train track, you divert your train at the next intersection by going to a tactical route map and just clicking on the intersection to point their next direction to head in. Its really as easy as that. You don't control the vehicles so much as just point out the route to take. You do have a player character to control. There is a 'speed up / turbo' button to make the game go faster.Since you're going through a warzone, the enemy has turrets, and other defenses setup to slow you down. So this is like you play the part of a GPS and they'll do the fighting as they come upon enemies. You can buy more vehicles for your caravan, upgrade current vehicles (for the same price as buying them new) and assign their formations. Like do you select a less defensive more offensive vehicle to go first or do you select a more defensive less offensive vehicle? Another thing to consider is range of attack. The 'attack crawler' vehicle has a longer range, but it is considerably weaker than the 'defender APCs.' Eventually you'll get shielders that will provide a shield for the vehicles directly in front and in back of them in the caravan train. There are also tanks that you will unlock later. In all the game's player vehicles seem limited in diversity.As a commander, you have abilities that you collect. The first is to repair your vehicles in a radius of where it is used for a specific time as the train keeps rolling. Your player character isn't limited to staying with the caravan, he can go out and wander to find things. This is a very simple yet engaging. The only downside is the controls could be better. A lot of times my commander was accidentally walking all over the place when I wanted him to repair things. Just because you hit the abilities menu, then select the ability with the mouse. Well when you use the mouse it makes your player character walk. The other abilities are, smoke screens that will cover vehicles in a radius preventing some cannons from hitting them and then decoys that will attract larger cannons that would otherwise accurately hit your vehicles in a smoke screen. Finally, there is a bomb target to bluntly bomb enemies. It might seem cheap, but it is useful for wide beam cannons that keep streaming a draining vehicles.Eventually the challenge outweighs the fun just gets too much on even the normal difficulty. When you have limited resources, money and enemies keep getting more and more powerful, such as giving enemies a damage radius to every bullet and enemies that ressurect destroyed towers. Once one of your vehicles is destroyed, I find myself wanting restart from the last checkpoint, because I know that one vehicle down will make my train too weak to beat later levels.Each level seems healthy time wise and you get to select your level of difficulty. It is definitely worth a play. Good instructions, good voice work explaining everything in a simple manner.			"

												Anomaly: Warzone Earth is a reverse tower-defense strategy game, the first of the series.The gameplay of Anomaly: Warzone Earth is very simple, yet needs lots of attention. You command your forces to destroy the enemy tower machine in your way. You will need to pick the best units combination then choose the best route for your troops to attack the enemy and then complete your objectives, but you can't just let your units attack alone like a rambo, your units are not in unlimited supply, you need to look after them. You can use some ability to help your troops destroy the enemy and survive the mission, like repair damaged units or call in airstrikes. Without these ability, your troops will surely get killed and you will fail, so keep an eye on them.The graphics of Anomaly: Warzone Earth is beautiful, not so advanced, but very pleasing on the eye, perfectly crafted. From the UI to the battlefield, they're all good. This also comes with great performances.This is one of the best tower-defense game I ever played. I recommend this!Rating 9/10			"

												Anomaly Warzone Earth is an indie game that has a surprisingly high production value.  I was incredibly impressed.  The menu and UI is slick, the control scheme is well thought out and plays almost entirely with the mouse right out of the box.  It has controller support and touch control support (mobile game) and the backgrounds and models are beautifully rendered and look high quality.  The gameplay is interesting too - it's kind of a reverse tower defense.  I found it refreshing and fun, and the difficulty really ramps up in the later levels.  I played on Casual, if you turn it up to really hard I'm sure it would knock your socks off.  There are also online leaderboards and automatic ranking notifications, challenge modes, and it's fully voice acted.  Everything in the game screams care and quality.  No corners were cut and you could tell the developers spent the time to make sure things were done *right*.Anomaly is good for pick up and play gaming, but I think grinding it out would get tedious after awhile - it's great for mobile gaming and to kill time a level at a time on the PC.  I'd recommend picking it up if you're looking for something to play intermitantly or giving it a shot if you picked it up in an indie bundle and have it sitting in your library.  B			"

												Interesting variety of tower defense genre. You're in control of ""invading"" units in pre-built maps. At the beginning of each stage, you select your squad based on money you have. You can set/change route of your squad any time you want, change their formation, upgrade their abilities, sell/buy units during mission. You'll have different goals like getting to the end point, destroying some towers along the route, escorting safely some unit to the end, etc. Enemy towers doesn't respawn (in most levels), nor upgrade, so you can plan your strategy ahead.Besides your squad ""on rails"", you control the commander - unit which can freely roam the field. His mission is to provide help to your squad with healing, diversions and air strike. He can also be killed, but he respawns after several seconds, unlike other units. Commander is equally important as your other units, so you must learn to use him wisely.Once you get familiar with game mechanics, you can finish this game with almost same unit formation every time on any difficulty, but nevertheless, game is addictive and very fun to play. I highly recommend playing in combination with steam achievements which adds interesting tasks to do during missions (which also makes the game more difficult).Overall, if you like tower defense games, you probably won't regret getting this game.

												Blending fast-paced, explosive action with а tactical battlefield command, Anomaly puts players in charge of a military convoy tasked with fighting back against the mysterious alien war machines that have begun to spring up in many of the world's largest cities. Players take part in battles personally to support and assist a hand-picked armor squad, utilizing their top-down tactical view to plot each and every turn of the convoy. As they progress through the story campaign and challenge modes, players will unlock upgrades and new units to build their ultimate destruction squad. I had no idea this would actually be all that entertaining. I'm a big fan of tower defense games, and this is a pretty good example of it flipped over. The graphics are very nice, the only other TD game. The game is beautifully voiced. Has a typical, yet working storyline. The mechanics are very dynamic, fast-paced, yet easy to learn. The game is just pure fun, it is unique in its approach to tower defense, and intermixing strategy allowing you to determine the step you think is best suited for the situation at hand, great action. Really worth the time!			"

												For the price, Anomaly: Warzone Earth offers a fresh and exhilaratingly fun strategy experience that only few titles can match.The graphics are smooth and exciting, the action is hectic and well-balanced, and the gameplay is truly like nothing else I've ever seen before.Despite the hazardous save system, Anomaly: Warzone Earth presents a fresh take on the Tower Defense genre. It's satisfying, but leaves a lingering hunger for a sequel - hopefully with a tighter save system and more units.Complemented with a solid plot and gameplay that finds a steady medium between strategy and action, Anomaly is a clever game that is sure to draw in tower defense fans.Anomaly is, above all, a very fresh and interesting game, with fun mechanics. It is a modest game which hasn't attracted much attention, but I am sure it will surprise many.If you're interested in strategy games, I highly recommend you pick this one up and keep your eyes on 11 bit studios in the future!

												Anomaly: Warzone Earth is a top-down Tower Defense type game, where you play as the commander of the 14th armor battalion, and direct your convoy of vehicles through streets, using various powerups and tactics, all in real time. You alone control a 14th Platoon soldier on foot who picks up decoys and smoke-screens, repair kits and uses these items to protect and heal the convoy. Your convoy is attempting to penetrate anomalous zones around the city, which surround parts of an alien spaceship that crashed to earth. Visually the graphics don't look bad at all. There is alot of switching back and forth from your minimap as you plot course corrections for the convoy depending on what obstacles are thown your way in real time. The game feels like it may have been made for a handheld initially and then ported to the PC, but if that is true they didn't do a bad job. While not exactly a tower defense game, more of a tower attack game, Anomaly: Warzone Earth can be fun to play. There are multiple difficulties to choose from, so I recommend the most difficult for the best experience.			"

												Anomaly: Warzone Earth is a RTS tower offense game (?) that takes place in a near future.You are the Commander of the 14th Platoon and it’s your mission to investigate the anomalies that have appeared in some of the major cities in the world, after something crashed on them. As expected of any weird stuff that falls from the sky and breaks all communications within its impact radius, they weren't simple meteorites. Earth is now in danger, but what lies in the anomaly doesn't seem interested in an invasion.What are they here for? How are you going to fight them? Why the hell do you feel like you’re the one invading a base?★★★★☆ | Liked it "

												Anomaly Warzone Earth treat to play from start to finish. I am not normally a fan of stratergy type genre, however this is more of a reverse tower defense game. The levels are well varied in type, as well as some interesting challenge mode to boot after you finish the main campaign. Once you work out the optimum build order, you will soon find your self powering through the levels. I especially like how you control a commander, which helps out by using powerups, such as a repair or activate a shield around your convoy of units. I can highly recommend Anomaly for anyone's time, with the addition of challenge modes, there is hours of gametime here.			"

												This is what you get when you reverse the roles in a tower defense game. Unfortunately, this turns it into a baby sitting simulator as you follow around a caravan healing it or covering it with aoe heal packets or smoke bombs respectively. The game is slow, offers no engaging gameplay, and the plot appears to be ripped out of a Command and Conquer game, then watered down to avoid copyright infringement.			"

												At first when I found out it was a ""Reverse Tower Defense"" where you control the units, I thought it'd be just another spam units when you had the money sort of thing. But was I wrong! This is actually surprisingly well made and fun for the most part of it!For the main game there is 14 missions and 3 side (Bonus?) missions. Now don't get me wrong that sounds like a small number but there is pleanty of awesome gameplay and things to do to keep you interested for hours! Hence, here is my thoughts on it:Pros:♦ Great Graphics♦ Amazing Voice Overs (Every game needs high quality voice overs like this one)♦ Awesome Gameplay that is challenging at times and will take you hours to finish (It took me 12.5hours to get all but 2 achievements)♦ Medals per level make the game that little bit more fun and challenging (This is an awesome concept that makes you want to keep playing to get them all)♦ 44 Achievements with achievements per level (This is epic as there is not only gold medals to achieve but individual achievements per level for doing certain challenge type things unrelated to the levels main objects which keeps the levels interesting for a longer time)♦ 3 difficulties per level (These add an even more challenging and fun aspect to the game)♦ Steam Trading Cards ♦ Leaderboards (Even though some of the scores seem impossible to get, this is a nice addition as each level is ranked individually and you can compare your score to friends and the global Steam users which adds a nice competitive aspect to the game)Cons:♦ Bonus levels Baghdad Mayhem and Tokyo Raid seem repetitive (This is bad as they are wave based and just seems like the levels were last minute as every wave is the same)♦ Bonus levels are numbered weirdly (Levels 1 and 3 are in Baghdad Mayhem and 2 is in Tokyo Raid. IMO they should have made them seperate from each other as they pretty much are)♦ Tokyo Raid's highscores seem unreachable (I destroyed almost every tower bar like 3 and was nowhere near number 1 highscore)♦ The way you unlock some Medals seems unconsistant (For example Directiveness in one level may be really straight forward and then you do the same the same things you did in the next level to get the directiveness medal and it doesn't unlock which is really annoying)♦ Story could have been better (Seemed kind of lame to me, some may enjoy it though)♦ Some Cutscenes seemingly don't pause the game which is annoying as I've come back to the game to find my unit die due to the timing of the cutscene (Really annoying as you only have limited money per level!!).Overall, for a Reverse Tower defense where you control the units the game is on par with many hours of fun, challenging and competitive gameplay to be had. Despite the repetitiveness of the Bonus levels and the bad Storyline the game is interesting, has many achievements and you will enjoy playing it and coming back to better your score or beat your difficulty or even beat your highscore or your friends! Well worth buying and playing if you are appealed by the concept of Reverse Tower Defense! "

 “Strategy requires thought, tactics require observation.” Anomaly: Warzone Earth (A:WE) is a hybrid reversed tower defense simulation crossed with a real-time strategy game developed by the company 11 bit studios with emphasis on combat and tactics. Atmosphere & presentation: + Creative gameplay concept, where the player leads his attacking units through static towers.+ Impressive balance between strategy and action keeps up the motivation.  + Well-done art direction and particle effects.o Solid background music.o Alien design is rather playful. Combat & gameplay: + Player escorts his convoy with an on-foot commander, who can collect and deploy tactical power-ups.+ Coordination of the units, scouting out positions and deploying resources create a dynamic gameplay.+ Strategic elements in form of route planning, convoy make-up and order of units.+ Units can be upgraded up to three times increasing their effectiveness.+ Additional spawning of enemy towers keeps the player on edge.+ Challenging end boss fight. o Column of vehicles is limited to six units.o Game speed can be adjusted. - Only six different models of enemy towers. Characters & story: + Original background story.o Solid voice work.- Limited identification of the player with the protagonist. Summary: 11 bit studios succeeds in reinterpreting the traditional concept of tower defense games. A:WE offers a lot of fun in trying to make the most efficient routes, that could cause greatest amount of devastation while minimizing both exposure and travel time.

												A pretty nice game idea, playing like a reverse tower defence game, where instead of setting up towers and fighting off waves of enemies, you're navigating a small force of tanks and other vehicles into an enemy territory.There's a lot of strategy involved here, as you must choose your routes carefully and to engage just enough towers at a time so not to get overwhelmed, whilst using abilities such as smoke screen and decoys to mislead enemy towers and protect your allies in the process. There are several different enemy towers, and each one can pose a serious threat if you don't approach it with good strategy. And in addition to encountering various tower setups, the game often throws other challenges your way too, such as needing to get across a bridge in the area before it gets destroyed, or having to evade powerful area artillery strikes from the enemy, and so on.The game is really fun if you like tactical gameplay, but it's also pretty relentless and hard, even on Casual difficulty. If you're looking for a casual, relaxing game, you won't find it here. But if you're seeking a challenge, you'll be right at home. Unfortunately the game's checkpoint system can sometimes work against you. If you happened to reach a chekpoint when you're low on ability supplies and your vehicles are in poor shape, you might find yourself unable to make progress past the next area, and returning back to the previous section becomes impossible after a checkpoint. These times could cause you having to restart the whole level from the beginning.In addition to the 14 campaign missions, you also get some bonus challenges (Baghdad Mayhem and Tokyo Raid) which you can try out, where you're given a series of tasks (not related to the story) in an area and you must complete them. Overall, the presentation is pretty good. Great visuals, adrenaline-pumping music, and nice voice acting. So if you don't mind some challenge, this game is worth getting.			"

												The premise behind Anomaly: Warzone Earth is that of reverse tower defense. Instead of setting up your defense towers in lanes and waiting for the enemy to attack, your job is to attack towers that have been set up by aliens through various campaign missions. While this may sound like it makes the tower  defense genre more interesting, and provides a much needed change in a fairly strict genre, the truth is, it does not. Graphically, it's serviceable. The developers did a decent job porting the game from mobile devices, even though there aren't that many options besides resolution. The artwork varies from creatively rendered post-apocalyptic cities around the world, to alien structures and weaponry. Voice acting is below average, but it isn't too bad. The British accent in particular sounds fake and over the top. As for the plot, it's your below average teenage action science fiction with very little substance and grossly lacking in twists. Overall,  Anomaly: Warzone Earth is predictable from beginning to end, if you can stomach finishing the game. From its presentation, to the mechanics, to the storyline, there isn't anything that rewards the player, or provides a sense of accomplishment and value. Playing the game feels more like an annoyance. It also suffers from a severe lack of depth and range. There are only four unit types, six enemy types, and only four commander abilities that can only be activated if you pick up their ability icons that are dropped on the map by supply planes. There is very little variation from mission to mission, and even though upgrading your units is an option, there is very little reason to do so, as you will need to get more units on the field instead. Having only one or two upgraded units go through the lanes is guaranteed suicide. Another very serious problem with Anomaly: Warzone Earth is the difficulty. Even at the easiest setting, there will be some more advanced campaign missions that are nearly impossible to beat unless you do exactly what the developers wanted you to by design. There is no choice to be made. Finishing those artificially difficult missions is not due to skill or through learned strategies, but by saving and repeating the same abilities you have been abusing of throughout the entire campaign. There is no strategy nor skill involved. You simply repeat the same steps over and over, for every mission. It doesn't really matter what enemies you are facing, or what the pointless mission objective is. The game gives you a false sense of decision making, and a false sense of strategy. It feels like all actions being done in-game are worthless and with no consequences. It's almost like the game plays itself. Only needing you to click a bit, instead of looking stupid as you poke your phone or your tablet, if you were playing on the game's original mobile platform. There are many other tower defense games that provide the player with actual choice of action and strategy. Anomaly: Warzone Earth does nothing to make the tower defense genre better. In fact, it makes it worse.Anomaly: Warzone Earth is mediocre.			"

												To be honest, I have never expected a game like that ((Reverse) Tower Defence) to be near as interesting as this one. Graphics, story, performance, level design and the general idea is really great :D At some point, you really want to win the game, you feel like it's your duty! The concept of powerups and the commander running around his units is brilliant, thanks to that the game is never boring (it's sort of a game in a game, you have to play in sort of two seperate dimensions at once).My advice: If you see this game with ~50% discount, take it :D			"

Product received for free
												Great tower defense game, although it's actually a tower attack one: you command a squad that needs to reach its destination, having to destroy every treat in your path and using your special abilities to make sure the squad gets there in one piece. You choose what type of vehicles you want in your squad based on how much money you have, set up the route and you're ready to go. The squad follows the route, which is limited to the streets, while you - the commander - can move everywhere. If a vehicle from your squad gets destroyed, it's gone. Lose all of them and your mission fails. You can also add / remove vehicles to your squad at any point throughout the mission, but you need money to add them: removing a vehicle gives you some money back, depending on how damaged it is. If you die, you respawn in the same place after a few seconds. As you progress through the game, harder and smarter towers start appearing: some can inflict damage to your entire squad at the same time, some can restore destroyed towers by sucking energy out of you every time you use a special ability in their field of view, some can turn your squad against you... It's a really fun game, and also has a very interesting story.			"

												This game is a combination of tower-defense action strategy with a somewhat unique tower-offense technique used most of the time. It will not give you many ways to accomplish missions, most of the times the scripted events are so obvious that you will know for sure when an ''anomaly'' hits the short route you decided to take, giving you only the choice to switch to the longer, more risky route.Despite of these scripted events and a bit of failed voice acting from every character, this is a very good game. It's refreshing an old, almost lost genre.Pros:        + Tower defense at its best, plus somethig more        + Suspanse at every corner, especially on higher difficulties        + The AI is surprisingly good for an almost indie game        + Nice and simple leaderboards display, depending on the difficulty you playCons:        - Short campaign; tiny fast-paced levels        - Scripted events will become obvious before they even happen, after 1h of gameplay        - The buy/sell/upgrade function is simple. Could've been added something more.Personal rating: 74/100 - Good			"

												When I got the game I had some doubts about its general quality.Graphics are really good for what I was expecting.Storyline could be a bit more engaging, but even if you skip the scenes you still get an idea on what's going on.There's a good variety of vehicles and each one has its own purpose and speciality.Unlike others are saying, the game is not boring. If you feel like you want to speed it up a bit you can just press shift and let it flow.10/10It's a fresh and great looking game on the scene. "

												Wow cool...I've never played this kind of game before.In this game, you have to lead an army to a location safely.The road is branched, and you have to choose which path to take because some of them will be destroyed.Choose a way to destroy enemies while going toward goal, and heal your army to make sure they don't get destroyed.Nice animation and gameplay.But I don't understand the story.History and warfare, I don't like that kind of stuff.It doesn't make me want to finish the game, I'm not motivated enough to see the ending.Well it is still a good game.

												EDIT : 3-3-14 I have to change my review to a 'No' after playing much more of the game. What started out as fun turned into annoying and micro. If you want to be any kind of efficient at the game you have to micro your units order to keep the damage off of them. Adding to that you have annoying missions. I just completed an escort one, I mean what is that doing in this kind of game? I just couldn't keep myself playing, felt more like I was forcing myself to beat it rather then enjoy it. I won't finish. (Old review based mostly on Demo) : Great twist on the tower defense genre by reversing it. Instead of building towers to defend you are maneuverings to destroy them. The strategy elements are there in the tactical view where you tell the units what path to take. However you only directly control a single unit which has four abilities to support the units on the field. Add to the the ability to change the order of the units  as well as upgrade them and you have a fun addicting game.			"

												This game is an interesting reversal of the tower defense genre where you become the creeps trying to destroy the tower. Control-wise, I liked the mouse interface better than a keyboard one, and eventually mapped the entire control system to my mouse. It gave it kind of a minimalist fee, leaving more room just to enjoy the game. Graphics-wise it's stellar for a top-down scroller, with decent lower-quality modes for lower-end GPUs. The gameplay itself was unique and fun, with maps that require thought but can be attacked many different ways, integral power-ups that need to be rationed smartly, and several different types of towers all with a different weak spot. Overall Anomaly: Warzone Earth is a lot of fun for the price, and I'd recommend it to anyone who prefers careful strategy to simply mowing down the opposition			"

												This is a reverse tower defense game that will not disappoint you.  Instead of a bunch of cannon fodder that you send against the towers you actually care about your troops.  You can rearrange their order, purchase upgrades and new vehicles and choose which path they take.  Then there's you, the commander.  You have certain abilities that you can use such as decoy or fog of war to help your troops get past the towers with the least amount of damage taken.This game is fun, looks great and plays without a single glitch or bug that I've noticed.  Took me about 10 hours to beat it, but when you beat more modes are unlocked for you to play the game in a different way.			"

												Anomaly Warzone Earth is a fresh take on the Tower Defense genre. The player controls an armor column, pushing forward against a massively-defended objective: Tower Defense in reverse. Additionally, you control the commander for the attacking column, distributing health packs, decoys, and smokescreens for your wounded tanks.The game itself is a bit thin. The basic strategy is to maneuver through the streets in such a way that you bite off a few towers at a time. Take on too many at once and you quickly find yourself overwhelmed, burning through your allotted health and decoy upgrades. Despite thin gameplay, the game's presentation is excellent. Sound is very good and graphics are attractive. AWE is fun to play, with a slick control scheme that works for keyboard or controller. There's a survival mode that unlocks quickly, which adds some replay value.Overall, more good than bad. It's fun.			"

												Got the whole series on a discount, I've had my eyes on these since the moment I saw Anomaly 2 on a random page. My interest in Tower Defense genre is not entirely the most enthusiastic approach perhaps, however these series with the idea and the great implementation of being the attacker seemed like a damn-good deal. So, I've been playing the Anomaly franchise for a while now, started from the very first Mobile Campaign game, to the Anomaly 2. Played them all in a row, didn't finish just tasted enough, and I'm impressed.First of all, if you're not interested in buying the whole franchise, I would strongly recommend you to skip Anomaly Korea and maybe the Warzone Earth Mobile Campaign. Mobile Campaign might not the brightest example of a mobile port to PC, however it's technically consistent compared to the Anomaly Korea. But don't get me wrong, they're both pointless since they're just ports not adaptations. Which is a problem when it comes to PC Gaming.Warzone Earth is an innovative Reverse Tower Defense game within an Alien Invasion setting on Earth which puts you as the commanding officer of a convoy of 6 different vehicles that you could purchase and upgrade by destroying your enemies. Pretty straight forward, nothing new. What makes it different though is that the game insists that you should not sit on your♥♥♥♥♥and let your convoy do the work. Nope. The only way to boost their attacking power is upgrading your units and from their types to their place within the convoy affects your survivalability. You will be constantly changing the Route you're taking, the Place of your Units, which Abilities you have to put on the ground in order to keep your units alive and their Tiers in order to beat a particular Mission. Which keeps you awake and well-aware of your surroundings, otherwise you fail. Plain and simple. If you're a fan of the Tower Defense genre and/or you would like to try something out of your regular zone, Warzone Earth is not only an outstanding, a brilliant example but also an example for how you should reimagine, adapt your mobile game for PC Market.Plus, it runs on GNU/Linux!

												Good quality reverse Tower Defence (Tower Assault?). Game mechanics are simple with 6 unit types vs 6 tower types. The story introduces new game elements at a perfect pace. Achievements are mostly easy. The Advanced difficulty ones are clever and put a twist on each of the 14 missions similar to Starcraft 2's Hard Story achievements. Further replayability is there with the contrasting gold medals forcing you to play each mission differently. Tokyo Raid gold medals are very time consuming and challenging though so it's not all easy. Highly recommended.			"

												So, what is Anomaly: Warzone Earth?It's a tower defense game, but then again, is not: It's Tower Offense.You get placed in charge of a squad consisting of up to 6 units and have to reach a certain point to complete each mission.Now, you must know: I don't usually play strategy games. Especially not TD games.In fact, the only reason I play Anomaly is because of a steam key a good friend called EPIK gave me.And you know what?I love it.If not for the voice acting, the british accents of just about anyone making the surprisingly serious scenario rather humorous to hear, then for the ability-based gameplay - you get four abilities to help you lead your squad. Repair, Cloak, Decoy, and Airstrike.If not for that, then because of the fact you can change your squad's route mid-travel. Pop up strategic view, change a few turns, close it, boop, done.If not for that, then for the story. Despite not being realistic, the story is plausible: a spaceship was toasted when it entered the atmosphere and, on impact cast giant energy domes around Bagdad and Tokyo - the Anomalies.If not for that, then for the music. The music is really well-made, though... under all the radio chatter and gunfire, sometimes hard to discern.And if not for that, then for the graphics. I don't know what engine the game is based on, but the graphics are a wonderful thing to behold. (Too bad my computer can't handle the higher settings.) "

												This game is a tower offense which means that you need to choose the perfect route for your squad to move on through the enemy without taking so much damage.The game is set in the near future, where sections of an alien spacecraft have crash-landed in several major cities around the world including Baghdad and Tokyo. The player assumes the role of the commander of an armor battalion (referred to as ""14th Platoon"" in the story) sent to investigate anomalies that have occurred in the vicinity of the wreckage and gather information on what is happening in the affected areas, as the anomalies are interfering with radar and satellite imagery - and to neutralize any threats that may exist within the anomalies' field of influence.Players control a convoy of vehicles investigating anomalies around sections of a downed alien spacecraft, which are protected by various types of defensive towers that have to be destroyed. Players do not directly control the vehicles in the convoy, rather they set paths for the convoy to follow along city streets, while also dropping power-ups such as decoys or smoke-screens to aid the survival of the convoy. In addition, players can purchase and equip a number of different units with varying offensive and defensive attributes to make up the convoy. In the Windows, Mac, Linux and XBLA versions, players directly control a soldier on foot (dubbed the Commander) whom they use to pick up and drop the power-ups for the convoy. The iOS and Android versions omit the Commander in lieu of the player directly placing power using the touch-based interface. In addition, the iOS and Android versions do not feature the levels set in Tokyo.Pros on PC:+The story is ok+The sound is well+Voice actors sound so niceCons on PC:-The graphics are mediocre-The gameplay is kind of strange and annoying-The AI is stupidPros on Mobile:+The story is good+The gameplay is very good for a mobile game+The sound is great+The graphics are gorgeousCons on Mobile:-You need to pay some money for full version-Bugs-Crashes-The AI is stupidThis game is good if you want tower offense game with aliens and military army, but i recommand to play it on mobile.

Overall Anomaly is good, but not great.Anomaly: Warzone Earth is something like a ""reverse Tower Defense"" game in that you are the invading army destroying the stationary alien towers.  But instead of using sheer numbers of invaders, you use strategy in selecting the path and deploy various diversions so the towers don't hit your few guys.Nice graphics, voices, story, and controls (for the most part). However, I'm not entirely sure why you had to be a character running around at all.  I'd periodically lose my little guy on the screen from all the action and it made moving/scrolling a nuissance at times as my guy would be stuck on the backside of building or something and not moving.  Only in some of the later missions where I had the bomb/airstrike skill would I run ahead of my squad to destroy some particular towers.An entertaining game, but I'm glad it ended when it did.  (6.4 hr campaign)  7 out of 10. "

												This game was a pleasant surprise. Im normally not a person to enjoy Tower defense games for longer than a couple of minutes; but Anomaly: Warzone Earth came with a nice twist: it's actually a Tower ATTACK game! meaning, you are the assaulting team who was to circumvent enemy towers (and destroy them) in order to reach your goals.In the game you can deploy up to 6 units, among an adequate variety of units, each with strengths and weaknesess and tactics on how to best use them. Your own unit (yourself) are the commander and go on foot (so you are not glued to the tracks) and can deploy power-ups for your units (like repairs, smoke screen) or against your enemies (like a decoy or air strike).

 Anomaly: Warzone Earth- Short Review There's nothing really much to say about Anomaly: Warzone Earth, as it has been said by other reviewers. I played this game just enough to see how it looks, how it works and where it goes. Graphics for this kind of game were pretty decent, but the gameplay just wasn't something I could connect with. If you are patient enough, the couple of completed missions seem okey, but then it starts to repeat itself. The new game options and some variety that you get through the progress of your missions didn't really get me a chalange or some better value to keep me playing (or even to complete the game). There's not much of a strategy in this game, only a few options that you have been given to choose from. But with a look from a different corner and from all the positve reviews and comments that this game received, maybe this game just wasn't the type of a strategy that I would really enjoy or try to mastered it. Hippo Turtle said: ""Finishing those artificially difficult missions is not due to skill or through learned strategies, but by saving and repeating the same abilities you have been abusing of throughout the entire campaign. There is no strategy nor skill involved. You simply repeat the same steps over and over, for every mission.""Graphics: 8Gameplay: 6Sound:6Story:6TOTAL SCORE: 6.5Replay value: YES, but only if your will is made of titan.Recommended: Yes, but only at really LOW PRICE or for FREE!.  by Garret A.M.

												I like this game! However, it is not a game for everybody. In the simplest terms, it is indeed a ""Tower Offense"" game. You play the creeps blowing up enemy towers.I played the entire game on medium difficulty, and I'd say it gave me a pretty good challenge. Some battles do last for upwards of an hour. With 15 main missions and a few bonus stages, it will keep you occupied, though having gone through the entire campaign, I feltlike I want more stages.The story starts off okay, but pretty quickly becomes bland, which annoys me because I feel they could have easily made a few changes to make it stand out.One particular fault of the game, and the reason why it's not for everybody, is that your creeps can and will die in seconds (on medium and hard, anyway. I haven't tried casual). Money is a scarce resource, so the best course of action is to reload at the last save if you lose even one guy. And so to save everyone you need to micromanage. A lot. Every second. Quickly.Recommended.			"

												Very nice gameplay. Anomaly: Warzone Earth uses a reverse tower defense formula. The player takes control of a controllable character that can run through the map. The goal is to escort your troops through city streets filled with alien turrets. The player can buy/sell and upgrade the available vehicles (APC, tanks with rocket launchers, shield generators, ...) so they have increased armor, damage output, ... etc. The player can also repair vehicles, deploy smokescreens and create decoys to get your troops safe from point A to B. While escorting the player also has to change routes of the vehicles so they take the path with the least resistance etc. Very nice and fun gameplay. Definitely worth buying. ;)			"

												TLDR: Anomaly Warzone Earth is a “reverse tower defense” game where you control a convoy trying to get through the mazes of enemy tower placements in an urban setting. Mix up your unit loadout and upgrade your units on the fly as you run alongside them using “special powers.”According to the game’s opening cinematic, in the not too distant future a bunch of mysterious objects fall from the sky, and end up encasing themselves is massive domes that the military call anomalies. You play a military commander tasked with infiltrating the anomalies and eliminating the alien menace inside. The game’s single player campaign has 14 discrete levels, where you control not only the commander on the field, but the convoy of vehicles which you need to guide through the level. It’s your choice whether to avoid or engage the alien towers that are set up all over the maps by manipulating the routes they take, similar to switching train tracks on railroads. Generally you should choose to find and destroy them since you earn money with which to upgrade or purchase more units. You get access to about half a dozen different unit types by the end of the game but it’s likely that you’ll stick to your favorites and just upgrade rather than having a large group of weak units. The vehicles are autonomous, you don’t choose who they fire at, just which direction they take through the cities. The “skill” portion of the game is in how you use your special powers in the field. Your little commander unit doesn’t have guns of his own, but he can “cast spells” such as repair, smoke screen, or decoy that make all the difference when your convoy is under fire. By the last level, you’ll be a spell casting fiend, just firing off your skills left and right as you’re bombarded by an overwhelming number (and variety) of enemy towers. Pros:+The game’s story is engaging and frames each level so you don’t just have 14 maps to play, you’re actually advancing the story, exploring the anomalies and the aliens’ plans.+The variety of units you can use and enemy towers is surprisingly complex. Some of the enemy towers are a major pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ like the one that absorbs energy if you use a special power within its line of sight. Cons:-The game is quite difficult at times, despite the “casual” difficulty setting. I tried replaying the game recently after about a year, just to experience the story again… and I couldn’t finish it again. It was fun the first playthrough, but the replayability value of the game just isn’t that high. Overall, the game is enjoyable and challenging, and the download size is under a gigabyte so go ahead and give it a try. I ended up not playing the different game modes though, like survival and mayhem. I guess I was just burnt out by the end.  "

												A reverse tower defence game with good voice acting, decent graphics and mostly simple controls. But with one or two missing features: an upgrade for the crawlers that increases the range and a shield that repairs the units also, both could serve the point of the game quite well.  It offers only 14 missions in the story, quite short from my point of view but the story is decent. Also it makes sense, even if it's a short one :P			"

												Anomaly is a tower offence game, which is a nice twist on the tower defence genre. The different types of friendly units, special powers and enemy turrets combine to give some nice tactical depth, and the action can get really intense. The main campaign, which has a fairly decent story and good quality voice acting, lasts around 7 hours. There are also some extra challenge modes and leaderboards to increase replayability. The graphics and music are good compared to other indie games. Don't worry if the Steam store screenshots look cluttered and confusing - when the game is in action, its easy to understand what is happening. Overall, considering the low purchase price, this is great value for money.			"

												Anomaly: Warzone Earth is a top-down Tower Offense (reverse tower defense?) game where you control a series of units as they navigate mazes of enemy towers, taking out those towers and trying to make it to some objectives. To assist in accomplishing this, you're given a series of powers (repair, mask your units' visibility, calling in air strikes, etc) with limited uses, as well as funds to buy/upgrade your units.This was my first experience with this sort of game and I found it to be very fun - the variety of enemy towers and layout of levels provided a continually varied experience, and I was more than satisfied to run through the game. On each level you're judged on a few metrics (towers destroyed, units lost, and time) which allows for a certain amount of replayability to get different medals. Overall, it's a good bit of fun, and worth a look.			"

												The game impressed me, I loved the soundtrack. The opening intro video made me curious to play the game and see what was going on.I always liked Tower Defenses, but this one as a story within, beautiful graphics and some nice animations.You are not defending, you are attaking. You can choose your paths and change whenever you want, to make strategic plans yourself. Your skills will help you survive and the ability to change the speed of the troops is veryuseful at some points.The voice acting makes the game enjoyable and I really hope that the sequel implements a multiplayer feature.So if you love Tower Defense, in the attacking side and love a ""Aliens Invade the modern Earth"" story (like Falling Skies or even War of the Worlds) then I would definitely recommend you to try this game.The only I would add or change in this game is the mouse pointer, which sometimes makes me confused when there's a lot of action going on. I can't seem to see where is it and sometimes I have to make the character move to realize where is the mouse pointer.Other than the mouse problem:9/10			"

												Firstly, I would like to mention that I personally enjoy the Anomaly Series and I would definitely recommend it to my friends. Anomaly: Warzone Earth is a Tower Offence game, instead of the traditional Tower Defence games. This makes the Anomaly Franchise stand out of other games. After getting all the games from the Anomaly Franchise, I do still feel that Anomaly: Warzone Earth has by far been the best Tower Offence game I’ve come across and is the first and only game in this series which lives up to the name of the Anomaly Franchise. For those who are intending of getting the game, I would like to say that I do still feel that it is worth getting the game despite the game being out for a few years now.  As for those who are intending of getting the entire Anomaly Series or some of the other games from the Anomaly Series, I would not recommend doing so as I personally don’t feel that the sequels of this game is worth the money getting. That is unless you are a hard-core fan of the Anomaly Series, you have extra cash to spend on, or you like Tower Offence games and just want to continue playing Tower Offence games even after you had finished Anomaly: Warzone Earth.

Definetly worth trying.			"

												Anomaly takes a different approach on the tower defense genre, swapping the roles so the player is the attacking party and the CPU controls the towers. The game is well-balanced and can be very challeging from beginning to end so you need to plan your strategy carefully using the various units and abilities at your disposal. It's a solid and fun experience, great game!			"

												8/10Turret attack is a comparatively rare genre. Turret attack done well is even more so. Anomaly manages to pull it off with style and flair, from the balance of units and enemies to the presentation. The action is solid, the interface is intuitive and yet still effective, and there is just enough character to make you care for this rag-tag team without having too many cutscenes interfering with the flow of the game  (although as a minor niggle It's a bit like Spinal Tap where the accents are convincing enough but I don't quite buy the ""Englishness"" of the script)All in all a sound beginning to a solid series. Possibly even worth full price, but hey, this is Steam so who actually ever pays full price?			"

												Feel what it's like to be a rushing mob in tower-defense games! :DUpdate:Bought this game long ago but managed to play it only now. Sadly, I have to admit that another great idea was almost completely wasted by lame developers. In a game where every second counts you can actually lose because of... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera control and stupidly slow ability menu. And on the top of that you can't even save properly - only by checkpoints, which sometimes are placed without any thought given to it. But when you finally manage to overcome all those fails and start having fun, the game just crashes, making you repeat all that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t again and again. What a joke of a game. If you value your time and nerves - DON'T EVER BUY THIS.			"

												A very refreshing take on the tower defense series. The graphics are really good, and the music is pretty driving as well. The voice acting is good as well, other than the HORRIBLE fake Japanese accents. How hard is it to find someone with an actual Japanese accent?Superficial stuff aside, the gameplay is really solid. It's a blast having to manage your team, forming a good balance between offense and defense, planning your route strategically, all while using your commander to jump into the fray to heal units or call in strikes without getting him killed. It's really a welcome layer of strategy on top of the (what I consider to be) tedious tower defense genre.What didn't work so much for me was how the game seems to demand perfection. Granted, that's pretty much the tower defense genre anyway, but I was hoping this game would take a step backwards in that regard. If you lose even one of your units, not only will you most likely not have the resources needed to replace it, but you will be facing a DRASTICALLY harder battle. Borderline impossible, on any difficulty other than casual.Unfortunately, that means you will be doomed to replay the same mission over and over until you find the perfect formula for success. I am not a fan of games that devolve that way, but I genuinely enjoyed this one. I didn't play any of the extra modes though, as I was mostly done with it by the time I replayed the final mission for the 2-dozenth time.My suggestion is to give a rating to the tower defense genre as a whole on a scale of 1-100 and add 20 points to it. If you like/love tower defense games, you will enjoy this. If you are meh about them, you will still probably enjoy this. If you have never found a tower defense game that you really liked, then only pick this up in a massive sale.			"

												I'm sure most of you guys are familiar with the term 'tower defense'. It's a game where you build and upgrade towers to defeat waves of enemies and, later on, bosses trying to destroy your [insert something random here like a base or village]. If you've seen one of them you've seen pretty much all of them. Not this one though. This one is different. It's a reverse-tower defense title, meaning you have to run with an actual character and guide your tanks across a city. Along the way alien towers spawn on the sides of the road and it's up to you to change your formation, help them out yourself with dropping small nukes and smoke bombs and create a safe path using a virtual map of the city. It's actually quite refreshing and I suggest to anyone who loves TD games (like I do) to buy and try.[Rating: 85/100]			"

												Top-down command of up to 6 units and setting their roadpath along the map, strategically evading sudden mishaps, enemy towers, collect alien substance and complete objectives. Using your commander you have to use given toolkits to either repair and shield your units from enemy towers attacks when needed. The story seems rather uncompeling - some aliens came to Earth and you have to check the anomaly they created and shut it down. Although the concept looks good, it is poorly executed. Personally I can imagine seing some RPG elements implemented between choosing missions, like experience points or star system like in Kingdom Rush, to push the player to try do the given mission better or harder. Leaderboards are not the way to do this.The player is also throughoutly fed military jargon, but in such manner that it feels it tries so hard to sound good but fails. I would advise to get a real soldiers from warzone and talk to them when creating similar game to create a good feel that you care about the situation.			"

												This game really doesn't appeal to me. You plan a route that your vehicles go through, and you tactically use your items/powerups. It's pretty boring most of the time as you're just standing there watching. There's some level of strategy involved, but not enough that it's actually challenging/rewarding. Maybe in the harder levels, but I'm not willing to play that much if it means wading through a few hours of boring gameplay in the beginning.			"

												Anomaly is a take on the Tower Defense games that seemed to have vanished over the years but are making their return on mobile devices. Though with Anomaly, the entire process is in reverse. Now you play as the attacking forces fighting through the enemies towers to complete the mission. The story here is nothing to brag about which is fine since you're not playing a Tower Defense for a story, right? To sum it up, alien machines invade and set up shop in Baghad along with Toyoko. You're 14th Battalion a bunch of british accented grunts about to go through hell and back. It's a simple game that anyone can hop into assuming you know the basics of tactics and how tower defense works. The game is also great for gamers who want to play a challenging but easy to use game as the entire game can be played with only the mouse. Leaving one hand open for a cold beer. A solid tower defense with clear signs that the developers are fans of the genre as well. 5/5 ""It's ok"" -IGN			"

												A tower offence game where you lead a small group of tanks them around a tower filled map. Unlike the mobile campaign, you actually get to run around as the commander, the main interactions you have are: 1)	Buying and upgrading tanks. The main choices being heavy armour, high firepower or support (like a shield tank). Upgrading is very simple with no branching upgrade paths. 2)	Choosing which way your tanks navigate around the map, to either avoid clusters of towers or to go after the currency to buy more tanks. 3)	Deploying power ups. These are plentiful and the main way of keeping your tanks alive, by repairing them, deploying smoke or decoys to divert the attention of the towers. Other than some poor voice acting, the game is well presented. It’s not the most in depth game, but it’s easy to get into repetitive (almost the opposite of Gratuitous Tank Battles, another take on tower offence). Overall the concept it interesting enough to just about last the length of the fairly short campaign. "

												It's 1997 and Blast Corps might as well be glued into your Nintendo 64 because you'll be damned if anyone is taking that small slice of heaven away from you. Using MASSIVE ROBOTS that you could pretend were Transformers, you must destroy pitiful man-made things such as cities and historical monuments to make way for a slowly trundling truck with an unstable thermo-nuclear missile on the back. It was great, maybe even (dare I say it), amazing fun the kind of which has lay unrivalled until the present day.Now take us to 2011, there's still trucks driving around carrying weapons of mass destruction, but now instead of clearing a path for them, you are building one. Fancy that! Building a road! Now you might stop me to say that ""I don't play games to build roads..."" and well sir/madam, you'd be damn right! This game is banal, it is drudgery, it is the type of sinful spectacle that if I heard the siren call of it's music through your window as I turned up at your house for a potluck buffet I would throw my dish to the floor, brushing past your opened armed greeting to run to your parlour, set on stomping the silicon from your motherboard and punching your monitor till the LCD bleeds.We would then celebrate it's destruction over delicious spicy eritrean stew and my injera that you so thoughtfully rescued from the floor.

This game is pretty intense and every second matters. The game has multiple difficulty settings that fit all levels of player experience. Only complaint is they could have added more save points to make the game a little less frusterating but overall it's still a good and fun game.Bonus: This game is also available for Android and iOS but you will have to pay for it a second time.

												I got really excited when I frist heard about this ""reverse tower defense"" or ""tower offense"" game. I played the first few levels and then it took me YEARS between then and ever feeling motivated to play the game again. I finally did and finished it and to my surprise it's only a couple hours long. Even doing everything I wanted to (bonus missions, mission-specific achievements, etc.) did not add that much time.But I'm thankful for the short length, because I did not enjoy it.The game's concept is great, but the execution is not good. Despite the fact that the game keeps introducing new enemies and units right up through the last mission - which actually sucked because you never had the full system figured out until the very end - I found myself oscillating between two very undesirable points.The first was more common: most levels were so easy as to be boring, even on higher difficulties. The second was shear frustration: getting stuck. The checkpoint system is totally inconsistent, as in some levels it will repeatedly reward you the same check point an infinite number of times, so that you can just get it as many times as you want, even every 10 seconds. But in other levels you'll go 15 minutes of gameplay without one and then have to reload. Frustraing. Annoying. And because of the set paths and limited resources if you do get a checkpoint late in a hard level where you don't have much money or health or abilities it might actually be impossible to finish the level and you have to restart. Accepting that is a painful process, but in some cases it's the only way forward.So for such a short game with a cool concept I feel like I got disproportionately frustrated and annoyed.The icing on the cake is that the story and the dialogue are abysmal.

												I didn't think I owned this game, but after many emails with Steam Support I can honestly say I do.  In a land of clicking games, this one rises above the chaff.  Pro clicks include making vehicles move, shoot and sometimes heal.  The graphics are amazing on my broken laptop screen, and the music/sound really swelled me up and lifted my spirits when I turned it off.You may hear that this game is boring but let me tell you they are wrong.  I have not experienced pulse pounding action like this since I turned on my computer five minutes ago.  From the first ""level"" (do they still call these levels?) the game grips you with it's high octane mixture of vehicles moving, and you pointing at things to kill/heal.  I lost 6 pounds playing this game due to the anxiety and sweat that filled my being.  I'm better now, so I can come back and tell you about this amazing game.  Buy it now.  If you have bought it, buy it again and eat the second version.  Hearily recommended if you like listening to gamespot or ign about anything.			"

												A reverse tower defense game. Your goal is to navigate a convoy of vehicles which help you fight off enemy turrets. You're also given abilities to defend and attack. Not especially memorable, but still a decent game.7/10			"

												I can now see why it's called Anomaly: Warzone Earth (AWE), because it's such a terrible and boring game that is very hard to even understand and is meaningless to play. I only recommend this for players who like to waste their time and money playing boring games.			"

												Nice twist on the typical tower defense game where the AI controls the towers. Aliens have invaded and your job, as an army commander, is to lead your troops to destroy the alien's towers. Along the way you rescue people, unlock new weapons and upgrade your troops. There is so much to do in this game after the main storyline. Definitely a must buy.			"

												Wow! This is a great game. And this time I really didn't know what to expect at all from the game when I bought it. I just found the artstyle so appealing. I thought this would be another modern RTS game, this time with really stylish graphics that I'd enjoy to look at but never really gonna like to play ... but man was I wrong ...At it's core Anomaly is a Tower Defense game. Only this time you're not playing the defending but the offending forces. So this time around you are playing a commander of a motorised squad that will attack the towers but can't be controlled directly by you. You can offcourse set the routes for your squad and you have some special abilities like repairing, laying smoke curtains to hide or placing decoys to protect your units and so on.The style of the graphics, the sound, the music, the voice overs event the menus ... everything is blended perfectly alltogether to give a pretty unique gameplay experience of a sort I personally haven't encountered before.This game sucks you right in from the first minute because of its very unique style and easy accessibility featuring perfect XBox 360 controller support. Even the story is nicely spread out through the campaign. On top of that it seems to feature a good portion of replayability by offering a ton of missions: First there is the story mode, then there are two campaigns based on locations from the story mode and after that you can still play on in some bonus missions with extra difficulty and slight twitches to the original gameplay mechanics.I liked very much what I've seen unti now and I can wholeheartedly recommend you to buy this game, exspecially when it's on sale. But I must say (and I don't say this often) this game is even worth it's full price. So go on and get it if you're in for some thrilling action strategy sort of game you haven't seen anywhere else before.@ngel			"

Billed as one of the first entries in the 'Tower Offense' genre.  Players take control of a commander on the ground guiding vehicles through twists and destroying enemy structures along the way.As much as a puzzle game as it is a strategy game the hybrid combination created a overall enjoyable a fulfilling experience.  The only negatives worth mentioning is that the units and especially their upgrades are rather bland.			"

												Especially with the great sale going on right about now, I certainly recommend people buy this game. Now, I will grant that it isn't perfect: it's long-lasting value is questionable, it's plot/storyline is not necessarily flourishing with detail and impact (I think), and the voiceacting I simply can't help but smirk at. But, this game definitely gets great points from me for innovation, presenting a new take on strategy and an innovative application of the tried tower defense genre. As the game progresses—at least in my case—you get the feeling that you've totally got this, but new features, units, and adversaries are constantly added and you are constantly expected to rethink your tactics to combat a threat that becomes less and less predictable and linear. Anomaly starts out simple, but eventually your ability to strategize is truly put to the test as more complicated battlefields filled with convoluted arrays of kinetic and non-kinetic threats appear.On the practical side, this is a ""tower attack"" game (you play the role of a commander leading your squad of units through turret-infested landscapes), but with many innovative nuance, such as abilities that can buff your units or detriment your adversaries, the ability to purchase and upgrade your units to create a personalized squard as you move through the city blocks, and the opportunity to choose what path you want your units to take, giving you the choice of whether or not you want to try and score some bonus cash that is sitting in a swarm of defenders, or avoid combat as much as you can in order to survive through the finish. Missions are comprehensive and fun to play but are short enough that you can open this game just for a quick round, and its progressing difficulty and story keep it interesting from start to finish.Oh, and let's not forget that this game was produced by a Polish company, and anything coming out of Poland has to be good (absolutely no bias whatsoever in this final statement).

												This game is a fresh take on tower defense: it's tower offense! It's two big flaws though are that the difficulty spikes badly: missions 1-9 = too easy, mission 10 = insanely hard. And timed missions. They are horrible, as they are in most games. Trust me, game developers, nobody wants ♥♥♥♥ing timed missions in games, nobody. They aren't fun, just stressful.I didn't plan on buying Anomaly 2, but I bought the sequel anyway because I stupidly based my purchase on a hope and prayer that they would remove timed missions and fix the difficulty spike. I am sure that neither of those things will happen, so it's basically yet again a waste of $15 on Steam because I have a Steam buying addiction.			"

			So, this game has a unique premise! I like the idea of being able to be on the other side of the tower wall for once. Sadly... I'm not really into the play style that much.		

So, this game has a unique premise! I like the idea of being able to be on the other side of the tower wall for once. Sadly... I'm not really into the play style that much. It's not bad, it's just not what I\ thought it would beo. I was hoping for something like the old WarCraft 3 custom map, Stronghold v3.4 (which most of you probably haven't played). This, of course is completely different. It's a good time waster, something to do when you have nothing else to do. Or maybe, this looks like something you can't wait to play! Either way, if it looks interesting to you, I'd recommend you check it out.			"

												Anomaly: Warzone Earth Review - Raymond KTI don’t understand why all of these games I review and dislike seem to get huge ratings from big time companies like IGN and PC Gamer yet I never even heard of the darn thing. This is what you get when you reverse the roles in a tower defense game. Unfortunately, this turns it into a baby sitting simulator as you follow around a caravan healing it or covering it with aoe heal packets or smoke bombs respectively. The game is slow, offers no engaging gameplay, and the plot appears to be ripped out of a Command and Conquer game, then watered down to avoid copyright infringement. Overall, I really didn’t like this game. Not unique at all just watered down			"

												Anomaly is a reverse tower defense game. Meaning, you play the units, not the towers. At first, I was a little skeptical. Towers are fun right? Well, apparently so are units, because this game is great. For $10, it has amazing production values and graphics. The single player campaign will last you somewhere in the range of 5-7 hours, and there is loads of replay. From achievements, to medals, to additional game modes. All in all, Anomaly is a fantastic game for this or any price.			"

												This game is billed as a reverse tower defense game.  Unfortunately you get a handful of units against dozens of towers.  (Just a few at first then it increases each level)  You have to send your handful of units out on a designated path and you run around with a little guy who buffs or debuffs.  That's the entire game.  It's really just a babysitting game where you MUST debuff/buff at exactly the right place and moment.  There is room for error at first but by the later levels there is very little, if any.  I would have enjoyed being able to build creeps, making it more of an RTS game, which is what I was expecting.  In the end I found it irritating that I would cast my buffs at slightly the wrong location and my front units would walk out of the buff and get destroyed forcing me to try the level again.  Replay was expected in this game though, there isn't enough content to justify no repetition play.  It has cool ideas, like, having a buff unit that can run off road (anywhere really).  It isn't a bad game, just not good in my opinion.			"

												A brilliant take on the reverse tower defense, this game is well worth its $10 price tag. The story keeps you engaged and halfway through you still dont know what the Anomaly is. It helps that the Commander (controlled by YOU) doesn't have any weapons to defend himself. Which prevents you from going Rambo and leaving your convoy behind. However you do get useful abilites that will help your men to reach safely to the end zone. All this means you stay close to your team and provide and direct support as a real team leader would.You aren't confined to a single path and can change your route midway through the game. Even as new obstacles pop up it's still in your hands whether you want to brave it and push through, or find an alternate route. However, a few levels do force you to take a certain path for small sections.The enemy towers while challenging haven't got much variety and you learn how to deal with them easily. However the real challenge comes in what direction you need to attack them from. What might seem like the easiest or the shortest path might also be the hardest.Overall a 7/10  Would be great if there were more special abilities or enemy tower types			"

												A very addictive strategy-tower OFFENSE game, it's short but with a lot of replayability and a few game modes. The visuals and effects are fantastic and gameplay very easy to pick up. You command a line of vehicle units along a path you manipulate through a maze of enemy towers with varying abilities. Could be a bit longer, and occasionally difficult, there are a variety of difficulty settings to get through and enjoy it for any skill level. 9/10			"

												Speaking as someone who's never cared for any tower defense game, this particular tower *offense* game enthralled me completely. It's fun and fast and challenging, it affords you tactical decisions, it has good graphics, sound effects and voice acting, and it never overstays its welcome. Would that more games were as lean and focused as Anomaly.			"

												Great game that's very well executed. Difficulty settings seem to be accurate to their naming - the Normal difficulty can actually get satifiably challenging. The mechanics run great, and the concept of reverse Tower Defense is simply awesome. Definitely a solid 8-8.5 from my more objective standpoint, but I'd personally give it as high as a 9 just because I'm a big fan of TD and like where this is taking it.			"

												Interesting gameplay, but good lord the dialogue.  The single most offensive portrayal of British and Japanese people I have ever seen.  If anyone of remotely African descent appeared in this game, the writers would have insisted on their need to speak of themselves as 'mutha♥♥♥♥as' and their immense desire to consume watermelons and fried chicken.It is that stereotypical, racist and unimaginitive with its characterizations.Wouldn't be as big a deal if unit responses and the single player narrative didn't make up most of the game.

												If you have ever played a TD (Tower Defence) game and enjoyed it then you might actually like this game. In this game your roles are reversed and instead of building towers to keep those pesky creeps from getting to their goal and getting their hands on your goodies YOU now are the pesky creep that must make it to your said goal.The game is fun and in your case you wont be rushing through a line of towers and be shot at... well, not if you can help it. You get to chose your own pathing and upgrade your creeps to withstand heavy fire and when that is not enough you can even HEAL your units. I hope you will enjoy playing this game as much as I did.

												I traded for this game when it was being offered for free, and I was happy with the deal.If you like tower defense games, especially reverse TD, then you will really like this game.I've played TD-games since I was a child, and Anomaly plays as a reverse TD, where you must keep your army alive while they navigate past enemy towers on their way to the end checkpoint.The aesthetics are very nice, the weapon effects are nice done well. The sound and music is decent. The tutorial is not too long and helpful in ensuring that you understand how to play the game. The controls are very simple and the learning curve is minimal. The main mechanic you will be using is to go into the map screen and select which routes you want your army to take - you can order them to continue around in a circle to destroy the stronger towers, or skip them altogether.Your army arrangement will be important, as the enemy towers follow a ""fire on first enemy you see"" targeting pattern. Typical strategy is to deploy your APC (tankier unit) first to soak up the damage. Be warned, that enemy towers may also attack the last unit in your convoy if you haven't destroyed the tower on your way past it. You act as the convoy general and have 4 skills that you unlock as you progress through the game. For example, you can heal your units, set up a smoke screen, or place a decoy to divert enemy fire. You will have plenty of these as you destroy towers because allied planes will drop many pickups for you. Units are upgradable, and you unlock more the further you progress through the story. Admittedly, I did not care so much for the story - it's interesting but not quite enough to keep me deeply engaged..A very fun reverse TD game, give it a try if you are interested.Recommend.			"

												What is the opposite of Tower Defense? Tower Attack? Whatever the word is, this game is the reference. The foul enemy spawns towers and you wipe them out by clever manouvers, tactical use of power-ups and superior firepower. This ""you"" is a non-fighting commander unit and a small treck of various tanks that can be rearranged, upgraded and repaired as you go. Gameplay happens on a tactical map where you set and change the route, and in realtime while you treck toils through that route. I only played on easy/casual so far and found enough of a challenge. Very clever enemy design, starts really simple and improves greatly along the road.Entertaining and well-balanced game, and a great way to spend a controlled amount of time.			"

												Really pleased with the reverse tower defence concept. Game itself is quite challenging on advanced difficulty levels and will make you carefully plan your route and spare every ability you can afford to. Also, there are a couple of bonus scenarios that will prove a real test to your skill, if the main campaign isnt enough. Collecting medals itself is enough to go for if u ever want to start the game over again.Only major flaw this game has is poor diversity of abilities you can deploy on battlefield; it gets a bit repetitive over time.

												A great take on the tower defence games, more like a tower assualt, taking on the roll of the ""monsters"" rather than setting up the towers.  You take control of a futuristic convoy of militry vehicles destroying the enemy defences along the way, and repairing your own vehicles after the battles.  You choose the path of the convoy on the go, re-acting to the events on the battlefield.Really fun and interesting, I would give it an 8/10.			"

												A brilliant spin on the tower defense genre. The first tower OFFENSE game I've seen, you control a set of units and can set and adjust their path through a city street grid. Goals change from level to level, but for the most part you have to take out the towers or certain key structures. Picking units and the order in which they parade through the gauntlet is critical. Time is sometimes the enemy, and the route planning screen will read out the ETA for each point on your path. You are also in control of an avatar that can deploy AOE abilities like healing, smokescreens and tactical strikes. Don't be thrown off because of the generic sounding name, this is a special game and should not be missed. A long campaign and several challenge modes with a few map variances should give you plenty to do in this unique strategy game. (also on iOS)			"

												Plus: Well thought out and implemented reverse TD game. Decent graphics, fast paced strategy, and intriguing storyline.Minus: Its setup as a strategy game, but there are times that the strategy will have to change and you already have a vehicle build setup for your previous strat.

												This is a decent piece of Tower Defence fare that becomes surprisingly entertaining the more you play it. The story is nothing we've seen before, and the gameplay feels like you're a traffic cop directing cars at rush hour. The result is a slow burning reverse tower defense experience that falls short of expectations. The visuals are impressive, and it's quite satisfying to finish each of the campaign's levels, but you never quite feel too satisfied. It has a distinct tendency to make you crave playing other games like Starcraft or any number of actual tower defense titles.			"

												It's a tower defence game with a twist, which is that you are the convoy going against the towers. The gameplay is fairly simple and yet it retains enough compelling strategy to be worth playing. You basically have to plot a route that is most survivable, while gathering most resources. You have control over a commander, who can move anywhere on the battlefield and he is your only means of interaction, enabling you to boost the health of your convoy whilst dropping smoke and calling in air strikes. There are also vehicle upgrades to earn. The convoy appears to move slowly, but you are constantly being set goals and needing to take your eye off it in order to send your commander off on his own. Extra challenging elements are thrown in, such as airborn friendlies plotting their own course across the map.Graphically and sonically, the game is really quite impressive. Overall it isn't the most amazing game you'll ever play, but it succeeds in being fun and providing a good mix of strategic forward planning with realtime action. The main source of irritation I have found is that there is no save game feature; only a checkpoint system. There's no way to rewind back past the most recent checkpoint. Occasionally, the game surprises you with something you couldn't anticipate and you realise that your strategy up to that point won't enable you to finish the level, which means you have to start again from the very beginning.

												It's not a bad game. It's basically inverted tower defence.  Instead of playing the towers, you play the little creeps (tanks and whatnot) destroying the towers. You get to upgrade your vehicles, add more firepower and provide assist through your ""suit"", which includes repair, smokescreens and other devices.My only complaint is the difficulty quickly escalates near the end, making it quite hard to finish. Otherwise, it's quite fun :3			"

												Don't let the ""Reverse Tower Defense"" description scare you off.   It's a great Tactical Strategy game.  I was very sceptical at first but I rolled the dice.   I enjoyed it so much I played the story mode straight through to the end.  Took about 8-9 hours on Advanced.  For the price of a Movie ticket I got my money's worth.  Now to comeback at some point and try it on Impossible.			"

												This is basicly a reversed tower defense game. Instead of the defender, you're the attacker. You're guiding a number of vehicles through the levels via pre-defined paths. You can upgrade your vehicles, deploy decoys and choose optimal paths to defeat the defending towers. The graphics are nice, the game runs smooth and the later levels are quite challanging!			"

												So far so good - the tower assault game is a refresher to the tower defense games we're seeing everywhere on App Store and Android Market. Whilst the hero has a very annyoying accent, the gameplay is generally fun - decide the path, decide the formation and decide the unit composition, then throw down power-ups to keep your units alive as they make it to their destination. Kept me entertained a little, high polish and low cost = good value. 7/10			"

												I have really good time playing Tower Defense games. I always thought about WHAT IF somebody would make a game where you switch sides and you are not the one defending, but attacking... And there it was. Some not popular flash game, which I sadly don't remember how it was called. It was simply - you were the one attacking (sending some bugs) and enemy was building tower. Oh boy, it sure was great game. And so somehow we got another game reversed Tower Defense game - Anomaly: Warzone Earth. To be honest I have the most fun playing simply Tower Defense formula game - building towers, killing over9000 enemies and upgrading stuff. There was already one example of unusual TD game which I loved - Sanctum. So, how is Anomaly: Warzone Earth? I can say for sure it's a must play for everyone who loves TD games. Starts rather easy, and end up quickly. If you will want to unlock everything (achievements) then it's quite a challenge, but that's all. It looks fine and sounds fine too. I'm not sure how are other Anomaly games but I can be sure of one thing - it started really well and if other games aren't worse than this one - then it's good. I enjoyed it and gladly will play sequels. If you love TD games, and enjoy experiment stuff about this genre, don't hesitate and play it.			"

												This is something special, something unique, something you most likely haven't heard of before. Everyone knows what tower defense is, right? But does everyone know what tower attack is? No? Thought so.Although it may sound like some browser game, it of course isn't. I mean, if you look at the graphics already... Well, they're amazing. The gameplay itself is fun and you'll have multiple routes available on each mission. You choose the one you want to take. Some are easier, some are more rewarding. Some result in easy victory, others result in brutal destruction of some of your units, unless you manage to keep 'em alive with your special abilities. All of it is quite fun, even failiures.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												I really enjoyed this reverse idea of a tower defense.  Basically you control the tanks that enter the map to attach the towers.  You tell them to turn at intersections to turn and give the tanks power ups so they can navigate and destroy the towers towards the goal.  The game is fast pace but not overly difficult.  There is about 14 missions in story mode that took roughly 4-5 hours.You control a guy on the battle field that can run around and  deploy power ups and pick them up.  You can also somewhat distract guns and drop air strikes.I would really recommend this game to those that enjoy tower defense style games, but want to experience it from the other side of the battlefield.

												The tower defense space is fairly crowded at this point, so another low-priced  indie title might not find the spotlight that it deserves, but this game changes the standard tower defense model: sending you in reverse (you're now the runners), granting abilities, and tasking you with planning your troops routes and vehicles. I always thought it might be interesting to play a TD game from the other vantage point and this one definitely lives up to my  expectations. Well worth any Steam sale price.			"

There may not be enough action for hardcore action fans, or enough hardcore strategy for strategy fands, but it's definitely worth a look, even if it's just for observing the mechanics.			"

It requires both strategic thinking (planning the road for our units) and tactical acting (repairing damaged units and protecting them from enemy fire - sometimes you need to act very fast!). It also has quite nice soundtrack and a plot (!) which isn't common in this type of games.Definietly worth playing!8/10			"

												Very interesting concept with the whole reverse tower defense thing. Normally I don't like tower defence games but actually found myself enjoying this one quite a bit. You really need to be on your toes with this one and it's interesting making tactical decisions for your unit rather than doing the shooting yourself, quite immersive in that sense.Very good production values and loved the voice acting on it!

												A fun play through. I remember I was really into this when it came out. I went back to play through the extra modes and missions only to remember that they were really obnoxious and unnecessary. The Baghdad Mayhem is 18 waves, each lasting about 4 - 5 minutes. It gets progressively more difficult, but the hour and a half you will need to beat it is outweighed by its repetitiveness. At that point I tried the Tokyo Raid and quickly realized I didn't want to play anymore.Overall, the story mode is great. The extras are useless and not worth your time. Is it a prerequisite for all games these days to have time-sucking hardcore extras that add nothing to the experience? I feel bad for developers because either they think it's a really cool idea or just believe those extras have to be there. I usually prefer quality over quantity, but I guess it's easier to pump out some extra junk, call your $10 game a 40 hour experience then forget about it.But really, the story mode is awesome. Buy this game.			"

												A brilliant take on the reverse tower defense, this game is well worth its $10 price tag. The story keeps you engaged and halfway through you still dont know what the Anomaly is. It helps that the Commander (controlled by YOU) doesn't have any weapons to defend himself. Which prevents you from going Rambo and leaving your convoy behind. However you do get useful abilites that will help your men to reach safely to the end zone. All this means you stay close to your team and provide and direct support as a real team leader would.You aren't confined to a single path and can change your route midway through the game. Even as new obstacles pop up it's still in your hands whether you want to brave it and push through, or find an alternate route. However, a few levels do force you to take a certain path for small sections.The enemy towers while challenging haven't got much variety and you learn how to deal with them easily. However the real challenge comes in what direction you need to attack them from. What might seem like the easiest or the shortest path might also be the hardest.Overall a 7/10  Would be great if there were more special abilities or enemy tower types			"

												Are you a tower-defense geek? Tired of playing the same gameplay? This prompted me to try Anomaly: Warzone Earth, which I'd presonally classify as a tower-offense / RTS.The main story in which aliens invade the middle-east and you've been chosen to check why this happend is quite entertaining, the voiceovers are really good, maybe one or two cutscense would intensify the feeling of the story.You are put in a role of a free walking commando which can buy, upgrade veichles which auto-fire at enemy towers. Since this is not your typical tower-defense game, you do have lanes where you can move (commando can roam a bit more than the units tho), but usually there are few available paths and you can decide which one you and your units will take. This is the RTS part which can be the difference between you being roasted by mega alien blasters or successfully completing a mission.As a command you can use special abilites which can aid to your misson.

												First time I saw this game was on Android, and I totally LOVED it. It's a game genre that I hardly see around, a reverse tower defence where you have to assault something and you are the ""invader"", not the ""defender"". Pretty cool game, nice graphics, sound, the gameplay is very enjoyable. Difficulty is perfectly balanced. The best thing of this game is the fact that it can't just be won by brutally attacking with random units but require a decent tactic, thus making this a fairly decent strategy game. Would totally reccomend it to every fan of strategic games. The game never gets boring, too, because of the different maps, routes and enemies encountered during the gameplay.			"

												Anomaly is a fun and challenging little gem of tower offense. Although lacking a little bit in terms of environment and unit variety, this game requires a lot more than just having the best “set-up”. In addition to the usual ‘deciding which units and where’, you’ll have to plan optimal routes and react accordingly to enemy actions on the fly. If you’re into tower defence, then this is something a little different worth looking into.			"

												The tower-offense idea behind this game alone makes it worth playing if you're a fan of tower-defense games. The graphics are good and the gameplay ideas are unique enough that it stands out.That said, the gameplay still has room for improvement. The biggest frustration I had while playing is how little control you have over your units. Sure, you can adjust their order and their route but that's about it. You can't tell them to stop (or even slow down), the best you can do is have them circle the block. You also can't adjust your unit's targetting priorities which means they always shoot at the nearest tower which frequently gets them killed in later levels.This lack of control makes this a tentative recommendation, it's worth a playthrough but be prepared to be frustrated sometimes with how stupid your units can be. Make sure to pick it up on sale.			"

												Totally awesome game! Gameplay is like a honey, story is really nice, each troop is diferent and the player has a lot of to do inside the heart of Anomaly! Campaign is qquite short, buy I passed it a couple of time on higher difficulty. Good graphics and sounds. One of the best tactics indie game ever.			"

												Okay, so, personally I am not an RTS game fan in the slightest as most of the time, they're too slowly paced for my liking, I however really wanted to give this one a go. This game I honestly have to say stands out for any other RTS I have ever played, unlike most where you are generally restricted to moving a group of units to either defend, capture or attack and that being pretty much it, this offers something new as the story-line pulls your character into investigating the unknown alien remnant's that landed on Earth.What I like the most is the free-roam movement of your character, running around collecting drop's and setting them down ahead, as long as you don't stray too far from your platoon to keep them defended and repaired.It manages to keep your interest from the get go, intertwining an interesting story-line that doesn't disappoint and where a lot of RTS games fail in my opinion is not keeping up a story or having one at all making it pretty redundant and repetitive, whereas this gives you a wider variety of stages, story, character development and with it keeping you on your toes, it doesn't really give you a chance to not be watching the battlefield as it could cost you. It keeps you having to constantly think ahead and plan the best path possible to victory.If you're an avid RTS player and haven't tried this one yet, I would defiantly suggest it and even recommend it to non-RTS game players as it offers something different.

												Un tower attack étonnamment immersif malgré la vue globale du champ de bataille. Le scénario ne casse pas des briques (le jeu pourrait être adapté au cinéma sous le nom de ""les américains chassent les martiens"") mais la durée de vie de ce jeu, qui est à l'origine une app, et ses graphismes soignés compensent largement cette faiblesse. Ajoutez à cela une bonne dose de difficulté et vous avez un titre indé' qui vaut le détour.			"

												It's a tower defence game with a twist, which is that you are the convoy going against the towers. The gameplay is fairly simple and yet it retains enough compelling strategy to be worth playing. You basically have to plot a route that is most survivable, while gathering most resources. You have control over a commander, who can move anywhere on the battlefield and he is your only means of interaction, enabling you to boost the health of your convoy whilst dropping smoke and calling in air strikes. There are also vehicle upgrades to earn. The convoy appears to move slowly, but you are constantly being set goals and needing to take your eye off it in order to send your commander off on his own. Extra challenging elements are thrown in, such as airborn friendlies plotting their own course across the map.Graphically and sonically, the game is really quite impressive. Overall it isn't the most amazing game you'll ever play, but it succeeds in being fun and providing a good mix of strategic forward planning with realtime action. The main source of irritation I have found is that there is no save game feature; only a checkpoint system. There's no way to rewind back past the most recent checkpoint. Occasionally, the game surprises you with something you couldn't anticipate and you realise that your strategy up to that point won't enable you to finish the level, which means you have to start again from the very beginning.

												Really pleased with the reverse tower defence concept. Game itself is quite challenging on advanced difficulty levels and will make you carefully plan your route and spare every ability you can afford to. Also, there are a couple of bonus scenarios that will prove a real test to your skill, if the main campaign isnt enough. Collecting medals itself is enough to go for if u ever want to start the game over again.Only major flaw this game has is poor diversity of abilities you can deploy on battlefield; it gets a bit repetitive over time.

												Why play a Tower Defence game, when you can play a Tower ATTACK game?! Anomaly: Warzone Earth truly throws the Tower Defence genre upside-down. The player indirectly controls a wave of units, designating the path and using support abilities to protect the units as they advance. This is an easy game to adapt to and only covers a few basic strategies, but continues to challenge the player as new units, abilities and enemies are introduced throughout the game. The graphical engine is impressive, well polished and looks excellent. This game can be completed in just under 10 hours. Although a high-score system is present throughout the game, the basic mechanics of the game diminish the games replay value. Overall, this is a really impressive indie game to come out of a small Polish development team.			"

												What is the opposite of Tower Defense? Tower Attack? Whatever the word is, this game is the reference. The foul enemy spawns towers and you wipe them out by clever manouvers, tactical use of power-ups and superior firepower. This ""you"" is a non-fighting commander unit and a small treck of various tanks that can be rearranged, upgraded and repaired as you go. Gameplay happens on a tactical map where you set and change the route, and in realtime while you treck toils through that route. I only played on easy/casual so far and found enough of a challenge. Very clever enemy design, starts really simple and improves greatly along the road.Entertaining and well-balanced game, and a great way to spend a controlled amount of time.			"

There's a few more elements to it, and gameplay requires a bit more from you than it does on the mobile version, but it's still a fun game. I'll probably end up finishing it at a later date on my computer. Overall, the game is lots of fun and has a pretty interesting background story/setting.			"

												When I received this game as a gift, not knowing anything about it, I went in thinking it was some sci-fi FPS. After finding out that it wasn't an FPS, and got over my self-inflicted disappointment after playing the first few levels, I truly found myself enjoying the game. The action's rather tense, particularly after facing several attackers on nearly all sides, but it runs quite smoothly on my PC. I have to say, it's a great game, with a great deal of underlying strategy, such as activating several of the abilities in a chain, to keep your team alive.And let's be honest. The bonus mission? The scenario's hilarious, and it gives a new challenge to the game.10/10 will play again (Once I beat the game). :P			"

												This is a decent piece of Tower Defence fare that becomes surprisingly entertaining the more you play it. The story is nothing we've seen before, and the gameplay feels like you're a traffic cop directing cars at rush hour. The result is a slow burning reverse tower defense experience that falls short of expectations. The visuals are impressive, and it's quite satisfying to finish each of the campaign's levels, but you never quite feel too satisfied. It has a distinct tendency to make you crave playing other games like Starcraft or any number of actual tower defense titles.			"

												To start, let me say that I love Tower Defense games. Orcs Must Die!, Sanctum, Dungeon Defenders, I love this genre because it's all about controling the flow of the enemy hordes; making them go in one direction versus another, leading them into a well armed trap and shooting them dead. While to some that may seem like it would kill replay value once you know the ""optimal"" placements, in most games it doesn't because there is always more than one effective way to work the map.This game takes Tower Defense and does a 180. You don't control the towers, the towers are the enemy. Instead of planning out how to lay traps, where to place key damage towers and how to funnel enemies towards the kill zone you're tasked with navagating a convoy through a map with multiple path options, strewn with enemy towers intent on killing you. Welcome to Tower Offense.Aside from the convoy's attack power (which you can upgrade with enough money, or replace lost units), you've got special powers that let you repair units, lay down a smoke screen, drop decoys and so one. Each uses a unique 'charge' so you'll be running all over the map going between using the abilites and picking up drops so you don't run out. Here the camera is what all TD players are used to; top-down isometric. But it's locked at a specific zoom level and can't be zoomed in (not sure why you'd want to, but it needed to be mentioned) and zooming out opens the tactical route map which lets you see where all currently visible enemy towers are on the map (some will pop up as part of the story and won't be visible until then) and plan your convoy's route, letting you change it on the fly in case something happens to block your current route.It's a fun game, and a break from the typical TD mindset without needing to add in in FPS elements like the Sanctum series (another fine series of games, BTW) or Orcs Must Die! (which has some RPG elements to it and in 3rd-Person). One key aspect of this game is that it can basically be played using just the mouse, because by default almost all commands are already assigned to Mouse 1, 2, 3 and the wheel (no shoulder buttons), so it's easy to pick up and play, but mastering what routes to take is where you'll spend a lot of time.

												The game is nice, and it's a fun thing to play when you're bored or waiting for some other game to download or whatever.It's kinda like a tower defense game, except this time it's YOU who is attacking the towers.The storyline is not very well designed and I don't feel like I'm playing a campaign.It does become hard at points, but if you like a challenge you'll like Anomaly: Warzone Earth.

You can upgrade your vehicles, deploy decoys and choose optimal paths to defeat the defending towers. The graphics are nice, the game runs smooth and the later levels are quite challanging!			"

												What is the opposite of Tower Defense? Tower Attack? Whatever the word is, this game is the reference. The foul enemy spawns towers and you wipe them out by clever manouvers, tactical use of power-ups and superior firepower. This ""you"" is a non-fighting commander unit and a small treck of various tanks that can be rearranged, upgraded and repaired as you go. Gameplay happens on a tactical map where you set and change the route, and in realtime while you treck toils through that route. I only played on easy/casual so far and found enough of a challenge. Very clever enemy design, starts really simple and improves greatly along the road.Entertaining and well-balanced game, and a great way to spend a controlled amount of time.			"

												Anomaly is a fun and challenging little gem of tower offense. Although lacking a little bit in terms of environment and unit variety, this game requires a lot more than just having the best “set-up”. In addition to the usual ‘deciding which units and where’, you’ll have to plan optimal routes and react accordingly to enemy actions on the fly. If you’re into tower defence, then this is something a little different worth looking into.			"

												The tower-offense idea behind this game alone makes it worth playing if you're a fan of tower-defense games. The graphics are good and the gameplay ideas are unique enough that it stands out.That said, the gameplay still has room for improvement. The biggest frustration I had while playing is how little control you have over your units. Sure, you can adjust their order and their route but that's about it. You can't tell them to stop (or even slow down), the best you can do is have them circle the block. You also can't adjust your unit's targetting priorities which means they always shoot at the nearest tower which frequently gets them killed in later levels.This lack of control makes this a tentative recommendation, it's worth a playthrough but be prepared to be frustrated sometimes with how stupid your units can be. Make sure to pick it up on sale.			"

												Anomaly: Warzone Earth is a “fateful” reversed tower defense game. Instead of building towers that need to defeat intruders, you get to control a squad of military machines that have to kill the intruder already nesting.While it may seem slow-paced in the beginning, it accelerates to a higher difficulty and more fun. It becomes very challenging, although not frustratingly so.This game shows us that reversed tower defense is equally as fun, if not even more.			"

												Game wasn't bad, but design flaws started coming up later in the game. It is fun how its the reverse of TD, and you can change your route. It would have been nicer if there was more of a variety of units, as things like the tank is just a straight upgrade of the starting APC, and the dragon can attack 2 sides, but does less damage and has much less range than tank and crawler....so seems not as useful. The problem was, design problems keep from the game from being better. The game says you can change and pick your path, but then uses a unit that will kill your entire squad if you go towards it in the path you are guarding. So there may be 4 paths, but because of the unit you can only use 2 paths, which is kind of a lame attempt at pretending you have more options than you actually do. Also, you get multiple different items, which is fun because you can use different things to get past towers. But then the game shoots itself in the foot and just introduces powerful towers that smoke doesn't work on and bombs don't kill, meaning only your decoy works. So to make new towers completely ignore half my abilities means I no longer have options, and just have to hoard and only hope for 1 specific type of power, which is lame. This means your smoke only helps with starter towers, which is dumb because later in the game they barely do anything anyways. Then the game introduces towers that if you use powers (which you have to to survive) can resurrect all the other towers you killed, which is super dumb. Also the tower has super long range, so avoiding it won't actually do anything. Things like that isn't adding a new layer, its just stacking the deck much more in the opponents favor. This is why you basically have to play easy later in the game. Also the pathfinding is super stupid. You have to plan your own path, but countless times I have gotten past the part I planned, only to realize the path the game was auto taking me was straight up towards a tower that autokills you if you go straight towards, and since you can't turn around (dumb exclusion) you auto die. Other times the auto path would take me in a square, just going in circles, or towards a giant cluster of guys instead of an open area. Since maps are huge you can't be asked to plan everything, especially since there are multiple parts in the game the game uses non-tower mechanics to force you even more down a specific way or away from a certain way. It's not too much to ask to have the game not purposefully go the worst way possible every time, especially since you get caught up in battle and its hard to see the way you are planning to go sometimes. The extras missions are overly hard and kind of dumb since they take away the main point of the main game. Also the levels get kind of repeitive and devolve into the same thing.  7/10.			"

												If you like tower defense games like me you'll find Anomaly: Warzone Earth very interesting. Its different approach to the genre (you command the wave(s) and have to fight your way to the end of the mission destroying the cpu's towers) it's quite fresh and offers a different perspective to the fans. While the story is really...well... absolutly awful, the gameplay is pretty solid and easy to master. But this is the main problem of Anomaly too. It's too easy and light. There are only six different units you can control and only four ""powers"" you can deploy (healing, smoke granades, luring mines and, obviously, the air strike). I've earned all the gold medals available in the main story, completed all the achievements in advanced mode (plus some other achievs) and i've failed like..mm..2 times. In conclusion i reccomend this game only if you really like TD games and want a really bland difficulty experience.PROS:+ quite cheap and not so short+ nice graphic (for the genre)+ badass tanksCONS:- too easy- only 5 different units- a bit boring sometimes			"

The game itself is fairly good, but the concept is awesome. Definately worth playing if you like tower defence - see what it's like from the other side. Well worth the money as it's hours of fun, especially on long trips without a good computer. ;)It's also available for android.

												Interesting gameplay, but good lord the dialogue.  The single most offensive portrayal of British and Japanese people I have ever seen.  If anyone of remotely African descent appeared in this game, the writers would have insisted on their need to speak of themselves as 'mutha♥♥♥♥as' and their immense desire to consume watermelons and fried chicken.It is that stereotypical, racist and unimaginitive with its characterizations.Wouldn't be as big a deal if unit responses and the single player narrative didn't make up most of the game.

												Solid game and intuitive twist to tower defence. Tower offense has proven to be a nice way to play with the same 'feel-good' rush you get when you upgrade a new unit and then take down an enemy with it. If you like tower defense or Defense Grid: Awakening, you have to download the demo of this and then buy it. The music adds punch to each map and is used to create tension rather than annoy. It's well-composed enough to even be easily ignored so you can concentrate on keeping that shield generator up. The unit variance is perfectly balanced so that you don't have too many, and the resource acquisition is paced well enough so you never feel like your being short-changed (on casual). There are three modes; casual, advanced and hardcore. I'm not sure what they do to scale the difficulty, but it could be anything from tapering the resupplies to raising the damage done by enemy towers. It's a great title that you can just pick up and play for 10 minutes and have a good time.			"

												It is the year 2011, and something bizarre has crash landed into our world. It's strange and takes what we know and twists it into something new and refreshing. Our world calls it  ""Anomaly Warzone Earth"".[Scores - out of 10]Story - 8 (Typical unknown alien invading our Earth with it's own variation and definitely twists to the story, and of course stopping the aliens.)Gameplay - 9 (The gameplay revolves around escorting your vehicles as they blow up enemy towers; It can get slow, repetitive, and frustrating at times.)Music/sounds - 8.7 (Guns, explosions, vehicles, and people complaining they're about to die. What's not to love!)Overall Value - 8.5Replayability - 4 (High scores)Worth it? - If you are a fan of strategy/tactical/tower defense games, it's definitely a great game and worth it to pick it up and play but do not expect much replayability unless you are a fan of getting the highest scores on the leaderboard or getting all of the achievements.

												The tower defense space is fairly crowded at this point, so another low-priced  indie title might not find the spotlight that it deserves, but this game changes the standard tower defense model: sending you in reverse (you're now the runners), granting abilities, and tasking you with planning your troops routes and vehicles. I always thought it might be interesting to play a TD game from the other vantage point and this one definitely lives up to my  expectations. Well worth any Steam sale price.			"

												In Anomaly: Warzone Earth, you're a hero leading a squad of units that you manage, buy and buff while you fight towers.As something of an outspoken anti-fan of RTs games, I was pleasantly surprised by this game.  The planning occurs in pause mode, and the strategy is intuitive enough for me to grasp.  There may not be enough action for hardcore action fans, or enough hardcore strategy for strategy fands, but it's definitely worth a look, even if it's just for observing the mechanics.			"

Use your one and only hero unit to collect scattered goodies for more points.2. Spend points to purchase vehicles. Vehicles are upgradeable.3. Repair, heal and shield your units on the fly using up to 4 power ups. These power ups can be picked up from battle zone.4.

												Why play a Tower Defence game, when you can play a Tower ATTACK game?! Anomaly: Warzone Earth truly throws the Tower Defence genre upside-down. The player indirectly controls a wave of units, designating the path and using support abilities to protect the units as they advance. This is an easy game to adapt to and only covers a few basic strategies, but continues to challenge the player as new units, abilities and enemies are introduced throughout the game. The graphical engine is impressive, well polished and looks excellent. This game can be completed in just under 10 hours. Although a high-score system is present throughout the game, the basic mechanics of the game diminish the games replay value. Overall, this is a really impressive indie game to come out of a small Polish development team.			"

You get to upgrade your vehicles, add more firepower and provide assist through your ""suit"", which includes repair, smokescreens and other devices.My only complaint is the difficulty quickly escalates near the end, making it quite hard to finish. Otherwise, it's quite fun :3			"

												Okay, so, personally I am not an RTS game fan in the slightest as most of the time, they're too slowly paced for my liking, I however really wanted to give this one a go. This game I honestly have to say stands out for any other RTS I have ever played, unlike most where you are generally restricted to moving a group of units to either defend, capture or attack and that being pretty much it, this offers something new as the story-line pulls your character into investigating the unknown alien remnant's that landed on Earth.What I like the most is the free-roam movement of your character, running around collecting drop's and setting them down ahead, as long as you don't stray too far from your platoon to keep them defended and repaired.It manages to keep your interest from the get go, intertwining an interesting story-line that doesn't disappoint and where a lot of RTS games fail in my opinion is not keeping up a story or having one at all making it pretty redundant and repetitive, whereas this gives you a wider variety of stages, story, character development and with it keeping you on your toes, it doesn't really give you a chance to not be watching the battlefield as it could cost you. It keeps you having to constantly think ahead and plan the best path possible to victory.If you're an avid RTS player and haven't tried this one yet, I would defiantly suggest it and even recommend it to non-RTS game players as it offers something different.

												This game technically isn’t tower defense but more ‘reverse tower defense’, or maybe you could call it tower offence. It’s like playing whack-a-mole from the mole’s point of view.The one thing I can assuredly tell you about this game is that it’s very very good. Despite being a simple game to play, it has the feel and look of a AAA game. The graphics are very well developed, there is a suited soundtrack for both Baghdad and Tokyo settings; and has a feel to it which reminds me of C&C: Generals. Though this is a tower offence game, not RTS, despite having some aspects of both.Asides from some odd choice of voice-acting, this game offer a steady difficulty climb and lots of fun, along with a challenge mode to chew through once you have completed the main story missions. This is a game worth buying as it’s not only fun and frantic, as most tower-defense should be, but also a very well-made indie game.For full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2013/06/15/anomalously-good/ "

												If you have ever played a TD (Tower Defence) game and enjoyed it then you might actually like this game. In this game your roles are reversed and instead of building towers to keep those pesky creeps from getting to their goal and getting their hands on your goodies YOU now are the pesky creep that must make it to your said goal.The game is fun and in your case you wont be rushing through a line of towers and be shot at... well, not if you can help it. You get to chose your own pathing and upgrade your creeps to withstand heavy fire and when that is not enough you can even HEAL your units. I hope you will enjoy playing this game as much as I did.

												Are you a tower-defense geek? Tired of playing the same gameplay? This prompted me to try Anomaly: Warzone Earth, which I'd presonally classify as a tower-offense / RTS.The main story in which aliens invade the middle-east and you've been chosen to check why this happend is quite entertaining, the voiceovers are really good, maybe one or two cutscense would intensify the feeling of the story.You are put in a role of a free walking commando which can buy, upgrade veichles which auto-fire at enemy towers. Since this is not your typical tower-defense game, you do have lanes where you can move (commando can roam a bit more than the units tho), but usually there are few available paths and you can decide which one you and your units will take. This is the RTS part which can be the difference between you being roasted by mega alien blasters or successfully completing a mission.As a command you can use special abilites which can aid to your misson.

												I play on casual and to me it's fun. It's simple. All you need to do is repair your vehicle while attacking, or create smoke screen to avoid enemy attacks, or decoy to divert them. It's not super fun, it is casual fun. It might be challenging on a higher level, haven't tried, probably won't even try. I have DOTA for games that I want myself to work hard on as a player. And then I have this to play when I feel like chilling while blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up. I feel it's as fun as Bastion (even though it's on different genre). 8/10.

												I really enjoy this as a casual game, that you can methodically take down your enemy towers at your own pace, with checkpoints that are easy to revert to, but challenging to perfect to keep all your troops alive.  It plays great on my Alienware Alpha (i7) with Windows 10 on my 47"" TV, full screen with an Xbox gamepad.  It is virtually identical in look and feel to the mobile version that I played before, except you have a little guy to run around instead of just using your finger.  You can take it easy by making your path take loops around a few targets at a time and heal yourself before engaging the next street/block of towers.  I have fun while playing it, but I don't find it as engaging as some games.  It is best play between other more in-depth games.  6/10, but recommended if you are into tower defense at a slower pace.			"

												This is a fun game that starts to really use your brain towards the end of the campaign, although it was very short. Towards the final boss, I really had to pause and think of good routes and resource management. The harder difficulties are where the game starts to shine. Where the game doesn't shine, however, are the cosmetic details. I understand we are in the Anomaly, so why do I need that red or blue patchy fog over my troops? It only gave me eye strain. Also, the biggest drawbacks to me was the voice acting, the music in Tokyo, and the strange quotes the soldiers would say. It wasn't even ""bro"" talk, it was just off and, in the case of the Japanese SDF, downright funny. Overall, if you want a nice, casual campaign, or if you want to ramp up the difficulty and really wrack your brain for strategies, this is a good fit.  If you want a seriously polished visual masterpiece or well-thought out story, look elsewhere. It's like a B-movie version of a game: fun and silly, but not up there with the greatest.			"

												If you like tower defense games like me you'll find Anomaly: Warzone Earth very interesting. Its different approach to the genre (you command the wave(s) and have to fight your way to the end of the mission destroying the cpu's towers) it's quite fresh and offers a different perspective to the fans. While the story is really...well... absolutly awful, the gameplay is pretty solid and easy to master. But this is the main problem of Anomaly too. It's too easy and light. There are only six different units you can control and only four ""powers"" you can deploy (healing, smoke granades, luring mines and, obviously, the air strike). I've earned all the gold medals available in the main story, completed all the achievements in advanced mode (plus some other achievs) and i've failed like..mm..2 times. In conclusion i reccomend this game only if you really like TD games and want a really bland difficulty experience.PROS:+ quite cheap and not so short+ nice graphic (for the genre)+ badass tanksCONS:- too easy- only 5 different units- a bit boring sometimes			"

												I have really good time playing Tower Defense games. I always thought about WHAT IF somebody would make a game where you switch sides and you are not the one defending, but attacking... And there it was. Some not popular flash game, which I sadly don't remember how it was called. It was simply - you were the one attacking (sending some bugs) and enemy was building tower. Oh boy, it sure was great game. And so somehow we got another game reversed Tower Defense game - Anomaly: Warzone Earth. To be honest I have the most fun playing simply Tower Defense formula game - building towers, killing over9000 enemies and upgrading stuff. There was already one example of unusual TD game which I loved - Sanctum. So, how is Anomaly: Warzone Earth? I can say for sure it's a must play for everyone who loves TD games. Starts rather easy, and end up quickly. If you will want to unlock everything (achievements) then it's quite a challenge, but that's all. It looks fine and sounds fine too. I'm not sure how are other Anomaly games but I can be sure of one thing - it started really well and if other games aren't worse than this one - then it's good. I enjoyed it and gladly will play sequels. If you love TD games, and enjoy experiment stuff about this genre, don't hesitate and play it.			"

												This is something special, something unique, something you most likely haven't heard of before. Everyone knows what tower defense is, right? But does everyone know what tower attack is? No? Thought so.Although it may sound like some browser game, it of course isn't. I mean, if you look at the graphics already... Well, they're amazing. The gameplay itself is fun and you'll have multiple routes available on each mission. You choose the one you want to take. Some are easier, some are more rewarding. Some result in easy victory, others result in brutal destruction of some of your units, unless you manage to keep 'em alive with your special abilities. All of it is quite fun, even failiures.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												Well first of all this is a anti-tower defence game.This game looking tower defence games very different angle.You are not making defence, making attack.You are going to kill different type defence towers with your assault team and make them support with your abilities.Actually i am really like this game, very original game.

												I really wanted to like this game. But what the hell is with your commander, it never stops moving. You spend all of you time directing it back to the rest of the troops. What is wrong with the idea of clicking on the ground and it moves to where you told it to go, rather than having it run around like a chook with its head cut off!Also, what is wrong with the right CTRL button being used to switch to tactical mode. Only the left button works.Idiot developers!			"

												Anomaly: Warzone Earth is an interesting new take on tower defense games. The controls are awkward and there is a lack of strategic options to an otherwise excellent game concept.

												Its a fun, exciting and challenging game until you play about the third level and have the game basics down because after this point there is little skill or strategy involved besides running around using heals and just reacting to the map. About the only thing that involves thinking or skill in the game is your line up which you will have down pat and have figured out what is the correct one by the end of the second level. You will get about an hour of fun out of the game so I wouldn't recommend it unless its under $3 as the game play gets really repeative and boring after that.			"

The game does not have much of a story line but its the best 80p i have spent in a long time.9/10 - Highly recommend!			"

												This is a nicely made little reverse TD with impressive graphics and physics. It looks and feels a bit like C&C 3, but I personally enjoy this a hell of a lot more than I did C&C 3. Strategy is key in this, as you can change the route of your convoy at any time, to choose the safest and most easily defendable path to the objective; but occurences mid-mission can flip the situation, so be ready to focus on combat and ability management. Definitely a must-try for anyone looking at TD genre games. ****			"

												An outstanding game amongst the downloadable titles. It is tower defense, but with an extreme twist. It is reversed! You are the one attacking, while the enemy towers await you. You can choose what units you bring into the mission, you can upgrade them and change their route of movement on the fly. A big extra is that you have a commando in a high tech suit at your disposal; he is very fast and agile, and with him you can place repair zones, smoke screens, decoys and airstrikes. The game is pretty simple and also very complex at the same time, this makes it highly enjoyable. It contains a slightly difficult campaign and a skirmish type assault mode as well. It looks very crips and clear, the graphics are really good; the music and the voice acting - despite being cheesy - are also quality work. All in all, it's an excellent indie game.			"

												Anomaly: Warzone Earth is a clever twist on tower defense that will rope back in gamers that think they’ve had enough of the well-worn formula. The balancing act between action and strategy is nicely tuned. Even when the firefights are ferocious, you’re still thinking about adjusting routes and how to smartly deploy precious power-ups so you don’t run dry later in the mission. And to top it all off, Anomaly’s good story and great locations give you constant reasons to fight. You always want to see what happens next. Thankfully, the gameplay itself is strong enough to bring you back even after the final act.			"

It looks very crips and clear, the graphics are really good; the music and the voice acting - despite being cheesy - are also quality work. All in all, it's an excellent indie game.			"

												This is a fun game that starts to really use your brain towards the end of the campaign, although it was very short. Towards the final boss, I really had to pause and think of good routes and resource management. The harder difficulties are where the game starts to shine. Where the game doesn't shine, however, are the cosmetic details. I understand we are in the Anomaly, so why do I need that red or blue patchy fog over my troops? It only gave me eye strain. Also, the biggest drawbacks to me was the voice acting, the music in Tokyo, and the strange quotes the soldiers would say. It wasn't even ""bro"" talk, it was just off and, in the case of the Japanese SDF, downright funny. Overall, if you want a nice, casual campaign, or if you want to ramp up the difficulty and really wrack your brain for strategies, this is a good fit.  If you want a seriously polished visual masterpiece or well-thought out story, look elsewhere. It's like a B-movie version of a game: fun and silly, but not up there with the greatest.			"

												The quick way to describe Anomaly is that it's a reverse tower defence game, but to me that sells it a bit short by comparison - there's a lot more to the gameplay than in most tower defence games. Along with the expected concept of managing a troop of units past some towers, you have a 'hero' unit free to roam around the map, collecting and deploying special abilities (mostly defensive to protect your units or distract foes, but you get an airstrike later on to attack enemy towers), which adds a nice layer of depth. Additionally, you have complete control over the path of your units through the towers - levels are often set in city areas with many possible routes to take. New elements are added at a fairly consistent rate, so each level feels distinct, which is also helped by some neat unique features in certain levels (for a few examples, in one level, enemies try to destroy bridges to block your path, in another you have to 'escort' your transport flying slowly through the level by clearing the towers in its path). The plot is a bit generic and the cutscenes sometimes feel like they get in the way of the gameplay, but it gives an excuse for an excellent setting and overall style, so it's forgivable.In short, Anomaly plays great and looks great, so if you want to flip the script and start knocking down some towers, give it a spin.

The checkpoints can be infuriating having to redo your sh*t every attempt, it wont't save your pathing between checkpoints, and there is no targeting circle and/or slow-mo to help with precision item dropping.It can quickly devolve into a trial and error puzzle nightmare instead of an action tower defense.

												This is a really interesting take on tower defense games. Instead of placing the towers, you are the invading force... but you're not really invading so much as trying to reclaim the cities of earth from alien invaders. You control a guy with a suit that can place power ups for your convoy that in most cases you can choose and upgrade. You can heal, make smoke clouds, place distractions or call in missile strikes. If you like tower defense games this is definitely worth checking out. Here are some videos of me playing through the game:
