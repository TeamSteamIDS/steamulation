												In a world of WWII or modern tank sims, this highly realistic title covers two vintage tanks that have never really been simulated in detail previously. So far, the realism and AI seem pretty top notch. In addition, exterior graphics such as tank models are very nicely modeled. Finally, the fact that this game features somewhat functional 3d tank interiors automatically puts this title above any other modern tank sims, that is of course because we haven't seen any interior tank models since Operation Flashpoint! (correct me if I'm wrong) Drawbacks? The interface navigation is a bit confusing and takes some getting used to. In addition, graphically the 3d interior models and land environment seem a bit dated to today's standards. Evidently, this game is not categorized as early access, but probably SHOULD be as it doesn't really feel like a finished product. Otherwise, if you like obscure vintage tanks in long forgotten conflict zones, (which I totally do!) this sim's for you!			"

												*Disclaimer* Please disregard Hours played, I bought this from Gamersgate a couple of years ago and have clocked up at least 75 hours. Bought the Steam version in order to place this review and to support the developer.Make no mistake this game is not easy to learn, there are literally hundreds of controls and commands to master, i still find myself referring to the manual mid game, however your efforts will be rewarded. The UI too is a little counter intuitive, it really takes some time getting to grips with it but once you understand it it makes sense. The tutorial is not great either, next to useless in fact but there are players around who can assist you and videos, wikis etc that will shed more light on things if you care to seek them out.This game doubles as both a realistic Tank simulator and a Platoon level strategy sandbox, you get to design scenarios, deploy your units, set up your tactics and command your men from the comfort of a beautifully modelled tank.You can occupy any of the tank crew positions, driver, gunner, commander or loader and switch between them, the interiors are beautifully and accurately modelled and no other game manages to recreate the sense of claustrophobia, the feelings of immense power and terrible vulnerability as experienced by real tank crews, in my humble opinion.There are only two playable tanks but they have been modelled to an exceptionally high standard, it's a case of quality over quantity, the maps too are beautiful with great lighting and weather effects that really succeed in creating a believeable and atmospheric battlefield experience.Realism is key to this game, ballistics are accurately modelled, as is the damage (or lack of it), shoot the wrong kind of round or even the right kind at a 45 degree thick armour plate and it'll glance off harmlessly into the sky, hit a weak spot square on with armour piercing and bingo! satisfying penetration, the game will accurately calculate whether or not the systems, munitions, fuel tanks or crew etc get damaged or are destroyed. After the fight you can review all the hits and any damage caused.Tactics matter, the way you manoeuvre matters, unit positioning matters, coordinating your forces well will pay dividends and poor decisions are ruthlessly punished.In a nutshell - this is a labour of love made by a developer that is passionate about armoured warfare and it shows, get through the tricky first few hours and you'll see just what a great tank sim this is. If you don't mind a steep learning curve and are up for a challenge this game will pay you back in spades.			"

												First off..  I am biased.   But I am going to give a bit O brutal review.  Not really that brutal.  1st off.  This is a ""remastered"" SABOW that was released back in 2011.  It had a borked release with publishers that where borderline stupid.  The game was released in a state with game braking bugs.  This had nothing to do with the dev.  In fact they released a series of unofficial patches to fix the issues.  They however, where not allowed to officially fix the game.   However, the rights just returned to the dev's.  Where all that unofficial content was made official and many fixes and improvements where added in.   There are 2 choices for realistic tank games out there that are newish.  This being one and the other being Steel Beasts Pro.  Both have their ups and downs.  But this one is a lot cheaper.  And frankly its campaign  system is better than SBpro.  Both are most certainly worth owning for a tread head.  The vehicle models have always been a strong point in this game.  And they have aged quite well.  They looked good 4 years ago and still look pretty darn good.  The textures for the interiors of models have been improved and are ok.  But they do not look as good as they could be by 2015 standards.  But they are better than they where on the 2011 release.  Some aspects have not aged super well.  Buildings and some trees/bushes are showing their age.  Not going to suger coat that.  But they do the job.   I guess as a side bonus it means it will run well enough on older vid cards =) The campaign's are pretty dynamic.  they never play out the same way twice.  In them you have the option usually (campaign depending) of letting the ai control none playable tanks or taking that on yourself and ordering every friendly unit around on the map.  Which I totally LOVE.  Boss guys around, call in arty strikes, air strikes, and fight your tank.  You have realistic ballistics.  Realistic damage model.  Realistic shell types with realistic effects.  the more important components of the tank you can interact with the mouse.  Set angle for the gun when on slopes with the level gauge.  On the M60a1 use the realistically modeled coincidence range finder and mechanical ballistic computer.  However, for some reason you do not have player control over lights, the near infrared search lights, and unlike a previous game from Graviteam, you can not stall out your tank if in the wrong gear as driver.  I miss that.  =(If your a tanker at heart...or in my case a Cav Scout out to pasture I do recommend. I like this game to much....  It like being on some sort of retro FTX without the bad cold bad food, little sleep, being filthy, and endless maintance issues.Edit... Oct. 2015Since this review things have changed for the better.  Now you have training missions to ease into your tank commander role.  You now do have control over lights, a choice of manual gear shifting and engine throttlle settings.  This last means you can drive stupid and stall the tank, throw a track, or over heat the engine.  Which is a nifty optional feature.  Tank interior has been greatly improved since I wrote this review.  And it looks like some bushes look better now.  The T62 can now lay smoke screens!  I was, ya that's nice.  After using such I use it quite alot to stay alive now.  The Basra 86 DLC is pretty excellant as well.  Great map!  Looks sort of like places I have been too in the mid east.  While I of course never went to where this battle took place, I did get to around out skirts of Basra.  What more can I say about that?  Last thought.  This sim is pretty much what it always should have been now.   There are some rough edges and there is larger than normal learning curve, but crap, its a legit tank sim in the old school sence.  You want real without taking a heat round and having your clothes set on fire with massive flashburns, this is for you.			"

												As a long time player of tank sims, M1TP 1&2, i44, Panzer Commander, SBPro, etc. Graviteam has presented us treadheads with another excellent armor simulator. Starting with the modest T-72 Balkans on Fire, then the WW2 classic Steel Fury;Kharkov 1942 and now Steel Armor Blaze of War. The campaign theaters are unique as are the main combatants, the M60a1 and T-62. I'm most impressed by the M60a1 in SABoW, a tank that was the backbone of the U.S. ARMY for over three decades. It is well modeled and detailed in this simulator. Graviteams unique blend of an armored simulator coupled with their award winning tactical simulator engine from Actung Panzer: Operation Star gives the player the options to control as much or as little of the battlefield they wish. No matter how you play your rarely if ever going to experiance the same outcome twice. The Tactic's part of SABoW is not super easy to learn but not impossible and believe me if you take the time to learn it your experiance with SABoW will be nothing short of amazing that a game can have this much depth. Even if the tactics part of SABoW isn't your thing, SABoW still offers much even if you prefer to keep it lite, the QMB will give you hours of playability alone. Just a closing note, my hours playing SABoW here on STEAM is not much but I have owned SABoW since 2011 when the publisher was UIG. I can tell you now that since Graviteam has reaquired the rights to SABoW it is a much better game, so much better that when Graviteam put it up here on STEAM I repurchased it, it's that good.			"

												A summary and list of Pros and Cons (previous Gamersgate player since 2012), review status March 2015:Summary:A hardcore tank simulator with many options, variety in maps, settings and assets, not much variety in controllable vehicles and a very steep learning curve. I suggest it for people that want a hardcore game and that do not shy away from spending some hours into getting used to the game and its interface. I do not recommend it for people that just want to drive around blowing stuff up, because the realistic engagement ranges and punishing difficulty make this kind of playstyle very hard to achieve.Pro:-Detailed simulation of vehicular warfare-Detailed and realistic maps, vehicles, driving and damage physics-Lots of control over your AI squad or own tanks crew in either direct commander mode or through the map interface-Dynamic campaign, giving plenty of replayability-Customizable difficulty and realism levels-Detailed Encyclopedia of the game content and its propertiesMids:-Decent messagebox tutorial that can be turned on or off with an interface button-Graphics are aged, but still detailled. Texture quality has suffered somewhat though-Slow paced gameplay is rewarded, because your tank is quite fragile when hit with anti tank weaponry-After Action Reports give a detailed view what hit a tank, from where and what damage has been done, allowing for improving ones playstyle in the futureCons:-Very hard to learn controls, due to somewhat unintuitive keyboard shortcuts/layout-Interface is a bit cluttered to allow every action to be done with the mouse-Hard to learn game, steep learning curve and very punishing in case of strategic or tactical failure-Texture quality is considered low now and makes some assets unpleasant to look at-Eyestrain might be caused by using the rangefinder that overlays two images to the player. You have to find the non-blurry version of the object you want to shoot at to dial in the correct range (gunning/rangefinding can be done by the AI though)Some more detailed comments:Steel Armor: Blaze of War is a game that has been out for quite some time. It was released late 2011 and unfortunately had a rough launch with lots of dispute between the developer and publisher. Now that these things have been moved to the past, the developer has aquired the rights back to his own game and implemented all the fixes that they have been released so far inofficially as the official new version of the game in hope to be able to support and release more content, now that they own their IP.

												This is an excellent tank simulation game, easily among the best available. It is not to be mistaken with any tank action game of any sort, so don't expect arcade gameplay. This game is about learning how to operate (either as commander, driver, gunner or loader) an American M60A1 and  a Russian T-62 main battle tank, both cold war era machinery. The developers practically crawled into both of these I've been told, this in order to create the cockpit and internal layout as accurate as possible, this is the real deal. The cockpit or inside experience of these tanks are no small part in this game. Every little detail is present and the crew is fully represented and accurately animated. When firing a short you can witness the loader to pickup another around of ammunition and load it up the cannon. You can easily switch roles are you see fit, playing the gunner for example and receiving orders from the A.I. commander on your targets, distance and whatnot. Very impressive.As an interesting addition the developers decided to also implement an operational part to the game, elements they carried over from their excellent Graviteam Operation Star strategy game. Here you can command platoons of tanks, infantry and motorized vehicles. So while operating your tank commanding your, excellent graphically represented, crew to battle victory, you can also issue orders and command an entire tank platoon. This by way of communicating orders and/or tactical map of the entire battlefield.The Ukrainian developers have pored a lot of love into this one and it does show. Like I said earlier, this is really for the simulation loving crowd, not the 'World of Tank' player seeking instant action. This game requires thought, learning and researching, but offers a virtual dive into how it must have felt to operate these metal beasts...			"

												A lot of crap gets given to Steel Armor - Blaze of War because there are only two operational tank models to use.  That is a bit of a misconception.  Yes there are only the T-62 and M60A1 to be driven and operated... BUT in most battles you are a part of a tank squad, platoon, company or all three, therefore you are able to interchange between multiple numbers of M60A1s and T-62s.  You are also able to give orders to Infantry, APCs, other tank variations like the T-55, Chieftain, and Olifant, Aircraft and other units via the Tactical Map.  If you've played Graviteam Tactics, it's basically the exact same thing, so really this game could be seen as an add-on to Graviteam Tactics, or Graviteam Tactics could be seen as an add-on to Steel Armor... I'm not really sure which came first.  But yes, you can only control the T-62 and the M60A1 but that is no where near the only unit in the game.  The settings are a bit odd... Afghanastan 1979-1989.  Iran 1980-1988.  Angola 1975-2002.  Most of those areas are not your typical, main stream maps, but once you get into one of the tanks you won't really care.  You could also say that it's not as fun as a World War 2 tank sim would be, and as I would mostly agree with you, the tanks involved in this game are not so advanced as to take away what made WWII an interesting and challenging fight.  There are no radar guided missiles, lazer beams, etc.  It's still hardcore and fairly straightforward basic combat reminiscent of the battles of WWII.			"

												This is a fantastic game. The graphics are amazing, the details will blow your mind, and the historical accuracy is spot on. The physics, for a tank simulator, are quite nice. They may be even more realistic than my knowledge. This game is a great simulator, especially for those who enjoy a slow paced fighting game. I'd recommend this to anyone who likes simulators. It's just that good. P.S; the graphics for the environment are spectacular. The dust, bushes, shrubs, rivers, and desert all add to the spice. And the best part is: if you run over a bush, it'll fall. 10/10, best game.			"

												Watched in horror as my driver drove of the road and into a deep river where we drowned before making to the enemy held town.......  Well considering im a pretty big war sim fan, i heard about this game awhile back and decided to give it a try, its actualy a pretty good game. The graphics are a bit dated and so is the audio but other then that its pretty good for being what it is. From what i have seen so far the unit/squad control is some what similar to the Arma series bit way more in depth and allows you to operate tank platoons with Infantry support, you can operate all stations of the tank (not sure about the loader) . my only issue is that the game has quite a bit of a learning curve, I'm unfamiliar with the series but considering this game was put onto steam i figured why not, i like tanks and it has tanks. Also the UI is kinda annoying, its better then the DCS ground units but its still i had to look up the controls to hop into a tank. The ballistics in the game seen pretty realistic, you could compare it to Warthunder Ground Forces but having as much detail inside the tank as the outside, i am not sure if the armor of the tanks are similar to WT as in modules instead of numbers like WOT. So far as where the game stands i give it a 8/10. Main reason is that it seems like they have bumped up the price tag, someone told me you could have got this game for about $5 before it went to steam, i did look around and could not confirm that so do not let that stop you from trying it out.

												I've been playing a (I have to admit) cracked version and waiting for this game to come to Steam for years, and I bought the game the moment I saw it on Steam. I think it deserves every single cent, and is probably the most detailed post WWII tank simulator that everyone can reach and afford (who manages to get their hands on a copy of Steel Beasts anyway.)The attention to detail in this game is great, both in the tactics phase and in the real battle phase. Supply, fuel, ammo and fatigue levels, weapon and armor characteristics are simulated quite nicely in the tactics phase. But even if you don't care for commanding platoons and you're just playing the game to simply hang out in a tank, the fact that this game has 3d interiors is enough of a reason to buy it for armor enthusiasts.Attention to detail results in a quite unforgiving game especially in terms of vision and damage; more often than not, battles consist of scanning for enemies than actually shooting at them. This may feel underwhelming for Rambo wannabes seeking to crash tanks into helos and stuff. When things get hot, though, the sound of rounds ricocheting off your armor alone is enough to force you into a fetal position, covering your ears.The 3 campaigns that are in game do a good job of representing the common types of warfare: Inf vs Armor, Armor vs Armor, Combined Arms vs Combined Arms. Note that the attention to detail is true for the campaigns, too. They aren't story driven, so they aren't necessarily supposed to be won if you follow a path or something. Sometimes you seal your fate in the 3rd turn with a less-than-optimal move, and you don't realize it until the 6th turn when the enemy crushes you utterly.That might be just me, but the graphics look better than it did on the non-Steam version. Yes, it shows age, but it is still on par with ArmA 2 which should be more than enough if it is a simulation you're looking for.It should be noted that the game does leave some things to be desired.First of all, the game doesn't make a serious attempt to, I don't know, be learned? And I'm not talking about the difficulty or complexity level here. The tutorials (which AFAIK simply didn't exist as separate levels in the non-Steam version), while nice additions, are far from adequately polished. Failure to read one sentence of essential info when it appears on screen can force you to restart the whole tutorial level, as the game offers you no easy way of going back to previous messages.Optimization seems to be a slight issue. I have no problem getting a constant 55-60 FPS like 90% of the time. But especially when moving in a column with other tanks, the dust kicked up by their treads cause the FPS to dip all the way down to 20-25. This is not a game-breaking performance failure though; you simply can't see and shoot through that dust and smoke anyway, so the lowered FPS doesn't impair your aiming, it just slightly annoys you for a few seconds until the dust settles.The menus kind of feel more clunky than the actual gameplay, and you would have thought that driving a 40-ton tank would feel clunky. Sometimes pressing the buttons doesn't really do anything; you have to go for that sweet spot that's like, not in the middle of the button and also not on the edge of it or something. You will figure it out.Also, currently it seems like you can't assign more than one button for an action. And I haven't yet managed to get this game to change the control scheme or detect my gamepad, but that might just be the inability on my part. (I appreciate all suggestions)Long story short, SABOW is an essential part of any simulation collection. As in any military sim, it is an acquired taste. Learn to enjoy its strong points and ignore its weak ones, and you have a game you will keep coming back for more. Also, just look at that abbreviation.SABOW!

After you get in a few battles you will be having a great time. The more Tank sims the better i say. "

												Well for tank sims this takes the cake.  So far in playing you are the commander of a tank unit.  And by far this is the most complex tank sim like with DCS.  Don’t let that put you off.  It’s beautiful once you get to know her and take her out time to time.  It’s not as bad as DCS but the detail is there.  You will want to keep your tanks alive but that will not happen.  You will die due to the enemy tanks better armor at times.  You will suffer losses.  This is war and this is a tank simulator.   I don’t write reviews but for this one I will.  I would say this is what everyone wants when they play a table top strat game when you want to fight the individual battles in detail.  Graphics are great if you have a good computer which I do.  So don’t expect a world of tanks sim as this is its Father.  Pro'sDetail of BattleDetail of Hit BoxesCan be anything you want to be in the tank.  Good computer you put your time into = Great GraphicsGot to face you’re not a god in the game complex which brings the real face of war.NegsWould like to see some updated tank battles of the modern day and nations.Would like to see some what if battles like US v Russian or Brittish.Didn’t put much money in your computer well you will suffer in graphics but the game play is still there.Learning curve but it’s worth it.

												Overall, I really like the game. The interface takes some getting used to, but once you understand it, it gives you a lot of fidelity in systems and function. There's no other tank sim like this - with generally forgotten Cold War tanks in generally forgotten wars. I give the devs a lot of credit for going down this route, and I'm happy to have bought this game twice now (their original publisher went under and apparently took all the money with them). If you are at all interested in tanks, buy this game. You'll learn a lot, you've got some great dynamic campaigns to fight and the devs have been continuously patching and improving the game with new features since it came out on Steam.			"

												Steel Armor is a challenging, detailed game that combines turn-based strategy with real-time tactical battles.  You play the role of a battallion commander using a tank as a command vehicle.  As a result, there is no floating camera to move around the battlefield and you only directly participate in a battle if you can actually enter a tank in that battle.  During battle, you can take the position of any member of a tank crew while communicating with the rest of the crew as each member performs his functions.  You will have to command your troops from the commander's station of your tank, with not much more than your map, binoculars, tank optics and radio.   Each battle happens organically throughout each historically accurate campaign and can involve anywhere from a couple of sqauds to hundreds of units.  Combined arms plays an important role.  There are heavy and light armored vehicles, air units, anti-armor and anti-air units, heavy and light machine guns, artillery, mortars and various kinds of infantry.  If you enjoy GTOS, this game uses many of the same mechanics.  It's a great buy for GTOS fans because it brings you to the first-person level for battles, creating new challenges and a different kind of immersion.Like other Graviteam titles, this game is dificult to learn but rewarding.  The included training missions are a big help.Buy this if you are a fan of historical war simulations that emphasize meticulously realistic mechanics, especially if you enjoy GTOS.			"

												A well-detailed tank simulation of Cold War era's M60A1 and T62 tanks with almost non-existent tutorial and a steep learning curve that is well worth it.Since it is based on Graviteam Tactics engine apart from directly controlling tanks you are also able to give orders to other troops under your command (or give the control away to AI if you want to concentrate on a pure tanking).Tank cockpits are nicely detailed, crew members are animated - however the actual interactivity is at the minimum, mostly done via shortcuts and interface buttons. Nonetheless cockpits provide some good immersion.Campaigns in the game are about capturing victory points on a large map, where combat encounters are being generated on the fly depending on the situation. Both you and the enemy have limited pool of units and reinforcements, attrition, fuel and ammo running out play a large role in the ultimate outcome. Altogether this means that no playthrough is ever the same. Plus as a nice touch every destroyed vehicle and killed infantry stays on the map permanently, across every encounter in that area.There is also a Quick Battle generator, where it is fast and easy to set up whatever combat encounter you want, with any mix of forces, on any map area, controlled by you or an AI ally.In Cold War era depicted in the game tank crews are not as blind as they were during WW2, while still not having all the tools that make tanks such an effective weapon platforms they are today. Night vision devices are passive, low res, and have to be supported by IR spotlights, otherwise there's little you can see at night. Coincidence rangefinders require constant manual control and thus the shot requires a lot more time to be perfectly lined up. Gun stabilization is only in its infancy so a lot more skill is required from gunners to land a hit. As a result all of this provides for some tight combat, not present in other, more modern tank simulations.The game has some downsides of course. Interface is quite bad and does not feature even half the commands that keyboard shortcuts let you access. Tutorials do not exist, apart from pop ups describing what a given button does. There are still minor bugs and pathfinding in cluttered areas is wonky.Despite all of these issues - it is one of the best tank sims out there.			"

												If you're a simulation buff then this game is for you.  If you want an arcade game this is not for you.  This is all about what it's like to ""be in the tank"".  The first time you watch your crew members get ripped up next to you in the tank, you are going to give pause.  If you've been looking for a great tank sim then you're not going to make a mistake with this one. The atmoshpere, landscape, graphics, tactics, weather, all seem to be here.   I'm just scratching the surface with a couple of hours in, but it's already got me hooked and I can see myself dedicating a lot of hours to this one.  It's on sale, so what are you waiting for.			"

												Steel armor blaze of war is a tank simulator featuring cold war combat scenarios, the game gives you two tanks to play in. The T-62 which brutally slaughtered enemies in Iraq-Iran war and the M60 which famously have been long used by the American military for 40 years+.This game features tactical and stragetic elements, in which in campaigns you have to kill enemies and every move you did will affect their stragetic abilities, deciding who is the ultimate winner.There's also tactical elements, which is accessible with F10 button and you can command tanks where to move, formation etc.The game accurately the tanks' interior, optics and capabilities however many things are automated, you don't even have to press 10 buttons to start a engine or god-knows-what buttons. Miles ahead of what other games like World Of Tanks has to offer.I recommend this game if you are into tanks, and like a stragetic, tactical game in which every move will affect the ultimate outcome,  one by one but harsh.

												This game is much better with the updats...  a good buy...1 find it helpful if the reviewer lists the Pors and Cons; so here I go!Pro....    The credit card goes right thru and the game does down load!   ;-)  fo far so good....Cons.....     There is a bug that opens the game in widescreen; because of this you cannot play the game.  When you buy a new game, the last thing you want to do is spend  hours trying to get it to run.  Then when you go into the difficult interface there is no option to correct the issue.  Poor quality control from the developers...  For a game that is remastered form 2011 there should be no issue or bugs this serious.Save yourself and buy something else - you will be happier; $30 is a lot to spend and find it does not work properly.UPDATE.....    Figured it out!   From your desktop, lower your resolution.....   it will correct the    widescreen.  You may sill need to go into the game options and reduce the settings there as well....  good luck.  It does work on Windows 8 and 8.1			"

												I haven't played it much due to time constraints in my life. Quick summary: If you like Steel Beasts, buy this. If you like simulation BUY THIS, if you like tanks BUY THIS simulator now! HIGHLY RECOMMEDED!__________________________I wholeheartedly recommend this simulator. The immersion factor is 10/10, from the rain, to the vegetation, to the light and people around you. To how they act and how the war is waged in this simulator. Very few games or simulators can make me feel like I'm there, this did. The African vegetation is spot on, and the lighting coupled with the trees and grass immerses you to no end. It makes you feel like you are a tiny battalion of tanks lost in nowhere, and the sight of a village is both a great thing and bad, as it may mean more fighting. May mean fighting? Yes, because the missions are dynamic, based on a dynamic campaign. So no mission is alike, and giving you a replayability like no other! The dynamic campaign is really deep and interesting, and you can also choose to ignore it if you so like. The controls are intuitive and it has a nice UI in case you feel lost with buttons. Everything is nicely explained, and including the training missions. Which is what I suggest you do before you venture any deeper. Even the campaign has tooltips and explaining what you can do. I would also like to make a special mention to the incredible engine they have here. The mud, terrain deformation, and even small rivers and banks. For example, if a tank crosses a small creek, and with it lowering the terrain further, which will cause the tank behind you to be unable to cross. This is because the small crossing ended up damaged by your tanks track. Amazing details like that make one hell of a difference in anything! I also would like to mention how interesting it is the repairing mechanic, watching your crew repair your tank, to the ballistics simulation and how even small details are modelled. Like when it rains, your tank gets shiny and wet. The developers are very friendly, and they answer all questions, especially on their own forums. They are still updating this gem, and there is a patch almost every month. This simulator is simply amazing. Sure, there are a few bugs, but they are getting fixed, and if you find one and report to them, on their forums they will fix it faster: http://graviteam.com/forum/index.php?board=11.0 "

												I have heard many things about this game over the years.  I have just been playing it a little so far.  But I can say 2 things.1) It is actually a fascinating and very enjoyable tank sim.2) I understand why there are complaints about the UI but I think much of that boils down to  the fact that there is a lot of game here.  What I am finding is that I need to read the manual to understand how it works.  So - for a sim, that is 100% understandable.  This is not an arcade multiplayer tank game where all you need is WASD and a mouse... this is far deeper.I can't believe iIdid not try this sooner!			"

												It's Saddam versus Khomeini, and all bets are off. Leading either an M60A1 or an T-62 has never felt so satisfying and immersive. Get into the commander's cupola, play some lo-fi Middle Eastern music coming from a shoddy tape recorder to help boost morale of your crow, and bring the fight to the enemy.

												This game is one of my most enjoyable sim/wargames so far. Normally, this comes with steep learning curve and requires some skills and thinking when driving tanks. Everything on the battlefield can disable your vehicles, even infantry if you are not careful. Coming from playing WoT and Armored Warfare, I really appreciate the amount of details and features implemented in Steel Armor. Non penetration shots can also cause significant damages to your vehicles. In some scenarios, my tanks got knocked out just because of non penetration rounds. They normally damage gun barrel, ammo rack, injure crew or just plain detrack the tank.  Pros:           Cold war era game with authentic feels.                    Very detailed interior for two main models.                    Good sound effect.                    Unique combination between sim and wargame genres.                    Realistic take on night fighting with various early night visions of both sides during the Cold War. It's been great to  see vehicles litting up the dark night.Cons: A.I is wonky at times, doesn't prove to be a big deal.          Could be confusing to newcomers, especially players who are not hardcore sim enthusiasts.          Limited playable vehicles for a sim game. I hope in the future, Graviteams will keep adding DLCs and patches that give us more stuff to play with. I won't complain if we even have different theatres for campaigns like the Yom Kippur war, Kosovo, Pakistani-Indian conflicts, etc.			"

But once you get the hang of it, you're hooked if you like serious simulators. The graphics are quite nice too. Which was a huge surprise.The M60 Patton and the T-62 are a great match up, and having the Iran-Iraq war is very interesting, as this war wasn't touched on too much in other sims.Would also love some more tanks in future DLC's.Goodjob Graviteam!

												If you have even a passing interest in armored warfare, this is a no brainer. For $30 you get an authentic tank simulation with fully modeled interiors, 4 dynamic campaigns and a quick mission builder. And though the interface is less than intuitive, the details modeled in Steel Armor are amazing. Radio communications, terrain deformation (your tank leaves actual tracks in the mud!), armor penetration, fires, artillery, driving and track physics... the list goes on. This game is obviously a work of passion by a very small dev team. Years after its release they are still developing patches to add major features for free. If you're willing to work through the interface, you may be surprised to find such a rich simulation of armored warfare. Very highly recommended.			"

												Compared to Steel Beasts, this game has much more polished graphics, sound, and UI. This game is also much much cheaper than Steel Beasts. I would say this is *the* best tank sim on the market right now.It's not perfect though, some considerations to keep in mind:-Only M60A1 and T-62 obr1972 tanks are playable. So you don't get many of the fancy features you see in the modern tanks of Steel Beasts, but I would argue this makes for more engaging gameplay.-Limited mission editor. You can only save one custom mission at a time, and you can't download additional missions online. The game comes with ~10 premade missions, but they play more like advanced tutorials. However I think the numerous dynamic campaigns more than makes up for this.-Instant action is really just a premade mission. You'll get the same mission everytime you hit instant action.-No multiplayer of any sort			"

												This game, I mean SIM, is excellent! The developers have put such great detail into this game. The battles are intense and unforgiving - a wrong move can see you forces ripped to shreds in seconds. The level of detail with the tanks and units is fantastic. There are strategic, operational and tactical elements - play at whatever level you want. In the middle of the battle you can be the driver of an M60 or T62 and then quickly hop into the commanders chair and direct your whole force. The game has a learning curve but its worth the effort of investing the time to learn how to play. Visually the game is really impressive and the atmosphere is great.

 Intro  First and Foremost,  if you are looking for a fast paced 'shoot 'em up' style game, then this is  NOT  for you, this game is a simulator, not Call of Duty. If, however you are looking for a good armoured warfare simulator, Steel Armor Blaze of War is a sim you must have.  The Good SABOW offers a large variety of gameplay, from intense close in battles in the bushes of Angola, to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan or long distance battles across the sprawling deserts of Iraq. There are two playable tanks in the game, the T-62 and the M60A1, both have fully 3D modeled  interiors and most if not all systems in the tanks are operational. There are three campaigns in the base game, each with two sub-campaigns for each faction as well as a fourth campaign avaliable as a DLC. The included factions that you can play as are Angola, Iran, Iraq and the USSR, I think you can also play as a Cuban tank crew. The large & numerous maps are incredibly fun to play on, and they all offer a unique experience and require different tactics for the different types of terrain.The phsyics of the game are also incredibly realistic, firing your gun over long distances will cause bullet drop which you need to account if you are to hit your desired target.Some people have complained about the lack of tanks, while I would have liked to see some legends such as the T-72, T-55, Chieften etc. I beleive that the quality of the playable tanks in the game easily makes up for the quantity of them. The Bad While this game is incredibly fun and realistic, it does have some minor problems, but these are certainly not game breaking,- Occasional but minor audio glitches- Driver AI is sometimes quite frustrating (Probably just my poor commanding skills to be honest)- Mission editor had a lot of potential, fully customisable scenarios would be great. Summary Steel Armor: Blaze of War is incredibly fun and realistic tank simulator with a good variety of maps and vehicles, all in all I would highly recommend this game.			"

												This  sim is not bad at all but i must say that surprise me in negative the management of the strategical battle into map.It don't let you move like you desire ,it is more like a strategical game made of squares or exagons.I did expect by it more free movements in strategic map .Also in map view it's not all so clear ,the units are showed not in a clear graphic that say to you something of logic and try to understand what happens into battle it's very hard and take to much time,pratically if you are under fire and you must move fastly your units you ll get some problems.The simulation of all the parts of the tanks are good and the graphic also if it's dated show a clear image of the situation.I got problems with graphic setting,the graphic was wrong and only after many tryes i got a situation with normal image of the game 3d.In total it would be much more better if developers would take more care about some particulars that are very important.In more the setting about the units for both sides into fast battle are not sufficient.The graphic icons into game are not all intuitive so you have to study a bit and try and try before to get to play.What i can say?? A basic good sim but it suffer of some little problems.After many years i don't seen a good tank sim this one leave me in the middle way,like not satisfy.A great mention about the choice of devs about the storic moment used for the sim it's very good playing with old technology tanks ,it's more fun.Anyway i can reccomend this game sayng to developers......please add into menu a section for to can  set the keys as anyone want.....and probably a page into game with all the keys and theyr functions.

												The game could be great except for one major flaw. The manual and instructions to use it were originally written in Russian and ""interpreted"" badly into English. Lots of essential inforamtion is either not included or needs to be deciphered. I suppose eventually the game can be figured adequately enough to be playable. But for new players it's going to be an uphill grind. I can't recommend the game in it's current version.			"

												yesedit: 8/15/16absolutely amazing. the fine detail of the physics of the most simplest things to the sound of the mig-23 strafing its targets while you watch on top of your tank, to the ai that never does the same things twice (even if you ragequit and restart the same battle) to the OOB.a must buy and a developer worth your money.

												This game is not worth $30,  don't buy unless you really find operating the T62 model 1972 and M60 in obscure wars to be an intriguing experience. The devs have made false promises of multiplayer for 5 years now, and they really seem to have lost interest. There's a reason why most people stop playing after 18hrs of gametime invested. The strategy part is completely uncalled for and is an unnecessary burden. The maps are bland, literally just a few deserts and a jungle savannah. The UI is clunky ( I cant even configure my control scheme thanks to this) and the translations are less than stellar.On the upside, the devs put excellent effort into modeling the tanks, you can look around the inside and interact with buttons, switches, dials, etc. The tank gameplay is a challenging and a blast at the same time.Final recommendation:Unless you really like the idea of RTS and tank sim in forgotten conflicts, the $30 asking price is too much for this rough game.My recommendation to the devs:- Add in a basic LAN MP capabilty to have players coming back and build a good community- Either abandon or make optional the RTS element, nobody asked for it- Get YouTubers like BaronVonGamez, PhlyDaily or Frankie to make a video or two on this game (preferably after adding MP)			"

												I will not recommand this to anyone.It may be the best M-60/T-62 tank simulator on Steam, many aspects are even better than Steel Beasts Pro PE.Why I don't recommand it:1. Very poor tutorials. No interactive instructions, no manuals, just some pop-up texts and I know nothing to do.2. Programe is not stable. While I am trying to read the pop-up-text tutorials, and do what it tells me to do, nothing works. And last time I play this, everything works. I don't know why.3. Very miserable and confusing UI design. It's like back to the 90s and I'm playing some HD dos games.4. Not very well optimized graphics. It makes GTX 970 howling while the fps only reachs to 40.Despite the lack of reference manuals and poor UI design and programe bugs which drive me crazy, this is the best Cold War tanks simulator as far as I can see.

												I had this game for nearly 2 hours game time. Graphics looked (very!) good and gameplay appeared quite promising (hence all the good reviews).But I really struggled with constantly hearing russian crew voices in American, Iranian and Iraqi tanks. This instantly killed any immersion.Asking the devs for any hope on improving this issue, they got rude on me and replied insulting bs.The bottom line is, these devs are too incompetent to hire voice actors over the internet, probably not even have heard of this option.Check this thread and judge by yourself:http://steamcommunity.com/app/286280/discussions/0/620712364037830281/After this, I happily invoked a refund. Thanks to steam, I got my money back.This actually demonstrates what refunds are also good for: to have a voice against devs who rather see you as a cashcow than a customer.Sadly, the game easily could gain so much potential, if it was left to some competent developers to implement American, Arabic and Farsi voice acting and of course - Multiplayer!, which shamefully also isn't existent.Therefore I can nothing but downvote this.

												I'd like to recommend this game because it does seem like it will become enjoyable once you've figured out how to play it.Unfortunately, the learning aspect has been very badly managed. There are only 2 tutorials in which a novice to the game doesn't find himself under fire from very live enemies within minutes of starting the mission. The controls are very badly explained, and very few of them are covered before the battle begins, at which point it's frankly hopeless to expect a novice like myself to be paying attention to the few and far between text tips if I want to survive for even a minute or two. Add to this the fact that many of the keys the player is instructed to press are simply the wrong ones, and you're left with a bloody mess of an experience I'm afraid.Though ~3 times as expensive, I wish I'd gotten Steel Beasts instead. At least that game has an understandable, useful UI and is easier to get a grasp of.Edit: Having delved deeper into this product, I can safely say that it is simply a pathetic excuse for an arcade game, let alone a simulator. For everything that generates a positive experience, there will be a dozen equally large factors that results in nothing else than an unrealistic, buggy, badly designed awful gameplay experience. The devs have demonstrated lacking a fundamental understanding of how SABOT ammunition works, of how to produce an acceptable AI pathfinding, a realistic campaign, crew/unit management, etc. Add to this your average Eastern block ""nationalistic"" take on Soviet tanks, and the recipe is complete. T-55s on the lowest skill setting will literally speaking return fire, hit and destroy M60s at the highest skill setting with the first round.If you consider buying this, then keep this in mind: This game is from a developer that doesn't think that you should be able to expect MP in the 21st century simulator. Yes, MP as in multiplayer. Let that stand as an indication to how fundamentally twisted this mess is.If you're looking for an armour sim, then this is not for you. Just bite the pillow and get Steel Beasts instead and save yourself wasting money on this. It is neither realistic, nor playable.			"

												I want to recommend this game but i can't because i really do not know whats going on half the time i'm playing it. Tutorials are clunky. Community doesn't understand whats going on. As a simulator it definitely hits 10/10. But other than that i really do not understand what goes on. From the crew talking about targets and range to actually finding these said targets. I hear more shells slamming against my armor than i do of my own gun firing. Its not bad just really bad at presenting things that are understandable.			"

												All I am going to say is, my pc is waaaay above minimum spec for this game and yet I found myself struggling with 9fps on certain views on normal settings. On minimum settings, the game looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥and the framerate is not much better. If your PC barely meets minimum spec and you are thinking of buying this, then don't. There is no way on earth that a pc with those specs they list could ever run this game. But hey, gotta make those sales huh?			"

												I've been looking for a good and fun tank game for quite a while now, this one isn't it. Seeing snide comments from the Dev's to people asking questions doesn't help sell me on it either. I really tried hard to like it. Whill the game does have high reviews and what appears to be a loyal core following there are just to many little things for this game to work for me. Sorry for the lack of specifics, but it's one of those things where you don't care for something but you just can't seem to put it to words, so it is with me and this game. For me $30 not well spent...			"

												EDIT 24.8.2015.I still think ~30 euros is too much. However I find myself playing this game again and again. Do I recommend this game at this price? No. Still this is best game available on this subject. Hopefully patched fix some issues, mainly improving AI and minimizing micromanagement that way.ORIGINAL OPINIONI seriously regret buying this game at this price (~30 euros). People tell how good tank simulation this is, well that may be the case when you get to the tank driving phase.Tried the battle editor so I could practice with the russian tank, after a looong while staring at map with useless symbols and useless ""help"" I really start feel that this game should be more about tanks and less about micromanaging ""allies"".I'l get to actual tank simulator at some point but so far this game has been a major disappointment.

You don't even see the whole menu as it doesn't display properly - so maybe I'm missing all sortes of other info?  Game also crashes a hugh amount - I have never been able to return to main menu - it just crashed every time.  I love tank games but just don't like this experience but I feel as though I'm missing out big time.			"

												Excellent armored warfare sim.  Right up there with Steel Beasts.  Keep in mind that this is a simulation, not a video game, therefore to successfully complete missions you'll need to spend hours on just a single mission alone.  You can drive, gun, command, and even be a loader of the T-64 and M60A1 tanks.  Even acting as a battlefield commander is possible (Although I'd recommend Graviteam Tactics for that stuff exclusively).			"
