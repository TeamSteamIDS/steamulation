												When I first bought the game for 75 cents, I didn't think this was a strategy type of game. Traditionally with World War II games, I picked Germany as who I want to play as. Instead of being evil, I hightened my reputation with neighboring countries, gave aid to countries in need, and was just being plain friendly. Then I realized that in order to make best friends with other countries, I needed their same goverment. Since I was trying to be buddies with France, I decided to go for Democracy. The only way I could think of changing my goverment was to declare war on them and immediately ask for peace by changing goverment fourm.This was a DISASTER. France chose to decline in a millisecond. Instead of the Nazis blitzkrieging the French, the French blitzkrieged ME. After losing, I was libberated into a COMMUNIST country from the USSR who recently took Poland due to greed. I fell out of my chair laughing now since I had the support of the communists from the East, and the Italians from the South. France fell in 3 turns after I was liberated. Eventually I grew strong enough to fight back the Soviets all the way to Leningrad just like real World War 2, until they demolished me with aircraft. The Americans were coming from the West while this happened. I had an amazing defence on the boarder of Germany and France, and when the Allies saw this, the United States of America declared war on the Allies. I was crying by this point. America has ruined the plan for all the Allies to defeat Nazi Germany, and I retook annexed France under my wing. While Americans were fighting British men in Normany (where the American men were suppose to fight the Nazis), I was marching into Moscow with my swastika flag. Eventually I took over Italy, and the rest of my European allies. I must say; America avoided the Cold war by reenacting the Revolutionary war of 1775-1783 in 1945. 10/10 will play as America next time to create World War III = The United States of America against The United Kingdom against The USSR.

												I would most certainly hope you would buy this game during the sale, or even when it's not on sale(it's a quite small price). Pros:*GREAT learning experience, easy to get into, very user friendly.*Easy moving system, nice controls.*Easy economy system.*Easy region control and production control.*Not all full of reports and pop up's about battles and the economy like in Hearts of Iron III or similar games.*Cheap and fun.*Never really gets boring. Has different campaign starts incase you don't want to spend a lot of time playing.- First campaign starts from 1936 and is mostly economic based up until 1939 when the war starts and then ends in 1945. It also involves a lot about the Spanish Civil War and lets you ask, or change/repeat history, whether Republican Spain would win or if Nationalist Spain wins and whether Nationalist Spain joins the Axis beyond political support or if Republican Spain joins the Allies, or vice versa.- Second campaign starts shortly before the war, in 1938, showing the rise of Germany and their moves in Czechoslovakia and the Rhineland. Ends in 1945.- Third campaign starts at the brink of the war, 1939, with the invasion of Poland and sorrounding countries. Ends in 1945.- Fourth campaign starts in 1941 with the entry of America into the war after Pearl Harbor. Ends in 1945. Also involves the invasion of the Soviet Union(Eastern Front). Ends in 1945. Also has the battle in Africa.- Last campaign starts in 1944 and involves the invasion of France by the hands America, Britian and Canada(Operation Overlord/D-Day). Also involves the final stages of the Pacific War and the end of the war. Ends in 1945.*Has other historically correct events(unless you are the country that would've caused that event, in that case it is your choice if you follow history), such as the civil war in China with Communist China and Nationalist China, economic problems in America, Japan's crazy expansion, etc.*Easy way to make your own scenarios.*Lets you do what you always wondered and see what happens. Play as Germany and avoid a war with the Soviet's and see if you can conquer all of non-Soviet Europe. See what happens as Japan if you had not declared war on America. See what happens if, as the Soviet's, you make a move against Germany first. SEE WHAT HAPPENS!*Area that was formally Allied is given back to the former country when conquered by an Allied army. Ie. Normandy is given back to France after America wins the battle in Normandy.*Countries are never defeated until the whole alliance is destroyed.*Turn based instead of real time(might be a con for some, but it makes it easier for planning purposes and reviewing mistakes quickly.)*Almost no lag.*Great mod support/custom scenario sharing support.Cons:*Area that is occupied is given to the country that fought first, not the country that contributed to the battle the most.*Hard to recover from major losses in an area.*No way to have production to reinforce in areas that you conquered back for a country you are Allied. Ie. America can't build stuff in a French factory in a region that they conquered for France.A very fun game!8/10 for strategy.9/10 for fun.10/10 for length.7/10 for occupation system/conquering system.Overall: 8.5/10Category:Five star+ game!Great gameDecent gameBuy on a saleNot that badPretty badHorrible, do not buy!

												After i managed to get Croatia it's independence i decided to randomly start war against it, because i got bored after i gave entire Russia and Europe to it.(Yes, Croatia had control over Russia and Europe, Croatia stronk)So, Croatia firstly made an alliance with Brazil, because there is no more random country when it comes to war against Croatia and Germany. The allied with Poland, i was amused.Then Croatia formed the ""Fascist state of Albania"". I died laughing.This game has nothing to do with WWII. Here you do whatever the hell you want.Croatia stronk, hail Fascist Albania 10/10			"

												This game could help give people a better understanding of just how fragile the eco system of war is, giving them a sense of realism that is not found in most other strategy games. Unfortunately it's that same level of realism that might make this game unplayable for other gamers.			"

												Due to me putting 130+ hours into the game, I feel like I have a right to review it.Compared to other games such as Europa Universalis or any other Grand Strategy game, The Calm & the Storm is pretty simplistic when it comes to gameplay. Diplomacy is simple and combat is relatively easy to learn. One thing I will mention though, is that the world market is your best friend. if you play as anyone but the U.S USSR or Germany (I'm not sure about the U.K or China) then you will become dependent to the world market. Surprisingly, the same goes to self-sufficient countries if you want to keep a fairly steady income. That's all I'm going to mention about the game because if you download custom scenarios (which I HIGHLY recommend) then the gameplay, research, resource consumption, world market, etc will change depending on the scenario.For an example, I downloaded a scenario that let me played as the Holy Roman Empire in 1936, I fought the Nazis, conquered Europe, and fought the USSR and the U.K as a pro-Fascist SuperPower. Yes, Hitler was beaten by Julius Caesar.I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get into Grand Strategy games. This is a good place to start with it's cheap price and its simple gameplay mechanics.			"

												Very fun UNTIL you run out of coal during the war, at which point NO ONE wants to sell any and unless you have a 2 billion dollar coushon your economy is going to tank, this was playing as mexico anyway, basically I've found that there is a lot of skipping to the next turn because you have to skew your build more towards economy than military or research, as far as the actual combat goes, eh not TOO exciting but it'll give you a kick the first few times, however Civ V has better looking combat but less realistic strategy so it's a horse a piece, also if you play as mexico... DO NOT ATTACK THE SMALL PEEPS. IDC HOW TEMPTING IT LOOKS DO NOT. YOU WILL RUIN THE REST OF THE GAME FOR YOURSELF.Solid 7/ 10			"

												When I first got the game for $1.24 on sale, I was shocked at how good the game actually is.For starters, the in game tutorial is relatively good. It teaches the core and advanced concepts of the game, without being too confusing or too long. You can play as any nation in the world, and lead your nation towards world domination, without being forced to play the game historically. The AI also doesn't completely act historical either. In one game, the UK declared war on Russia, when Russia invaded Poland. The game doesn't end at a specific time, while it does say that it has a set amount of max turns, you can continue on and  play indefinitely.The map is easy to navigate, the economy of the game is easy to understand, there are overview windows that display everything your cities and mines are producing so you don’t have to hunt them down individually, and there is an easy to understand tech tree that even my nephew could operate efficiently. In fact, I often play this game with my young nephew and he is able to fully comprehend and play the game (which is a true testament as to how easy to understand the basic concepts are and the controls of the game are.)However, the game is not that easy to win. The AI will take full advantage of its navy, air force, and land armies to efficiently defend themselves, flank your armies, invade your homeland when you lest expect it, and even nuke you if you're not too careful. Another plus, is that the multiplayer in this game doesn’t have lag or syncing issues. The game also runs well on older computers as well, I got it to run rather well on an old 2003 XP laptop of mine.The game also comes with an scenario editor which is easy to use and adds lots of replay value. In essence, this game is somewhat similar to the Hearts of Iron games, except that it’s more simplistic and turn-based. In all, I would highly recommend this game to anyone seeking a sandbox turn-based WW2 strategy game. The game's low price is also a nice plus. However, if you are looking for an extremely in depth realistic game of WW2, I would suggest looking elsewhere.			"

Posted: December 2, 2015
												I find that I usually only write reviews when I don't like a game, but I'm going to force myself to write one for this game, because I feel its one of the best games I've played in this genre.Firstly, the graphics are attractive and detailed, which I find a plus for a war game.  The unit organization is easy to get the hang of, dividing, combining, and renaming armies are quite intuitive.  Supply levels are limited to one type, Arms, which helps you focus strategically instead of trying to micromanage many different kinds of supplies for your armies.Trading is as complicated as you want it to be.  You can just put in trade requests, or you can micromanage the trades as more resources come into the market.  However, trades will be handed off to other parties automatically, which is a benefit if you don't want to pay particular attention to trading.  Although if you don't watch it, you'll find yourself trading with a nation you didn't want to, because they took over some of your 'contracts' so to speak.Improving your infrastructure is easy and involves upgrading your roads, agricultural improvements, and reducing or expanding your mine output.  It keeps it out of your way, and you get easy updates on progress.  This is the same as choosing production, it's easy, and there aren't so many options you can get lost.All of this is a boon to you, because it makes it easier to focus on your strategy and tactics, which to be fair aren't incredibly in depth, but enough that you can benefits for cutting off enemy army supplies (combat penalties), and you can blitz behind combat to disrupt enemy production.  Air units can be assigned to support a battle, or you can target reinforcements, producing cities, attack enemy fleets, provide air cover, they are a help but not overbalanced.  Combat is a bit abstract with the computer AI sometimes splitting up a huge number of units into small groups, it can be hard to maintain a cohesive front, but generally they will try to overcome your largest troop concentration by refocusing their units, so it isn't uncontrollable.Historically the game tries to be accurate, with some events coded into the game, but you can have an immense impact on outcomes, even if you play a smaller nation.  I've had crazy match-ups where Japan allies with America to fight the German and Soviet menace.  You can stall the Nazi menace, or you can join it and help out, you can preempt the entire war and launch an unprovoked attack on the Germans with America, or try flip the world on its head by trying to become an Argentinian Axis super power.  The depth and fluidity of the diplomacy system is also simple, perhaps more simple than it should be, but it works well with the rest of the mechanics.In short, the game is unbeatable at this price, and even if it cost more it's literally pennies per hour of play, and if you get bored of the included scenarios there are a vast amount of user created ones to choose from.  Did I mention the game includes a map/scenario editor?  It does, and if you wanted to create the Drakon world of S.M. Stirling, go ahead.			"

												This game isnt the best strategy game, granted, however it is about World War 2, which is real life history. You can simulate it how you want to, and might be suprised with some of the alliances formed! You can also use the Modern History Editor which allows you to change lots of areas of the game, like territory. So much fun, especially if you are winning! Its definitely worth a buy as it is cheap and fun!			"

												Best 99 cents I've ever spend. I'd have even paid the full price, maybe more for it. At first you might think: ""EWW DIS GAME IS FROM 2007 IZ SO OLD AND DA GRAPHIZ IS♥♥♥♥♥♥♥SO IT MUST BE BAD"". If you think so, you're wrong. It's one of the best games i've ever played, I got addicted from playing the demo and persuaded my friends to buy it too cause they thought the same as I mentioned earlier. But hell, this game is f*cking fun! Play in single- or multiplayer (LAN connection or Hamachi) with maximum 8 players as one if the leading nations in WW2 (Italy, Germany, UK, US, France, China, USSR, Japan) in 6 different scenarios in the time before and in WW2 (20th Jul 1936 - 1st Oct 1945, 1st Sep 1938 - 30th Mar 1939, 1st Sep 1939 - 19th Oct 1945, 1st Aug 1940 - 4th Oct 1945, 7th Dec 1941 - 7th Oct 1945, 6th Jun 1945 - 9th Oct 1945). In singleplayer you can even play as one of the ""smaller"" Nations (afghanistan, spain, etc...). It's really realistic and shows many aspects, not only ""I HAVE MOAR TROOPS SO I WIN BATTLE"" but also how advanced the troops are, how many arms were produced for them and which vehicles support them. Combine war tactics, alliances, production, research and trading on the world market to push up your nation in war. Before you start a game you can either pick if the biggest alliance, nation or ideology wins in the end.TL:DR: Buy it, f*cking buy it. NOW			"

												A very excellent turn-based, global-scale, war-game, with tons of freedom and options.""Making History"" as the title is perfect, because you basically pick out your nation and then engage in World War II. Everything plays out independently. No scripted historical events.You can play starting in different time-frames, but at its heart, the game is a giant ""WW2 sandbox"" game. **NOTE: Although game ""scenarios"" have an ""end-date"", GAME IS ENDLESS. You can keep playing. You can adjust Scenario setttings to customize.Some aspects remind me of:Superpower 2 (RTS game) you can wage war on any nation, make treaties, do whatever you want on a 3D Google-Earth like map.Supreme Ruler 2020 (RTS game) is like that but on flat 3D map, and more complicated, in that you can build unique, individual structures on each territory you control. Making History is sort of like a fusion of both, you don't quite have ""buildings"" on each territory, rather just cities and oil wells mostly on some, but you have all the tools needed to manage each individual territory. Boost production of Goods in Alaska, upgrade farms in Florida, improve infrastructure in New York. Etc.Biggest downside to this is that it's USELESS, and the interface/menu system is cumbersome and confusing. BUT THAT'S OK. The game is actually WAY more simple than you think.The biggest problem most people will have with this game is simply ""overthinking"" the gameWHY?I played as the USA starting around 1935 or 1936, and spent 10 years of game time, actually BALANCING my budget, selling resources to warring alliances, and making a profit; trying to balance trade, etc. HOWEVER, I couldn't figure out how the computer was producing massive amounts of tanks, ships, troops, etc. Not only were the computer players producing them fast, the computer was producing them in large numbers.There was no way I could product as fast without destroying my economy.How could the computer balance it's economy and do this?The answer: IT DIDN'T!YES, the computer nations all went into MAJOR debt. Like a few other strategy games, you can go ""into debt"". If you reach zero, you then go into the red.And NO, your assets don't start getting magically ""sold off"" like in certain other games.No, you still have everything, you just owe a lot of money......to SOMEONE. Who?WHO CARES!SO, when you get this game, FORGET about managing the economy, it's all a waste of time.In this game, when you go into ""debt"", it only lowers the effectiveness of your units and a few things, but I found it rather unnoticeable.ALL YOU HAVE TO DO:Set all of your areas to maximize production.As for what to produce: set about 90% of them to upgrade industry. A city's industry is rated by a simple point system. A city worth 20 industry points, is usually ""Light Industry"". If you set production to whatever ""Industry"" option it has, after X number of turns, it will gain a point. Turns can go fast, so before you know it, it might become ""Heavy Industry"" and later to ""Advanced"" (Advanced can build units others can't, like Advanced tanks, nuke bombers, super-carriers, etc).WHY DO THIS?Because the higher it's industry point rating, the FASTER you can produce units.You'll need to set the rest to produce Research and Transport Capacity (if not enough Transport Capacity points, you won't be able to move all your units overseas at once, they'll have to 'wait for the next ride').That's about it. You'll be spamming out units in no time, and sending them into the grinder of an endless World War. You will go into massive debt, but it doesn't affect gameplay all that much at all.I was like $149 billion or trillion in debt by the end of my game. NO BIG DEAL.That's too bad, but I guess maybe the developers found the economic system too restricting on enjoying the game.That was the problem Supreme Ruler 2020 had, the economy system was made by people who didn't know how economies work. They tried to make it the way they ""envisioned"" only to have it cripple the game (not to mention all the ridiculous click-fest with logistics) that detracted from enjoying the game. Yikes. Making History keeps it simple and let's you focus on gameplay.DIPLOMACY:Very, very limited. It's basically you can join an alliance, leave an alliance, or try to get another country to join in an alliance with you. The computer players will leave/join alliances all the time. Like ""1984"", you'll be at war with mortal enemy ""Eurasia"" for a long time, only until one day, to now be at peace with them, and at war with new mortal enemy ""East Asia"", the next day. This aspect of the game can actually turn out to be pretty fun at times, watching nations for ""super alliances"" and then stab each other in the back. I wish there were more diplomacy options, but this is a war game after all. HAHAHAH.Territories/provinces can also break off and become part of a new nation.You can even grant independence to conquered areas and make them an alliance, you'll see new nations formed frequently. You'll see Nazi Germany maybe take over Ireland and form a Nazi Ireland. Or Soviets take over India and form Communist India.There are competing ideologies in the game that are visible and those with similar ideologies will favor relations with each other over others.CONTROL:Controlling armies is EASY. You just click on a unit, and tell it where to go. Sort of like the Europa Universalis games. Only thing, sometimes, seems like units not moving but it's really they need time to cross out of large territory and enter next one. In those EU games, you'll see a meter or bar that shows progress but no in this one. Not a big deal, just a cosmetic thing.You can also stack and split units, so no problem there.NO NEED to load units on ships or anything. When you tell them to go overseas, they are automatically converted into a ""ship"" fleet unit. Of course, they are weak. Best to clear the way or have ships patrolling the zones they must go through to stop enemy raiders.EDITOR:The game comes with an editor so you can make your own mod/world, edit unit stats, edit countries, anything. Can be a bit cumbersome to put together. People have made some online you can download through developer's site. I haven't tried any though.CONS:-The economic system, while totally useless, the menus/navigating suck. You won't use it much anyways, but finding out it's useless after wasting so much time, was frustrating ""You mean I don't have to manage any of this, I can go into trillions of dollar in debt and still fight on just fine?!"" I hear the ""Gold"" version of this game, makes the menus easier. -Nukes! You can build ICBM and mobile-nuke units, HOWEVER, they fight like regular units, that only do major damage; but they are weak and get destroyed easily. STRATEGIC NUKE BOMBERS are the only ""real"" nuke units. You can direct them to nuke a city. If it succeeds, the city is permanently destroyed. It will just be ruins without any production ability. -Subs can't be set to auto-defend an area. If an enemy surface ship enters water area you have a surface ship in, they automatically fight. If you have a sub, they don't fight. You have to manually order them, which enables enemies to sail right by. FAIL!-Loading game, you have to remember to reselect your nation. You can load your saved game, play as other nation. By default, the nation you saved game playing as should already be selected.If you're looking for some ""historically accurate"" WW2 game, you can forget about it.It's MAKING HISTORY: you make your own history---ITS FUN TO DO!The game goes on for however long it takes for you to reach your goal.I conquered the entire world around 1957. I had modern supercarriers and jet fighters by that time, 638 warships, like 1300 armored divisions.Very rewarding game.			"

												Baby's first grand strategy game.Unlike the massive Hearts of Iron, Making History is a GSG that doesn't take at least 5 years and 2 blood sacrifices to understand. Its a fun little timewaster in wich you take on the role of any nation between 1933 till about 1980 (altough tech level stays at 50s or so) or something and try not to ♥♥♥♥ up. If you play well enough, you can turn any nation into a global government. However, most of the fun comes from the ""realistic"" changes in world history.Imagine: As the USA, you don't involve yourself in the war because you aint gonna help Europe with their little argument again. Welp, prepare to be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by a combination of Japanese, Germans, Italians and the Soviet Union. Soviet Union? Yes, Soviet Union.

												This is a great game, though it does get tiring clicking on so many cities once you get large enough. The difficulty curve makes sense. If you want to face resistance, go ""normal"". If you want a real war, go ""hardest"". But if you just want to have fun and conquer the world, choose ""easiest"" difficulty and choose Germany.Overall, this is an enjoyable game, save for two things: the aforementioned monotonous clicking and a very, very annoying bug that makes it impossible to play the game due to an error concerning the game's apparent inability to find its own engine. When this happens, the only thing that will help is to restart Steam in Administrator mode and launch it from there. It should work then.			"

												In short a more detailed version of RISK or less detailed version of HoI. It's short points are the turn based nature of the game, lack of options and generally feeling unpolished. There are no real fronts to speak of, just spamming units into select battles and hoping you come out on top with few technologies in the game and very basic units. It doesn't really suit casual gamers because there's some depth to the mechanics but also doesn't really suit hardcore gamers because of how unbalanced combat is.			"

												I had only played the Gold version before and now that I picked this gem on Steam for under a euro I can say - they are very different. At first I thought that the only difference is the lack of some campaign scenarios - mainly the one that starts at 1933 and gives you so much time to develop them unstoppable armies! But after I played one of the shorter ones I came to some conclusions: the color palettes are a bit off and not so smooth on my eyes - easily changed in the Gold version the infrastructure is VERY slow to develop - really 72 turns to upgrade one level? And I thought Gold taking 17 turns was slow. HUGE maintenance costs! Why spend 1/5th of the campaign in upgrading a slot if in the end it will cost half your GDP to maintain? No such problem in Gold. at first I thought ""Why does research cost so little points? Now I can pump Heavy tanks before everyone else!"" - yeah but no - research is compleatly RNG based so even at full IPU those 25 research poins can take 100+ turns to make... all units have only one combat ""value"" which makes gameplay blunt as it doesn't matter what armies you build. In Gold each unit has Attack and Defense - this for instance makes infantry very hard to deal with and while tanks have huge attack power they are probably the first to fall in battle due to low defense. a lot of other nitpicks that I could point out but they aren't that gamebreaking.What I am trying to get at is this - there are a lot of balance issues with the game but chances are unless you've played the Gold version, you might not notice some at all and thats good. Just letting you know there is a better version out there that is  currently not on Steam. That being said I still think this series is amazing.5/108/10 for Making History: The Calm & the Storm Gold EditionEdit: Gold is LIVE on Steam! Pick it up!			"

												 Outstanding game! I would recommend playing on the easier level at first to get a feel for the game, unless you have played this type of game before. I enjoy it more than Hearts of Iron. If you’re an action game player you may not like it. But give it a try you may find something you didn’t know you liked. I enjoy the fact you can play different Nations and play in different modes and levels. The outcome is not fixed and will depend on what you do in the game. I have put in a lot of hours on the game and still enjoy it. It’s not just a war game, you have to balance you economy and trade while building your nations Industry and bring you Armed forces up to strength. For example when playing the USA your nation has just came out of the great depression. Playing China you start with fighting to overturn Communist China and then Japan, will probable attack you. A fun game that is playable with several nations.  You can play to win with Alliance Power Points, Ideology Power Points, or Nation Power Points.  I highly recommend this game.

This game is not working period, the license key issue is ridiculous. Either steam, the maker, or both need to make this good. If not it is a blatant theft of customer money. It is not up to the customer to do this that and the other to make the product work, it was purchased as presented and should work as such, period. Anything else is ridiculous, and again, a rip off of customers who bought product in good faith. Something needs to be done on the maker or distributor end, one denies it can do anything, the other says it isnt their issue. Well someone is responsible and its not the customer. This needs to get fixed or taken to another place for satisfaction. I for one do not appreciate being blatantly ripped off.			"

												ENG:The game is currently the best in my opinion, but also realistic version of turn-based strategy game, with involvement of the egologia, as well as the state economy. The game also will be able to play in their own State, and the impact on the game completely all potential economic and course of the war. Most similar games such as Civilization game or beyon Earth game, so this also includes similar elements such as industry or army updating with the difference that they have been implemented in this game better. How so?Above all, I personally very much appreciate the simplicity but, versatility, and it is in this well executed, as opposed to a series of civilization, and that's why I like the game, even better than more of the same game. That's why I like this game!Includes also quite functional map editor. I highly recommend, especially if you like to play with friends. Forced purchase startegia games lovers, referral! 3(See also the newer version of the game)FIN:Kyseinen peli on mielestäni tällä hetkellä paras mutta, myös realistinen versio vuoropohjaisesta strategia pelistä, jossa on mukana myös egologia sekä valtiotalouden kehittämisestä. Pelissä pystyy pelaamaan myös omalla valtiolla ja vaikuttaa pelissä täysin kaikkeen mahdolliseen talous ja sodan kulkuun. Useimmat vastaavat pelit kuten Sivilisaatio peli tai Beyon Earth peli niin, tämä sisältää myös vastaavia elementtejä kuten teollisuuden tai armejan päivittämistä sillä erotuksella että, ne on toteutettu tässä pelissä paremmin. Kuinka niin?Ennen kaikkea minä itse arvostan hyvinpaljon yksinkertaisuutta mutta, monipuolisuutta ja se on tässä toteutettu hyvin, toisinkuin siviilisaatio sarjassa ja siksi pidän peliä, jopa parempana kuin useampi vastaava peli. Siksi pidän tästä pelistä!Sisältää myös varsin toimivan karttaeditorin. Suosittelen eritoten jos tykkää pelata kaverien kanssa. Pakko hankinta startegia pelien ystäville, suositteluni! :3(Katso myös uudempi versio pelistä)			"

												Great game, and well worth it's asking price. The Calm & the Storm is somewhat of a mix between total war and risk. Of course there are no real time battles to speak of but that does make the game more calculating in the fact that you don't really control the outcomes of battles.Positives:Many times you will fight your own world war II fighting for power and struggling for dominance! The A.I. is great with unrelenting force they will plow through an opening in your defenses and quickly consolodate their forces if you attak.On a player VS COMP map you will quickly realize how aggresive the A.I is. You can no longer declare war on all the weaker nations and exspect the world powers to not respond. You then will have to face down pretty much anyone who is not allied with you for the desperate resource grabbing to keep your war machine up.In this way the game makes it's greatest sucess at a slower paced game with a good amount of tension.Negatives: There is a ♥♥♥♥ing lot of themThe game of course has it's flaws and should not be overlooked. Me being the man I am could not handle mainstreaming WWII as germany or the U.S. so I liked to play as smaller nations who can barely hold their own. All to quickly you will realize this is impossible as the major players like Germany and the U.S. have WAY too much under their belt from the get go and will trample you if you dare attack anyone they like.The game also gets repetitive. Fast. If you like WWII games than you will find this game able to last you a long time but that does not change the fact that A.I. have limitations and will work together to fight the player being as superior as you are rather than the German Facists who are right at their doorstep.The diplomacy as with pretty much any stratagy game is underdeveloped and lacks any real options.The trade seems unfair, almost designed so you have to give up on something to get anything (which is realistic, but does not help the gameplay) you almost can never have enough goods or especially arms to get you anywhere. AND GOD FORBID you have a large army and try to produce arms for it. Your resources (most notably your oil) will go down so damn fast that you can't hold it up for more that 10 turns.Games are over relatively quickly in this game(we are talking 2-3 hours max) and don't even have a ""turn limit off"" or a ""Conquest"" game mode. Though the game does help itself by allowing you to keep playing indefinately even after the game has ended. So a ""kinda"" conquest modeYou are gonna wan't to play with other players. Preferably people you know so you can set up rules and have an actually fun time. (randoms don't bring the thrill of fighting your friends.)Also while you do struggle sometimes. Once you get a hold of this game it can be pretty easy to play so I would recommend turning that default difficulty up a notch.Final Verdict:This game is worth buying for five dollars but no more. I would actually recommend you buy one of the newer Making Historys as I have heard/read that they have adressed many of these issues.Still when I picked up this game it was less than a dollar. (like 78 cents) and that was a steal for this game so if you a money grubber like me. Wait for the sale to happen again or just pay the damn five dollars I mean I payed over 9 dollars in copies for my friends to play with me because they are struggling hard right now. But I repeat For FIVE DOLLARS this game is well worth it. So pick it up now and relive WWII while you still got the motivation in you.OFF TO THE BATTLEFIELD!!!			"

												This game has amazing depth, if you just want to jump in and conquer the world, stay away. But if you are willing to spend a bit of time learning the intricacies of this game then you are in for a blast. This game allows you to play as EVERY country that was around during WWII, this sounds great but you will be forced to play as one of the major superpowers as the other countries are just useless. I was playing as Republican Spain, Thinking I could conquer the world as spain but I was disapointed to find out that my army was useless against most other countries and I had to limit myself to winning the civil war. This was very anoying but it is historicly acurate, so I guess it makes up for the lack of options.War is not the only path, you can stay neutral and watch other countries fight it out (not very fun :( )The UI is a bit outdated but the game mechanics more than make up for it.Conclussion: If you are willing to spend some time learning how this game works then you will have a blast9/10, would buy again............. it cost me 90 cents :)			"

In a nutshell you play as a country in the WWII era. Do you want to invade Mexico as America right when you start the game? Go ahead, want to invade Germany as Poland? Be my guest.I r8 this 8/8 m8			"

												Yeah game AI were so smart. In 1941 Axis keep pushing Russia and not declare war on America so they can won easier. Russia had fallen. Europe covered in gray. Me (Britain) were the last allied left (Last useful allied). Canada sit there and send me a little aid. America reject my alliance treaty because they don't want to be in war. Japan control the whole Asia. The last hope are lost. The last light that shine into my country was.... My freaking flying junk that scare the crap out of the Luffwaffe and make their pilot eject from their plane in he sky. I can kill almost all luffwaffe in a month. After that my last 3 Fleet get out of the port and freak the hell out of their convoy and kill almost half of their Army and Navy. ( I still can't figure out why they still send 1-3 ships a time so i can kill them and get back to repair and come out again.) Then I deploy the D-Day operation one maybe Febuary (Without the help from US). Then forward though Berlin Spain then Romania Bulgaria Ukraine Tibet and the last... Japan. The AI always join the alliance that has the highest change to win( They were smart I think). I have to sorry for the Japan because after I can take the Japan main land I send the peace treaty for them so they can have their land back and become democracy but the Russia reject that. Sorry for you Japan     :{This is my second reviews thank for readingPS   :Sorry for bad EnglishPS 2:Britain were so weak at ground force but they neary can't be invaded as long as they control all beach head.

												Game stops working after first run. I attempted to fix it, but was not successful after trying multiple methods. I have read post of people with similar problems, both more recent and in the past so I assume the publisher also does no care about the issue. Unfortunate, but it was less then the cost of a coffee at Tims so no big deal (although I would have preferred the coffee)			"

												Alright, I believe I've clocked enough hours into this game to safely say this is absolutely fantastic.I have never loved a grand strategy game more, and honestly, I am usually very hard on these types of games. Most of them are either too limiting or too complicated for me. This one has the perfect recipe of simplicity and very complex design. Here's a short story based on one of my games:The U.S. sat back as Germany was taking over Europe, they knew it would happen but weren't yet ready to fight back, it wasn't an immediate danger to them anyway. Finally after years of research they developed nuclear weaponry and ICBMs. They were ready to take down Germany. A message was sent the the UK asking for permission to use their land to launch the nukes from to finally help put an end to this war, but the requested was rejected and met with a declaration of war. So the U.S. nuked London then Germany invited the U.S. into their alliance. The U.S. sent hundreds of tanks straight into the UK and took over then basically sat back and watched as Germany took over the rest of Europe with Italy's help. There is a lesson here, always give the U.S. permission to launch nukes off your territory. :D			"

												The menus and gameplay are completely unintuitive, that combined with the complete lack of tutorials make this game absolutely no fun. The game has many mechanics, including: resource gathering, diplomacy, various combat types (infantry, airplanes, ships, & artillery), however, there is never any clear indication of what is going on. Perhaps there is a good game buried within somewhere, I for one do not have the desire to research and explore all the various stats and options, nor the desire to untangle the complete mess of menus given.

												I have bought this only as it's on 0.59€.It's a good game, it has a normal learning curve (it has taken me only 1h to understand all its mechanics) and it's a good alternative to HOI. What those games lack is a real time fight (there was one in a game called ""War Leaders"" but it was abandoned by the devs unfortunately). I would recommend it only for the current price on sale as there is much better around. "

												I have dug around 130+ hours into this game. And it is great.I bough it for less than a pound so basically anything I got out of it is profit. So what is the game like?Well, you can play as any nation that existed in 1936 through to the end of the second worl war. As for accuracy it is definitely a massive no. All countries have access to the same units (if researched) so itdoesn't matter if you are Chillie or Germany, your heavy tanks and aircraft are just the same. The unitsappearance does differ depending on your country so that is something. As for strategy it is pretty simple.Keep your arms production up and it is litterally the biggest army wins. Very little benefit for combined arms.Why the hell then, did I I sink so many hours into it then?Because It is so simple it is a great game to play when there's not much to do, you don't have to think aboutit or anything.

And if it does it will probably do it IF you make a lot of strange things (log in as steam administrator, restart the pc, make a prayer to Zeus, sacrifice a couple of virgins and then maybe, maybe it will work).Sorry guys, I buy all my games on Steam (or similar services) in order to avoid issues like that. If I have to become a programmer I would downloaded the game from a Torrent site, At least it would have been free.Hope that review will prevent a few people from wasting their money.Personally even though I love strategy games Muzzy Lane is on my personal black list.

												This is horrible, I was very excited to get the full game as I had the demo before, but after I got it, it just says ""Installation Key not found. Please try reinstalling the game."". After I reinstall it, it just keeps on happening again. I know I got it for only 0.99, but any game that costs money should work.			"

JK there army was destroyed faster than my army Losing hope I asked for France and britians help they help meThey did and France and Britian saved the day not really they just held the USSR off for a bitSo then I ask for America to join the war they didnt until Britian asked So then USSR and America had a huge war btw this took about a hour and USA won Then I put this in a WW 2 history test at school I failed and I asked how I failed and my history teacher said it was made up and I said it isnt it was on a game then I got an hour detention for answering my teacher back 10/10 would do it all again "

												An interesting take on alternative WWII strategy and history. The only problem is that scripted events vs randomised events sometimes make no strategic, ideological or economical sense. But, hey, this one is closer to Risk than to Hearts of Iron series. Still, it is worth checking out.			"

												I first came across this game in my GCSE History textbook where it mentioned that video-game simulations can help historians to explore what would have happened if one key event had been changed. I proceeded to buy the game as it was very cheap (And still is) and was immediately thrown into the shoes of Stalin and had to fight off Nazi Germany alongside the U.S.A and Britain. If you're a history lover or a stratedgy lover then this is definitely the game for you as this little cheap and relitively unknown game ranks highly in my top games of all time. During one playthrough (The one I mentioned before) I had at least 20 hours of gameplay and ended up ending the game in 1979 when Europe was dominated by the U.S.S.R and the U.S.A and it had reached a massive stalemate in the Cold War where the U.S.A had a far superior military force which I (The U.S.S.R) could not match, without the use of nuclear weapons. Instead I had proceeded to go to war with Britain (Somehow the U.S.A didn't intervene) although this war went nowhere, apart from Russia capturing most of Britain's colonies in Asia and Africa. Britain resisted every attempt for a landing on British soil, so I ended the war with London being nuked, causing Britain to surrender. 9/10 - Would dictate again.			"

												The ecenomy system in this game is horribly broken, this is painfully obviouse when you play as a small country. A great example is when you play as Iraq, you have basicaly no food and almost nothing to trade with which means you amass huge amounts of debt.The weirdest thing being even if your people are starving they still reproduce like mad causing an even bigger deficit. So unless you play as one of the superpowers of the world there is no way to actually play the game, which makes me feel the game is incomplete. So save your money look for a good digital risk game, or perhaps you can find axis and allies?			"

												The ecenomy system in this game is horribly broken, this is painfully obviouse when you play as a small country. A great example is when you play as Iraq, you have basicaly no food and almost nothing to trade with which means you amass huge amounts of debt.The weirdest thing being even if your people are starving they still reproduce like mad causing an even bigger deficit. So unless you play as one of the superpowers of the world there is no way to actually play the game, which makes me feel the game is incomplete. So save your money look for a good digital risk game, or perhaps you can find axis and allies?			"

												The game is a valiant first attempt at a World War 2 grand strategy game, but it falls apart on a number of levels.  Its diplomatic model is obtuse, and unable to actually reflect events of the period (when one person in an alliance is at war, it's all in, so you can't have Italy's late entry or Japan being part of the Axis but not at war), the combat model is reasonable enough - simple but effective - but production is a mess (it's hard to tell, but it looks like you need the same amount of consumer goods whether you're at war or not), and the UI gets pretty fiddly.  On top that, the starting force set-ups are incredibly ahistorical (Germany starts with a larger army than UK and France combined, in 1936!).  It's too complicated to be accessible, and too simple (and ahistorical) to draw in enthusiasts of the period.			"

I won't bother with ""pros and cons"" here, or otherwise break down my reasoning behind this ""review"". I played this game long enough to realize that I was permanently bored with it after the first five minutes. Chalk it up to its lack of depth or uninspired foundation, or blame it on my upbringing, hell you could even blame the Federal Reserve, but regardless of however you figure I arived at this point, I just won't recommend this game,2 out of 10 Would buy it again if they promised not to make any more games			"

												The watered down Hearts of Iron model that emulates Axis and Allies is admirable, but the broken diplomacy and logistics mechanics ruin the game. Communist China can be liberated by Japan to become fascist. Countries will declare war on you even if buffer states are in the way. You can't test factories to see how long they'll take to produce something else without actually resetting the original production process in case you don't like how long your option would take. This is especially awful with gearing. If you produce the same item back to back, you get a production discount, but that discount disappears from testing. If you want to ally with someone, but another member of your alliance disapproves, you're screwed. Alliances only come in the way of coalitions. You can't end up with complicated situations like what happened with Finland or Poland in real life between the Western allies and the Soviets. You also can't end up with complicated situations like how Germany and Japan signed alternating neutrality pacts with the Soviets while the other one was fighting it. Latin America often screws things up because of this too. Don't be surprised if Argentina or Brazil get you into trouble. This is especially awful when trying to liberate countries too. If you and another country like America and Britain invade someone like France, you can't liberate your territories on your own if you don't capture the capital. Transferring becomes possible only after you annex territories instead of simply occupying them, and you can't annex until a war is over. Some countries like Germany won't surrender until completely conquered, so you're stuck until the very end of the war. Furthermore, you have to feed and supply them based on penalized farming and factories that can't produce 100% food or goods like if they were liberated. This can be a serious drain on your economy.The opposite situation also applies in case you and someone like Germany and Italy invade France. The computer is very reluctant to transfer territories even if you're in a strongarm position. If Italy grabs some wealthy or connecting territories you want while allied, then you can't tell him to give them to you because the AI's so stubborn. This is especially important when fortifying the Atlantic Wall to prevent the D-Day counterattack. Italy can leave major gaps in your line. Also, you can technically sign peace treaties that force countries to change ideology (like how Vichy France became fascist, or how post-war West Germany became democratic), but this rarely ever works. The computer forces other computer countries to change ideology all the time, but it will never listen to you. Oh... and don't get me started on transport capacity either when trying to ferry troops across oceans and seas. There's no way at all to tell if you have not enough or too much transport capacity. It's a guessing game the whole way through. The same thing goes for figuring out how strong your relationship needs to be with another country to directly buy or sell resources so you don't have to gamble with free trade over time. Aid never works either. The United States won't help Britain defend against the blitz... not that Germany will even try it. It hardly ever tries to take Africa, and Italy always fails miserably. Britain never retakes the Middle East either. Iraq and Iran always remain independent. Heck, it usually takes South Africa to liberate Ethiopia......and don't even try to invade China as Japan. The computer always does it, but it knows how much TC it needs.There are just major issues with this game. It doesn't really work unless you want to play as the Germans or Russians to conquer the world, and don't want to ally the Japanese in the process since they'll make issues for you with overlapping British, French, Dutch, and American Pacific colonies. Just buy HoI when it's on sale. You can get HoI2 or 3, Arsenal of Democracy, or Darkest Hour for a couple bucks when it is. This game tries to simplify things, but it makes a mess in the process.

												Yet another game trying to ride another games coat tails; this game tries it's best to duplicate what Hearts of Iron and it's ilk do. Although graphics aren't the emphasis of these types of games they are pretty weak. The controls are servicable but it's all trial and error since there is no real tutorial. The AI's decision making is fairly random making strategy difficult in the early going and playing as any country aside from the major powers is basically impossible.

												George and Martha are a middle aged married couple, whose charged relationship is defined by vitriolic verbal battles, which underlies what seems like an emotional dependence upon each other. This verbal abuse is fueled by an excessive consumption of alcohol. George being an associate History professor in a New Carthage university where Martha's father is the President adds an extra dimension to their relationship. Late one Saturday evening after a faculty mixer, Martha invites Nick and Honey, an ambitious young Biology professor new to the university and his mousy wife, over for a nightcap. As the evening progresses, Nick and Honey, plied with more alcohol, get caught up in George and Martha's games of needing to hurt each other and everyone around them. The ultimate abuse comes in the form of talk of George and Martha's unseen sixteen year old son, whose birthday is the following day.Review paid for by: Nabisco			"

This game is very fun, being able to play and command all the major countries during WW2 was a blast for me, I especially had fun playing this with a couple friends of mine, playing as the allies, or the axis taking over the world and establishing different government tupes throughout this strategy game, though it would've been nice if they added a few more features to it.

												I like modding, like messing around with events and scenarios. This lets me do that, which is awesome.The gameplay is simple, but sadly the AI is simpler. Had the AI been good in this game, i would have easily held it above Hearts of Iron II. Sadly it isn't.No clue why i got this on steam, probably in a bundle. Truth is i got this from another digital vendor, and played easily over 500 hours. (you can probably add 500 hours of modding to it aswell) If you like modding and messing around with games, and have grown tired of doing so with Hearts of Iron, then why not pick this up for kicks. (Just stay away from MH II, its got even more horrible AI)6/10 for non mod lovers, 7/10 for modders and mod downloadersThere's fun to be had, if you can get yourself to ignore its flaws ;)			"

												one of my most favorite games, probably.its just like civilization without the supervisors that tell you about stuff. i wish there was a setting to turn them off.it is a bit low on the research of items which is the only con i have of it that and the difficulties to find the one last country the enemy has and you look for 100 turns for the AI to get the victory, but nevermind that back the the research that i really want to talk about.there may not be much and the nukes were a bit of a let down, it takes forever to get them, so you'll play for a long time and get your moneys worth. i played for about 1000 turns (a normal game is only 480 if you start with the lowest time period) in one game to get all the research done with about half the would generating research.sould you buy it?if you like long games about world war 2 and cite builders i guess it was fun and ill certainly continue to play it and hope friends get it too.

												Bought this for a dollar and to my surprise it is a very fun little game. Immersive and challenging enough to keep you interested but not overly complex. Now this is not a big name game like Total War or Civ but for a cool little WW 2 game I would say it is worth way more than a dollar. I am sure I will be buying the Gold edition for five just wanted to try it out. What is cool is playing like Argentina and becoming the Hitler of South America. Found normal setting too hard and easy setting too easy. I noticed it is best just not joining an alliance there seem to be some war weary mechanics built in so that once you take over a country still being at war with ten other countries this seems to take its toll. Watched some youtube on how to play also there is an in game trainer. "

												Not too micro managed and yet still  challenging. Dislike not having the sway of a changing in hand Government. Would like to see the ability to sway government to desired policy ie. Pumping money into propaganda to turn say Mother Russia into democratic Capatalist from communism and still remain in control without changing into NPC faction. One thing this game lacks is a check box when in control of a territory to have a supply kill switch. population control ie. no food  = starvation decrease population. China needs vast amounts of food. Just some ideas for anyone that understands how to create mods. "

												So I started out playing this game as the United States and naturally decided that I wanted to conquer Mexico, so I did. After that I kept going down until I hit South America and I stopped there. After that I decided I needed an ally so of course I chose Japan. The Japanese and I started taking over China when I decided to send Germany an alliance invite, they accepted and continued to roll through Europe. Eventually Italy asked to join my alliance so I accepted and they helped Germany start to take Europe. Eventually the UK got ticked off and declared war on us. It didn't bother me because I knew I had the better alliance but what I didn't realize while I was taking over China, was that Canada started invading my borders and took some states from me. Well I couldn't have that so I gathered some tanks and conquered Canada in a matter of turns. During this whole time Germany keeps sending Brazil invites to our alliance but Brazil kept refusing. I got sick of that and promptly invaded and took over Brazil.During this whole ordeal Russia has sat there quietly refusing my alliance invites until the last couple of turns. Russia has started taking small European countries at an alarming rate. I probably need to declare war on them soon before they get to big. 10/10 Would start the Axis Powers again			"

												Do not buy this game if you have a job, a girlfriend/wife or any kind of social life, this game will make you stay up much later than you intend, make you cancel time with your mates, and cause you to ignore your other half for hours.I mean I got this game when it is on sale for 99p, and I feel guilty, cause this game is worth considerably more than that.If you like Turn Based Strategy games you will love this game.My only advice would be buy it when you have a week off, because you will play this game with the intention of only playing an hour or so and next thing you'll look at the clock and it will be 5am.

												While the game may look simple, it is deep and it allows you to quickly dive into it and have fun playing out the modifiable scenarios in both singleplayer and multiplayer realms. I bought the game becuase it's strategy and at the time of writing this, it was on sale. I did not expect this game to be this good. Even if you pay the full five dollars you will still get alot of good fun out of this game because it far outweighs the value of the price tag. Spoole, if you read this, choose this game for 1 Dollar 1 Hour. If you like strategy, WWII, or historical games, just pick this up because you're going to have a great time.Was great until the Invalid License Key came up.			"

												This game gets a 9.2/10 from me.This story explains my progress so far.This review will be based off my progress around the entire year of 1939.The small country of Romania was a peaceful place which was surrounded by multiple smaller countries apart from Poland, Yugoslavia, and the USSR.Italy then declares war on Greece, giving Romania a good chance to expand south and establish some love between Italy & Romania.Romania joins the Italian Alliance to help defeat Greece, but Bulgaria won't agree to a Military Access pact.Romania annexs Bulgaria.Germany likes what they see.Germany joins the Italian Alliance against Greece.Romania pushes further south into Greece.Romania recieves unexpected air support from Germany and Italy.Romania captures mainland Greece.Romania begins building naval transports.Germany is declaring war on smaller countries like Denmark up north.Romania begins to worry that the British alliance might not like that.Romania begins to worry about the relationship towards the USSR.USSR invades Finland.British Alliance decides that is too far and declares war on USSR.Romania must decide if the Italian alliance will join the USSR against the British Alliance or the British Alliance against the USSR.Romania still waits for naval transports.Romania realizes that Turkey is tasty.Romania begins thinking of Turkey.Turkey begins to cry.Romania merges most of its military might along with our one and only destroyer which is a sad excuse for Romanian navy along the border of Turkey.Romanian naval transports still being built.Mexican standoff between Communist China - China - Japan.Romania decides to invite Japan to Italian alliance.Japan joins Italian alliance.Italian alliance is now hostile towards Chinese alliance.All of these events led up to this:Bulgaria is ded (Press G for respecks)Greece has some islands left & joins Chinese alliance. (Oh nu)Chinese alliance is formed including Communist China, China, and Greece. (Much wow)British alliance pokes USSR with stick. (Wonder how that'll go)Finland is having giant naval battle with USSR. (No way could they fight my one destroyer . . . I cri)United States is building death fleet. (GG)All in all, an amazing stage is set between the Chinese Alliance + Greece, the British alliance, the USSR, and the Italian Alliance.Oh and Turkey is still crying.This game is very lovely, the only thing that would top my interest would be more intimate combat systems & an achievement system. A more simple type of Hearts of Iron, and a bit faster than HoI.Much love & very much worth the five dollars.			"

Relatively easy once you have learned the basics, from then on your way to conquer the world is achievable, there's not only one way, but many others.I love that you can edit in a seperate program, for those that like it, creating unlimited troops and artillery is also an option, as well as changing diplomatic relations, for example, Alliances.You can change the course of the world within a few clicks, the game is based much on how you act and how you handle situations, for a few dollars this is much appreciated, (I'm sad when I lost as Germany, I had whole EU & almost US, but the Japs betrayed me) "

It is very simple but also has a large depth layer beneath for anyone willing or wanting to tap into that. The customization of pretty much everything is also something that i liked and just the plain old messing with history.Anything you want done, it can happen. Japan wins the war in the pacific sure, Italy is the main member of the Axis forces in Europe not Germany, Why not. I reccomend this game to anyone who just wants to mess around, wants a game that can be both serious and casual, or is into management of anykind. 10/10			"

												Awesome Game!!! No doubt.A steal for the £0.79 i got it for!Only two problems being that loading multiplayer games seems to be bugged and invading France as Britain seems impossible but other than that it seems great!!!!			"

												Perfect for those who want to mess up with History (Like DESTROYING THE NAZI ) cue the *Evil Laugh*This game requires :know's a great strategy (especially when crossing the carribean sea. Damn Those American Navy!)know's how to manage the money (Really, because there is a penalty if you have a loan in the World Bank) XDHow To Handle A Country (because you have to upgrade the cities to gain more IPU, to produce more product)andKNOW HOW TO KILL ALL ZI NAZI!!! (Hail Hydra!) "

												If you like Hearts of Iron and grand strategy than this is a game for you...It is great for multiplayer because its simple by design and runs smooth on everything.Complexity is well balanced for MP, its a dressed down version of hearts of iron but still way more complex than lets say Axis & allies or Risk. So it pleases Grognards for a while and at the same time it does not make the entry into strategy gaming to difficult for newbies on the frontline. The downside is that the lack of complexity makes this only a 50-100 hour game before all are features mastered, so for single players i would advice part 2 which offers all the depth needed to expiriment for a few hundred hours more.For multi player this is much better because of the fast pace AND the lack of complexity makes drinking beer together while Lan gaming easier it doesnt require you to remember a thousand economy settings and battle orders/strategies			"

												First ever review. I love this game. Got it for 50p months ago, and I love it more than any other games I have purchased deposited it being the cheapest!!!The AI is challenging, very historical and if you are going to purchase this game, it is best to not play as Poland, Czechoslovakia or Austria after 1936 ;)			"

												I did not really know what to expect when I bought this game. I bought it  because of the 80 % off deal at the moment. Now I can say: I really recommend this game to players that love turn based strategy games, specifically people that love WW2 turn based strategy games because you can replay WW2 but there is more. You can play as any country you want. This means that you can change history. I also recommend to download custom scenarios or make your own scenarios because you can change anything you want. You can making countries bigger or give them more power. You can even make your own country. So what are you waiting for. Get the game for only €0,79!			"
