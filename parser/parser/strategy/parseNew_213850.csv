												This version doesn't have the best base game decks.This version doesn't have the best DLC decks.This version is still the best Magic The Gathering game to buy on Steam.How can this be?Magic 2014 has the best modding community for any of the Magic games on Steam. http://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=109You can get all the decks from 2010, 2012, 2013, and even a few from 2015 in this game for free. Also, there are lots of other custom decks and custom cards that have been made. If you don't like what the community has made, there are great modding tools to make your own cards/decks. Installation of the mods couldn't be easier, because it is nothing more than drag and drop.All of the modded decks can be used in online play(assuming your opponent also has the modded deck you are using). There is even an online community focused on playing with modded content, so you will be able to find an opponent, even when using the unofficial content.The actual gamemodes are more of the same from the previous games in the series. The new gamemode is ""Sealed"" play, which is a total ripoff and should be ignored after you use your base game plays. Sealed is not enough like the IRL counterpart, to justify actually spending money on those DLC.There are lots of purely cosmetic DLC, in the form of Foil Cards. They are completely pointless, aside from looking shiny. There is even an option to disable seeing the Foil skins on the cards that other people use, if you dislike their inclusion in the game. There is also a bunch of Deck Key DLC, which is nothing more than ""skip the grinding"" DLC. The Deck Key DLC should be skipped, as you can just use Cheat Engine, a Trainer, or sharing a gamesave to get all the cards without having to spend money or hours grinding.The only DLCs that are worth buying are the Expansion Pack, and Deck Packs 1-3, since these are expanding the content of the game. Expansion Pack adds 5 more decks, and adds more content to the base game's gamemodes. Deck Packs 1-3 each add 2 more decks to the game. These 4 DLC give you slightly more than double the number of decks of the base game.  Luckily, Stainless Games has given the bundled option of all 4 of these DLC with the base game for a cheaper price than buying them separately. This bundle is called Gold Game, and is going to be the wisest way to purchase this game now.Magic 2014 is more than just a dumb nerd game. There is a surprising amount of depth to playing, without the need to buy dozens of IRL cards. Easy to learn, hard to master.As an added bonus, you can enter promotional codes to get some extra cards for all 21 decks. I had to enter each of the codes a few times to get them to properly unlock the extra cards, but they will unlock with a few tries. Check the ""Problems"" section if you are unable to get the promotional codes to work. 


ALL 10 Promo Codes / TODOS los Códigos Promo 
A Guide for Magic 2014

			You need to finish the campaing first and then under the main menu select: Extras, Promotional unlocks, Enter code. You may need to turn Server-Driven Content located in Help and Options, Settings.		


 If that guide does not work, the excellent modding community I mentioned before has found another work around for getting the promotional cards.http://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=62&t=10898 "

												This game is horrible. Nothing different from MtG 2012 or 2013. Which I was okay with. All I wanted was the ability to build my own decks with the new ""Sealed Deck"" Gametype and duel the computer. Maybe let the computer play one of my own decks. That would be cool, too.But that wasn't happening. You can only play ""Sealed Deck"" twice until you have to buy new slots for your custom decks. No deleting decks allowed. After you draw your boosters, those boosters are locked to your acccount, and you can't shake them or Re-draft (Start from scratch). You have to buy more slots from WoTC. This is a money grab, plain and simple.When I dug into it, I found out their reasoning was for ""Online Play"", they didn't want people to sit around and re-roll decks to get the perfect combination and head to the top of the Online Ladder, so they locked cards in place. But then they let you re-roll decks anyway, however you have to ""Buy Slots"". Which means, people will still be doing the same thing -- sitting around and re-rolling decks to get the perfect cards. The only difference? They have to shell out three bucks everytime they do it, now. So, we can clearly see why they put this mechanism into place.Which is the dumbest part. I suck at programming, but I know a monkey could seperate online from offline play and let me reroll my sealed decks, even if its just against the computer. But, they opt not to. Because they want your money. I'm not joking when I say I beat the Single Player campaign within an afternoon (3 hours), and when I found out I couldn't Re-Roll decks, I uninstalled this application and rebooted MTG 2012. It's a more solid / balanced game with more fun decks, and Planechase is Worlds Better than the current iteration of Sealed Deck.Try again, Wizards. Nobody wants to play a MtG game where they are paywalled for building decks. That is what this game is about. Building decks and taking them apart. Why are you preventing us from doing what the very foundation of this game is about? That's like telling a Kenyan Runner he has to complete the 400m dash, but you hack his legs off and charge him if he wants to use them. What is the sense in that?Lunatics.			"

												It's great for learning how to play MTG, but the d***chebags practically beg for money for simple features like adding a 3rd slot for a deck. That would be OK if it were a free-to-play, but it's absolutely greedy when you already have to pay to get the game.			"

												My Opinion: While Magic 2014: Duels of the Planeswalkers greatly improves on the mechanics of the previous games, poorly constructed decks ultimately ruin the game.I have a deep love for Magic. It's one of the best card game's I've played, and I've been an avid player for years, playing both the online versions (MTG 2012-14, MTGO) and the real life version. So jumping into this, I thought I would love it out of pure fanboyism. And in fact, I did. The campaign in this game is good, although there's still some problems with AI cheating. The challenges were fun way to spend the time if I got tired of basic duels. Most importantly of all, Sealed play (a game mode where you construct your own decks) was the most enjoyable part of the game, a place where veterans like me could go and test their skill instead of facing people with the same decks. Every opponent was different, and that's where a player's skill lies.So what's the problem? The problem is that using my own created decks can only be so much fun. I said every deck was different in Sealed Play, but always within the same core group of cards. The variety was lacking, but this is it's first installment so I couldn't have gone it with too high hopes. So naturally, when I get tired of Sealed Play, I go to basic multiplayer with the dozen or so decks that the game provides me, right? Wrong. As the standard multiplayer is the main aspect of the game, it should have been the best, but ended up being the most terrible experience I've had in MTG.Each deck, without any cards unlocked, is pretty good in itself. If you used those decks in real life, you could play a pretty good game. In MTG 2014, as in the previous installments, the more games you win with a deck the more cards that are unlocked, usually good ones. To start off with, unlocking cards is painfully slow. 2013 had, let's say 30 unlockable cards, but each win would give you a card plus all of it's repeats, meaning you only had to win 15 or so times to unlock the full deck, so it didn't take too much of a grind. In 2014, each 30 cards has to be unlocked individually, leading to an incredibly slow grind that ultimately isn't feasible to do, especially since you have to win the game to unlock a card, could take upwards of 60 games to get the whole deck if you're good. When each game lasts around 10-20 minutes, that's just impossible, at least for me. The second problem is the card choices, each deck is riddled with the most overpowered game breaking cards imaginable, taking away all skill and making it a game of simply who can get out the most mythics (the technical term for game winning cards) in the least amount of time.Want to continue reading for a more in depth review?

												***IMPORTANT INFORMATION*** :::::::ATTN: Sealed play players!:::::::After having the game for a few days and beating the initial campaign I really wanted more sealed deck slots....For everyone who has wanted more sealed play slots i have figured out the workaround to get them:)This is my gift to you :)  all i ask is that you tell others so we can become a more active community of sealed players.Originally we only had 2 sealed play slots to use and once they were used we were stuck with them or forced to buy slots 3-20 individually or in blocks (6-10, 11-15,16-20)...On your original account whether you have 2 sealed deck slots or 20 sealed deck slots you can duplicate those slots on up to 5 separate steam accounts by linking them with access through Steam Family Sharing to your main Steam account that has your Magic 2014 http://store.steampowered.com/sharing QUICK GUIDE: #1 Create new steam account#2 log into the newly created steam account and verify the email *#3 log in and out of that account 2 times to enable Steam Guard#4 attempt to start Magic DOTP 2014 while logged into new account#5 click on ""Request Access"" when dialog box pops up#6 log into your email that your Main Magic 2014 account is linked to#7 open Email from Steam support titled Steam Family Sharing Request#8 click the link under the Text reading ""To grant ______and any other users on this computer access to your Steam#9 Log into steam using your new account if your not already still logged in from the previous step #5#10 click on Play on Magic 2014#11 Enjoy your new empty Sealed play slots with all new sealed play packs (you will have the same amount of free deck slots as you had for you main steam account except they will all be empty so you can start over!)* (it can be the same email for all accounts just use the website when you create, it will inform you the ""email address is already used"", click the ""Create a new account anyway"" button )Now here is the Fine print.......You can only give access to 5 accounts at a time to your main account.You can only give access to up to 5 accounts per 90 days (so no switching them out to new blank accounts before 90 days)So basically you are getting up to 5X the amount of slots you have right now for free every 90 days(if you unlink current slotted account(s) and then in turn link them to newly created accounts)so if you had only the 2 slots on original account it would be up to 5 more accounts so 2x5=10 slots to play around with....but if you have all 20 open....that's 100 extra slots that you didn't know about before that you have access to now that every 90 days you can unlink and refresh with fresh accounts.so you ask me.....why tell everyone? Im glad you asked...I want a bunch of people to play and have fun and i want my games to get joined a lot more:P ..i know this is going to make a bunch of people happy too...i know when i figured it out my smile was from ear to ear. Also i have read so many peoples posts about being so unhappy about this specific limitation on pc for the sealed slots.you wont have all your campaign cards unlocked on the new accounts but im thinking some people may just be as happy about that too:) even if your not stoked on that you can always log back into your main steam account and play with all your unlocked decks and cards in other formats.This is my contribution to the community. For some reason i had kept coming back to that thought of ""if i could only reset or get more sealed slots""...now we all have it for free and can even clear up more slots every 90 days if we want.MarkDavidTheDJaka FaithNChrist & RPGALOT in gameGOD bless you guys! hope to see you in game!

												much better than magic 2015. magic 2015 might have full blown deck building, but you may only have one mythic rare in a deck of a card. magic 2015 is too regulated.magic 2014 has 2 headed giant. that is the most popular online gameplay style. i have at this post over 700 hours put in this game. the games can take as long as LoL games to play.if you are looking to start to play MTG, i recommend magic 2014 only.one downside is playing with bounce and boon with mul daya. simply because there is no way to shorten the life counting. drop the avenger card you might as well have dinner while that is going on.do everyone a favor and TURN OFF DAMAGE EFFECTS. that delays the game as well.

												It's exactly the same as Magic 2013, but with different decks. I bought this game because it's sealed campaign looked promising, but it was nothing short of a gimmick. The screen shot steam has for it is all it is. 5 battles by making a deck out of a 2014 equivilent pack (except without some of the mythics and rares). I was disipointed - no - I AM disipointed! All I want from a mtg game is the abillity to create my very own deck, but none of the Duels of the Planeswalkers games seems to get that (and I can't be the only one either).If you want to play magic with a limited amount of decks and whatnot, then just buy 2013/2012/etc...if you just want the new decks then go at it.(Before people bring up Magic Online; if I wanted to pay for my cards with real money then I'd just play the actual mtc card game with my friends).

												Magic the Gathering, the money gougingest game the world has ever seen.There is no greater argument for never buying this game than its DLC.  There is a DLC, something you have to pay for, to have another deck in a card game.  Honestly, words fail me when I see DLC done this badly.The music is boring, short, and constantly repeated - it hurts to listen to after a while.And what is worse, there will be a new version of this exact same game, with the exact same mechanics, the exact same bad music, the exact same horrible mass of DLC...  And it will be out in 2015.  Just as it was in 2012 and 2013.  This is worse than Call of Duty, at least there they change which brown people are getting killed and add new and horrible music.  This?  I just don't know.  :rfacepalm:			"

												I have never played Magic the card game, nor any of the inspired video games. I've always had some interest in it, but the cost of getting the cards and having to learn how to actually play the game was always a deterrent.Then came along a Steam sale, and I bought this game having read that this is one of the best places to learn how to play the game for beginners. And I'm glad I did. At the moment I am over 20 hours into Magic 2014 and enjoying it inmensely. This while not even having tried online gaming, nor the expansion which I bought in the bundle, or a ""closed deck' game. As a matter of fact I don't even know what a ""closed deck"" game means, since I'm re-playing the campaign trying to unlock cards for the different sets. Again, this while being over 20 hours in the game.To concur with the other reviews: this is a fantastic place to learn how to play the game for beginners. The tutorial explains everything perfectly. As you go further into the campaign you will have cards with certain attributes which weren't explained in the tutorial, and with a simple mouse-click on the card you can see what it does. I'm surprised how easily it was to learn how to play Magic to be honest.Replayability is necessary to unlock most of the cards. Considering the enemies in the campaign play the same way every time, one might think this becomes boring. For me this couldn't be further from the truth. I am actually enjoying replaying the campaign with different sets. Since you play with different cards, you'll have to rethink your strategy and despite the AI playing the same order of cards every time (I don't think this is the case for bosses though) it still becomes a new experience with every set.As I said, I have never played Magic nor it's videogames, as such I can not judge this game by looking at other offerings and seeing what the 2014 version does worse (or better) than other versions. I can only tell that my experience with this game has been a very good one, and I would easily recommend it to anybody.			"

												Built For Beginners.I'll start with the cons: You don't have any freedom of deck design. You play the decks available in game with the option to add or subtract cards from a preset list for that deck. It's not a good game for learning about deck building.Why I recommend it: This is an excellent tool for learning the game mechanics. The pace is nice and slow, and the visuals make things very simple. The game won't allow you to make an illegal move, so as a new player it's an excellent way to learn what to do and when; it even goes as far as to show you which cards you CAN play at any given stage. It breaks down the steps and phases of a turn very clearly, so again, you can learn how the game works. Another, and probably one of my favorite features in the Digital MTG series is that whenever an ability is triggered, the game will slowly and visually show you exactly which cards are involved, with the option to enlarge the card and read the ability.It's a lot of small things that help learn to play the game that you probably wouldn't get with a human player, regardless of their patince. They just don't want to wait while you read every single card 2 or 3 times and trace with a finger everything that's going on. I recommend this game 100% for new players or people who are interested in starting out. It's cheaper than buying a pre-made deck in stores and comes with the advantage of masterfully teaching you how to play, without being so all encompassing as to eliminate your reason to play the 'real' game.

												Nice game, nice graphics and gameplay, very smooth but it needs some serious improvements:First: it should be possible to create your very own deck chosing among all the available cards in game...but it's not. You can only use predefined decks and take out or in cards that are already part of that deck.Second: Sealed play is a joke...you get those 2 sealed deck slots but then you can't reset them if you change your mind or if you don't like your draft. Yes you can buy more slots but it doesn't solve anything.Third: Fix steam overlay, this has been a problem for a long time and there's still no fix for it! Yes in some computer it can be ""fixed"" by running the game as administrator, but it doesn't work on all PCs.Forth: quite often is very hard to know which cards you have unlocked because after winning in multiplayer most of the times the card unlocked doesn't get highlighted.For the people starting to play magic the tutorials are well done and will teach you well how to move and to understand game dynamics.Beside this I have to say it was nice to get the promo card at my Magic store and it is always nice to play with my friends both online and IRL.

												For me this game is all about the Two-Headed giant multiplayer mode, without it I would have stopped playing this game a long time ago. Even though you know all the cards by heart after 800+ hours (that also includes all the flavor texts at the bottom of the cards, and who the artists are… sigh), playing 2 vs 2 remains a lot of fun.On certain days it can take a bit longer to fill up 4 spots in multiplayer, but there are still plenty of players to be found, and most of them are OK people, it’s just very easy to focus on the negative ones unfortunately.There are the occasional bugs where the game just freezes at a timer event, and the person who has the problem has to leave the game or you are all just sitting there waiting... and waiting... and waiting, until you decide to just leave yourself and join another game. Annoying, sure, but the Magic gameplay mechanics keep me going for another round.And finally I would like to thank whoever made the decision to NOT include a Two-Headed giant mode in Magic 2015, you have saved me many months of my life. Thank you stranger, I sincerely mean it.			"

												I must admit, I've been an avid MTG player since the Urza's Saga block of what must be 98-99. Enjoyed, invested, traded, and sold quite a lot till 2004, participated in tournaments (all bit rather casually, never broke any charts), and sold most of my real card collection afterwards. With hindsight I shouldn't have, cause MTG never really leaves you. When I got gifted this game for father's day I immediately fell in love with MTG again, I knew again why I loved this game so much.Luckily I didn't sell everything, so it was only a matter of time before my wife learned to play and now thanks to the online version we can play again on the diner table just like 10 or more years ago.The game itself is in my opinion purely for enthusiasts, you're either into card games or you're not. Graphics are allright, music too, story and cutscenes aren't remarkable.The computer does show you a lot better how the game mechanics work and what does what than you can with friends around your playing table though.If you're a fan of MTG or are in need of nostalgia of your former MTG friends-around-the-table moments...this is a good investment.

I already had a collector's addiction to comics so I don't think I would ever bite on the real stuff but well I'm liking the game so far and that's just basically using 2 decks so far... the white one you get from the first part of the campaign is awesome!

												As much as I like MTG, the Duels of the Planeswalkers games don't really do it any justice. Like the other DotP games, Magic 2014 doesn't allow you to fully create your own deck, but basically asks you to choose from one of the premade game decks which aren't that bad. The extent of customization options are just some unlockable cards that you can add on to the deck while removing other cards to compensate. The Sealed Play mode is kind of cool, but it leaves a lot to be desired when certain cards you may or may not get turn out to be instawin for the player who uses them. Also like other DotP installments, the online mode also only works when there's a Steam sale and people have just bought the game, it never works or connects you to other players otherwise. In its defense though, the campaign always does a good job of teaching you your deck's strengths and weaknesses, which is very helpful to new players.It's a good game for people just getting into MTG, but for average fans and veterans it just isn't worth it.

												In short? Don't.Longer version?1. I played a ton of Magic on my years, but there is nothing extra in this version, who needs cutscenes in a card game honestly. Just buy some older one for way cheaper.2. Constant reminders to purchase packs, decks, expansions, dlc's, ""just puuuurchaaase, give us your money, because we clearly do not have enough"". I'm talking several dozen reminders an hour when you start playing campaign and try to deck build often.3. When I clearly click on option that I played a lot of Magic, why do you still explain me mechanics like flying and trample and all of the tutorials? I said I played it a lot, didn't I? What was the setting for then? I could understand explaining only the newest. But all of them? Really?4.

												The game is quiet fun until you reach a certain point in the game: as soon as you played through all campains and challenges. The balance is decent, although there was 1 deck before ""deck pack 2"" came out that was kind of unbalanced and now there are 2. Before it was just the elven deck where it was very hard to play against if you didn't have lot's of counter spells or damage spells. Since there is the faerie deck open to play, it is very hard to lose with it. It has only flying creatures, so at first you'd need something with flying or reach yourself. Then most of the creatures a flash and a very nice bonus to them, like: counter target spell, an enemy discards a card you choose among his hand, take control of target creature and tons of ""unsummon"" to prevent the enemy from playing anything dangerous or saving your own creatures .... not to mention the ""mind unbound"" enchantment which makes it's controler draw an additional card every round, so 1 card the round you play it, next time 2, then 3, then 4 ...Why do the developers always have to ruin nice games?

												tl;dr: this isn't exactly Magic The Gathering, but it's still fun. 7/10.What you DON'T get in this version (compared to the CCG):*normal game flow (phases aren't like the MTG CCG, also slow, can feel clunky)*spells and skills that activate at the right time (I'm looking at you Regenerate)*A real Deck Building/Design experience (you get booster packs that you can use to make a deck for a handful of battles only. Otherwise you just get prefabs with loads of mythic rares and you can select/deselect cards)*Collecting, comparing, trading, etc.*Great moments of triumph from strategyWhat you DO get in this version:*creature battles*spells*lots of land tapping*online multiplayer with a couple different modes*Pay for features you should get with the game for free*Pay for booster packs*Pay for each extra deck slot*Pay some more and then some more, and then more after that*streamlined phases and actions*a pleasant casual experienceThey somehow took a lot of the fun out of the game, namely the collecting, trading, deck building, strategy, etc. But still have fun elements like creature battles, spells, art, etc. So this version could be called a streamlined version of Magic The Gathering's actual gameplay. It's sad that they didn't seem to care about adding the collecting and actual deck building, but I suppose they were either worried about competing with their physical cards' sales, or they just didn't think that the average Xbox 360 player (who this game is obviously targeted at, and designed for) have the patience or maybe even the capacity to collect, comprehend and create their own deck from scratch. I was rather disappointed to learn that the game lacked these crucial features (at least in a real experience), but found out through playing that although the most fun in the physical game is the winning with a deck that you built from scratch, the core mechanics of the card game still stands on its own. As for this computer game, it may not be a CCG, but it's a table top card game that is fun and casual but also a challenging experience.One final sour point: As mentioned above briefly, there is a whole lot to pay for to get basic features that should have been included with the game. I don't really have a problem with the paying aspect as that's what the physical MTG game is, if you think about it. But I do have a problem with the growing sentiment that game development should be one half-released product and the other half behind an extensive series of paywalls. There are 49 addons for this game, and although not all of them unlock features, this is quite the pathetic attempt to disguise large payments by splitting them up into dozens of ""DLC."" I guess it is up to each of us individual players and whether we want to stand for this blatant capitalization of gaming addiction and half-product half-""DLC."" I can't blame the industry for moving towards higher/hidden monetization of their titles, but I don't have to like it.P.S. About the Regenerate comment: activate Regenerate BEFORE combat damage and DURING the block phase AFTER they have assigned blockers. I know.. ""Regenerate before damage, WTF?!?!""  I don't know why, that's just the way this game works.			"

												With 50+ hours of gameplay and all acheivements unlocked, I think I can provide a decent insight to Magic 2014 - Dules of the Planeswalkers. If you're a new player to M:tG, this is a great place to learn the very basic gameplay and mechanics of the game. You'll be exposed to cards from the very first sets all the way up to now. The game will have you unlock decks and stronger cards by facing other Planeswalkers. Deck construction is a bit limited, but with a pool of about  80  cards per deck, you should be able to come up with a few strategies for each of them. It's a great place to start if you don't want to pour money into the physical card game or Wizards of the Coast's Magic Online. Diehard fans may be a bit dissappointed with the game on the whole considering how broad and intense Magic can be outside of DoTP, but this game balances out the power curves you'll see in standard Magic: the Gathering play. You can add your own creativity in the Sealed Deck mode which enables you to build a 40-card deck from semi-radomized packs. You may have to switch your strategy as you play this mode, as you'll face different opponents who have different strategies. You won't get blown out by Pro decks, but watch out for the DLC decks as they are more powerful. You can join forces with your friends to face other AI Planeswalkers (which you can higher or lower in difficulty) or other human players. Overall, it's a great way to scratch the surface of a very in-depth game, hone your skills, and discover cards that could change the way your physical decks operate.			"

												As an ex-paper magic player, this game is great. It helped me get back into MTG, and it's a cheap alternative (if a bit limited) to playing the real thing, even cheaper when you grab it on a sale. Sure, there are annoying bugs like games getting stuck here and there, but all in all it's a very solid MTG experience.Imo it's very much worth its money for both beginners and returning players to hone their skills and get a feel for the game.Also the 2 vs. 2 mode is just awesome! Big recommendation!			"

												Would not recommend over 2012 or 2013. The enemy NPC players start with premade hands and you can ""feel it"" more in this game, with early decks pulling more consistant tricks and drawing just the card they need. The game feels a lot more laggy than it's previous incarnations and the sealed format feels like a joke - you can only play sealed format twice before you have to buy additional slots otherwise you are stuck with the same deck, which completly ruins the point (and if there IS a button to delete the deck and start anew, the interface is so clunky I can't find it). Given the previous two games I didn't think it was possible to mess up the format.			"

												Until they include the very basic option of being able to build your own decks from scratch, this series of games is not worth it.  I'm glad I played this on the free weekend so that I didn't feel cheated out of my money, just my time.I suppose if you've never played Magic before, this might be worthwhile as its restrictive, premade decks won't overwhelm new players with options.That single (albeit massive) complaint aside, the game's playable.  The UI is a bit clunkier than other Magic games I've seen, but it's usable.  The music gets repetitive, but is otherwise of decent quality.			"

												Magic 2014 — Duels of the PlaneswalkersReview by ProtossWhat is Magic 2014? Well, Magic 2014 is the collectible card game ""Magic The Gathering"" in its fourth iteration of the series ""Duels of the Planeswalkers"" (DotP), not to be confused with the Microprose game of the same name that also is known as ""Shandalar"".Magic 2014 allows you to compete with a number of pre-built decks (as of writing this: 10 in the base game, 5 in the expansion and 2 in the deck pack) with 60 to 100 cards against other pre-built decks or in the campaign mode against so-called ""encounters"" that don't follow the Magic deckbuilding rules.It would be too complicated to go into details of the complete Magic rules, but the basics should be explained here: When you build a deck, you can freely choose what cards you have in it, which include any number of basic lands, up to 4 of each other card of the same name, and up to 1 of each restricted card. In the computer game I review here, the game takes care already that you can't build an illegal deck unless you have less than 60 or more than 100 cards. The ""more than 100 cards"" rule does not apply in real-life magic but because of the influence of luck generally a deck is considered more efficient with less cards in it, unless it is specifically built to maintain a larger card base.After you have built your deck you can play. In the computer game, instead you have the pre-built decks with unlockable cards. This means you can customize your deck to a degree but not as freely as you would in real life Magic. This is on one hand good to introduce you to the game, on the other hand it also limits your options.When you start an actual game, usually both players (it works similarly in a game mode with more players) draw a hand of seven cards each. You can exchange that hand for another one with seven cards, then six etc. down to one. You will usually want to have a certain number of lands and other cards in your hand.Lands are used as a mana source. Almost every spell in the game costs mana. There are five mana colors in Magic plus colorless mana. A card that requires colorless mana to be cast can be paid with any mana, while a card that requires a specific color must be cast with that color. In the first turn, you will usually play a land - you can play at most one per turn unless other effects allow you to play more - and maybe cast a spell. There are different kinds of spells:Permanents are spells that go to the battlefield when cast. Those can be creatures, enchantments or artifacts. Creatures can attack the enemy, enchantments and artifacts have different effects that affect the gameplay. Usually a permanent can only be used by its controller, who normally is the one who cast the spell.There are also instants and sorceries which are spells that can be cast to have effects on the gameplay, for example making a creature stronger or weaker until the end of a turn, or dealing damage.In your main phases, you can play permanents and sorcerys, in your attack phases you can attack. If your opponent has the turn, he gets those benefits and you can block. Instants can be played at any time, even in the opponent's move. Two decks are even built partially around instants that prevent an enemy's spells from working.Your objective is to defeat your opponent who starts with the same amount of life as you, usually 20. When you win with a deck you unlock a new card that you can use in it later.Read the rest of the Review in the comments because of the artificial character limit by Steam!			"

												Prepares you perfectly for the actual card game by starting you off with crappy cards and pitting you against decks that are far better and more powerful than your own so you can lose miserably over and over again until you just manage to end up with a lucky draw allowing you to earn an unsatisfying victory that you know you didn't deserve.  Unlike the actual card game though, your options to improve your garbage decks are severely limited.  It's a good way to learn to play Magic: The Gathering, but frustrating if you already know what you're doing and looking to build a decent deck.  Some of the later campaign matches are especially asinine as the AI opponent starts with a stacked deck that allows them to play all their best combos at the beginning of the match every single time in exactly the same order while you get stuck with a properly random shuffled deck.  The only way I was able to beat the last few campaign matches was by restarting over and over until I got a hand that I knew would stand a chance against the first few combos in the stacked AI deck.  That is not how Magic should be played.I only recommend this game to beginners interested in learning Magic: The Gathering, if you are already a Magic player you will probably find this game frustrating and annoying.  Half the fun of playing Magic is designing and building your deck, and that entire aspect of the game is poorly represented in this digital form.  Combine that with the fact that the AI basically cheats and the cards are literally stacked against you, and you have a video game that is only marginally as fun and entertaining as the actual card game it emulates.

												I mainly purchased this game because it promised ""deck building"" rather than the boring pre-built deck play... if you're thinking the same thing: don't do it.  The deck building piece is very short (only five matches), and rather than really being able to construct and tune decks you're just scratching around with a small pile of cards trying to get a deck that works.Otherwise, unless you pay the extra for decks you'll be slowly slogging your way through a series of increasingly frustrating matches unlocking one card at a time and making tiny, restrictive edits to the same decks over and over.

Why does this matter? It tells you that I know a thing or 2 about Magic. This game is designed to force you to pay more money to buy decks to continue with the game. It's basically all scripted and I bought the game because it mentioned Shaldalar. For those who actually know what that is, that is why I bought the game. But stuck on scripted and pointlessly unbalanced fights now to force me to pay more. #passonthisgarbage			"

												I played through the basic ""story"" of the game and I have to say I am a bit disapointed.  The game mechanics, while mostly done well still have a few key elements that do not work properly (priority of effects triggered by cards entering the graveyard to point out one).  Also, for the campaign, Magic 2014 made all of the final fights at the end of each plane a fight against a fully scripted deck so there is no variation and you just have to build a deck knowing exactly what your opponent is going to play.  As a result, those games often became an issue of starting over until you got a decent beginning draw.  Very weak.Also to be clear this is just a rating of the single player content and the mechanics I have seen.  It may still be a solid multiplayer experience.			"

												I have to admit and confirm positive feedback of other reviewers...Magic 2014 is a definitely great game which can be hardly compared with older and even newer MtG games (I own even Magic 2015 Duels of the Planeswalkers). The visual style of the game is important for me so when I ran the game for the first time, I was pleased to see everything in the game as it is. The menu of the game is friendly, the color of the battleground is friendly to my eyes. The game itself is running smoothly while the newer ""brother"" from the series seems to have some ""slowness problems"" on the same machine...Even though I have never played previous versions of MtG so far, I still read many reviews and watched lots of game-plays which does not offer the same level of fun.CAMPAIGNThe campaign itself is pretty solid with all of those opponent's decks. Only the last fight against the main ""villain"" can be disappointing for someone. It is easy to face to someone (not only the ""villain"") who has some kind of disadvantage in the game. Actually there is a opponent's deck who is quite difficult versus some player's deck aiming on late game play-style.  If you want to use only one deck for whole campaign and own only basic version of the game, then you can ""feel the pain"" in some situations.SEALED PLAYEven I can confirm, that it does not offer anything special to players. It reminds me a draft, when it is difficult to collect a solid deck. And even if you buy new boosters, you can not use them all altogether. It is really weird. I played Sealed game-mode only for achievements.As for being a repetitive game-mode.Two-headed ogre is fine, but All-for-one is so much better according to my opinion. Four opponents attacking to each other offer unlimited variations.MY SUMMARYIf you like MtG as me, you will not regret to have the game in your library at all.			"

This game is a piece of sheat!! I stopped playing it during tutorial.Beaty art but uncomfortable gameplay without any tunable options.For instance, when you put your axe (Some sort of artefact-equipment or whatever) on table youhave to press ""continue"" every time after your finish attacking for no good reason.Attack is already finished, there is nothing to do by myself so... Game please go to opponent move automatically.For attack you have to press 2 buttons instead of 1 single left click what will be much better for me.No! It's time to press your buttons!!Space+Tab by default or clicking mouse 2 times.First time clicking on button ""attack by all creatures"" and second clicking on ""Attack"" button.Even growing mana is incredibly annoying. There should be an option for make it automatically.You can't get rid of stupid notifications like ""Continue"" button, cards animation, even ""block"" is stupid.Block! WTF is this?Where did you find this definition for simple attack action?I think, when creature attack an enemy during his turn- this should be called an ""attack"",and if creature is actually block somethingthis is should be called a ""block"".Size of card is tiny by default.You can's see a sheat in enemy side of deck. And even in yours you have to zoom in order to see your own card and guess what? Game is stopped when you doing so.Aaaaand there is no options to change it.TL;DR annotations! I cant even understand what you trying to ""explain"" by this messages.""Dear developers"".. Haha! I'm just foolin'. Guys! You really need learn how to make laconic annotationsNext is... LOOOOOOONG time before and after casting spells and all sorts of stuff.Default resolution of this game is 1280x720. Are you focking kiddin' me?You can't turn off Vsync.[/spoiler]No options. No comfort. Fukk this game. "

In 1993, an American-based company named Wizards of the Coast acquired what is considered the world’s premier licensed trading card game, which was originally developed by a studious individual known as Richard Garfield. Now, with millions of individual cards in circulation and a highly distinguishable brand that bellows across the tabletop gaming world, Magic: the Gathering (MtG) has evolved into a highly successful franchise that includes in its catalogue an assortment of comic books, novels, and other merchandise. Magic 2014 is a structured trading card game based on the physical card game of the same name, and is highly enjoyed by myself and  many others. Just like this variance of the game, it is quick and painless to learn, as everyone I have taught has picked up at least the basics during the course of one game.Here are some things that I enjoyed about this specific year’s instance of the video game series:Story - You take the role of a Planeswalker: a spellcaster that utilizes various forms of magic to defect countless enemies; this is also the premise of the player vs. player aspect in Magic: the Gathering. Throughout this story’s arch, you follow and ally yourself with Chandra Nalaar, a pyromancer seeking revenge against an enemy of great power. Chandra is one of the featured Planeswalkers within the MtG universe, her story told through multiple comic strips and novels since her original appearance in the 2000’s. Magic 2014 sequences the player against multiple opponents in turn-based card game action as the story progresses through said battles and cutscenes that are, in my opinion, pretty awesome.Draft Mode - Similar to real-life booster drafts for the trading card game, Magic 2014is the first of the Duels of the Planeswalkers series to feature Draft Mode, in which a player receives a given number of booster packs in order to create an in-game Magic: the Gathering deck, which is then utilized to defeat multiple enemies in succession. Though only two different decks are allowed through this game mode without having to dish out some extra spending cash for downloadable content (DLC), the player can earn additional booster packs that expand the total pool of cards they can use to modify their deck; this further enhances customization and overall play. There are also hints displayed on screen during deck construction that aide newer players when first creating and later editing a ‘library.’Connectability to the Card Game - Though it has very clunk player interfaces and you cannot tap your own mana, Magic 2014 is exactly what you’d expect it to be: a video game adaptation of the MtG trading card game. The similarities boil down to game mechanics, the utilization of cards that were in circulation, noteworthy Planeswalkers and other characters from the base game and novels, and even the ability to purchase foil deck conversions at an additional price as a cosmetic change. Magic 2014 is, simply, the same Magic: the Gathering trading card game that millions have enjoyed for years converted to a digital format.TL:DR - Magic 2014 is a great entrant into the Duels of the Planeswalkers series that can either be utilized as a teaching tool for card game players interested in learning the MtG trading card game or as a standalone title with varying styles of play and degrees of challenge. I would like to give a very special thanks to ‘the guys’ for enjoying the physical variance of this card game with me for many years. Also, a big thank you to my fantastic fiancé for being addicted to purchasing booster packs for me so that I could own more cards in an unbearable stack than I ever thought I could. Thanks for reading. Do you enjoy these reviews? Please visit my Curator Page at  Spearpoint Reviews	.			"

												Newcomers may find this game more enjoyable than Magic veterans, and the new feature of adding a sealed deck is both one of the best and worst things this game has to offer. As a long time player of MTG, this game is about 85% accurate on it's interpretations of the rules and game play. It has improved on previous versions, but it is particularly annoying to know that a card works one way and DotP seems unaware of this fact. New players won't notice this, and the 2014 version certain makes the UI a little more responsive, making it less likely for you to miss an opportune trigger. Deck building is a generous description of what really happens. each deck is, in essense a 90 card deck, and you unlock a good number of those cards throughout the playing of the game - or you can pay to unlock them. The final deck is no powerhouse, but when compared to the relatively terrible decks you are started with, it's a rewarding experience to take those powered up decks against previous opponents against whom you may have struggled and crush them mercilessly. The sealed deck element is both brilliant and remarkably dumb at the same time. You can do sealed 2 times before you must buy more slots. This little money grab makes the experience highly frustrating. You can not delete the boring, or bad, pool of cards you once had. It was the most fun I had in the game, and the one reason I never went back after finishing them. If I wanted to pay money to draft, I would actually go draft online or in person and walk away with cards I can use for other things. Nothing is overly challenging in this game, and with any level of decent magic skill, you will outplay your opponents easily. they are predictable, easily trapped and setting up blowouts can make even the unfair matches seem relatively easy. Overall, however, the casual magic player will enjoy this game, and deal with the limitations and weaknesses. All in all, it was a positive experience and I recommend it.			"

												For newcomers to MTG, this is a MUCH better choice over DotP 2015.Pros:-Makes learning the game very easy.-Multiplayer is alright.-Moddable. Now I can play Tinker Vintage combo against the all powerful Shadowborn Apostle deck !-Campaign is a decent length (to me)-The challenges/scenarios makes me think on a solution with the given resources, which has even taught me more tips and tricks when playing. Cons:-No proper deckbuilding.-The insane amount of DLCs. Again, for newcomers to Magic, this is a great option to learn the game with ease. Do NOT get DotP 2015. For those who are already experienced with MTG, it is still an alright game to play once in a while, though you probably won't get much out of it.			"

												While an awesome game, I find some of its aspects frustrating. These include the lack of freedom when building decks and playing them in sealed mode and the lack of freedom when choosing which creature to cast a spell on (in some cases, the settings prevent moves that may otherwise have been effective in a real-world game of magic). Overall though, still great fun and I would recommend this to those who love magic. Especially good for those who want to get practice.			"

												Limited seal deck gameplay and the lack of diversity of cards and decks you're able to make sucks. If you want more cards, you have to pay for it. At least in Hearthstone you can play matches to eventually get more booster card packs.For $10, the amount of time is truthfully worth it, you will get 10-20 hours of time, more if you just play this casually, but because of the lack of variety, unable to mix and match and create your own decks, it gets tedious and you eventually understand what each deck holds.

												Magic 2014 feels pretty much the same as the 2012 version, but it's definitely improved as far as being more friendly to new players in terms of learning how to play. Magic 2014 does have a good variety of different card sets, although unlocking cards is a grind unless you spend the extra few bucks up front.The campaign is not very enjoyable because each opponent gets a pre-made stacked deck so you pretty much need to get a lucky draw to beat their stacked deck. I do miss the Archenemy game mode in the 2012 version as well.Overall, it's still mostly fun--for a card game that is.			"

												Allow me to explain something to you about this game, its EXTREMELY unbalanced. You would be surprised at how clear cut the tiers are. Unless you play one of these select decks, you are going to lose unless by some stroke of luck you manage to pull just the right card. Its wraught with people who will blantantly admit they are there to frustrate you, and its just flat out a mean community. I have a fairly decent win/loss record yet most of these battles had to be won using these top tier decks. The main selling point of this game was Sealed Play which is by no means as good as it should be. You are given 2 slots to start with, and a select number of boosters to pull from. You can have the Computer assemble a deck for you based on your cards (which defeats the entire purpose) or you can build them yourself, however you are given extremely mediocre cards to use. The FFA mode is basically 1v1 (there are three way and four way matchups, but no one plays them) and once again, the top tier decks WILL WIN. People will reply with, ""this deck beats this one if you have these certain cards"" here lies another problem, you have to grind to unlock cards for premade decks to play with, or you can pay 99 cents on the store to buy the deck, and you can buy a 99 cent foil pack (which serves no purpose other than to take your money) and you can buy sealed deck slots (sealed was also a money grab) They have DLC by way of decks, and most of these decks are awfully overpowered compared to the others. As a casual player of the paper card game, this game is terrible by any standard. If you are looking to be frustrated by people, who are pretentious and rude, pick this game up, if not STAY AWAY and play the actual card game, there is a much nicer community in the actual product. Happy Gaming!			"

												I use to play MtG offline a lot. Even have passed referee exam. Have tons of real cards started as from ""Torment"" set. My fav card pcs artist is - John Avon.Nothing special to say abt this game but- ATTENTION -Magic 2014 is NOT the same MtG as you use to play offline. Developers make they own changes in general rules of the game. The following is noted after 2 weeks playing this Magic 2014:1) PC will have ALL cards he's needed while playing against AI. Always.2) Some card where found bagged/not working. (Bugged or not working abilities).  Game options :1) Buy online booster for your deck - N/A2) Have one pool of cards from your precon decks - N/A (1 pool per precon ONLY)3) Swap the cards between precon decks - N/A4) Sealed decks are same as booster draft format. Purchasing additional sealed decks with slot for it is Not recommended. 5) Stack time is 1 sec ONLY. Be always ready to puch Space Bar to play on stack.Due to unknown errors on game server you can observe the following♥♥♥♥♥♥:- Your second main phase is disappeared,- Sometimes game become struck and time stopped. Even 2 or 4 players in round, all facing same crap.- Your creature can't play ability.If you want to play normal MtG with MtG rules, Magic 2014 is NOT that game to pick & play.			"

												I played a lot of Magic the Gathering back when I was in secondary school. I got in during the Mirrodin block, a series of cards notorious for being much to too strong. It introduced two new things that upset a lot of people: 1. the new card layout. 2. Affinity for artifacts. The result was a metagame built around completely overpowered combos and cards and as a result Wizard backpedaled for the next block: Kamigawa. It was infinitely weaker and very different. Fast forward a few years and Wizard is preparing the biggest update in the game ever: Magic 2010. This changed some rules and introduced all sorts of loopholes to make more insanely powerful cards that make everything in Mirrodin seem weak. The Duels of the Planeswalkers series in an attempt to bring the card game to the masses in a simplfied form. Basically you're given a set of Decks, each with a special theme or tactic and you have to fight your way through a series of computer opponents or against other humans with the same set of decks. This is the inherent problem with this game: everything is stripped down for the game. The inherent awesomeness of magic is building your own unique deck with over 30.000 possible cards. This game offers no such options. Obviously for dirty monetising reasons. Furthermore, the game is a complete wreck when it comes to flow. The animations are so overly long and uninteresting you'll lose attention and motivation to play before you have gotten to the core of the game. All in all, as a player of the actual card game I cannot reccomend this. It is thin watery gruel that resembles the game in rules and look, but misses everything that inheritly makes it fun.			"

												I cannot recommend this game to anyone I like. The entire series is plagued with game breaking bugs which have never been fixed and there is no multiplayer infrastructure, at all. It is possible to find a multiplayer lobby, and it's possible to sit in that lobby for an hour; waiting on another player to join.Victory goes to the person who pays to unlock the best cards for every deck, but they can't celebrate for long as the losing player may simply pause the game timer, indefinitely, until someone quits.90% of games will conclude with someone quitting, being disconnected, or merely walking away from their computer and leaving the game postponed.As someone who has clocked Hundreds of hours of play time in this series, I can tell you that each game is getting progressively worse, every-single-year!

That being said, I would only recommend this game for individuals heavily into MTG.      It's a great teaching mechanism, but that role can be filled by fellow players or online how-to-play guides just as easily(for free).      Big negative? You'll have to dish out some more dough if you want to use the game to its full potential. This makes it too much of an investment for people who have little money or little interest in MTG.			"

												Introducing a new ""Sealed Deck"" game mode, DotP 2014 at first appears to finally introduce deck customization to the series. Sadly, this is just another marketing ploy, a shallow attempt at introducing casuals to the limited Sealed Deck format. You open up boosters composed of cards available in DotP 2014, resulting in terrible mish-mashed decks (with still no non-basic lands available!) that you have to use against mono-colored decks. If you ""unwrap"" a terrible set of boosters, there is no reset button; after the initial two decks you can make you have to buy additional slots at $1.99 each. This game also features the worst decks in the series: STILL no non-basic lands and a terrible core set (m14 is incredibly bland with casualified slivers).Once again locking you out of all but two decks at the start (Chandra & Garruk's again), DotP 2014 is a terrible introduction to MTG for new and casual players. Featuring the worst decks, the worst UI, easiest challenges, an awful campaign comprised of static decks (enemies pull the same cards no matter what, making the campaign little more than long challenges), and the worst game modes, 2014 is the worst DotP game since the original and not worth playing.

												I have to admit, after playing MTG for about 5 years now, the Video Game isn't that bad. That being said, since it is a video game, you are very restricted compared to the real game. One misclick and it's final. When I was playing two-headed giant (Which is very fun by the way) with my friend, he ended up using Pacifism on his own creature. However, Duels 2014 is still Magic, and if you are new to the game or bored, this is great way to play Magic when it's not Friday Night.			"

												Recommended only to learn the basics of Magic the Gathering.  For some complicated plays, the AI just does things without attributing a specific card.  The single-player campaign is short, but it can still be fun trying to beat it with different decks.  You can unlock and play with different pre-selected decks.  The deck building options are limited, you cannot design a deck based on a strategy, you have to design a strategy based on a deck.The UI is utilitarian at best.  The menu system is poorly designed.  It seems to take forever to load, which is odd since there aren't any complicated graphical assets.  The pacing of the card play is slow, even after turning off all of the ""pause to show card"" options.  After a while these annoyances will become irritating.			"

												I enjoy MTG CCG. This however really annoys me. It also loads slowly.Extremely frustrating and very poorly balanced. Your first campaign starts you with two single coloured pre-built decks with no option to optimize each deck save to remove cards. Now this is fine until you reach the fourth duel in the challenge where you face an extremely optimized white fast creature deck and you are defeated time and time again. To progress I imagine you have to go back and duel the previous fights to get the right cards to begin tweaking your decks. Those who remember the ""duals of the planeswalkers"" computer game will befrustrated by an annoyingly steep difficulty curve without immediate access to tweaking your deck.Learning is slow paced for key concepts but for more complicated powers that involve interrupting play (e.g. regeneration) these are not explained.  Those who are prepared to grind the first couple of campaign scenarios (or spend money to unlock decks of course) might be a lot more satisfied. Play the demo and if you are a wiz at the game, consider buying if cheap. Otherwise you might get ninety minutes of enjoyment and four hours of frustration.			"

												This game is good for people looking at learning the game. As a store owner, I talked to Wizards of the Coast about Duels of the Plainswalkers and found out that its design is to introduce the CCG to the public in a walk-through game. There is a way to play in multi-player against other Steam players but that is not the focus on this game. Ultimately the game is designed to get the player introduced to Magic the Gathering and then transition them to the CCG in the real world (non-digital).If you want to learn the game or are a fellow store owner who wants to introduce the game to new players, download this game. If you are a competitive player who already knows the game, then you may want to look at more competitive forums.			"

												Overall this game could be considered mostly solid aside from some very major drawbacks. If you expect to play against AI characters in two headed dragon, then you are better off just turning the game off and saving yourself the frustration. They have better decks and always seem to draw the perfect card to screw you over at just the right time. Also viewing the cards can be troublesome sometimes when the game decides that you had enough time and now you should stop.The game can be fun for usually simple campaign duels and playing against other players is easy and fun, which could easily make this game a good entry point to Magic: The Gathering over having to buy a bunch of cards. But the game is definitely best enjoyed with friends.At the end of the day this game is just the at the time Magic:The Gathering game. Pretty soon a new one will be released if it has not already. But this one seems like a step back from 2013, so hopefully the 2015 version will be better than this.			"

Compared to mtg2013 there are more options, but on the other side game feels to just nuke your a** out just to get you buy more cards. Usually i have played on t2 difficulty, but this is hard game just for the easiest option around.Also check out your options before playing. These autoresolves and no pause at upkeep settings are bad. Also you are not able to inspect the cards while using multiple blockers. Definitely not worth the buy if you are not a true fan and willing to spend more cash on extra tuff decks.AND WHY THE HELL CHANDRA ON EVERY FFING MENU/ICON/QUEST?

												This game is a simplified introduction to Magic: The Gathering. It has some very serious flaws, but MtG is normally very expensive and hard to learn, while this game is easy to get into (thanks to half-predefined decks) and very affordable during Steam Sales.Campaign mode is a challenging, varied sequence of relatively static battles akin to a puzzle game. They're a great introduction to different deck types especially if you're unlocking decks manually instead of paying for them.Multiplayer is the heart of the game, but thanks to the only half-customizable premade decks it's kind of a rock-paper-scissors type affair in that victory is largely a matter of taking the right kind of deck into a match, and I've experienced issues with players disconnecting and each opposing side being replaced with a bot.The 3D graphics are pretty, but unnecessarily reduce the compatibility with very old cards.I find the normal price overblown given the huge amount of DLCs, but I had a lot of fun learning Magic: The Gathering through this game.

												This game is a simplified introduction to Magic: The Gathering. It has some very serious flaws, but MtG is normally very expensive and hard to learn, while this game is easy to get into (thanks to half-predefined decks) and very affordable during Steam Sales.Campaign mode is a challenging, varied sequence of relatively static battles akin to a puzzle game. They're a great introduction to different deck types especially if you're unlocking decks manually instead of paying for them.Multiplayer is the heart of the game, but thanks to the only half-customizable premade decks it's kind of a rock-paper-scissors type affair in that victory is largely a matter of taking the right kind of deck into a match, and I've experienced issues with players disconnecting and each opposing side being replaced with a bot.The 3D graphics are pretty, but unnecessarily reduce the compatibility with very old cards.I find the normal price overblown given the huge amount of DLCs, but I had a lot of fun learning Magic: The Gathering through this game.

												Definitely a sweet game, if you ever played any card games its extremely fun, and even if you havent, especially becuase you dont have to pay for all of the cards in the game!! (a single card, avacyn, is $15 and theres like 1000 cards in the game without the expansion.) It managed to get me and several other people ordering magic decks to play together in person, then get them to buy it on steam to play when we were apart! However, i would not spend the extra money for the foils, as it does almost nothing, they get a slight shine, and the legendary creatures get a short, 4 second animation. Just get the $10 one or wait for a sale on the special edition. Id reccomend getting the regular game, then spending half the $10 you saved on the expansion to unlock 5 more decks (50% mroe cards, and theyre badass). Also, look up the promo codes online beforeyou play so you get a slight boost with all of your decks when you first start leveling them!! (Promo cards are permanently locked without these codes and theyre useful!) The game has a much better UI and runs smoother than the previous 2, and some of the cards are better9.5/10			"

												Having played about two hours of MTG in my life before buying this, I can safely say it's quite beginner friendly. In fact, it might be more friendly to beginners than it is to long-time players, who might have some challenge adapting to some of the mechanic changes. The campaign isn't the longest, clocking in at under a dozen hours, and whilst the ""tables"" or backgrounds for matches have little to no diversity, the presentation as a whole is solid.Still, given the low price, it's good value for money. Of course, if you want to spend a lot of time making your own decks in sealed play, you'll probably want to shell out extra money to unlock the slots. Seems to function well enough - there's the occasional bug where effects do not play out as they should, and trying to double KO apparently breaks the game. All the same, it's fun.			"

												A deceptively marketed game that was a serious let down. As someone that plays MTG I was expecting a lot more freedom when it came to making decks and the number of expansions that would be included. Little did I know that the game pretty much contains the 2014 set and a few other sets.This game is only useful for people who are new to the game. Even then this game is full of bugs that just break the game on some occasions and the fact that the AI in some games does not have a randomized decks defeated the purpose of MTG.Want to keep reading about how this game made me angry?

												This game is ok. Decent mechanics at play for the game. However, it has many drawbacks. You are better off just playing MTG online. The campaign is the same every time without much variety in cards or ways through. Sealed tournament seems cool until you realize that you only get to play it 4 times. If you delete a sealed game and start a new one, you'll just get the same cards again anyways. This is a game that could have offered more but seems it just wasn't interested in doing so. I can't recommend this when MTG Online is out there offering variety in play.			"

And the addition of the make your own deck thing is interesting, but still not that good as most decks you can make in this game would only take maybe $50 to make in real life and that's pushing it.

Its also the first game to feature drafts as a game mode but that was sadly a huge disapointment due to a lot of limitations and poor design choices...specially if you compare it to the Arena mode in Hearthstone.Same as most other MTG games it has a good spread of achievements that covers all aspects of the game.

												Magic 2014 — Duels of the Planeswalkers is a really good game, but it's not addicting as well. This is a game you'll happilly finish the campaign after some days (you won't feel like ending the campaign in the 1st days, for real) and play a few MP games before getting a little bit tired. You'll come back some days, play some more... but you won't get that feeling of ""OMG, I need to play this game so bad, pls lemme play it, ♥♥♥♥ off teacher, I wanna play Magic"", no, not like that at all. Let's go to some specific points nowDeck Variety: Pretty varied decks, we don't have only the monocolored decks we know we have double-colored and triple-colored as well. There are even TWO white decks. All of them have a different style of play, fitting most of the players playing style.Cards Variety: I expected a little bit more, but I'm by no means disappointed. We've got some quite interesting cards.Graphics: C'mon, it's not the most important thing in this game. The graphs are more than enough for it.DLC: It's cheap and it's worth it. You can use the 3 or 4 decks (don't remember) you gain to play in the SP as well as the MP. They're unique in this game. All of them are varied and we even have a really good elves deck in this DLC that uses some really old physical cards. Pretty good.Also, both the game and its DLC are cheaper right now. I'd buy the Special Edition if I were you, really worth it.Magic 2014 - Duels of the Planeswalkers is undoubtedly the best TCG we've in Steam. We've got a great variety of both decks and cards. The single DLC is amazing and the price is really cheap.Also, if you got money I'd recommend you checking out ""Magic Online"", google it, it's very interesting, much more than this game if you want to make such an investment.That's it for today, thanks by reading guys.

												After playing Magic 2015 I am compelled to return here and write a review.Pros:- Great for beginners. The Prebuilt decks offer a lot of nice synergy cards which many beginners might not be able to understand. And you can grasp the basics from this. I actually wish other friends of mine played this before starting to play real magic. I facepalmed when I learned they didn't know that a counter spell could counter everything unlike a counter creature/aura/enchantment/sorcery instant.- Fun to play with friends. Always has been. And it has Two-Headed Giant. I wish it had Planechase as well but we can't have it all.Some customizable cards. You can choose the amount of lands and select from the predefined cards. Plus the codes for 10 free cards are available. Just search it up on Google.- Nice interface. Compared to the next installment. I definitely like this interface better.Cons:- To get the full experience from the base game you'll want to buy the Magic 2014 - Gold Game pack. Otherwise you can look up a method of adding custom decks. That makes it much more bearable.- Grinding. Yes you need to win games to get cards. It's a hassle but worth it if you play your favorite deck. I still hate grinding though.- Sealed Play. We all had different perceptions of it back when this game first came out. And yes it was disappointing. Never buy sealed decks. Honestly mod the game and play singleplayer with decks that you made for free.With that said, I will recommend this game because it's still good. And if you want to learn about modding look up SlightlyMagic on google.			"

												downloaded this game when it was released but had an annoying problem i couldnt solve. for some reason the graphics on the cards was invisible, it was as if someone had cut all the images out of the cards and i could see the board through the holes. apart from that it runs fine hahaha			"

												Magic 2014 — Duels of the Planeswalkers is a really good game, but it's not addicting as well. This is a game you'll happilly finish the campaign after some days (you won't feel like ending the campaign in the 1st days, for real) and play a few MP games before getting a little bit tired. You'll come back some days, play some more... but you won't get that feeling of ""OMG, I need to play this game so bad, pls lemme play it, ♥♥♥♥ off teacher, I wanna play Magic"", no, not like that at all. Let's go to some specific points nowDeck Variety: Pretty varied decks, we don't have only the monocolored decks we know we have double-colored and triple-colored as well. There are even TWO white decks. All of them have a different style of play, fitting most of the players playing style.Cards Variety: I expected a little bit more, but I'm by no means disappointed. We've got some quite interesting cards.Graphics: C'mon, it's not the most important thing in this game. The graphs are more than enough for it.DLC: It's cheap and it's worth it. You can use the 3 or 4 decks (don't remember) you gain to play in the SP as well as the MP. They're unique in this game. All of them are varied and we even have a really good elves deck in this DLC that uses some really old physical cards. Pretty good.Also, both the game and its DLC are cheaper right now. I'd buy the Special Edition if I were you, really worth it.Magic 2014 - Duels of the Planeswalkers is undoubtedly the best TCG we've in Steam. We've got a great variety of both decks and cards. The single DLC is amazing and the price is really cheap.Also, if you got money I'd recommend you checking out ""Magic Online"", google it, it's very interesting, much more than this game if you want to make such an investment.That's it for today, thanks by reading guys. Feel free to thumbs up or down if you want, comment down below. Go play some physical Magic and win some FNM in your city!			"

												These games have come a very long way from DotP 2010, which was one of the worst console ports I've ever had the displeasure of playing. Everything is slick and clearly actually designed with the PC at least as a consideration, and with limited deck-building options this is about the best easy to play multiplayer digital magic you'll get that won't break your bank**Of course, you can play for free with whole custom decks with your friends using Cockatrice, but have fun resolving all those rules yourself D:			"

												This game is a lot of fun.  It lets you play Magic in a campaign type setting and is a great way to get to see the cards from the 2014 core set. Pros-great way to learn 2014 core set-premade theme decks with customizable side board-campaign mode to keep you goingCons-may cause you to buy a lot of real magic cards-not very customizable, can't make a deck from scratch with your cards-not easy to unlock unlockable cards and no clear definition of how to unlock them "

												After playing Magic 2015 I am compelled to return here and write a review.Pros:- Great for beginners. The Prebuilt decks offer a lot of nice synergy cards which many beginners might not be able to understand. And you can grasp the basics from this. I actually wish other friends of mine played this before starting to play real magic. I facepalmed when I learned they didn't know that a counter spell could counter everything unlike a counter creature/aura/enchantment/sorcery instant.- Fun to play with friends. Always has been. And it has Two-Headed Giant. I wish it had Planechase as well but we can't have it all.Some customizable cards. You can choose the amount of lands and select from the predefined cards. Plus the codes for 10 free cards are available. Just search it up on Google.- Nice interface. Compared to the next installment. I definitely like this interface better.Cons:- To get the full experience from the base game you'll want to buy the Magic 2014 - Gold Game pack. Otherwise you can look up a method of adding custom decks. That makes it much more bearable.- Grinding. Yes you need to win games to get cards. It's a hassle but worth it if you play your favorite deck. I still hate grinding though.- Sealed Play. We all had different perceptions of it back when this game first came out. And yes it was disappointing. Never buy sealed decks. Honestly mod the game and play singleplayer with decks that you made for free.With that said, I will recommend this game because it's still good. And if you want to learn about modding look up SlightlyMagic on google.			"

The last one i played of this series was magic the gathering. Just cards, with some effects. Feature you can buy some things on steam. To buy the expension why not, but the placeholders for sealed game is waste -_-Don´t trust the status bar on sealed campaign which indicates, how strong your deck is. It says my Deck power were average, but finished the sealed campaign with no interrupt.I´m a fan of this Card game and it´s fun. I like it  better then Yugi Oh Pc series Power of Chaos Yugi the destiny, Kaiba the revenge and Joey the passion.These were also nice. "

												I've played and completed the Android version (w/o expansions) and did enjoy it but only for the challenge it presented. The limited deck control is frustrating as is the AI breaking game rules but it felt good winning even against those odds, so I got hooked. I decided to go for the PC version for the easier multiplayer option and different set of challenges, getting the expansions as well. I don't regret buying the game only because I knew what I was getting. And that's not the complete MTG 2014 experience. If freedom of deck building is what you're looking for, don't bother with this game - even the sealed play is heavily restricted. That feeling of having an almost great deck is horrible when you know it could be better if you could just pool all your cards together and nab from there. The game is somewhat good for beginners as it does give you plenty of time to familiarise yourself with the mechanics while keeping track of the game for your (which I still struggle with sometimes with all my experience), but as it takes away parts of the game I truely enjoy, I'm cautious to recommend it to those who haven't experienced the physical game itself.

												While I would recommend this game for someone who just wishes to play Magic in their free time, I wouldn't recommend it to someone who plays it outside of this.The pros of this game are the easy rulings and pre-built, satisfying decks. The 'story' made in order to hold the different parts of the game together is enough to do just that; hold the different parts together, nothing more.'The cons of this game are the limits set for you. While you can unlock new cards and decks, you can't create your own or even edit one greatly. While cheaper than the actual TCG, it is far less enjoyable.All in all, this game is decent and worth playing if on sale, but if you enjoy Magic: The Gathering, you are much better off playing the actual TCG.

												Some 20 years ago I've played Magic in school. It was great. Now I thought why not try this? There's plenty of things I like about it, but the few cons outweigh the pros. In the end this is speaking against buying it. Here's my overview:PROs+ wonderful magic setting with characteristic cards for each color+ nice campaign+ nice graphics & graphical effects+ demanding challengesCONs- can't build my own deck (WTF???)- gameplay a bit slow- new GAME every year -> can't play with friends- oh and: Monetization of this one really seems to be an isses - they're begging for your cash ALL THE TIME.

												Just buy the latest version. Unless you're an extremely hardcore fan for Magic and can't get enough of it.---I learned to play on the 2013 version and it was an easy to learn and enjoyable experience (if you like these kind of games).The 2014 version was pretty much the same game with slightly better decks and some more cards. The main storyline was different as well but still kinda short. Besides the main storyline being different, it just felt like 2014 relocked most of my accomplishments from 2013.Didn't bother with 2015 since each game doesn't seem much different than the last.It has online play too but I couldn't seem to find an opponent. So that's another reason to stick with the latest version.Overall though, its a fun game in general if you have't tried it. There are also mods and stuff which you can apply to the game, but I didn't do much of that.Maybe in a few years I might try the latest version again.. If I feel like playing some Magic.			"

												6/10 Limited, but fun.It's no card game of the century, but it can be a lot of fun.Ideal for when you want to randomly play cards.The downsides are that sealed game mode which is a cheap money grab and multi which is nonexistant.Buy this game if you feel like playing with some decks every now and then.

Before buying this game you have to keep in mind that this game is intended for playing Magic The Gathering casually online. If you want card collecting and deck building this is the wrong game and you should look up ""Magic Online"". Most negative reviews are made because of this.I still recommend it because of the fun I have playing against people online. Everybody can use a pool of predefined decks which can tweaked slightly. This results in exiting matches with almost no overpowered deck combinations. So in the end the best player wins and not the deck. Also the gameplay and graphics are the best of any magic game. Controls are very simple and you can do anything as in reallife magic.All cards can be unlocked by winning matches or if you are lazy you can purchase deck keys. The released deck packs and expansions however have to purchased to play the decks. But you can already have alot of fun without them.The sealed deck feature however is a disappointment but i personally just ignore it and play the regular multiplayer. "

												This is a positive-negative view on this game; like is mentioned in previous reviews, this game is perfect for the beginner player! It tells you what you can do in each phase (and explains what phases are), how cards are played and when you can play certain cards. You can look at the cards, read-up on effects and special abilities (IRL the abilities are usually explained on the cards, less so in game, but there's a ""more info"" button, which is helpful), which is super helpful sometimes. Also, I thank myself for getting this during the sale at an insanely low price, it's fun to play with friends - in fact, it can be a blast to play this with friends; you can have a 4-man party, 2v2, or one-for-all, which is really nice.So, why the negative review? Because this game is more money-grabbing than most other games I've seen. You buy the original game, yet you soon realise that it's either a horrible grind to fully unlock a deck and even more of a horrifying grind to fully unlock all preset decks, or you have to spend 1 euro to buy a ""deck key""; it's not even 1 or 2 euros for all decks, but for each deck!The campaign, depending on your starter deck, is at times impossible, because the AI has the same scripted hand every time you play against them. You might have to replay the same guy 4 or 5 times before being able to beat them (happened to me on the blasted tutorial boss for christ's sake!), which is (to me) boring and frustrating. The challenges are quite fun, but can also get extremely annoying and are, at times, nearly impossible to figure out too.The sealed challenge part is just an insane money grabbing ploy. You get 5 boosters to make a deck and that's it, final. They don't allow you to reroll your deck; the excuse is so that people don't constantly reroll to get the best deck and just own online, to the point of becoming #1 in the leaderboard, but guess what! You can buy slots for more decks, essentially making it possible for people with money to waste to just buy 20 slots and still get that perfect, beat-all, deck.PAY TO WIN in a nutshell here!Another problem is that the campaign can be finished in a few hours if you're lucky - so you get the expansion DLC, which unlocks a few more decks, but again, it doesn't fully unlock them, you have to grind for that, or spend even more money!Then they sell deck expansions, more money, grind to unlock or pay to unlock, more money!TL;DR: Can be fun if you have friends with which to play, but otherwise it's a money-grabbing ploy that's simply a reboot of previous years' games.

												I like it but it is lacking a whole lot. I'd recommend free open source clients over this, I use MAGE for multiplayer and drafts but occassionally Forge but others exist like botarena (good ai) etc . MTGO is the official wizards client but that cost in others ways but is more flexible than this so you're best buying that with standard 600 odd cards as you'll get more cards and features for the price.Cons first: In 2014 as with earlier you can ONLY use preconstructed decks and some are not balanced IMHO. There is no deck building per se; you can trim out cards from the vanilla build and change land amounts but not build properly such as build a mono green from all the green cards that exist in 2014. Also there is no drafting, limited cards, hardly any modes just 2 vs 2, duels and 4 player free for all. For single player the campaign is very short and an excuse to unlock decks. Missed opportunity since mtg has ton of lore and they could have packed it with backstory and introduction to factions, characters and so on. The ai sucks and is flawed yet even when it is tough it is more due to uncanny luck than strategy; seems to be able to get whatever it needs, it doesn't seem to use same system assigning cards to the ai that it does playersPros: the interface is slick, easy to pick up and nice for a quick dual, prebuilt decks can even the playing field somewhat and good for fast simple games. Worth buying when on 70% or more off sales still and kills the time when not after complex thought out games with proper custom decks but I'd still rather be drafting BotG in somethign else haha.

												Though it more of the same in every year's version, but on the other hand, it's more of the good card play and all these new Solforges and Heroes of the Hearthstone things just doesn't compare to the staple of MtG. They are just too simple, too dynamic and minimalistic, don't have a bit complex but rewarding counter attack (instant, flash, etc) options. 2014 version also introduced Sealed play, which is mostly a money grab from the Wizards/Stainless, but was something new and fun to construct completely unique decks (well, from the random cards you get in a few boosters). Wish multiplayer get more attention, but probably we should wait another year or two for a proper lobby system. And i wish i shouldn't have to buy a new version of a game every year. Should be just expansions and decks..			"

												If you're into magic and fantasy, want to think tactics and strategy - get this game. The price is good and worth it for what it is, and once you get an idea of how to play, you'll realize how addicting it is. However, if you're here, you've probably seen Magic 2015 and are thinking ""why should I get this when 2015 is right there?"". That game kind of failed, but it was because of the fans; they asked for a game where they can create their own decks from scratch and it back-fired on them - 2-headed giant got removed (for obvious reasons being it would be stupidly OP). I would avoid that game completely and play this until Magic 2016 comes out - even the developers say 2015 was awful.			"

												Magic 2014 is yet again a the best Magic learning tool for most people. It is user friendly and informative for those who are new to the game, with a very clean and well-presented interface. The tutorials aren’t boring and frustrating long either, it puts you right into a duel and teaches what you need to do to survive and flourish. Nevertheless, the game failed to offer an open deck builder (sealed deck is a joke with P2W AND Cheaters). If I compare 2014 with MtG: DotP 2013, I got dumber basic decks (expansion/DLC improves that) and also miss Planechase mode, but I got epic music and beautiful graphics (with bigger cards!).Also, there's MODs from community! You can add THOUSANDS of new cards to the game!Synthesing, Magic: The Gathering 2014 is an awesome game. It is a great (and cheap :D) introduction into the wonderful world of trading card games.			"

												I grew up playing Magic and I hold the game dear.  I wish the same experience translated here.  The vanilla game you pay for (or, in the case of this free weekend, are gifted) does not give you enough cards to be competitive.  Do mind that this is a paygate game in every sense of the word.  You may clear the tutorial, and possibly one or two campaign opponents, but expect to spend money on better cards and decks to sustain playability.  With that said, many core game concepts are retained and the dueling is somewhat fun.  3/10			"

												Soooo this is my first review and i have to say its not a ""bad"" game but i have to say the free version (Magic Duels) actually offers more content since its gets updated regulary. And i have a feeling almost noone plays it online anymore, most of the time you wont find anyone to play ANY mode.I realy enjoyed the singleplayer though. But it was kinda short and the ""Revenge campaign"" wasnt realy helping.So to sum it up i wouldnt recommend buying this game. Magic Duels (wich is free2play) is a better alternative.			"

												Go play the actual magic game even if youre new. Go to a comic store and play with a few guys or something this game isnt worth your time. You barely are able to customize your decks in this game which takes away the purpose of magic. AI are stupid good and always pull the right ♥♥♥♥ing card for every situation. Oh you finally got a creature out onto the field. Enemy casts a removal spell of some sort to get rid of it. The only color that fares well is blue because of the removal it has.

Hopefully the next Duels Of The Planeswalkers will let you customize decks with the cards you have unlike the ones in the past.			"

												I would give this game a pretty good review except for the campaign mode, which really should be called ""Computer cheat because all the computer draws are pre-programmed to be the best possible sequence of draws for this deck."" Which makes the campaign mode almost zero fun to play. Getting your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you repeatedly by what would be called out for cheating in a real game just takes all the fun out of it. That lost the game my recommendation. I'm just glad I got it at 75% off. If I had paid full price, I would have been ragingly angry.Further, there really needs to be a ""skip timer"" button. Being forced to wait through multiple timers when you can't do anything (like when you're being attacked, have no blockers, and no instants), just drags out the experience of getting owned.			"

												They had a lot of things they could do with this game, but they didn't go that route.  The difficulty curve was unpleasant, and reminiscent of a 'pay to win' pve implementation.  You get two newbie friendly decks, no room to customize or edit (short of buying DLC) and then you get put against a superior deck.  Victory isn't achieved by skill, but by sheer dumb luck (getting all the right cards), lowering the difficulty, or buying DLC.  Notice how I keep bringing up the DLC?  I think there's a strategy at work here.  As a longtime Magic fan and a big fan of the old MTG computer game, way back when (glitches and all), I'm pained that they've thrown their usual design philosophy out the window (See articles on Johnny, Timmy, and Spike - google them) and opted for the 'cash in on DLC' route.  No, you don't actually get to build decks, you follow the set builds they offer.  Why take something so open ended and creative and limit it so badly?  It baffles.I can't recommend.  I bought this on sale for 75% off, and I still feel it was a waste of my money.			"

												I'm not crazy about this game.  The deck building was nice in theory, but just didn't work out in practice - there's not nearly enough cards in the database to ensure an interesting selection.  I get the same cards from most booster packs.  I also find the card selection in general to be less appealing than in 2013.  Think I'll just stick with the 2013 version.			"

												I love MTG, I've played the card game for a good while now and considering its age, it's been the influence for a multitude of other card based games (Yu-Gi-Oh! and Hearthstone). However, this is a terrible game; I understand that a video game version will be unable to create quite the same feeling as playing it with friends and actual cards, but they could have done a much better job than this. If you didn’t enjoy the previous Magic the Gathering videogames, then you won’t enjoy this because it is identical to the last apart from different cards, encounters and story. They made no effort to improve or change the interface/gameplay which really needed a reboot, especially as this game now has a lot of competition from other games.The encounters feel as though they are going on forever, pointless features that just drag the game on an on even though you already know the outcome. For example, even when I am unable to block an attack, it still waits for me to respond which is one of the many things that makes drag on for about an hour. On the opponents turn, if he plays a card, the game will not continue, unless you actually click it. This is the same for every card played by an opponent (except land). Why? Why does it make me do this? I cannot change the outcome, I am still watching what my opponent is doing, why not just show me the card then resume your turn? There is no point in waiting for me to click on it as I can read the cards abilities at ANY point in the game. There are plenty more examples, but these are the main ones that made me not enjoy the game.I've only played single player, and have no desire whatsoever to play the multiplayer feature so that may be better, I don't know? But this game was a waste of my money considering I have several physical decks at home and a group of friends who are willing to play the actual game with me. I just feel as though the developers could have done a lot more to make this game flow much nicer and speed it up. Perhaps I was just expecting a little too much after playing so much Hearthstone, but there are so many little things this game lacked that could have made it at least bearable.			"

												This review is going to be short and sweet, because come on, who hasn't heard of Magic The Gathering games?Magic 2014 is the PC version of the famous physical card game. There are several different modes of play from single player to multiplayer, loads of decks to choose from, and you can even manage each deck and choose which cards you want in them and which ones you don't. So far I've only played the single player campaign. I found it quite enjoyable and challenging. In future, I will move on to the sealed deck campaign and multiplayer. I recommend this game, but only if it's on sale, since the 2015 version has now been released.			"

												I had no idea an online card game would be so addicting. I haven't really played M:tG before this game, so keep in mind that this recommendation is being written with no relation to the actual card game. You can customize decks to a degree, but you don't have complete freedom. It's not as limiting as you think, though. I'd compare the decks to something like a fighting game. Each character has their move list, they have their strengths and weaknesses, but it's up to you how to play them. Skill isn't left by the wayside.			"

												Well you could expect the 2014 to be better than 2013 and 2012 version but obviously lazy dev makes this statement WRONGFirst of all Magic is all about cards and decks and this is the worse point of the 2014, most of the decks are either BAD, or too situational, or unplayable in 1v1/2v2, so basically you'll end up facing the same 3 decks over and over again, which makes this game VERY boringSo once you're done unlocking all the cards, which gonna take you a LONG time if you don't pay the extra euros to buy the DLC key (rip off please), you'll quickly notice how boring most of the decks are (thus unplayed in multi, the core of the game) and you'll quickly try to head back to the 2013 or even 2012 version sadly founding yourself not getting any games available by the lack of players!Talking about the lack of players even the 2014 face that problem, looking for players for a 2v2 game might take you seconds if you're lucky but more often than not expect a few long minutes at least even if you filled the 2nd slot of your side with a friend, be warned)Then comes the Sealed deck part! big news in this version! Except it's another rip off, if you get lucky you might get an OP deck, good for you! looks fun at first then you notice you'll struggle hard to find any player to compete with you.. and then once you unlocked those 2 ""free"" sealed deck bad surprise! if you want more deck or if your draws were terrible and both sealed deck you have you CAN'T reset them and you have to PAY to get more slots! and not just a few cents, no, 2 euros just for ONE sealed deck that might turn out terribad again, pure waste!Actually until not long ago from the 6th sealed deck and up DLC you'd have to pay about 9 euros just to unlock 3 sealed deck slots packages! what a RIP OFF!so talking about price check it out, about 60+euros to have a full 2014 version, which gets you basically 3 or 4 decks worth playing but you'll get very bored of them fast, probably won't have any players to compete with within a few months with the 2015 version coming up and a game FULL of BUGS!Yes another huge bad thing about the 2014: it doesn't resolve ANYTHING from the 2012 and 2013 (well actually a recent patch in the 2012 broke a deck you can't keep it unlocked anymore, it hasn't happened YET in the 13 and 14..), you'll end up with a limit to token on the board as usual, freezes, game sync issues which won't get solved until one of the players leave the game and to make matter worse when you're trying to unlock decks if your opponent leaves the game for rage quit or whatever reason you HAVE to fight the AI until it's over unlike the 2012 and 2013 where you could choose weither or not you wanted the AI to take over, making the unlocking process a pain in the *SS, basically trying to force your hand to pay 1e per deck key to unlock them!So if you like magic what I recommend you best is to either go get some cards in real life and play there (that won't cost you much more than the sealed deck DLC anyway!!!) or buy the 2013 version which has much better decks and variety and pretty much as many online players anyway) or even get the 2012 if you get it on steam sales, you might struggle to get some multiplayer going but the decks are way more fun anyway (might wanna wait until the Treefolk deck isn't freaking bugged anymore though, how can you realease a patch 3 years after the launch of the game and BREAK the game is beyond me, just proves how bad the dev are and how much they do not care about their customers nor their games!)So there you have it, DON'T give your money to vampires by buying the 2014, especially for the full price, at least wait until some solid 60+% sales or you might regret it, I DO			"

Good times, when things were more simple. If you are looking to create your own deck Magic Online is the way to go. But if you want to learn or refresh your skills in Magic, Duels of the Planeswalkers is a great alternative. AI is probably the best Online/Digital TCG I have ever experienced. I love the challenge and grind of unlocking the full decks. Just to make things clear, I have been playing Campaign only and I haven't even tried playing any other game modes.

												If you enjoy Magic but think it's too expensive, this game will be nothing new. And let me just say, when I'm playing a video game, I shouldn't be confronted with the decision to spend more money or stop playing within the first 2 hours of play. The base game might as well be free since Wizards will nickle and dime you for all you're worth. Enjoy sealed format? 2 bucks a pop after the first 2. Enjoy new decks? 3 bucks a pop. Want foil cards? Seriously? Why? Well, that's money too.This game is the pinnacle of money grubbing developers, which is a shame because I don't mind spending money on a quality game I enjoy (up to a point), but just the feeling of 'pay me or you can't play,' makes me say 'Thanks, but I guess I won't play or buy from you again.'Pros: it's magic, it's generally funCons: obvious money grubbing, limited playability, you're better off going to shops and playing magic or just playing something else at allOverall, would not buy if you've played a decent amount of Magic before; BUT if you're looking to learn, you can pick this up pretty cheap and get a feel for your playstyle. Do not buy anything besides the base game since all the DLC is a waste of money.			"

Friendly to new players yet challenging to veterans.Content and graphics are as usual, as good as they usually are.Would like to see a speed up option in gameplay though (animation speedup/disable option) for people who wish to go through games faster.Would also like to see the removal of 'impossible' decks (eg. suntail hawk/apostle decks). they posed no meaning to the game except being a filler opponent. More opponents with proper decks would give proper and better match experience.			"

												A great way to make magic the gathering card game come to life.Having all buffs and tokens handled for you, makes this a game that really allows you to just get into what this game is all about.Only cons I have are that this game is quite buggy, sometimes pausing the game indefinitely or zooming into a card that you cannot un-zoom out of... and the limited customization of decks... Apart from this; a game I would defiantly suggest for casual magic players and/or beginners.  "

												Really enjoyable game, really easy to follow as it step-by-step teaches you the rules of the game. However for a seasoned player this can be a little annoying as tutorials are unavoidable. The online play is a nice touch as you can create interesting decks. But honestly the exclusion of onlin boosters does bother me as i can't build a deck that's anywhere near as good as anything in real life. Also do not expect any DLC as we're at the end of the Theros booster cycle and no DLC has yet come and no doubt the next MTG game will be out before October.			"

												Absolute Trash. If you like winning or unlocking new decks without paying to unlock the rest of a deck so you actually stand a chance against the real decks your campaign opponents are given, this game is not for you. Even the limited play is only sealed, suggests which deck the program thinks is best and you have to buy more slots to play with new sealed pools. The game is flashy and can sometimes bring new players into the game, but DOTP 13 was probably better than this, it even seems like more time-wasting was pumped into DOTP 14 after deciding that there wasn't enough waiting in 13. 2/10, I would just pick up an intro deck at your local hobby shop or buy in to MTGO if you want to get into Magic. Even as a limited introduction to the game, DOTP is pay-to-play when you could just buy magic singles or cards on MTGO which actually have resale value.			"

												  As a beginner Magic player and long time table top gamer, this game immediately grabbed my attention. While I wasn't too big into Magic before playing this game; the game did however make it easier for me to understand Magic much better than I did before. However, the actual game itself suffers from a short campaign and a shorter sealed campaign; as well as a low number of opponents to play against in custom play.     First the good stuff, while the campaign is too short for a seasoned magic player; a beginner should find the campaign as a 4 hour tutorial on the basics of the game. The sealed campaign is also a good way for beginners to apply what they've learned to create a deck with a strategy all their own.     But unfortunately the main game only uses cards from the 2014 Core set and there is a limit in the sealed campaign that keeps you from creating more decks. You could buy those slots, but it's more beneficial to just get into the actual trading card game.     The experience is enjoyable, but too pricey. I recommend picking this game up if you’re a beginner or a seasoned player with very few people to play with. I also recommend picking this game up when it’s on sale.			"

												The game could be much better, specially the campaign and sealed deck modes. In the campaign mode, the four or five animation movies are quite poor, show nothing interesting and graphics are bad. As you can see in the fith screenshot planes are a short trip, 3 encounters against weird buids with fixed gameplay that will force you to use different decks in order to beat them, and a last one, a boss using a unlockable deck. You get a short text with every one of this four encounters, plus an introductory one for the plane, and that's it. Once this are beaten you can face a Planeswalker (of five) and unlock its deck or move to the next plane. There are 5 planes like this in the core game, and the last boss (you fight it alongside Chandra). Beating him unlocks revenge mode, where you get a rematch against the ten playable decks and a final one agains the last boss.In sealed deck mode, first and second screenshots, you get six sealed booster packs, and with the random cards they contain you build a deck, wich you can use to face up to six computer controlled decks, a test-deck that spams 1/1 fliers, plus other players also using their sealed decks. You can recieve another three booster packs in the singleplay mode. Now, there are two slots avalaible in sealed mode, and every sealed deck use one of this, for good, it cannot be restarded. Extra slots can be purchased, up to a maximum of 20 (3rd, 4th and 5th slots cost 1'99 each, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20 slots are sold in groups of four for 8'99 each). Quite messy.10 challenges, and multiplayer (1vs1, 1vs1vs1vs1, 2vs2)The expansion adds two planes in campaign mode, 5 unlockable decks (meaning 5 encounters in revenge) and 5 challenges.There are playable decks as dlc, for 2'99 you get a couple of those.Soundtrack is very good, and so is the artwork. Gameplay is fine, unless you want to use a gamepad.As I said, the game could be better, has a lot of potencial, but it's still used as an introduction to the actual card game. That doesn't mean is not a good game, and even if some of the dlc are way overpriced  (would you buy everything the total spent would be close to 100 €), the core game and the expansion have a huge value for the money.Core game: 4/5DLC: 2/5			"

You can slowly unlock cards to make a contructed deck but it takes so painfully long to unlock cards without having to pay extra for more decks to play with. You are better off playing magic online through wizards website since most of the time it's hard to find a single match.			"

Posted: January 4, 2014
												So, this is the first time I've actually played Magic.  I've always been interested in playing Magic, but there were a few things about card-collection driven gameplay that always turned me off.  One, it leads to uneven gameplay.  Two, it will likely have me spending lots of money on additional card pacts to try and find rare cards.  Three, even though I hadn't even tried playing the game, I figured that I'd rather play a version of Magic where the winner is determined by in-game tactics (how you use your cards) or a bit of luck (the order that the cards fly out of the deck), rather than 'the player with the best collection of cards wins.'  Somehow I convinced myself that all of this would be different if I were to buy a video game version of it...So, completely oblivious, I started playing.  Initially I'm just having fun getting the hang of the rules, unlocking a few starter decks... and then I get ♥♥♥♥ed.  I learn to un-♥♥♥♥ myself.  I get ♥♥♥♥ed again.  Slowly, I start piecing together the 'rock, paper, scissors, lighter, squirt-gun, Legos’ style tactics the game employs.  And, through this enjoyable, yet painful, ♥♥♥♥ing and un-♥♥♥♥ing learning process, the game teaches me how important the meta-game deck selection and deck building tactics are.  This was not a point I was willing to concede for quite a while.  I had grown rather fond of a particular deck and wanted to think I could beat anyone with it, but I’m afraid that’s just not true for the starting cards.  Eventually I fell back on the 'cheaper' tactics of other elemental decks.  If my opponent was zerg-rushing, I’d try to out zerg them.  If my opponent was inhibiting all of my creatures, I’d bypass the need for creatures and just attack the player with spells.  If an opponent is killing off all of your important creatures with black magic, switch to a black magic deck so most of their spells can’t harm you, etcetera.The game is mainly about sizing up your opponent, realizing what deck and strategy they'll try to use, and responding with an appropriate deck/counter strategy.  The gameplay elements that I had previously focused so much importance on were mainly just the aftermath.  Sure, some tactics are required during gameplay, but in my experience it rarely makes a significant difference in the outcome of a match.  There is still a large bit of luck required though.  A strong starting hand and the order in which cards are revealed can swing the outcome of a match.  That being said, most of the matches I played were against opponents with better cards in their deck, so luck could have played a bigger role.  I really enjoyed playing the campaign (player vs AI) waaaaay too much.  Like, 14 hours straight 'too much.'  The campaign, like many campaigns, seemed like a good extended tutorial.  It pits you against many opponents that attack you with a variety of strategies which keeps it fresh and challenging.  Some strategies work pretty well against multiple opponents, but eventually you’ll find something that will make you mix things up.  I’ve yet to play multiplayer to see if anything I’ve learned from the campaign will pay off…  To be honest, I’m a bit afraid of the multiplayer.  I have a feeling that it’s going to be a lot like Starcraft… there will be a lot of ‘getting ♥♥♥♥ed’ being had on my end. :)			"

												While MTG purists stick to the very expensive and uber archaic Magic Online platform, I find that the Duels of the Planeswalker series has provided a much more accessible and varied experience.  Magic 2014 is by far a huge update from past games.  The co-op modes have been included and improved, and we finally see the beginnings of a serviceable sealed play format (think Hearthstone Arena or Scrolls Judgement modes).The UI in this installment is slick and responsive.  I love that this game streams well, too, so I will be doing more YouTube and Twitch gameplay videos for sure.  There are tons of features packed into this game.  I'd say this is the definitive version of Magic online.  Campaign/single-player is satisfying as well.  I will say I found even the initial battles challenging so this is a great tool for shaking off rust or [re]learning the MTG ropes..  It's a fantastic introduction to the ""Return to Ravnica"" series, too.  Excellent across the board.At it's core, this is still fundamentally the same game.  At $10 or less, it's worth it.  You can grind to unlock all the pre-made decks, which you can tweak a bit to your liking, or you can pay to unlock the decks.  Some complain about the microtransactions due to the silly business of buying foil conversions and deck slots but these items are more for the hardcore players..  or those who are impatient.My only complaint, if I had to say something bad, would be that the DotP: SE version is pretty poop.  They should have included more deck slots for sealed play and perhaps a token to unlock your preferred deck.  The eBook and soundtrack are cool additions but that could have been a third tier bundle, really.I think this will be my last DotP purchase as it seems that Wizards is committed to releasing one of these every year, which sucks because it spreads the online community thin.  They seem to use this series as a glorified marketing piece but, fortunately, the replay value is very high in spite of these blatant greedy moves.  If you are looking for a definitive MTG experience, look no further!			"

												Yet another installment in the Magic Duels of the Planeswalkers series. As an owner of the first 2009 version I can quickly say that it has been several improvements over the years. You have more freedom with the decks, as you are able to swap all cards  from the preset decks out, and put your new and better unlocked cards in. The gameplay is still Magic 2014. Nothing to hold against them here, as they stay true to the source cardgame. The decks are varied, and challenges you to try different gameplaying styles. Some are aggro, others are control, and some rely on specific strats. Each deck has 40 unlockable cards. Some of them are throwaway horsegarbage while other strengthens your deck signicantly. With the amount of unlockable cards you can see varians between how people choose to play each deck.  The multiplayer is lacking in content. Which is really Magic 2014 biggest weakness. With such a fanbase as MTG has, it should've been Stainless Games first priority to make the player vs player experience immense and filling. Instead you get a bareboned version. Where you go into ""lobbies"" with your opponent(s). Chose your deck and go. That's it. No ladders, no tournaments and barely no reason to play multiplayer other than playing against other human players. Also the addition of sealed play feels like nothing but a tease. Here they could've done so much more. Maybe even made it into an arena (Hearthstone) type of experience.Summary+ Fun and varied decks+ New Deck packs are being constantly developed added(tho at a price of 3euro per 2 decks)+ Good AI, the best in the series so far+ Lots of gametime if you want to try and unlock everything+ Challenges and singleplayer campaign of decent length- Multiplayer is bare boned- Sealed play is bare boned- Some unlockable cards are utterly useless- Somewhat clumsy menu and UI.I would definitively recommend this to fans of cardgames and especially Magic: The Gathering. If you hate card games and/or lack patience, stay away. It will not be like Magic online, which is much more advanced and challenging to both new and more seasoned players. So if you are a die hard Magic nerd,  you would probably be better off with Magic Online. That said, this is a good entrylevel for completly new player.			"

												This review is comming from a seasoned real life MTG player. This game cheats. once you accept that fact, you may be able to begin to enjoy it. When I refer to cheating, I am not talking about the pre scripted matches were they play the same thing every time. I am talking about planeswalker oponnents have more than 4 of a creature, no I am not talkin about endless rats. I am refering to Tukatongue Thallid. I killed 4, then watched it play 2 more. To make sure I wasn't seeing things, I checked the graveyard, and there 4 of them were. Once you over look blatant AI cheating the game can be quite fun, especially when playing agaisnt human opponents.  I recommend getting this game on sale, 9.99 is a bit steep for a game that cheats the player lol. "

												In two words: ""it stinks"".It lacks what is the most fun part of the actual card game; The ability to craft a deck, by acquiring cards.Sure you can add or remove some preset cards, but it's just not fun.Think about it if you want to have a full ""MAGIC"" experence it could cost as much as $500 in cards.  Why would a company digitize that game and charge $15 - $50.The offline game is a linear set of decks, and nothing else.Most content is pay and see, meaning; after buying the game you must also buy content created at the same time as the game. It's not new content. It's pay for content.This game could be like the 1990's ""MAGIC THE GATHERING"" PC card game.  You could have craft your own deck, or explored a gui rpg world like fallout or an elderscrolls game.  Where fights could be settled with cards.A magic the gathering online game could include the ability to play as other editions of the original game, or have a special mixed aditions play.  In fact with todays technology a single engine could support multaple card games like pokemon, battle-tech, or the infamous my little pony.  Think of TF2 and how it evolves over time, or the halflife engine which has multiple games born from it.  you could have a main engine that lets you purchase the rights to different versions of magic as they come out, you could purchase an ""orange box"" that may contain ;fallen empires, arabian nights, 16th edition, Erza trilogy, Portal, Portal2 etc.   But you don't.  In fact you don't get much of anything in this game.  And considering how good computer games of the same price are. There is no excuse why these yearly released magic games suck so much, except for one; greed.I recomend you don't buy this, or any other magic card game for the pc. Especialy those yet to come out. Untill wizards cleans up their act.  But they won't because ""MAGIC"" is a fun yet expensive hobby. Andca digital verson would threaten that.  "

												I'm iffy on M2014 at best. It wasn't what I expected. I expected basically a deck-building toolkit and the ability to play other people online, since I can't afford to go to local tournaments or keep updateing my deck every few months. This is sort-kinda what you get, but it has some severe limitations. The biggest glareing issue is the fact that you don't seem to have any freedom in building a deck at all. Yes, there are about 30 different varaities of deck that you have (if you buy the gold edition), and more that can be unlocked as you play through singleplayer. But, each of those decks consist of approxamently 45 cards (not counting lands), and 30 ""extra"" cards that you can swap in or out of your deck to tweak it a bit; you're not allowed to greatly alter how the deck plays, nor build one from scratch. Those 30 ""Extra"" cards are also unique to each deck and can't be used in different decks, even if they use the same color. So if you wanted to, perhaps, move some mana acceleration from one deck to your prefered deck, or to help speed up a tragically slow deck, tough luck. This said, whether or not this game would be good for you depends on what you're wanting. If you want free-range to build your deck and test it against other people, you're going to be greatly dissapointed. If you're a new player, unfamiliar with the game and wanting to learn how to play, then this offers a very nice interactive tutorial on how the game runs and what you can expect. If you're an experianced player, you're probably going to be frusterated by how restricted of a card pool you have to work with and how you MUST adhere to a specific archetype.I'm going to have to vote against it. It has some good points, to be sure, and will probably help alot of newbies get into the game, but the deck-building restrictions break it for me.			"

												The problem with all the ""newest"" MTG games...has been theres no customization, you know, like in an actual card game.They're designed for people to just pick up the game and go, and not have to put in too much thought or reason at the start, so that it doesnt feel ""overbearing"" to get into the game.Building your own deck is quite the steep learning curve, but its something that teaches you very quickly what the ins and outs of the game are. When all your decks are pre built....you lose half of the point of card games.Having said that, I feel like I wasted my money. More to the point, I feel cheated and disenfranchised. When you call your game ""Magic the Gathering"", there are certain good-faith expectations that are informed, such as core gameplay elements, but also axiomatic truths that are intrinsic to the format of a card game. Core among these are the ability to build your own deck. Due to these misrepresentations, I feel I'm entitled to a refund.Even at $3.39, I regret this purchase (though I purchased the Special Edition at $6.79).Would not buy again.			"

												Well honestly I highly recommend this to any person who never thought card games could be fun. I honestly at first though this looked boring as hell, but my friend insisted on that I got it so I did and now I am happy for it. This game got me in to playing Magic the Gathering and the ammount of skill needed to win and planning ahead is quite essential, the difficulty on a pure strategy scale is higher than chess mixed in with some random events. I recently also tried the Blizzard card game Hearthstone it is no where near as complicated and advanced as this is. As a first time Magic player I highly recommend this. 10/10 in my deck. "

												Now, I love Magic: The Gathering, and when I saw this in the steam sale at Christmas, I was like: ""What the hell, I'll try it out, it's only like £3."" But... My mind is blown at how poorly done it is. This must be one of the cheapest games in the world to make, besides a few CGI cutscenes and like, Chandra's voice actress.The mechanics are OK, they do the job, but my biggest problem is the interface, at least on PC (can't speak for the tablet version). Like seriously, ""Let's play a cardgame on opposite sides of the room."" Great, now the cards on the board are distant, indistinct, blurry non-entities. Oh, but there's a top-down view? Let's try that. ""Let's play a cardgame... From ORBIT!"" If this is on the iPad or whatever, these cards must be microscopic. There is SO much wasted space everywhere. It's absurd. Why don't the developers take a look at Hearthstone, which is frankly a superior experience in almost every single way in terms of interface and user-friendliness, and remake this game to be more like that, where you can actually see the cards you are using and read what they do (being able to see what cards you have played, why would you ever need to do that?!), and see what your opponent has. Does it even show you the graveyards? I wasn't able to see that, although it was so far away I might be forgiven if I couldn't spot it.Wake up Stainless Games, you have a mediocre product that needs a serious overhaul. The idea is alright, even with the very limited level of customisation (Hearthstone is also superior when it comes to that, too... Did I mention that HS is also free to play? I've not dropped a dime on it) it's just... Ugh. It leaves the sour taste of wasted potential.			"

												I have not played Magic The Gathering card games before and this game was Free to Play on steam so, why not give it a try? Card games are not that hard, right? I've cleared GBC version of Pokemon Trading Card Game pretty easily in the past, so there shouldn't be much of a problem for me at the beginning, right? Boy, was I wrong!The tutorial started off pretty smoothly. They let you get a strong build and winning your opponent is a no brainer then. Its easy to overkill your opponent with more than 10 odds dammages, so I guess the tutorial is really built for players with no card gaming background or what sort. Fair enough.Then comes the real battle. You see, you start off with a ""Hunter's Strength"" deck (which was amazing during the tutorial if you figured it out how to play), and you have to fight this Chandra NaLaar girl with a fire head and a Firewave deck at the end of the tutorial. The fight was alright for the first couple of rounds, then the real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t came. Alright, she's already having the upper hand, fine, maybe I'm new, but then she summoned a holographic card. A phoneix with unlimited revival as long as you have enough mana. Seriously, wtf? If that's not bad enough, she summoned another phoenix with the same ability. After another 2 rounds, boom, i got overburnt with -8 hp remaining. I'm not saying that I played a lot of card games or what, but this IS a tutorial, and if you are ""flexing"" your muscles as a game dev during a tutorial, people will turn away. Come on, if we are being overpowered that much during tutorials, what else will happen during the rest of the game? Think about it, there are many people out there like me, who have no idea what this game is about and won't mind spending time and a bit of money on it. And that's how you kick start the game? This is ridiculous. And then I realize that you need to pay for new deck or card or whatsoever. Alright, I get it, so you want us to pay more for better cards. I'm glad that I came across this during Steam's free weekend.			"

												It's alright but it doesn't offer enough variety when it comes to building your own deck unlike playing magic in person. You can slowly unlock cards to make a contructed deck but it takes so painfully long to unlock cards without having to pay extra for more decks to play with. You are better off playing magic online through wizards website since most of the time it's hard to find a single match.			"

												  As a beginner Magic player and long time table top gamer, this game immediately grabbed my attention. While I wasn't too big into Magic before playing this game; the game did however make it easier for me to understand Magic much better than I did before. However, the actual game itself suffers from a short campaign and a shorter sealed campaign; as well as a low number of opponents to play against in custom play.     First the good stuff, while the campaign is too short for a seasoned magic player; a beginner should find the campaign as a 4 hour tutorial on the basics of the game. The sealed campaign is also a good way for beginners to apply what they've learned to create a deck with a strategy all their own.     But unfortunately the main game only uses cards from the 2014 Core set and there is a limit in the sealed campaign that keeps you from creating more decks. You could buy those slots, but it's more beneficial to just get into the actual trading card game.     The experience is enjoyable, but too pricey. I recommend picking this game up if you’re a beginner or a seasoned player with very few people to play with. I also recommend picking this game up when it’s on sale.			"

 What is Magic??Well Magic is a strategy based card game that can be played with up to 4 players. You are given decks that you can edit and devise a strategy with the cards given in that deck (keeping in mind that you can only use 60-100 cards and 40% of them have to be land cards. Every card in Magic has a mana cost (except lands) to pay for these mana costs Magic uses 5 different elements known as land cards that produce mana: *Fire ~ Mountain *Darkness ~ Swamp *Earth ~ Forest *Water ~ Island *Light ~ plains, Each element has its own things that they are good at and bad at and part from your life force bar these lands are your main resource. In away lands are a bit like money you spend them witch leads to investing in more money and when it your turn again you get paid again, of course the more money you have the bigger and better things you can buy and so on. To win the game you must think carefully and play your cards right to either take your opponent's life force to 0 or make them run out of cards and its very rear that anyone comes to a draw. Matches can last anything from 5 mins to an hour and a half but a good average match lasts about half an hour. My opinion & More InfoI wouldn't say this game is totally mind-blowing but it is in all fairness its a grate game! Out of the 150+ games i have on my list its the most played and iv met some good people and made some friends from all over the world with magic 2014, but i don't just recommend 2014, all of the Magics are great and i recommend them to all, even if your not a fan of card games, i know people that hate card games however, they love this one. For me 2014 just feels nicer and more user friendly, it only takes 1 or 2 matches to pick up most of the rules, plus i like the new game mode ""Sealed Play"". As for the campaigns they are all fun, not very long but that has been balanced out in difficulty and the amount of of them, some of the matches you will find easy some you will learn to hate, it depends on how you build your decks. progressing threw these campaigns unlocks decks, but you still have to win about 30 times with each deck before you have all the cards in them decks (unless you buy them instead!). No doubt that you will find online mutiplayer easier than playing against the AI as the AI has a very big and bad habit of cheating and i find 2014 cheats more than the previous Magics but hey that makes the win even more rewarding right!! Plus if an AI in a card game wasn't able to cheat then it would be too easy and boring and would make the game rather lousy.Game ModesFree For All - This mode is hole idea of Magic and is the most played it can be played by 2 players or anything up to 4 players there really isn't much to tell about this mode other that what iv already told you. like all the other game modes its just some good relaxing fun and if you can get your opponents talking you get a good giggle out of it, even more so when you are really good friends with that person.Two Headed Giant - This game mode requires a little bit of team work and 4 players. The game mode works the same way as Free For All but with a twist, you are split into teams of 2. you and your partner share the same life force and do your best to defend it, you are able to see yours and your partners hand so then if they a card that can help you or the other way round you can just tell them (unless your partner is an AI of course) but the only the abilities or effects you own only work for you and you also have your own supply of land cards the rest of the game is just like Free For All. This game mode can come up with some interesting results as some decks just don't mix and others compliment each other rather well.Sealed Play - This mode is like a sub game mode its completely different form the other two main modes (Free For All and [/b]Two Headed Giant[/b] use the decks you buy or slowly unlock). Sealed Play is made to make things more like the paper version of Magic. You get given 5 booster packs of random cards and then your expected to make a deck of at least 40 cards (there is an auto build option) and then you can fight your way threw that deck's campaign to earn more cards but you can also use it in online multiplayer, sadly at the moment there is no way of trading cards with friends or resetting decks also you can only go head to head with this game mode, I'm looking forward to this changing because Sealed Play has a lot of potential and i don't think it has met any where near its potential (lazy Dev's or maybe there just gathering ideas for the future of this game mode).  Thanks for reading all this, its a lot i know but i hoped it helped and you at least give it a try as its not that price heavy and you can get a really good time out of it, like i have. One last thing if there is cards you cant seam to unlock that is because there is something called promo cards that you have to unlock using codes.			"

												Really enjoyable game, really easy to follow as it step-by-step teaches you the rules of the game. However for a seasoned player this can be a little annoying as tutorials are unavoidable. The online play is a nice touch as you can create interesting decks. But honestly the exclusion of onlin boosters does bother me as i can't build a deck that's anywhere near as good as anything in real life. Also do not expect any DLC as we're at the end of the Theros booster cycle and no DLC has yet come and no doubt the next MTG game will be out before October.			"

												Magic 2014 is exactly what you expect from the franchise. It's as good place to start as any, though I'll say that you can probably get cheaper deals on the older versions of the game, which are more or less the same. This has better graphics than those however, but Magic isn't about the pixel count, it's about the playing experience :) All in all I recommend this as much as any of the other ones, though I will stress that if you have 2013 then there really isn't much point in buying this unless you're hellbent on playing online.

												For that price, it is an amazing game i must say, but only for a couple of weeks / about 20 hours i would say, because the amount of cards are limited.There is a campaign, but you don´t play it for the story which is quite boring in my opinion, but for the variety of enemy´s strategys. There is a tutorial for non-magic-players, and after that, you start with your first deck. Controls are simple and don´t seem to have any bug in it - i enjoyed playing a lot.Sadly, like in all trading card games (as far as i know the genre), you can always pay to ""win"" - i bought myself a deck (they are quite ""cheap""; 0.99€) and played the whole story with that particular strategy.

												Overall, a  good game. I play Magic casually in real life (multiple different decks, and participate in drafts once or twice a month). Since I'm always trying to build a new deck that's odd and different for fun, that's were I had my biggest dissappointment: All the decks are pre built. You have to win a match (against the computer or real life players) to finish out all of the unlockable cards; which is typically where you find all of the powerful cards and all of the Mythics (the highest form of rarity for a card). However, I did find several of the decks very entertaining, especially the Avacyn's Glory deck (a deck that only uses White mana, and lots of human creatures until you can play angels like Avacyn, Baneslayer and Angelic Overseer). The AI was smart about most of it's choices for blocking and targeting with removal spells, and didn't give in when situations seemed hopeless like human players would. Though there were a few times that it seemed to gain an extra card or two, or play another card without mana at the right time while I was in campain (specifically the Simic Clones encounter mission). Speaking of campain, it was ok, though I had it done in an afternoon. Entertaining, but a lot of the lines felt cheesy, and the CG scenes made me cringe. The Sealed Mode was ingenous and moronic. It's the one way to truely build a deck that isn't already determined; but you can only have two without paying extra money, and any decks you make (no matter how bad) can't be removed.All in all, I would recommend this game to anyone looking to get into Magic the Gathering, or anyone who is willing to keep an open mind and look past it's faults.

												I bought this game as a treat for myself because I haven't touched MTG in a VERY long time. But it is very clear to me from the outset that this is a game that relies entirely on luck. Yes, the campaign gameplay is more or less balanced, but unless you are willing to grind away at duel after duel like you've got nothing better to do you get stuck with what is essentially an out of the box preconstructed deck versus an out of the box preconstructed deck, so there is no skill involved in building a deck and even less (than usual) involved in using it. This goes doubly-so for the sealed campaign. Granted, your selection is completely random and you have to build a deck from that, but then you're limited to more or less basic strategies without--what's that called?-- Luck, again yes. Add to this the fact that you have to buy extra sealed slots (you can't reset them) AND the fact that there is over fifty dollars worth of DLC for this game and you see what the strategy is here: first taste is free, the next one costs you a child.Also: What the heck is with premium foils? Uh. Hello? This is a computer game! Who gives a rat's rear-end about foils and who on earth is gullible enough to pay money for digital foil cards? If you really want to spend a small fortune on MTG, just go to your local gaming store and buy some actual cards.			"

												I am a fan of the Magic games but before I get into the guts of this review/ recommendation I have got to say I was pretty disappointed with Magic 2014. There was alot I didnt like about Magic 2014, one of the biggest was that there was almost no real freedom with deck builds, thats something almost unheard of in dcg (digital card games) or card games in general. Another thing I did not like was the graphics themselves, dont get me wrong I dont expect alot graphics wise from a dcg but a table and cards are the last thing I would choose to do If I could make everything look ""cool"". It is almost like playing Magic the tabletop card game through a computer monitor. Its fun table top but when your able to do all sorts of cool stuff with a computer and you choose not to, well it just does not seem like a good choice to me. There seems to be alot of extra paid content as well, I haven't looked into that very far but I have heard some complaints. Overall you should try Magic 2014 if you are a fan of the series, or are looking for a payed dcg, but I bet you can find a FTP dcg that you will have just as much fun with. Lets hope the next Magic game ends up better than Magic 2014.    NOTE:  I am adding this note to let you guys know that I did like the game. I got a comment asking me why I gave the game a thumbs up if my review was negative. I did like magic 2014 It just did not live fully up to my expectations, I have been playing a bunch of other free dcg and I know how fun/ popular the magic series is so I figured it would be ""better"" than it was. I still liked the game.			"

												This game is a vast improvement of 2013, where the decks were to unbalanced. It adds a new feature of opening packs and building decks, but this seems a bit of a waste of time and you have to pay extra if you want any more than 2 decks.

												For that price, it is an amazing game i must say, but only for a couple of weeks / about 20 hours i would say, because the amount of cards are limited.There is a campaign, but you don´t play it for the story which is quite boring in my opinion, but for the variety of enemy´s strategys. There is a tutorial for non-magic-players, and after that, you start with your first deck. Controls are simple and don´t seem to have any bug in it - i enjoyed playing a lot.Sadly, like in all trading card games (as far as i know the genre), you can always pay to ""win"" - i bought myself a deck (they are quite ""cheap""; 0.99€) and played the whole story with that particular strategy. If you don´t want to spend money, you can still win - but you must unlock 30 cards.There are special cards which you can only unlock with a special code, but all them codes are found here: http://www.toptiertactics.com/19267/magic-2014-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-promo-card-unlock-codes/#axzz2tyzUHDlEThis was my first review, i hope it helped you with your decision - if the pay-for-a-deck feature bothers you, think of Magic 2014 as a 11€ game instead of 10€ :)			"

												Let me first say that I am not against DLCs, when it's properly done, and it is not a requirement to win or advance in a game. Having said that, this game features the exact opposite. It seems at times that it has been built with the intention to force you to buy decks. I do not recommend this game not even in sale. Play it as it was intended, with a physical deck, with friends.

												Overall, a  good game. I play Magic casually in real life (multiple different decks, and participate in drafts once or twice a month). Since I'm always trying to build a new deck that's odd and different for fun, that's were I had my biggest dissappointment: All the decks are pre built. You have to win a match (against the computer or real life players) to finish out all of the unlockable cards; which is typically where you find all of the powerful cards and all of the Mythics (the highest form of rarity for a card). However, I did find several of the decks very entertaining, especially the Avacyn's Glory deck (a deck that only uses White mana, and lots of human creatures until you can play angels like Avacyn, Baneslayer and Angelic Overseer). The AI was smart about most of it's choices for blocking and targeting with removal spells, and didn't give in when situations seemed hopeless like human players would. Though there were a few times that it seemed to gain an extra card or two, or play another card without mana at the right time while I was in campain (specifically the Simic Clones encounter mission). Speaking of campain, it was ok, though I had it done in an afternoon. Entertaining, but a lot of the lines felt cheesy, and the CG scenes made me cringe. The Sealed Mode was ingenous and moronic. It's the one way to truely build a deck that isn't already determined; but you can only have two without paying extra money, and any decks you make (no matter how bad) can't be removed.All in all, I would recommend this game to anyone looking to get into Magic the Gathering, or anyone who is willing to keep an open mind and look past it's faults.

												Do you remember playing MTG in Alpha? I do. Do you remember the amazing game it was? This is not it. One of the most rewarding parts of MTG was building a deck and tailoring it to your foes. This aspect of the original MTG is pretty much removed from this game. You are required to play with pre-bulit decks in the main game and only are allowed to build a deck in a much smaller side game. If you want a agonizingly painful storyline that you are dragged though with little choice, this may be the game for you. If you like all the options avilable to a prisoner at Guantanamo and have the brains of a slightly concussed sea sponge, this game may be for you. The developers took something woderful, stripped it of any glory, dressed it in a cheap plastic outfit and sent it out to walk the streets filled with shame. MTG was a monumental game. Duels of the Plansewalkers is a slap in the face to any one who supported Wizzards of the Coast in the early days. Rated 2/10			"

												This game is decent for beginners who don't know how to play the game or for people who are just too lazy to build their own deck, but for experienced players this is little more then a refresher course on how to play. The main reason for this s the fact that you cannot build your own deck, because building your own unique and powerful deck is one of the biggest parts of card games like this, and removing that from the game makes the game almost not worth buying. If you are brand new to Magic and have no idea how to play then go ahead and buy this game, but if you are an experienced player, then stick with the physical cards, you will learn more and do far better, untill this game gains the ""Build Your Own Deck"" feature it is not worth the money I bought it with.

The single player campaign and revenge campaign can both be beat without forking over extra $$ to unlock decks, similar to last year.  The standard decks have been refreshed with some new cards of course, and there are some new interesting opponents.  Gone is planechase but now there is ""sealed deck"" mode which challenges you to build your own deck and is a fun mode to play.  Multiplayer is basically the same with free for all, one on one or two headed giant.  Great artwork of course.  Definitely worth the 10 bucks.			"

												To all the whiners panning this game: grow up.Magic 2014 is not perfect, I will be the first to admit that. But the worst thing you can say about this game is that it does not allow for the scope of freedom that is inherant in Magic: The Gathering.The positives, as in any good game worth your money, far outweigh the negatives. First of all there are many pre-arranged packs of cards which you can use in both the single player campaign and online with other players, and winning games unlocks more cards for each pack. You can play 1v1, or 'Two Headed Giant' mode for 2v2, or Free For All for as many as 4v4. The campaign is straightforward and entertaining (even if I still think 'Clones of Simic' encounter is lame) and teaches even novice Magic players the rudiments of the game.Sealed Mode, which is obviously the most controversial part of this game, is misunderstood. Many players complain about not being able to trade for cards, or 'reset' their decks to get a mulligan. Guess what? That's the point of Sealed Mode, you have to make the best with what you're given. This teaches deck optimization and conservative thinking, and you can play online knowing every other player did the same, they didn't just pull a trade to arrange some pre-conceived card combo they looked up online from players better than themselves to give themselves an unfair advantage.Magic 2014 is not only worth your time, but your money. You'd be missing out if you didn't pick it up.			"

												This is the second installment of the widely popular witcher series. While the first one failed to capture my imagination nor♥♥♥♥♥♥♥this one promised a better future. This time all sex scenes are in 3d allowing for maximum dreaming of pixelly women. They look so real you can practically see your virginity swell! It should be noted that some minor gameplay is required to get to these sex scenes, but working towards it adds to the value of the sex scene.10/10 was pretty cool "

												About the only Magic: The Gathering experience that this game replicates is that they're hoping you'll keep buying booster packs.Enjoy deck building?  Tough luck, you'll play with what they give you, and slowly unlock a minimal degree of customization over hours of play (or by buying 'DLC' that is just removing the handcuffs they put on you).  Quite frankly, it's insulting to think of how stupid they think their customers must be to fall for such a blatant cash shakedown.			"

												This game could be so much better than it is. They really need to unlock more deck building options with less restrictions on what cards you can use. If only WOTC would recognize that they could make so much more through proliferation of the game if they would just open it up more. All that aside, if you are a magic fan, and have played other restricted MTG platforms like this one in the past, its more of the same, which while fun, could be so much better.			"

												Ok before anyone says anything.This game is amazing.On ps3 I was in the top 20 players for 4 player FFA and I have prob put at least 200 hours of gameplay into this game.However I am giving it a bad review for now for a few reasons.Most of this is just annoying the hell out of me.1. I can't get the Promo codes to work on the pc version but they work fine for consol version. (I have promos now but have no idea how i got them.)2. The game keeps reseting my settings for no reason at all. (open the Config file in the game folder and change thesettings to what you want save it then you have to disable other programs from changing this file. then put it to read only.)3. I have an alienware computer (yes i know) but when im in game the colors are always changing and I focus more on my keyboard and mouse than the game because the colors keep pulling me away from the game. no option to turn off.4. I can't shift tab and use the steam community while in game.5. Why do you have to check the mic button in the settings to even use a mic? why not just press a button to use if you want to use a mic. No one even talks on this game. The chat box is ok but i feel the game is lifeless on multiplayer because no one talks.6. Took out planechase :(I will say buy this game for only 9.99 its worth every penny but there is no reason why I should be having these issues on pc. My computer should be able to run this game fine but yet i feel the optimazation is terrible for the game.I give the game an 8.5/10 only because the game has setting problems.			"

												I love card games, played some MTG, WoWTCG ,Pokemon and YugiOh in the past.When I heard that MTG games had computer alternatives I quickly purchased it on Steam.I was greatly dissapointed , You are given very little to customize with and the game itself has a very buggy and slow interface. And by god , if you want to excel in this game , be prepared to spend some coin. If you want to play Magic :The Gathering , play it in real life, even though it's more costly, you will have more fun and if you're restricted to playing a card game on the PC , I recommend getting into Hearthstone. It's wayy more simple sure but it has a much better F2P model than this game.			"

I actually look forward to this TCG, unlike Yu-Gi-Oh!.I also bought the GOLD COMPLETE PACK, which includes almost all the dlc(besides the special edition), and I get tons of foils and booster packs.Pros:- Good for beginners- Good tutorial- People in Multiplayer know what they are doing- Doesn't take much time to learn how to do everything- Has some of the latest cards- This will make Magic very interesting to newcomers.- Can be played in a variety of languagesCons:- Not much access to the decks unless you buy them, you can always earn them in Co-Op though.- You don't get that much foils, but if you buy some of the DLC, you will get a lot.- If you want a good start and tons of different deck choices, you have to buy that(beginning campaign, ETC.)- If you are a newbie, you probably won't win in Multiplayer- Some booster packs are hard to get, they suggest you buy them.(Trust me, takes lots of work to get them in campaign)- The Campaign mode is almost the same as any other Magic game releasedI highly recommend Multiplayer to non-beginners, you will probably know what you are doing, and you will have some what of a challenge.

												I bought this game yesterday, spent the evening playing through the normal campaign and had a ton of fun doing so.However, after a break I opened it back up to start playing some of the sealed gameplay - I realized that I hadn't been playing on the maximum setting in terms of framerate and decided to change that before going into sealed. This caused the game to crash, and ever since that I have been getting a Fatal Error message every time I try to open it. I've tried reinstalling to no avail, and the support has been anything but helpful, no suggestions as to what I could do about it, only a refusal to provide a refund, since apparently buying a game and playing it for half an evening is enough value to warrant no refunds.It's an enjoyable game, but it obviously has major issues like this and the support if it happens to you will obviously be non-existent.

												I've been playing Magic DOTP for many years and for the price its simply awesome. I've sunk more hours than I care to mention into this game and thats one of the reasons its so good. The game has longevity, you never complete it. There is always a new strategy to try. With many decks available you don't get bored. The single player campaign is pretty decent but the MP keeps things fresh. Its not perfect the MP lobby is severely lacking in polish, and there are a few bugs but nothing that really stops your enjoyment of creating decks (though you can't create decks from scratch - think of this as magic light).Its also  cheap for the amount of hours I've played it and it has regular expansions to keep your interest.If you like magic you'll like it. If you've ever wanted to try a CCG this is the daddy. In short what are you waiting for go buy it.			"

												Magic is one of the foremost Trading Card Games out there. It requires a good deck, skills, intuition, and just plain luck. Magic isn't your measly TCG like many others.  Before I even got this game I had already played Magic and gone to several small competitions, but when I played the campaign I lost at least 8 times to the second challenger. You really have to learn everything about your cards if you want to be good at this TCG. This game also offers exciting multiplayer battles with other people in 1v1 and 2v2 and some others. I totally recommend that you get this game, but dont stop there. Order a real pack of cards online and go to your nearest TCG store and see if they hold any competitions for this game and meet with others. Ya never know, ya know?			"

												I enjoyed MTG (Magic The Gathering) when I played it with physical cards and I enjoy the setup and feel of this game. It explains everything nicely, makes your interactions with the cards and environment easy, and even has a nice story line to follow to further a certain level of role playing if you follow the campaign. A quick look at the multiplayer side of things was attractive to me. I could setup a game with a close or distant friend or friends (2v2) if I wanted.			"

												This game is no good for the beginner or the expert. I've had several scenarios where you need to have perfect timing to counter a spell or sacrifice a creature. If you mistakingly try to pause and do it one second to early or too late, you will miss your window and the action won't work. In fact, just today I tried to counter a very powerful creature and it didn't work...""No valid targets"" it said. Then the creature was out and it was too late and I got smashed into the ground. If that counter worked who knows.In addition, the timing system where it forces phases and rounds to glide by is entirely too fast. If you have 10 creatures and need to choose defenders for a spore rush that will kill you without careful planning and you only have 30 seconds....you will lose.Oh, and do you want to read that 200 word card description to make sure it does exactly what you think? English better be your native tongue and you better read fast fast fast because if not you'll easily waste over half your turn, which leaves little to no time to actuall DO your turn.This game removes any strategy aspect of Magic and distills it down to complete luck, as any real strategy is lost when every 10th action you take is swallowed up without results by a clunky interface and unforgiving timer system.I expected something better from a multimillion dollar company, but cutting corners is all I got.

												Found a glitch in the tutorial. Game will burn an activated ability if you click off wrong. I got cheated out of a card being played to the battlefield which was the key to winning that round. I didn't even know that activated powers by tapping were optional when there is a valid target, so I was stunned.I will play more and see if this crops up again. If it does, it is game breaking enough to garner a negative review. I already get a little ticked about how the game interprets clicks as it is, I can't put up with lost activated abilities.			"

												Played once for about 3 hours during the free weekend.  It was fun, at least fun enough for the $2.49 sale price, but the game now crashes on launch and I haven't been able to fix it.This seems to be a LOT of bug issues with this game, and briefly checking the community forum shows many other players not being able to play at all.  Some people have managed to get it working, but I still haven't, and I've tried all recommendations, including verifying the game cache, manually changing the resolution, reinstalling Direct X and C++, reinstalling the game, updating my video drivers, everything.Aside from this issue, the game seems fun, however there is a LOT of DLC, and apparenty some annoyances like not being able to delete your decks in sealed mode (you start out with randomized boosters and make a deck.)  The sealed mode is also extremely short, in the 3 hours I played while the game was working I played through it once and was halfway through another playthroung before exiting the game.  To get a third slot for sealed, you have to pay for it, and that's just a shameless money-grab. I also played Magic 2013, which was free on the 360 with Xbox's Games for Gold program a while back.  Seems the 2013 version actually had more features, such as planeswalker mode, and I've seen others recommend buying 2013 or an older version instead.Note:  I have had very little experience with MTG, but it was easy enough to pick up with these video game versions.  If this game had worked longer, I might have bought it. "

												The campaign was fine, it was just like all the previous campaigns. The sealed deck campaign ends after 5 or 6 battles. It's an entirely pointless feature. The selection of decks doesn't change much from 2013. They really phoned this one in.I enjoyed DotP 2012 much more. If you really love MtG, go ahead and play it but if you're just starting out, 2012 was much better.			"

The AI gets lands every turn, can counter you easily, and has all its best cards in the first couple of turns. You either have no lands or no creatures, have no way to counter the AI, and all your best cards are received after the AI's nearly kicked your♥♥♥♥♥If you want a good MTG game, get it on iCloud or play the real thing.

My only gripes are that I wish the campaigns were longer, and multiplayer servers were less buggy (massive problems connecting sometimes).

												I refuse to recommend this game- NOT EVEN TO BEGINNERS. This is a ""strategy game"" first and foremost so if you, as a beginner, don't have access to combining the color types, or even playing a solid color type you wont get far, nor does it teach you Magic because deck creation/play style is 80% of this damn game and there is none; so you cant try the strats that are more suited to your personality/play style ...you just cant. Sorry. There is no custom deck creation in this game and you are forced to use the very lame/un- thoughtout decks they provide. The interface is clean and simple to use however it takes way to long to go from turn to turn even if you go to options and turn off all the animations, pop ups, and tips turns still take way to long. Why do i have so many hours logged if i hate the game? Because i modded the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it with custom mods, thats why, and no the game does not support mods.Ai: First I want to say this game has incredibly sloppy and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ai. I would even go as far as to say Rigged. As you go through the game unlocking cards to improve your deck you will quickly notice that the Ai is locked in its decision making do to the fact it is based on a deck strategy, the Ai will not alter or improvise in anyway. Hell ive even been in instances where the Ai has no idea as to what to do to counter what i had just done so it does nothing and just continues to lay down land cards even though he has cards to take action. Putting the game on max difficulty changes very little im terms of difficulty and is still far to easy. The AI os AwefulSecond battling other players just isnt fun AT ALL, everyone is using the same decks, the same strategies. What its come down to is the only thing determining the winner in VS is the one who gets the better starting hand (in other words luck, or in this case a flawed random generator) where as normally your deck strategy/in the moment decision making would decide the victor ...I also want to add this game has false advertising ALL OVER IT, at launch they made the game sound like something completely different than what it turned out to be and with held a GREAT amount of information from customers regarding deck creation. Wait what? ..i thought the game didnt have deck creation. Well that's right it doesnt but they sure as hell advertised it as if it did. Instead what you are given is 40 card limt deck option made using 10 random booster pack, and guess what? if that deck turns out to be crap or the the wrong color type, tough, your stuck with it ...oh wait but it gets better, if you want to make another deck and try again you cant can't. They wont let you delete the deck you just made and if you want to try again you have to spend $2.00 for another deck slot once more no guarantee that you get ANY! of the cards you desire.DO NOT BUY THE DLC the decks lack  massive amounts of creatvity and are not fun or interesting in anyway, it is a complete waste of money ....Zero effort was put into it.Caution Magic 2015: Wizzards of the coast is an incredibly money hungry company with one purpose in mind; to get you buying extra crap you dont need, booster packs, deck add ons, deck slots, and if they weren't they would be offering a fully functioning magic the gathering experience with all cards for a one time fee of 90 bucks or something ...but nope, they want you spending-spending-spending. A pre ordered copy of the magic 2015 was given to me by a friend so ill let you know how it turns out, but im willing to bet my left nut that they will be up to the same old sneaky♥♥♥♥♥♥TCG pro tip from a pro player:Gambling, i mean buying booster packs is VERY addictive (see what i did there) and something you should always be thinking about when playing TCG (trading card games). Trust me i understand/know the feeling of ""not"" knowing what that next booster pack will contain, the surprise, the excitement, and the wonderful smell of freshly purchased booster box/packs meets no equal. All those wonderful highly addictive toxic chemicals.Ask your self this ...if your playing TCG games with friends or tournament out of love for the game why are you spending thousands of dollars on it? essentially throwing your future down the toilet. If your just playing with friends or even tournament i recommend this. Buy a good printer for around 90 bucks and print all the cards you want from the internet; you and your friends will have access to what ever they need to come up with awesome deck combos etc, etc, and when your ready to play the big boys in tournament you will know Exactly what to buy for that special deck you just made saving you thousands of dollars; use old crummy cards in deck sleeves to support the printed out paper card (because paper is very flimsy and hard to work with), if you dont have any search ebay for random lot of common cards you can get around a 500 for just a few dollars. Now if you cant see the simple logic behind this suggestion you are ether A: very brainwashed, or B: Highly addicted to gamblimng aspect and refuse to act sensibly do it causing conflict.There is a reason kids go Ape♥♥♥♥♥♥over Pokemon, yugio, magic, cards.

												This game is so blatantly patterned after free-to-play games that it's entirely unconscionable that they charge for it at all.  Each successive iteration of this game has established a more and more painful experience for filling out the decks yourself through winning matches.  It seems the only purpose of that was to make us as players more likely to buy the ""unlocks"" to get the full deck right away.  Buying the decks is a good way to progress, because make no doubts, your opponents will not be laboring under the same handicaps as you.  I can only imagine that in successive games that you will be limited to unlocking only one card per day unless you give them more money.  The M:TG basis is all good.  It plays the game well enough, even if it in irritatingly slow.  Just know that what you are buying is free-to-play mechanics that'll set you up for a frustrating time unless you're willing to fork over additional cash.			"

												The only reason I bought this game at the current time of its release was so that I would recieve a code I could use to pick up a promo scavenging ooze at my local play store. The game itself was fun and all but was very restrictive. Unlocking all of the cards in each deck takes an impossible amount of time and sealed play is very restrctive. Hopefull Hasbro will notice that magic fans want more out of the digital games and will fix many of the current issues in the future. Until then I refuse to buy any of these games. Wizards has the fans at heart, but Hasbro wants nothing more than to steal from players and monotize the franchise.			"

												I haven't played this much, but it doesn't seem any better than the 2012 MtG:DotP (with a worse interface).  It still doesn't have card collecting and open deck construction, though they've made a nod to it with their extremely limited Sealed Deck mode.  I've always felt that MtG was half card collecting and deck construction and half in-game strategy, so I feel like every Duels of the Planeswalkers game to date (including this one) has only ever been half of MtG.

												This game is terrible. Aside from the clunky mechanics, mentioned multiple times in other reviews, the fact that these games force you to start with a certain deck is enough to ruin in. I know this is my playstyle preference (I love blue, hate green) but at the same time this is simply a stupid gimmick to get you to spend money. As much as I love MTG (old sets, new sets are ridiculously stupid) I would rather run my car into a tree than play this game any further.			"

												Sealed Deck is NOT worth buying this for. The base decks are not that hot, even when fully unlocked. The sealed decks are seriously hit or miss on card quality, and you only get 2 and must pay for any decks you want to build after the first 2. There is no way to reset them, and even if you DO find a way (less legit it would be) you will get the same cards, as they are seeded by your steam ID. There are less legit ways to edit the decks, but if you have to go that far, why are you even thinking about the game anymore?			"

												This game is no good for the beginner or the expert. I've had several scenarios where you need to have perfect timing to counter a spell or sacrifice a creature. If you mistakingly try to pause and do it one second to early or too late, you will miss your window and the action won't work. In fact, just today I tried to counter a very powerful creature and it didn't work...""No valid targets"" it said. Then the creature was out and it was too late and I got smashed into the ground. If that counter worked who knows.In addition, the timing system where it forces phases and rounds to glide by is entirely too fast. If you have 10 creatures and need to choose defenders for a spore rush that will kill you without careful planning and you only have 30 seconds....you will lose.Oh, and do you want to read that 200 word card description to make sure it does exactly what you think? English better be your native tongue and you better read fast fast fast because if not you'll easily waste over half your turn, which leaves little to no time to actuall DO your turn.This game removes any strategy aspect of Magic and distills it down to complete luck, as any real strategy is lost when every 10th action you take is swallowed up without results by a clunky interface and unforgiving timer system.I expected something better from a multimillion dollar company, but cutting corners is all I got.

												The Duels of the Planewwalkers games have always had problems with land draw, but this particular version carried that to the most absurd maximum. Play a hand with 1 land and be thankful if you draw 1 land in 5 turns. Play a hand with 5 lands and expect to draw land pretty much every turn. This exacerbates the luck factor, making the opening hand much more important than it should be if actual probabilities were used in the card draw. The previous versions, although not given the ability to adjust the land ratio, plays much better even with this problem due to the balance and design of the decks.			"

												While the interface is better than Magic 2013, which was a bad console port, the game itself in Magic 2014 is much worse.  This game is designed to force you to pay to unlock more cards/DLC in order to have an enjoyable experience.  If you don't, you're stuck playing with horrible cards and horrible decks going up against scripted encounters that you have to get lucky to win.  I have played Magic on and off for 19 years including competitively, so I know how to play the game.  But I do not enjoy having to restart the duel again and again until I get something close to a ""perfect hand"" to have a chance at winning.This game is designed to force you to shell out extra money to unlock more cards/decks just to even beat the campaign mode.  I do not recommend it and I will not be buying any further games in this series.			"

Instead, you're given a prebuilt deck. Even in sealed deck style, you don't receive enough variety of cards to make deck building interesting, and the opponnents all have prebuilt decks, so you're pretty much walking into a known situation every time. None of the joy of the game I remember is here.			"

After playing DotP 2015 I can safely say that version makes this one look like the Holy Grail of gaming) or the much more fun chaos of planechase in the 2013 edition.  If you are an old hat at the game, you probably won't enjoy this much unless you cannot find anyone to play with or are currently unable to play any other way.  Basically, I cannot recommend it when the year before, much less the ancient microprose version, are so much better!If you need your hand held while you dip a toe into MtG, consider this.  Otherwise aquire real cards, look into MTGO, download cockatrice, or dig up a copy of the far superior (although using an older ruleset) Microprose Duels of the Planeswalkers.			"

This version improved on some mechanics over the previous one, but it still falls very short from where it should be. The lack of progress betweem each version is getting very old. If the nex version does not fix the severe issues of deck contrustion, game modes, in game control, etc... then I'm done with Magic.

												I've played previous games and had fun with them.  There's not much new here, apart from fact that most decks are either boring or just atrocious. It feels like no one even bothered about balancing the game, because most players get stuck on the first duel in singleplayer, chandra is OP, and you have to fight her before you unlock anything.Also, it feels much more ""cheaty"" than previous games - it's very very rare for computer to not come up with some deus ex machina when you're ready to deal the final blow. Let's hope that next one will be better!			"

												The campaign was short but sweet, comparable to Magic 2013 but lacking the 4 player ""Planeschase"" mode. Sealed play was not fulfilling, within an hour you can unlock every card option for that particular deck. It also seemed to require many DLC purchases to fully flesh out.If you're a die hard fan of Magic the Gathering, it's worth the money. Otherwise, stick to Magic 2013 which was in my opinion an all around superior game.			"

												I rarely take the time to write a review for a game - much less an industry giant that has 100s of other reviews - but I can solidly recommend Magic 2014 for almost every reason:Fun first time playthrough,Good replayability and multiplayer,Decent options for deck setups, variability, randomness.It is exactly what you should expect from the series.  My only gripes are that I wish the campaigns were longer, and multiplayer servers were less buggy (massive problems connecting sometimes).  Troubleshooting multiplayer errors are frustrating also, but it *does* work...sometimes.  When it works, tons of fun to play with people from around the globe - most recent match had a Swede, Canadian, Russian, and myself in a 2v2 match.			"

It's good for multiplayer- up to four people per the three gaming styles- two-headed giant, sealed, and free for all. The campaign is pretty cool too, though could've been longer (they made a DLC for that of course). I recommend everyone get this game or at least try the demo.			"

There is an option to play with manufactured decks but its incredibly limitted and once you've made 2 decks with limitted cards you have to pay for the option of starting agin... not even with extended options. The Duels of the Plainswalkers from 1998 makes this look like a demo.			"

												If you want to learn Magic The Gathering on the cheap you might enjoy this game.  On the other hand you would probably want the added deckbuilding features of 2015 (Actually you don't.  After playing DotP 2015 I can safely say that version makes this one look like the Holy Grail of gaming) or the much more fun chaos of planechase in the 2013 edition.  If you are an old hat at the game, you probably won't enjoy this much unless you cannot find anyone to play with or are currently unable to play any other way.  Basically, I cannot recommend it when the year before, much less the ancient microprose version, are so much better!If you need your hand held while you dip a toe into MtG, consider this.  Otherwise aquire real cards, look into MTGO, download cockatrice, or dig up a copy of the far superior (although using an older ruleset) Microprose Duels of the Planeswalkers.			"

												I love MTG and play it quite often. With that said, STAY AWAY from this game. It is WAY too buggy and not worth the money. First of all, the sealed deck play - don't expect much. They give you a certain amount of boosters, it's 1v1 only, and you can only make your deck from those boosters. If you have a second set unlocked to play, it gives you the same boosters to make the same kind of deck. Granted it's an improvement from not having it at all, but as much as I'd love sealed deck play, I don't play it because it's just not what it should be compared to the decks pre-built. Now to the bugs - the game freezes mid game as if you're waiting on someone to make a choice, but it never will go through, until everyone leaves and restarts the match. That happens about 40% of the time. The other times you aren't able to play instant cards when you try to. These bugs not only happen to me, but my friends that I play with as well. 2013 was put together much better IMO. Also, 2013 seemed to be on a more level playing field. With these decks, you're either completely slaughtered or completely dominate. There doesn't seem to be a fun inbetween where the playing field is even. All in all, I would say don't waste your money. I keep going back to 2013. This game needs fixing badly.			"

												Difficulty raises so sharply that I haven't won a duel in hours but I'm a new player and don't have any decent cards.  A lack of good multiplayer matchmaking makes it almost impossible to find another human to play and in the event I do find and win a game I'll only get 1 standard card.  The cost of building a winning deck in this game wouldbe over $100 and there's just no way I'm going to waste all that time and money on a single player card game.			"

												I bought this game because I heard you could finally customize your own deck in a Magic game since Shandalar. Turns out that they give you two slots to build a deck from randomized card draws, and once you have drawn all your cards, that's it: the slot is locked. Here's the catch: It's a money grab, because they charge $1.99 for every extra slot, and they know they can do this because they lock those slots down and don't let you reset them.That's fine for multiplayer, but there should be a single-player option where you can reset your Sealed Deck. As it is, you play through the Sealed Campaign twice and you're done. Then it's back to using pre-fab decks that come with the game. Avoid this one if you are looking to customize your own deck.			"

												It is a shame that this game is as broken as it is.  In a ""Free For All"" game between 4 players(3 being AI) you can bet that all 3 players will attack you first essentailly making it a 3 vs 1 match with no regard for strategic attacks on other players to help survive themselves.  This really makes the heart of the game worthless in my eyes as it does not test the real strengh of the decks in a large game.   Aside from the fact that the cards they pump out these days are so overpowered as to take quite a bit of skill and fun out of the real game, the mechanics are just terrible.  Have your opponent down to 1 life and your sure to win next round?  Go in the kitchen and make yourself a sandwich as the AI will sit there for a good 5 minutes debating the next move to try and win.  It's so slow I usually have to find a book or watch tv while always waiting for the AI to make a move.  I admit this review is just for single player as I have not yet tried multiplayer but that does not change the fact that the lack of deck management takes away what I consider the best part of the card game which is developing personal decks and testing them out.

The closest option to building your own decks from scratch is sealed play, but you only have two slots of sealed cards, cannot erase them to start with a new set of random cards, and have to pay for additional slots.

												Wow.  This game is garbage.  The true spirit of the game, the deck building, has been torn from the game.  Now the player is spoonfed several lackluster technical decks with no life of their own.  The developers have apparently decided that the players are far too stupid to be allowed to build their own and so the would be self proclaimed gods of the game, the developers, have removed our ability to play the game.  Don't be fooled by the 'sealed deck' play.  You are expected to make a deck, and it can be done, out of boosters alone, and they have allowed us only two decks for free.  Then they extort additional cash, for a game you paid for, for more of these worthless would-be decks.  Not only that, you are only allowed a booster as a weak kind of reward three times per deck.  So, you can only play the single, underpowered, deck in the sealed deck 'tournament' that it was created for and are given a smattering of cards to upgrade it.  A game built by the weak of mind, for the weak of mind.  It's a pity that a game that was so fun to play has become so boring and useless.			"

												Magic 2014 has a bad habit of breaking the rules it sets. There has been many a time where I've been screwed over because of random creature spawning or extra damage being dealt where damage shouldn't be dealt. It works okay a majority of the time, but there are plenty of mishaps to be experienced.Only buy if you're desperate to get rid of money.			"

Oh and guess what you cant use the cards from you first slot in your second slot to get a better deck. I dont write reviews, so believe me this will disappoint you big time!!!			"

												I have played half a year of MTG. I have won games before, many times. And in Magic 2014, I have lost about 15 times to Chandra in the tutorial on the easiest game mode.The game is way to biased towards the AI. The AI gets lands every turn, can counter you easily, and has all its best cards in the first couple of turns. You either have no lands or no creatures, have no way to counter the AI, and all your best cards are received after the AI's nearly kicked your♥♥♥♥♥If you want a good MTG game, get it on iCloud or play the real thing.

												There is nothing here that you can not get in previous incarnations of the game. The decks are rather poor compared to the previous games too I believe. The sealed deck mode is a a great example of greedy publishers exploiting microtransactions. You get two sealed deck slots. After you open boosters and create a deck, you can only edit the deck from the card pool you drew. What's that? You want more slots? Well just pony up $2 a PIECE for another.I would recommend sticking with 2013 or 2012 and if you are tired of those decks, there are tons of custom decks made by the community that will greatly extend the life of the game.

												The most dub game ever!If you want to play magic - do it using real cards FNM will give you a lot more fun and expirience.Why game is bad:1. Controls are disgusting, you need to keep looking for time out otherwise you can end up loosing your move. And there is no option to keep priority, well there is but only 'IN THE END OF YOUR TURN' (red gobling, trolling voice behind the scene*)2. your opponents in campaing - well their hand is always the same i can bet top deck is static too, yes that is wery fair, sure why not play with usual shuffle when you can give PC that kind of advantage. It is a lot of fun playing your favorite(I think it is basicaly the same for any) deck waiting for good pick to come, restarting it over and over because there is no meaning playing otherwise.3. Where is play vs friend, why can't i invite my friend and play with him, there is only random players in game format of your choosing. There is a lot more, but realy i do not want spending any more time on this game, it is awful, dissapointing. You better try real play on FNM or just at any day in MTG places, spending same amount on commons can give you intersting deck to start with.			"

Before I even got this game I had already played Magic and gone to several small competitions, but when I played the campaign I lost at least 8 times to the second challenger. You really have to learn everything about your cards if you want to be good at this TCG. This game also offers exciting multiplayer battles with other people in 1v1 and 2v2 and some others. I totally recommend that you get this game, but dont stop there. Order a real pack of cards online and go to your nearest TCG store and see if they hold any competitions for this game and meet with others. Ya never know, ya know?			"

												I love MTG and play it quite often. With that said, STAY AWAY from this game. It is WAY too buggy and not worth the money. First of all, the sealed deck play - don't expect much. They give you a certain amount of boosters, it's 1v1 only, and you can only make your deck from those boosters. If you have a second set unlocked to play, it gives you the same boosters to make the same kind of deck. Granted it's an improvement from not having it at all, but as much as I'd love sealed deck play, I don't play it because it's just not what it should be compared to the decks pre-built. Now to the bugs - the game freezes mid game as if you're waiting on someone to make a choice, but it never will go through, until everyone leaves and restarts the match. That happens about 40% of the time. The other times you aren't able to play instant cards when you try to. These bugs not only happen to me, but my friends that I play with as well. 2013 was put together much better IMO. Also, 2013 seemed to be on a more level playing field. With these decks, you're either completely slaughtered or completely dominate. There doesn't seem to be a fun inbetween where the playing field is even. All in all, I would say don't waste your money. I keep going back to 2013. This game needs fixing badly.			"

												I thought this was a good game for a beginner in the world of Magic until I saw the cost for a multitude of expansion packs coupled with the $10 price tag for the setup. $35 for the GC. Not worth it. I've seen too many other online card games that don't cost anything to play and let you use every pack. The animations were good and the card pictures were decent graphical depictions of the actual cards, but the gameplay itself seemed to lag between moves making each turn slower than one would expect. It has an ok tutorial, once again not as good as other online card games that are free to play, but decent anyway. Unless you are an uber-mega-ultra fan of Wizards of the Coast and have to own everything Magic related, this game doesn't justify the $35 for the Gold Complete.			"

												At first, I thought this would be a game to play and relax. That's where I was wrong.....In this game you start out with a bunch of random cards to face the NPC's; while they get preset decks. Which is a lot like other video card games but they use the same strategy over and over. Not only does this happen but these decks are simingly better than what cards are given to start with.  The only way to unlock ""cards"" is  after getting to a certain spot in the game, however you only achive ONE new booster pack. This is the only way to get new cards and the DLC is to only get new deck spots. I do enjoy Magic:The Gathering but this game is highly overratted. STICK TO THE REAL TIME CARD GAME!!!!!!!!  "

												The deck builder leaves much to be desired. You can choose a preconstructed deck with a very small side board that leaves much to be desired. For single player, MTG 1997 is better.			"

												It's pretty much the same as magic 2013 and 2012, only you don't have archenemy and planechase modes, the only addition is the new sealed mode which is totally pay to win since you need to pay to have more deck slots and you can't reset the 2 you get with the game. It really feels much worse than the previous ones too, the AI is terrible and keeps doing bad suicidal moves, a mate AI even countered a spell I was playing. It also really lacks the fun modes the previous 2 had, since I don't like playing online atleast I had fun unlocking cards in planechase and archenemy against AI but here the best I can hope for is a 2 headed giant.

												Just an advertisement for their cardboard products.  Also plays like a pseudo FTP game, hoping you'll toss a few bucks at them to unlock some of the decks and options, so you don't have to struggle with the absolutely horrendous default deck.  It gets better with unlocks, but there really is no true deck customization/game.  It's mainly designed to try and suck a few quick, dirty bucks out of you, then remind you that if you've enjoyed your sparse experience, then maybe you'll also enjoy attempting to “defeat” antisocial misanthropes using REAL cardboard, with only the power of your wallet!

												I have enjoyed the previous installments of DotP.  They all added a new game type, mechanic, twist, and the decks were varied and interesting.  Chandra's deck in the previous installment could literally be played with no creatures...Jace's mill deck was surprisingly fun, and the demons of Liliana's were brutal and made for some interesting happenings.What I have played of this, and of the 5-6 decks I have played...each deck is LITERALLY the exact same.  Well...not exact, but they all follow a basic premise...mana ramp, play big creature, win with big creature.  Even the non-green (the color best known for mana-ramping) followed this pattern.  Whichever side dropped the bombshell first, won.  And the time I've played, only one deck acheived this on a consistent basis for you.  The AI pretty much cheats it's way to beating your face in. The campaign itself only unlocks a handful of decks.  In order to unlock the myriad of others, you have to play a ""revenge"" mode, where you re-fight all the people you fought...with better versions of their decks.  And then, you encounter and unlock the other missing 10341 decks you didn't get before.  So much grind, such hassle.  Or, you know, the alternative exists...pay them real money to eliminate the grind...which also destroys much of the (non-existent) fun of facing new decks with what you have and winning.This was the first DotP I did NOT enjoy in any sense.  I gave up on the campaign after losing repeatedly with the two decks I had at my disposal.  Eventually, i did succeed and tried other decks, only to find that I couldn't win ANY matches without using one specific deck, period.  And I play MtG on a quite frequent basis.Bottom line, ignore this one...by 2013 instead.  Not quite as smooth, but far more fun, with far more versatility in the decks.			"

												 I am new to magic the card game but I have tried it a couple of times in the past. So when I read the reviews great for beginners, I thought I would give it try. But over an hour later of trying to get through the first battle Chandra, I give up. She just smokes me every time.  How can this game be fun? This is supposed to be the training battle. I don't think I have gotten her below 15 health yet. I am just glad I got it when it was on sale, so it was just the cost of a beer. I may try later on to see if I can get any further. But if not I'm just going to uninstall.			"

												As someone who came back into magic at the tail end of Return to Ravnica I found alot of the abilities and new one very fun and engaging and being introduced to ways of using mechanics that the AI would use that I would never have thought of, Its a great title and the expansions is well worth the cost. My only real complaints are the high price for the Deck Packs in relation to the Expansion and the lack of some current color combinations and mechanics (I was hoping for mechanics from Gatecrash and the like to be supported but maybe in a future Deck Pack before 2015). Overall great game could use some more variety in color combinations and mechanic variety(Enchant decks very prevalent this time around) Definetly recommend especially if you have freinds who enjoy Magic.

												Game play is really horrible. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!The worst aspect about this game is that you need to zoom in to be able to see what the cards you have are. When you zoom in on a card, it is displayed in fullscreen, blocking the entire game board. This combined with the timer, leaves the multiplayer aspect of the game stupendiously difficult for new players. I have no idea why the designers of this game didn't use the screen assets more properly. The writing on the cards could have been made more legible, and the cards could be made to zoom on 'mouseover' to the empty side on the bottom left of the screen. I hope these issues get resolved in a later patch.			"

												Why Hello There !!! (He said like Chew Chew Nong Nong Head)... Actually my name is Walt, and I am a real Bard, and soon I'll be putting out a book. I got this game because it seems to fit in with my line of work . WOW is this ever involed ! I have no idea what I'm doing, so I went on Wikipedia to look up Magic The Gathering, and now I see that this is not just a game, but a hobby that could turn into a carreer ! Then I started clicking around, and I went into STEAM'S Community Guides, and I noticed that in order to win the ""Phantom Mage""achievement, a fellow has to win a game controlling only illusions . This aroused my curiosity, as I was all ticked off about the lack of usefullnes of the illusion spells in Skyrim (unless you go with all the perks), so I went into downloadable content and found the Deck Key for ""Mind Maze"", which would allow a fellow to compass this mighty task . Wow is this ever involved ! If you're all done writing that book, get the game and the extra downloads, and maybe the cool kids (or at least the nerds, dweebs, and heads) will let you play with them .  Yes, get the game if you have time .			"

Posted: June 29, 2014
												NOTE - This review isn't so much about the game but the decks featured. I don't have enough space for each expansion deck.The base game comes with 10 decks. These decks range in colour and strategy, but some are clearly better than others:WHITEGuardian's of Light - This deck heavily features aura's and others spells that work well with aura's. It doesn't have very much removal, so it relies on the strength of its own creatures... or really, creature. It usually attacks with just one creature that  can usually be chump-blocked. Thankfully, the deck has a good number of creature's or aura's with lifelink so you can stay in the game whether they chump-block or not. However, if your one super-powered creature is killed through removal, it's hard to come back. Losing a creature and 2+ aura's from just one spell means more mana-efficiency for them.Overall, a very strong deck if your opponent can't remove your creatures. Avacyn's Glory - This deck's strength comes from numbers - and removal. This is a white weenie deck basically made from the Innistrad block. The deck works like a well-oiled machine, but can breakdown if a wrench is thrown in. This deck, if played perfectly, can win in a few turns. It can also play the long game with spells like Baneslayer Angel, and obviously, Avacyn herself. One of the reasons why this is one of the strongest decks is because it has many removal spells. This means this deck can stop creature decks in their tracks.Unfortunately, many of the best cards in this deck can only be unlocked if you buy the extra unlock key. Without the unlock key, the deck is one of the strongest in the game.BLUEMind Maze - Despite the name and Jace's usual mill deck strategy, this is a highly aggressive Illusion tribal deck. The deck is mostly creature-based and can win very quickly. The big problem is most of the creatures have the ""if targetted, sacrifice"" clause. This can be a problem if your opponent has creatures and spells that can target your creatures. This deck has a few counterspells and a few freeze spells, but mostly relies on its strong agressively-costed glass cannons. BLACKDeadwalkers - This deck is a rather basic zombie deck that is very dangerous. Many of its creatures are expendable and can also come back from the grave. This deck also has 19 pieces of removal, and can keep killing your opponents creatures while it slowly withers away at their health. Some of the removal, like Tendrils of Corruption and Corrupt, also give this deck some  lifegain. All in all, this deck is probably the strongest of the base game decks. REDFirewave - This is Chandra's usual burn deck. It features a few Phoenix's with a decent bit of damage spells. While this deck can be good at removing small threats, it really suffers when dealing with anything bigger than a 4/4. It doesn't feel like it has any set strategy, and kind of stumbles between burning your opponent and punching them.It does get bonus points for its strength in multiplayer games.GREENHunter's Strength - This deck can be summed up with just ""creatures"". While it lacks a real direction, this deck can have its moments. It has a few pieces of situational removal and can overpower the game very early on. As the game draws on, the deck slows down a bit and the agressively-costed Kalonian Tusker's and Garruk's Companion's feel like dead-draws. The decks main drawback is that it has very little mana ramp, despite being a mono-green deck. The deck gets a lot better once you've unlocked a few more cards, but evolve beyond ""Play Creature; Attack with Creature"".Overall, a decent deck, but can be foiled by a bit of removal.Chant of the Mul-Daya -This deck is a fascinating ramp deck that has a few big stompy creatures to finish off. This deck really falters early game and can lose without playing anything good if you don't ramp your land fast enough. However, once you've got 6+ lands, the deck gets really dangerous. It has a few All is Dust's, which can really turn the game around. This deck suffers to most from removal. Even if you've ramped up to 12 lands by turn 7, you'll probably only have 2 big creatures that don't really have any means of protecting itself from solid removal like Doom Blade or Oblivion Ring. This deck is probably the best deck at top-decking a means of winning, though.In the end, this deck is the strongest if your opponent doesn't play any removal. MULTI-COLOUREDSliver Hive - Probably one of the most anticipated decks of the game, this White/Red/Green deck is a relatively new imagining of the Slivers from M14. This deck features a bunch of Sliver's as well as some mana ramp and small bits of removal. On paper, it seems like a strong deck. This deck can win quickly if you get all of the pieces assembled quickly and efficiently. However, this deck suffers once one of the Slivers are destroyed. Since they all build off each other, removing one can mean the difference. Even if they have no removal, you might still be unable to deal with them if they have one bigger creature than yours. This deck gets a little off-focus when you add more of the unlocked cards. While this can diversify the deck, you start to lose your win condition as you start veering off the Sliver strategy.Masks of the Dimir - This deck is basically a Black/Blue control deck. Its main focus is on discarding your opponents cards from their hand and chipping away at their health. Unfortunately, this deck really doesn't know what it wants to be: It doesn't have enough removal to really stop big threats and it doesn't have any counter spells to really control how your opponent plays. The only victories I've earned for myself was through attacking with my 4/4 flyer. Once it's killed, I rarely win afterwards. A really disappointing deck; one of the weakest in the game. Enter the Dracomancer - This Black/Red/Green deck's main focus is playing dragons. This deck has a decent bit of ramp spells that go into the few dragons (7) the deck starts with. It has a few weenies that can protect you and deal small bits of damage, but after a while, they're only good for chump blocking. They can later be used for the few cards that can Devour them.Similar to Slivers and Mono-Green ramp, this deck gets bowled over once you've destroyed the few big creatures this deck plays. Devouring the weenies sounds like the right thing to do, but it actually helps your opponent pin-point which creature to destroy. Removal is minimal in this deck.This deck does get better once you've unlocked more cards, but initially, this deck is weaker than the Dimir deck.So there you have it: the initial ten decks this game offers. I hope this helps you decide whether this is the right version of Duels of the Planeswalkers or not.I've even taken the liberty to rank the decks personally, based on how well each deck has played against each other:1. Black - Deadwalkers2. White - Glory of Avacyn3. Blue - Mind Maze4. Green - Chant of the Mul Daya5. White - Guardians of Light6. Green - Hunter's Strength7. White/Red/Green - Sliver Hive8. Red - Firewave9. Black/Red/Green - Enter the Dracomancer10. Black/Blue - Masks of the Dimir "

												I have played all of the iterations of the ""Magic: Dotp"" series and I have to say this is another great addition to the series. The new drafting mode is an interesting and refreshing style of play that has been well waited for. One of the less exciting changes to the game is the make over that has been done to the HUD. Oddly they have chose to go for a lighter and brighter theme as opposed to the darker more metallic version of the previous entry. It isn't a bad choice but the bright blue is a bit distracting. Another aspect of the game that is a favorite of mine is the DLC decks that come every once in a while, this time around they are all pretty good, but personally I don't find them as interesting and unique as previous DLC decks. Overall the game is really fun especially if you can play with a few friends, a definite buy if you liked the last one or want to get prepped for DOTP 2015.			"

This aroused my curiosity, as I was all ticked off about the lack of usefullnes of the illusion spells in Skyrim (unless you go with all the perks), so I went into downloadable content and found the Deck Key for ""Mind Maze"", which would allow a fellow to compass this mighty task . Wow is this ever involved ! If you're all done writing that book, get the game and the extra downloads, and maybe the cool kids (or at least the nerds, dweebs, and heads) will let you play with them .  Yes, get the game if you have time .			"

												Look, this is a decent game... nothing more. It's an extremely difficult game for not so rewarding goals. Beating a challenging level, defeating a difficult opponent, gives you nothing. It's just a repetitive game that you go level to level with no change up. You can't even make your own custom deck, you HAVE to use the decks they give you. If you have ten dollars to blow, sure go ahead and buy it. However if you are looking for an actually entertaining game that will actually keep you entertained for a extended period of time, do NOT buy it. Overall I'll give it 2/5 stars just because I enjoy Magic the Gathering card game... by the way if you play the Magic card game and are hoping this is just like it.... IT'S NOT.			"

												2014 brings sealed play, which gets us closer to making our own deck from scratch... however, there are a couple things I did not like.The decks in this year's MTG are disappointing. There are a few that are fun to play (Dodge & Burn being my personal favorite), but most seem very simple. I miss the Landfall deck from a couple years back... Jace's deck is pitiful compared to year's past... And most just don't seem to have much flare to them. WotC is trying really really hard to put a story to MTG, but it is pointless and unecessary. The Planeswalker idea is dumb and needs to go away.So, be as it is. It's another year of premade decks. Again, the sealed play is fun, couch co-op 2-headed giant is fun, and there are more decks this year. REMEMBER- They are not going to make it to where you can make any deck from scratch... you can already do this with hteir actual online MTG, so why would they want you to be able to do the same thing for 10 bucks? Go buy some starter packs and boosters and get started making decks on their actual MTG Online game. Leave this for the plug and play gaming sessions.I recommend it, but don't get your hopes up thinking they have fixed everything.			"

												I would strongly suggest against buying anyting Magic The Gathering relating. I've had the time of my life with this game any my friends, but the developer decided to move on to new versions and broke the previous versions enough so they have become unplayable. Consindering you have to either pay, or spend countless hours to full unlock all decks, this seems like a timesink. I have been playing MTG the card game since 2002 and had a good time. I've probably spent $10k at least in cards trying to complete certain decks. But this has gone out of control. That a company retroactively ♥♥♥♥s up a game to make it unplayable so you upgrade and play with a) cards you don't care about b) rules you don't care about c) changing existing cards around, just makes it unsupportative for me. I'm sorry WOTC. I've played your games for over 20 years but enough is enough			"

												No, I do not recommend this game. Sure it's an alright magic simulator, but honestly, the game is coded like♥♥♥♥♥♥ I have played about three games in the past twenty minutes. Every single one is plagued with bugs. When zombies die and can be resurrected from the graveyard, half of the time the game will not allow you. It's the same with phoenixes or other after death effects. Most of the time, it doesn't even feel like the game shuffled your deck. One match it feels like all the land has been put on top of your deck. The next it feels like every creature you ever had is on top of your deck. For example. I used the card Flamebreak against a undying zombie card. It's supposed to allow any creatures to regenerate this turn. The zombie regenerated immediately. Later in the game, the undying zombie refused to regenerate when killed. There has been something like this in every single game I play. Where is the sense in this? Exiling and regeneration also only seem to work half the time. How does a game with this many bugs actually exist? I have played dozens of matches in this game. I only bought this game to play matches online with my friends, but every game just seems to be waiting to see who gets more bugs in their favor. I'd rather go back to texting photos of the card I played, than deal with this stupid game. I want my money back.			"

												I know no one cares about a 2 year old card game, but the AI is laughably bad.  It always draws the same hand, the same perfect combination of cards.  I understand that programers are lazy but this is really poor programing.  If you can disrupt the first few cards played by the AI it makes for an easy win.			"

												While I gave Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 a thumbs down, this game I recommend if you enjoy playing MTG. While most people will buy this version because of the additional of the sealed deck format, please do not buy this thinking its going to be some amazing addition, its not.One, the sealed'ness of the packs you receive are pre-determined by a hash of your game account and cannot be changed. Thus you get stuck with cards and whatever you get is what you get. Two, the computer has a major advantage against you in the sealed campaign, as they either do not played sealed, or they are given packs with one color in them to choose from.Excusing the terribleness that is sealed, I'll now review the rest of the game.For the most part the game follows the rules quite well, and its noobed up just enough to allow people who do not want to go through ever step to just let the computer do them for you. In this way, you only need to play things from your hands and attack with your creatures when prompted to do so.The game also has a pretty nice campaign system with varying skill. But let me confirm the computer definitely cheats, does not follow deck rules, and has a rigged deck, so if you thought it would be like a regular game in that fashion you'd be wrong. I was holding a peek in my opening hand and peeked the computer's opening hand. All land. It then proceeded to top deck every card it needed and could cast each turn for 7 turns.Another time the computer was playing black, and I either destoryed or countered each of its opening cards for the first 9 turns until it kept drawing land after land. I then used stolen goods which would allow me to exile cards from its deck until i reached a non-land permanent that I could then play for free. Guess what? I exiled his deck, it was all lands. So his deck consisted of about 7 or 8 actual cards designed to combo you to death and all lands.You will also find the computer is given decks like relentless rats with a perfect draw.For actual games against the computer you will have to play custom and leave the campaign alone, however you will not be able to unlock the cards and decks to continue without playing the campaign.The multiplayer is where its at. Unlike 2012 its actually stable, runs perfectly and allows up to 4 players to play the game simultaneously in either a free-for-all or two-headed giant format. A multiplayer sealed deck is also included, however its limited to 2 players simultaneously.Now what makes this game different than magic online where you can choose from all the cards in the game, your decks here for the most part are pre-defined. You are given a 60 card deck with a pool 80 or more cards together with which you can configure your deck. For most of the game these cards will not be available and must be unlocked to play them by playing the campaign.In some ways this limitation of the game allows for more skill, as you must use what is available and still strategize to win.As someone who has been playing magic since 1993, I can say for sure this is one of the better ways to play online, its inexpensive compared to Magic Online and gives you the full magic tabletop experience unlike some of the game clients not designed by Wizards that allow you to play magic with other players online.I recommend this for new players and for more advanced players who just want something fun to do, a way to play magic with no one else around to bust out actual magic cards.

												I feel the decks you start out with are a bit dicky to play around with and so felt that I had to buy a couple of the deck unlock keys, which, to be honest, is money I could be spending on real cards. The allure is that I can play it any time, however the clunky combat screens that seem to be very tempermental as to when you want to pause the time kind of ruin the flow and the constant need to zoom in and out to see what cards I'm playing with just pisses me off. If it floats your boat, good for you, but I much prefer playing IRL. The only reason I will keep playing this version is cos I can play whenever I want and I don't have to go looking around to find a friend who will be willing to play with me at random hours :P			"

												I would not recommend this game to anyone.  It is about as far from the real experience of playing the game as you can possibly get.  The game is scripted with the worst R.N.G. I have ever experienced in any game ever.  I am an experienced MTG Player with an extensive card collection and have played since well before Urza's Saga so I'm not just some idiot with no sense of how to play the game.This game forces you to get mana screwed/flooded while giving the AI Opponents nearly the exact answer to what you play every time.  Good luck trying to unlock your decks while playing against fully unlocked decks.. that makes so much sense.  If there was any way I could refund my money for this game I would do it and I will be sticking to the actual card game from now on.  I have learned my lesson by wasting my time playing this poorly developed game.  Oh and the multiplayer is pretty much dead.  I can occasionally find a two headed giant match type but that is about it.  Connection issues and bugs make connectivity pretty much null and void.  TLDR; This game is bad, please spend your money on something better.			"

												This game is an otherwise good idea ruined by poor features. I'll say it right at the beginning: this game is completely useless unless you're a beginner at Magic and want to learn the ropes.So, the good:- The user interface in general is really nice and works well, but it has some glaring issues- The campaign is cool, with a series of fixed-strategy encounters plus a dynamic AI encounter for each chapter-The battle mechanics are well made but I suspect a couple of bugs are out there- The dlc's are just there to make you unlock stuff faster, you can do everything ingame without problems.And that's it. Now, the bad:- There's no hot seat mode. What the hell? This is mandatory. You can only fight against AI or on internet multiplayer.- this is a big one: YOU CANNOT CUSTOM BUILD DECKS. Straight out impossible. That's like 90% of the fun in magic, and they took it out. Main reason why the game is good only as a learning tool but other than that it's useless.- while building decks the filter tools are downright lacking and having to scroll through the cards is a pain. Plus, after every won encounter, when you unlock a card it gets AUTOMATICALLY added to the deck, so you have to scroll and remove it every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time.- in general it's just barebones. You fight with basic decks against the AI, or against internet opponents, that's it. There's a sealed combat option where you unpack cards and build random decks but it's just there to remind you ""you could build custom decks, only we decided not to let you""That's it. Worth 9€ if you're new, ignore it if you ever played more than a couple of matches of Magic. I don't feel like playing multiplayer only with pre-made decks, it kills the fun of it. "

												15 years ago, I started to play Magic the Gathering (paper cards). I'm still playing this awesome game now, I spend 2-3 hours each day for things dealing with MtG.Regarding this game, it's clearly not the paper game.- The pool of cards is not that wide, you have to play with a restricted amount of available cards, which is annoying.- I'm pretty sure that some IA opponents have pre-determined patterns : there are playing the same cards in the same order, game after game. It's not that fun to know what's coming next, especially when you play a game that involves a random aspect ...- The interface isn't great and doesn't allow you to use all of the mechanics of the game. In particular, it's not quite painful to use the stack.But, in the end, this is still Magic, a great game, and you will have fun to spend around 20 hours to unlock all of the achievements. Then, you can still build decks and play with them against other players all over the world.			"

												I've played alot of magic the gathering and i must say - do not buy this game. it is frucking stupid. the computer opponents are designed to win or lose , because it knows exactly what you have in your deck and how to counter you. What an jerkhole move. Fug this game. so, I was playing magic the gathering duel of the planeswalker, and I must say ""WTF?""! it gives me an ok deck, then I beat the first set of trials, then it gives me a new red deck. im still using my old green deck, but you know what ? Its not the same deck, they purposly took out most of my ""good"" low cost creatures and gave me garbage. Garbage that is designed specifically to lose to a certain opponent. It is trucking reDICKulous. Im so aggravated at how , just, how completely anushole it did me. Its just unconscionable. wow. Im not buying Magic : the gathering - Duel of the Planeswalker for $2.50 on its free/70% off weekend promotional. N o way am I going to paying real money for ""fake"" cards. It just stole the ones I liked and gave me new ones that are worthless, and it never told me it was doing so. Then it gives me an opponent that has a perfect counter for the cards it just gave me, and the ones it took away ( without telling me it was doing so) would actually help me win. The low cost creatures I got will die to the AI opponents swarm decks first 1 mana creature. It gives me all 3/1s and 3/2s for 2 mana, and a bunch of spiders that cant block. It exiles all my creatures as soon as I enchant them, and it stomps me with a handfull of 1/1 tokens I cant do anything about because all my creatures cant block or have no defense. Total horsenuggets. Why would they do this to someone ?			"

												This game is horribly unfair. While I haven't been playing Magic for the longest time, I'm decent at the card game. Therefore I can tell when the game is fixed. The opponent you are playing against is controlled by the computer. Therefore, if it doesn't want you to win, you won't win. For instance, if you're playing against a blue deck and he's used tons of counters and you have your most powerful creature right in your hand and you cast him because you know he can't have anymore counters, guess what? One more counter! The controls are awkward and clunky too. It's hard to understand how to block and attack because you have to go through at least 3 ""are you sure you want to attack"" screens.			"

												Is this the video game Magic deserves? Really? Great disappoinment for me! Graphic interface sucks. Who the hell decides isometric view? You cannot see cards. Opponent's cards are miles away. I am tired of zooming in and out to see cards. And yet you have to click mouse to zoom! Even heartstone makes it mouse over action.Magic the gathering may be a better game than heartstone in terms of card gaming but heartstone is way better than magic in terms of video game design. At least it has top down view to see cards easily. Just mouse over the card and see what it is. And deck management. Worst management system I have ever seen.			"

												Screw this game. If you want to play magic with your friends online, just don't even bother and buy Hearthstone. You start with one deck, and you have to play for hours to unlock other decks and cards for the decks you have. Want to play with your friends? Better spend the timeOr just the money, since the game has DLC to unlock the decks and cards automatically. And it costs money up-front. And it's riddled with ads for the physical game.I'm glad I got it on sale because it's an offensive waste of time and money. Just play hearthstone			"

												This games AI clearly cheats. Sealed Mode sucks to play in, because you get a bunch of random cards that don't go together. And I know, that's the point, and it would be fine, if your opponents followed the same rules. The AI uses decks that actually work. They don't use Sealed decks like you have to. They have their own decks, that are pure type(all a single color), unlike you, that has to create a multicolor deck that does not synergize well at all. Even at the lowest difficulty level, they hand perfect hands that countered every single thing I did. If I summoned a creature, they destroyed it. zIf I played an enchantment or sorcery, they negated it. Total waste of time. And if you think that I'm ""just a noob,"" I've been playing for years, and I know what I'm doing.			"

												This is the best MTG title since it's release in 2012. Opening boosterpacks to create your own deck! It's almost as fun as the real thing. The game feels very refined this time around even the sound effects and some of the lesser mechanics of the game have been improved. Anyone who's even remotely interested in MTG should give this a try. it is a great way to get back into the game if its been a while or even if you are an active player it can be a fun way to experiment with the different card mechanics, test decks and you will enjoy the Planeswalker story in the campaign that is starting to really flesh out into a pretty cool story. it offers some interesting motivation to your games that are already very engaging. The nice thing about MTG is you can draw perfect cards or the worst cards from your library and lose either way. It takes intelligence to win and excercising that with the hand you are dealt is supremely engaging and satisfying. losing is sometimes frustrating but when you finally get your opponent down with a strategy that you engineered yourself it is extremely rewarding!

												If it wasn't this short, it could be a wonderful game. It feels like they prepared the first part of the game well, but began rushing it for release; I don't know why: a game like this could withstand an extra year of development, take advantage of new cards being released, and use the time to add maybe triple the levels. There's some nice ideas here, but it's overall too short; especially with the amount of stuff to unlock: there's not enough gameplay here to use even a third of it at all really, unless you're really into multiplayer.As far as gameplay, this game does a fair job of showing you the rules and helping you progress through each step correctly. However, there's no way to queue an action: more than once, while defending, I've wanted to enhance one of my monsters with an instant spell; you can't cast a spell specifically while choosing your defenders, yet the window of time before the attack starts--and you can't use a spell during the actual attack--is so short, that I've often missed it, even while trying to use the card as soon as I'm able. You have to endure this ""wait window"" over and over throughout the duel, and it's tedius; yet when I actually want to make use of the window, there's always some animation just before it starts, and then there's no kind of alert the window has started ticking by, so it seems as soon as I try to use my spell, it's already too late! Or too early! It's not like I want a longer window in this game, but it's so frustrating when the enemy plays a spell and I'm going to play a counter to that spell but they're still in their casting process so I can't actually cast mine yet, so I wait, for, what, I'm not really sure when one step ends perciesly; next thing I know it's too late! After playing through the campaign, I think I only had a 50/50 success rate for using a spell when the window was relevent. It's easily the most frustrating thing about this game.It's fun, and an easy way to play Magic, but there are freeware multiplayer Magic programs that allow a much broader selection to play with, so there's really very little reason to actually play this one. If only the campaign for this game had been developed more--or if the multiplayer had more cards you could choose from--it could be a good game. It's still fun, and worth the fair price, but this is definetly some distance from the premiere Magic experience.			"

												Designed for new players of magic, do not buy this expecting to have any kind of deck building freedom or creativity. Still a good tool to help beginners and new players learn but at the same time it isn't because it does things so quickly it is difficult to know what happened and why sometimes. There is no action log or anything to look at and see what just happened or where your land/creature vanished to.			"

												Duels of the Planeswalkers A.K.A. Magic the gathering 2014 variant is a game for newcomers of the still ungoingcard game, while mostly used to teach people the mechanics and promote their current decks of this generation, it does it pretty well and i'm recomending this, however you're going to want to play the original card game after these sessions.What 2014 lacks is a deck builder flexlible enough to give you variations in multiplayer games, that's my only nitpick really.So putting that little nitpick aside, play this game with your friends and play multiplayer cause it's hell alot of fun.And once you're ready, buy some real cards and have fun!

												Recommended due to how much fun it can provide as a single player, campaign oriented game. Might not appeal to experienced Magic players. Micro-transactions are a huge turn off.Pros:  Casual-ish fun  Feels fluid  AI behaves decently  decent controller support  Different game modes even on single player  Local co-opCons:  Micro-transactions  Might be too casual for experienced players  Pre-made decks with limited range of customization  Buggy at times "

												Keep in mind you will be paying not only to play the game, but also to get cards!  On top of that the gameplay is extremly frustrating.  The final introduction mission you are put agaisnt a player who counters you, and with a really bad deck on top.  You can get to the deck builder at this point, but you have no options unless you pay them more money!			"

												Magic The Gathering (MTG).  A classic and great strategy card game.  I have been playing games for about 20 years + and the card game in real life for probably 15 years +.  The game series is easily a top 10 for me and this game itself is a top 50.  This game works well and runs smooth.  A lot of material to play through, and really fun to build your decks and work on different strategies.  8/10 (no game is perfect).			"

												In 1997 MicroProse released an MtG game that had all the in-game cards available in the deck builder. That was several hundreds of various cards, so decks with good synergy could be made. I've been waiting for WotC to introduce the same. Stiil waiting, as WotC once again delivered a game that has you stuck with premade decks with no freedom of improvisation. What? Sealed mode? Well, it sucks. A bunch of random cards of all colors without any hope for high synergy around specific idea.			"

												This game is great for the short amount of time it takes to play. It is also semi-challenging and inventive in the ways they use many cards abilites. The worst things about the game is that there is no multiplayer and there is no create any deck you like and test it on others or on in-game opponents. I also found the paying to unlock deck slots a bit ridiculous! Come on Wizards, you can afford to sell a game and give unlimited deck slots and in put the features I described here. We crave for these additions and milions of Magic players would pay for these options, even if you released a new version of the game every year(like most/ every sports franchise ever). Plus I can see charging for updated cardlists so you can have the newest cards at the ready for custom deck construction. It just seems that this game is watered down a lot from what the Magic playing community wanted.			"

												Worst redition of magic I've ever played. You're unable to really make your own decks, the gameplay mechanics are broken in most places Such as being able to ONLY cast instants when you've actually already hit ""Attack"" rather than before hand (Which instants are able to be played any time in the RL game.) which when you hit ""Attack"" it literally gives you around 2 seconds to cast any and all instants you want.I honestly wish I would have bought goat simulator. It would be a more realistic experience in comparison to this piece of GARBAGE. You don't have people standing over your shoulder screaming ""PLAY YOUR CARDS IN 5 SECONDS OR EAT♥♥♥♥♥♥AND DIE MAGGOT"" like this game does.New idea for a game though ""Magic the Gathering: CALL OF BATTLEFIELD RELEX EDITION""I honestly wish I could get my money back, It is the WORST game I've played in years.You have NO control over your deck so get used to eating losses because you only have useless cards that nobody would ever use in a real deck, unless you happen to pick a specific few decks which are broken and let you pretty much control a game from turn 2+.I will honestly tell everybody I know to stay AWAY from MtG PC games.I've been playing MTG since I was 10 years old and this game felt forign to me. That's a sign of BAD GAME DESIGN. It means your game is a PICE OF S**T AND YOU OWE PEOPLE MONEY BACK FOR MAKING THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE AND SELLING IT TO US. I BOUGHT THIS ON SALE AND I HONESTLY FEEL I WOULD RATHER HAVE THE MONEY BACK THAN THIS GAME.			"

												Game is nice, but totally unfair for those who are't willing to pay a lot more for:1)Finished decks(you can unlock only 30/40 cards without paying, so your deck is incomplete anyway unless you pay)2)Sealed decks(decks created by opening boosters), because you can make only 2 decks which you can't improve or delete, unless you pay more, then you can get slots for more than 2 decks..Got all achievements and played all decks i like and i still don't feel like i really did anything special with my account, everything is limited(and also unfair if you play against someone who is paying)			"

												The game is extremely inconsistant with play. The rules change depending on seald play and standard play. Not to mention the core decks are the worst decks that I have ever seen and the dlc ones are not much better. If you want to get a good duels game any of the predecessors are a much better game. All in all Wizards should be ashamed of the game they alowed to be made			"

												Absolute joke of a PC-gameas seen here i have not played so much of this, why? welll....I have 200 hours on 2013 on my ps3 and it work just fine but this is not even close to case here.lets start with the fact that there is no options menu, no resolution options, nothing... it's a card game but still, no resolutions? how about the fact that i cant even see half of the game in some instances? nah...The game it self is pure gold, as MtG usualy is, if your into that kind of things BUT single player is nice engout, no big problems but again with the network coding, it's an absolute disaster.I dont know how and who is resposible for the fact that it seems that fairly big part of players are completly unable to join to their friends matches, me included and there is no way around it. Thats kinda deal breaker.IF you wanna play against your friend, it wont happen!If you wanna just play random people online then this is game for you.Pure MtG gold wrapped in worst coding i've seen in a while, seriously...

												A dissapoinment if you're already into MTG, campaign was far too short and storyline was rubbish, and what's up with those cinematics, I've seen better in 10 year old games. If you have never played MTG before and you wanted to learn how, this would be a fine way to learn, but that's about the only good thing about it. Sealed deck play is a joke. The only reason this game was made was to get you into the game so that you will either start playing the real card game or Magic online. By the way, either of those options are better than this, though both are more expensive. I suppose I can't complain that the game I payed about $5 for entertained me for 8 hours, just didn't live up to my expectations, maybe I was expecting too much.			"

												This game reminded me why I stopped playing Magic.   It's fun at first until you realize you either have to keep investing money in cards or get beat by those that do.  Not a bad game, the UI was surprising good.  It's just that it's ultimately Magic without the deck building, which was really the best part of traditional Magic.  Decks are premade with a few cards that you can shuffle in or out.  You soon face computer players with better decks that are scripted to get cards in useful order.  If you had the flexiblity to build decks to counter there decks, rather than play with the pre-mades, I think this would be fun.  The frustrating thing is that I have a solid pool of cards between the premades - you just can't use them as a pool.  It was worth the $5 though.			"

												This game is a scam.Not only does the game cost money, but in order to actually do anything within the game YOU PURCHASED, you have to buy a ton of DLC. This is an unacceptable practice.  Buying the base game only unlocks ONE pack of cards. All additionals have to be purchased.If this game were FREE, this wouldn't be a terrible thing.

												MacP below reviewed this game the best. Like he said....this game is great for a beginner who wants to learn the ins and outs of the game. The biggest downfall of this game is the fact that you can't customize your own deck. That's a huge aspect of Magic the Gathering and for some reason they did not implement it in to this game. Also I don't see much difference from last year's Magic or the year before that. Bottomline....if you're new to the card game, or a long time fan that doesn't have earlier versions of the game, get Magic 2014. You won't be disappointed.			"

												If WotC would create a COMPLETE MtG card simulator for both single player and multiplayer (private LAN or Public WAN) with NO server in the middle crap we would be very happy gamers.Imagine ... being able to build a deck from ANY of the 12,000 some odd cards from an online database like this[magiccards.info] and have a card game interpretor make sense of the card text.Imagine ... an accurate voice synthasizer read any flavor text.Imagine ... being able to play this card game engine independant of some controlling server in the middle. Imagine ... dragging and dropping the installation of this MtG gaming engine onto another hard drive and it work flawlessly.Imagine ... playing with your friends with these 12,000 some odd MtG cards and not having to grind and grind through poorly desgined scenerios and ""single player games"".Imagine ... that this card game engine would allow you to play special modified games through a highly powerful game editor where you could change parameters and quqntities inherently static in the original game.Imagine ... if you were freed from being forced to spend $20-$30 every time you wanted to play with 250 more cards every year that you cannot even combine with last year's MtG card game.It would take approximentally 40 years to release all the cards MtG has printed at a rate of 250 per game release.Is it possible to give us all complete access to a card gaming engine that can interpret text on a card and accurately play the card according to the core rules?Yes.Will WotC give the customer what we truely want in a COMPLETE MtG game and find a way to make a profit from it?Yes.Will they do this?No. It is entirely too profitable to chop up a game and only give the customer what is absolutely minimum to keep them minimally sastisfied.I sincerely hope some day someone releases the code and the UI to successfuly play all the existing MtG cards from a USB stick. One day ... one can only imagine.			"

												After almost 15 hours in this game I can say that it is probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had with a videogame.The story, if you can even call it that, is scarse, incredibly short, and plagued by terrible voice actors and CG cutscenes. Once again you can't build your own deck, which makes almost pointless making a Magic game at all. And no, you can't build a deck in sealed play, they will just give you a total of 120 random cards, and after that you can let the game build you the deck, because making it yourself is totally pointless. Duels are boring, no animations, mostly bad music, and the whole game just comes down to restarting the duel how many times you like until you get a good hand. And by the way, by using the white deck from the story you can pretty much beat everyone without any problem.Magic 2014 is, basically, a big commercial, in fact the game is plagued by tons of magic based ads. But the ads are apparently not enough, so WotC had the brilliant idea to release bonus content that could have easily been added to the full game, that has almost no content by the way, in form of 44 amazing DLCs. I'm really disappointed, this could have been something great, but after 3 games I really doubt WotC is ever going to release a good Magic game. Just buy a basic deck IRL and go play. Even by yourself you would have more fun.Oh, also, after a crash the game wiped all of my saves, good.			"

												Struggling to find a woman that will touch you on a voluntary basis?  Do you have zero expectations in life in general?  Well, why not start shuffling a deck of cards instead of yourself?!  That's right, Magic the Gathering 2014 now gives virgins a new hope of doing something more constructive with their life instead of leering at women in bus shelters. Essentially, you start out with a basic deck of Magic Cards (probably including the 2 of clubs and Mr Bunn the baker) and it's your job to search the plains for opponents, defeat them and win more powerful cards...Sound simple?!  Think again.This game will magically keep perverts off the street for at least a month and allow ""normal"" citizens of the world to go about their business unmolested and without the fear of being drugged, bound and driven into the middle of a wood  where they will no doubt appear in a tabloid newspaper under the headline ""Rapey Joe Strikes AGAIN!""

												Diese Teil von m14 ist mit einigen Neuerungen veröffentlicht worden! Das neue Sealed gibt jetzt den spielern sein eigenes Deck zu Basteln! Mann kann für 3 Euro ein 3 slots Kaufen, ab den 6-10 slot bezahlt man 9 euro! Was sehr überteuert ist.Die Decks sind gut Ausgeprägt! Leider sind einige nicht so Stark nach mana/Kreaturen/Zauber, Spontanzauber etc. Ausgelegt.Jace deck ist sehr Stark, mit Kreaturen und Natürlich mit Überdimensionierten spells.Epische Karten, wie zb von Liliana vess Herhebung aus den Dunkelreich; bringe alles Kreaturen von allen Friedhöfen unter deiner kontrolle ins Spiel! Kostet 9 Mana und ist ein sehr Starker Finisher.Für mich Persönlich ist der in der Expansion veröffentlichtes The Lord of the Darkness deck Favorite neben Liliana Vess! Sehr große und Mächtige Dämonen, ein Rheines Demonisches Deck!Dann kommt noch Der spell Verdammung: Zerstöre alle Kreaturen, sie können nicht wieder Regeneriert werden. Solche karten machen das Deck sehr Stark.Die Kartenverteillung an den Planeswalkern ist sehr gut Umgesetzt worden. Leider ist zu bemängeln das nicht die Realen Karten aus den Haupset von M14 nur zu einviertel ins Spiel Intrigiert wurden!Kostet nicht ungemein an Geld den Deck in Wirklich zu erstellen, und macht heiden Spass in Multiplayer Modus zu spielen. Kann dieses Spiel nur weiter Empfehlen.			"

												This game is so much better than the current iteration, Magic Duels. The main thing that makes this game fun is the two-headed giant online play. Unfortunately, the matchmaking sucks and due to the creators of the series inexplicably making a different version for each year (which they've tried to fix with Duels, but they failed miserably) the player base has been decreasing a lot lately. The past 2 weeks it's taken me way too long to find anybody to play with, to the point where I think I might be done with this game. It was fun while it lasted though, and way better than the games that came after it, which is a shame.			"

												The sealed deck is a great step in the right direction however the 2 and done until you pay more money for additional sealed deck slots is rediculous.  When I heard there would be sealed deck competitive, I was excited.  FINALLY Wizards is doing something nice for the customer without f***ing them from behind with additional costs.  Well I was wrong.  2 Sealed decks you continuously play with, with little room for improvement is horrid.  That's not fun and it doesn't keep your customers playing.			"

												This is probably the best iteration of Duels of the Planeswalkers.  It's also the best way to play Magic: The Gathering for those of us who don't have the time or are unwilling to spend the money to acquire lots of cards and play people via Magic Online.  It has good tutorials and a good help system, so I would guess it would be alright for newbies to MTG, but I was playing since I was in 7th grade (I won't tell you how many years ago that was, it's a high number), and so I was able to just jump right in.

												Magic has always been a fantastic game to me. Although it does take some of the customization off in the computer version it is still very enjoyable. If you love magic as much as I, you sure should but it, especially now with the sale on 75%.There are 2 different modes to play it. There are sealed and there are normal game mode.Though, when you play normal you don't make decks from scratch. Instead you get a standard deck in which you can improve and customize with 40 extra cards for the specific deck. These cards are locked from start but can be unlocked while playing.In the normal gamemode you play through a campaign. The campaign contains about 5 worlds with each 4 duels to play. 3 of these duels are scripted while the last ""boss"" in each world draws cards randomly from his deck, just like you. When you win a duel you will get an additional card for the deck you played with. When you win a duel against a ""boss"" you will get an additional deck.If you're looking for customization there is still a bit of that, as you can play sealed game. Sealed game is when you get 6 booster packs, each containing about 15 cards and build a deck with at least 40 cards. As you play throw a very challenging campaign, about 6-7 duels or so, you can get 3 additional boosters.You only have 2 slots for these kinds of decks, but if you want you can buy 1 more.Final score: 4/6 "

												If you are a fan of Magic, this game is a must have. Huge value when you compare what you get in the game and factor in the replayability (which is really good). I last played Magic 2012 and it was frankly a terrible game with what seemed to be very little replayability and so I didn't give the franchise another shot until a friend gifted me Magic 2014 Gold, which was on sale for $4.99 or about 2 booster packs in real life. Huge value, tremendous fun.. and I'm not even a huge MTG fan, but the game is very balanced and fun so I have yet to get tired of it. Sealed play is huge and will hopefully be expanded even more in 2015.			"

												I find this game to be a bit of a quandary. I love Magic, in all it's forms. I have been playing for almost 20 years off and on. It is indeed one of my favorite gaming obsessions. I love the game mechanics, the artwork, the deluge of new releases brought to us by Wizards each year. These are all fantastic things. However, and this is what makes a review for this game difficult, I think people miss the point with what Duels is trying to accomplish. This game is not made for the hardcore IRL Magic player. It is made for the casual fan, or perhaps even a beginner wondering what the game is all about. Don't get me wrong, the challenges and sealed deck play inclusive of this edition are geared at a more experienced player, but, minus those, this is an attempt to get people into the game. Thus far, you may be wondering where I'm actually going to recommend this game, well patient reader, you have reached that fork in the road. I will very much recommend this game as it serves the prospective player on many different fronts. For one thing, I have difficulty finding real life games of Magic to play. I have a busy and odd work schedule that prohibits me from being able to play at my local hobby and game stores. This fills the need nicely. One could say that Magic Online would be a better option, however, that title, though I do enjoy it, is a much more difficult entry to get into. The process of finding games is difficult, as is the ability to compete with others that have incredible collections to work with. I don't want to spend money forever just to have a chance to win a game. Duels gives players the opportunity to pop in and play a game quickly without the meta game that goes along with real Magic or MGO. I will provide no argument that the act of building quality decks is a huge part of the game. For me it is possibly more enjoyable than playing. I love looking through my cards and trying to come up with that next killer combo of cards. But, in adult life I rarely find the time to sit with countless cards at a table and do just that, or perhaps I just don't find it to be important enough to make the time. I don't know.Regardless, this is a decent digital representation of a fantastic game. It gives quick play ability. The sealed deck mode gives decent, albeit limited, deck building for the first time in a Duels entry. The challenges, for me anyway, are indeed challenging, and very fun. I really enjoy the puzzle aspect of the challenges, and they are quick enough that you will want to try again and again until you beat them. I will admit I have not tried this year's campaign mode, nor the multiplayer, however, neither of those was my primary reason for purchase. I bought this for the Sealed Deck play. I wanted to see what they would do with it. While it isn't like playing for real, that's what MGO is for, it is a reasonable alternative at a much cheaper price point. I think it will likely be a good point for them to improve on with next year's edition.I just want to end this with one more point to be made. A lot of negative reviews are being written about this game. I urge interested parties to download the demo before purchasing. This will give you a chance to see if it's for you. It may or may not be. I have a feeling that most of these negative reviews are being written by people expecting too much. No Magic product for $10 is going to give you a huge assortment of cards to work with, nor the ability to build custom decks to your hearts content. This product sits in a particular category for the Magic franchise and people need to understand that. If you want all the cards and the best multiplayer, go online and get Magic: The Gathering Online. If you want an interesting take on things in a quick and easy format, or want to learn to play the real thing, this is an excellent starting point.Because everyone gives everything a number rating on here, I'm going to do the same.  8/10			"

												Eh, what can be said about this that hasn't already been said.Played magic years ago, and I still dig the game, but this is just vasty unsatisfying.  The game is kind of slow and clunky, and feels very little like the tabletop version.  Moreso, the limited customability takes away from one of the most fun points of the game, designing a deck and seeing if it works.  I'm sure magic online is better, but I'll be damned if I pay for virtual cards.  Wizards of the coast are just too money hungry.			"

I don't really mind too much if the computer cheats a bit..... but seriously? The simic clone guy had like 10 useful clone cards right at the start and 50 lands (47 being islands, and 3 forests ....somehow being the 3 forests he needed to even make the deck work), I know because I sat there and waited for him to run out of cards.... why you might ask? Because I was curious. The game has been pretty nice when doing free-for-all battles, but the story, I wish the computer had to suffer the same luck of the draw I put up with :/			"

												Well it's pretty hard to write a review about Magic 2014. I just got into the world of Magic The Gathering, and i like it very much. I play it in real life, and on my computer aswell, and i like the virtual version.IMPORTANT: I do NOT recommend this game for the hardcore magic fans. I recommend it for those, who are new to the world of Magic, and they give it a try, and they don't know yet, if they should buy real life decks, or not. Because i haven't play the previous versions, here a quick sum:Pros:- Cheap- Cool decks, fits for most of the playstyles.- Challenges- Good tutorial- Easy controls- Can be pretty fun with friendsCons:- DLCs- Buggy controls- Some deck are overpowered as hell (For example: i love the Jace deck. i've made it myself, and i won a 3 player FFA with only 2 mana. With most deck i can't even summon a creature if i only have 2 mana, and here a won a game.)- Controversal cards: There are lot of illusion cards in Jace's deck, and there are a rule: If your illusion card is target of an instant or sorcery sacrifice it. But this rule doesn't effect on all of the illusion creatures.			"

These cards are locked from start but can be unlocked while playing.In the normal gamemode you play through a campaign. The campaign contains about 5 worlds with each 4 duels to play. 3 of these duels are scripted while the last ""boss"" in each world draws cards randomly from his deck, just like you. When you win a duel you will get an additional card for the deck you played with. When you win a duel against a ""boss"" you will get an additional deck.If you're looking for customization there is still a bit of that, as you can play sealed game. Sealed game is when you get 6 booster packs, each containing about 15 cards and build a deck with at least 40 cards. As you play throw a very challenging campaign, about 6-7 duels or so, you can get 3 additional boosters.You only have 2 slots for these kinds of decks, but if you want you can buy 1 more.Final score: 4/6 "

												If you are a fan of Magic, this game is a must have. Huge value when you compare what you get in the game and factor in the replayability (which is really good). I last played Magic 2012 and it was frankly a terrible game with what seemed to be very little replayability and so I didn't give the franchise another shot until a friend gifted me Magic 2014 Gold, which was on sale for $4.99 or about 2 booster packs in real life. Huge value, tremendous fun.. and I'm not even a huge MTG fan, but the game is very balanced and fun so I have yet to get tired of it. Sealed play is huge and will hopefully be expanded even more in 2015.			"

												I find this game to be a bit of a quandary. I love Magic, in all it's forms. I have been playing for almost 20 years off and on. It is indeed one of my favorite gaming obsessions. I love the game mechanics, the artwork, the deluge of new releases brought to us by Wizards each year. These are all fantastic things. However, and this is what makes a review for this game difficult, I think people miss the point with what Duels is trying to accomplish. This game is not made for the hardcore IRL Magic player. It is made for the casual fan, or perhaps even a beginner wondering what the game is all about. Don't get me wrong, the challenges and sealed deck play inclusive of this edition are geared at a more experienced player, but, minus those, this is an attempt to get people into the game. Thus far, you may be wondering where I'm actually going to recommend this game, well patient reader, you have reached that fork in the road. I will very much recommend this game as it serves the prospective player on many different fronts. For one thing, I have difficulty finding real life games of Magic to play. I have a busy and odd work schedule that prohibits me from being able to play at my local hobby and game stores. This fills the need nicely. One could say that Magic Online would be a better option, however, that title, though I do enjoy it, is a much more difficult entry to get into. The process of finding games is difficult, as is the ability to compete with others that have incredible collections to work with. I don't want to spend money forever just to have a chance to win a game. Duels gives players the opportunity to pop in and play a game quickly without the meta game that goes along with real Magic or MGO. I will provide no argument that the act of building quality decks is a huge part of the game. For me it is possibly more enjoyable than playing. I love looking through my cards and trying to come up with that next killer combo of cards. But, in adult life I rarely find the time to sit with countless cards at a table and do just that, or perhaps I just don't find it to be important enough to make the time. I don't know.Regardless, this is a decent digital representation of a fantastic game. It gives quick play ability. The sealed deck mode gives decent, albeit limited, deck building for the first time in a Duels entry. The challenges, for me anyway, are indeed challenging, and very fun. I really enjoy the puzzle aspect of the challenges, and they are quick enough that you will want to try again and again until you beat them. I will admit I have not tried this year's campaign mode, nor the multiplayer, however, neither of those was my primary reason for purchase. I bought this for the Sealed Deck play. I wanted to see what they would do with it. While it isn't like playing for real, that's what MGO is for, it is a reasonable alternative at a much cheaper price point. I think it will likely be a good point for them to improve on with next year's edition.I just want to end this with one more point to be made. A lot of negative reviews are being written about this game. I urge interested parties to download the demo before purchasing. This will give you a chance to see if it's for you. It may or may not be. I have a feeling that most of these negative reviews are being written by people expecting too much. No Magic product for $10 is going to give you a huge assortment of cards to work with, nor the ability to build custom decks to your hearts content. This product sits in a particular category for the Magic franchise and people need to understand that. If you want all the cards and the best multiplayer, go online and get Magic: The Gathering Online. If you want an interesting take on things in a quick and easy format, or want to learn to play the real thing, this is an excellent starting point.Because everyone gives everything a number rating on here, I'm going to do the same.  8/10			"

												Eh, what can be said about this that hasn't already been said.Played magic years ago, and I still dig the game, but this is just vasty unsatisfying.  The game is kind of slow and clunky, and feels very little like the tabletop version.  Moreso, the limited customability takes away from one of the most fun points of the game, designing a deck and seeing if it works.  I'm sure magic online is better, but I'll be damned if I pay for virtual cards.  Wizards of the coast are just too money hungry.			"

												Next installation in the Magic: Duels of the Planeswalkers series. If you are a fan of the game, this is a must have. Playing against high powered decks and high level AI opponents makes for some interesting (and frustrating) duels. The addition of the sealed play is great because you can build your own deck by opening boosters. I thought this mode was gonna be more rewarding than it actually was. Also, you can only have 2 decks unless you buy more slots. Pretty lack luster aspect of the game. The campaign has a new layout. All of the decks are interesting it seems in this game unlike previous installments where only a few decks were really good. I have yet to try all of the decks. I was not disappointed.			"

												It's effectively the same Magic game as the previous years - except now you can do sealed play. It deceptively says you can customize decks finally - but you really can't. You can only make decks in sealed play, and you may only have two. After that you have to pay real life money to unlock more decks. If you like Magic 2012/13 you'll like this and I think it did a better job getting people into magic. I just wish we could have a magic game where we simply have all the traditional card game cards to play with and customize.			"

												I imagine if you're a MTG veteran, this game can be tedious and altogether less awesome than paper Magic. For those who are new to MTG or haven't played in quite some time (like me) this game can be a great way to get back into things. Playing paper Magic can get expensive quick, but the deals on Steam are pretty good: Getting the game plus the 3 deck packs gets you 16(?) decks total for about $20-$25. That's a lot to play around with compared to buying actual cards. Playing with a group of friends can be quite fun. 2 Headed Giant and Free For All are great, and matches don't take long to find opponents.			"

												It's magic.  You unlock cards for prebuilt decks, then yuou can reconfigure them as you wish.  There are two ""sealed deck campaigns"" also where you just open boosters from the current core set and build your own decks to fight a series of opponents.  That is fun, but you have to pay for more than two decks and you don't get to ""redo"" your decks with new boosters once you've played the two slots you alreayd have.When I got the first one of these games, it's what got me back in to magic.  This is the best of the games in the series thus far.  It's 10 bucks, which is cheaper than 3 booster packs.  I recommend it.			"

												This new version has a challenging revenge campaign and a good number of decks out of the box. However, I am still waiting for a full deck editor that allows you do create a deck using cards from different decks. Hopefully the next game will have this feature or something similar.			"

												I love this game! I was really unconvinced that i would find a card game this fun, especially as I was used to playing games like 'The Last of Us' on PS3, and Left 4 Dead 2 on steam, but alas, I have clocked 400 hours in 2 months. I could not recommend this game enough, very strategic and rewarding!			"

												A card playing video game, based on Magic The Gathering. For people who've already played magic this game is really really worth it, for those who haven't I would recommend downloading the demo. It is a great game but that could also be my nostaligia speaking. The game itself takes a bit of patience, strategy, follow their tutorials and such and you will have a lot of fun. There is also a deck building feature which is really fun, you can versus with your friends with the deck you built or the premade decks they already have, if you don't want to make a deck but don't like their premade decks there is an auto build feature, you can also win more cards etc etc etc. For the money the game is definitely worth it.

												For those that said this version is just a cash-grab, you really have to think of the business model that M:TG uses. Small payments, often. With that said, there is a whole lot of content to be consumened within the £6.99 base version of the game for many many hours of play. In all fairness, most of the cards can be unlocked without spending more than the price of the game. After that one or two payments of £1.99 will have you pretty much the complete set. Now with that out of the way, I will  admit that nothing much has changed since Magic 2013, and that's no bad thing, it's just more of the same with this year's cards. If you're a Magic fan, you'll drop huge chunks of time on this, if you're not, you'll pick it up fast and begin your addiction. The only thing that annoys me is that they havent made the UI any more intuitive this time around. After playing Hearthstone and throwing my cards around the screen, and going back to this, it feels very clunky and having to click tiny buttons on the left of the screen really halts the pace. Also, not being able to drag and drop cards on each other is an issue that should have been addressed for 2014. Overall, cracking game. Can't wait for M15!			"

												I thought it was impossible to have even less content than previous magic games, yet here we are.Sealed campaign is a joke, the usual campaign is even shorter and somehow seems even more uninspired than usual and, like in previous games, you have to grind your heart out or pay for deck unlocks. I finished almost the whole campaign+revenge with a single deck and didn't even fully unlock it. In a world where free-to-play Hearthstone exists this kind of game is absolutely unacceptable. And don't get me wrong - Hearthstone doesn't even come close to Magic:TG - the card game, but compared to this video game incarnation it's an absolute winner in every category possible (well, except the card art, but that is again thanks to M:TG - the card game).I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, even on sale. If you want a video game introduction to M:TG - go buy one of the previous ones, but be aware that most of the issues described above will be waiting for you in those games too. "

												Still one of my favorite card games to date. I have been playing Magic for 5-6 years and this game is fun/challenging, if you enjoy play card games vs. AI this is a great title. I have probably a good 40 hours logged into this game (many offline hours) and for the price it is damn good. However, the micro-transaction system is pesky for playing multiplayer. It's worth $15 to me, but I think for most people an under $10 price tag would get them to buy it.			"

												I haven't played Magic since I was 10, and that was 21 years ago. I totally forgot how awesome and difficult this game was!I would easily recommend this game to anyone that enjoys card-based games. The tutorial is a MUST, and thankfully I very casually finished it within an hour and a half. But don't let that get you down, the tutorial is fun. It is really just playing the normal game with some simple instructions. It probably took me longer than most, just because I was enjoying reading all the cards again.Some people have had complaints, but I don't understand them. But that could be because I'm not really into playing multiplayer. I just like relaxing and playing the AI.			"

												I like this game, I really do.  Especially since I cannot find Magic players in my area.  ...however, this game?  It cheats.  If I destroy a card, the game decides it wants to activate the tapped ability prior to removing it from game.  That's not okay!  (Yes, I'm aware that tapping abilities on cards are available to activate as instants.  However, instants MUST be activated prior to my declaring an attack or target!  Exceptions being cards which nullify the original card I've played.)Ex 1:  I play a card which deals 5 damage to a creature which would kill it.  Opposing player plays card which nullifies the damage.  This is legit!  (I'll even let the game have the idea that the creature itself can activate it's ability and nullify the effect of my card.)Ex 2:  I play a card which destroys a permanent on the field.  Opposing player then taps the card to use the ability on the card prior to discarding it (tapping the card does NOT nullify the effect of my card, but instead we'll say gives the player 2 mana.).  ...that, unless the rules have changed drastically, is NOT okay!  What's the difference you may ask?  I'll give you a shield and I'll take a sword and swing at you.  You're not dead!  Now I'm taking the shield away and giving you the keys to my car but I'm still going to swing at you.  ...kinda hard to start the car when you're dead right?  Aside from this minor thing, which aside from aggrevation can be overcome, yes I would totally recommend this game!(Also...if I'm wrong about tapping abilities, please show me the text within the rule book which says that's okay.  I'll happily rescind everything in this post about the rules!)			"

												A simple way to learn MTG. The pre-built decks are designed around easily played themes and the variety between the decks are reason enough to try them all.For MTG vets this is not something you should play as it limits what you can build as the only ""Deck Building"" option is swapping out cards for the pre-built decks with cards you earn as you play them. The Sealed Play option is the closest you can get to building your own deck but the limited format falls flat especially since you end up against constructed decks.			"

												This is a very well-explained, well-designed, well-put together advertisement. They're not even trying to hide it. Before you can get to the actual cards and strategy and Mountain Dew, you are shown advertising for the physical Magic game they also want you to buy. The game which, itself, is an insidiously-designed machine, an engine that runs on nerd fighting and reprehensibly disposable income.I mean, I dig it. I find it fun. I like how it walks you through the mechanics, the traits, the strategy and even the appeal of Magic the Gathering. I like how it presents all this bare-numbers nerdy♥♥♥♥♥♥with a bare-bones doofy fantasy story. I like the online play, which I'm sure is going to be devouring most of my life very shortly. But: I dug Magic before that. I played it as a kid, and I'm pretty sure I like this particular, online, Steam game because of the lingering, salty taste of preteen tears.Magic, like Dungeons and Dragons, is such a niche hobby, and now such an old niche hobby, that it either appeals to you or it doesn't. If you brushed past a hobby shop, saw full, adult grown-ups arguing over why that one cardstock spell shouldn't have killed that one cardstock goblin, then this isn't going to be your thing. But if you already suspect that it might be your thing, or it was once but then you grew up and sold your cards and paid rent with the net, then, well, this is Magic.Don't worry. I'll be around to tap all your swamps with my fat blue deck. We're in this together. We were always doomed.			"

Pros: Excellent way to learn how to play magic         Fun         Varying levels of difficulty so that new players can learn and magic vets like myself can challenge themselves         Multiple play styles (Standard, Legacy, Sealed Deck, Two Headed Giant, And free for all)Cons: Does not teach you how to build real decks         No customizable decks (Except sealed play)         Out of date promos offeredI definately reccomend this to people wanting to learn how to play magic. However vets like myself should be wary. This game can challenge you but chances are your magic buddies will challenge you much further than the AI in this game ever could.			"

												Awesome game if you're a fan of Magic The Gathering, even if you're new to the game, the tutorial teaches you how to play and the basic game mechanics in a comprehensive and simple way. Gets really addicting once you start unlocking more cards and decks. Campaign is not the most difficult thing in the world but the challenges are something else. Definitely recommend.			"

The campaign is fun and challenging, the visuals are attractive, if not overly impressissive and all the cards can be obtained by playing the campaign.

												I've been playing Duels of the Planeswalkers since the first one was released a few years back and I'll have to say 2014 was the weakest in the franchise. It's only upside when compared to the very first Duels of the Planeswalkers is that you can modify your deck with all the cards you unlocked rather than only being able to replace unlocked cards with other unlocked cards.All Duels of the Planeswalkers games had an extra game mode, and 2014's seemed to be more of a cash grab from Hasbro/WotC than a legitimate game mode. The game mode introduces players (or reintroduces MTG veterans) to the sealed deck game mode, which is one of my more favorite methods of playing MTG. What 2014 did wrong though, in my opinion, is force players to buy (via real currency unlocks) new sealed deck opportunities. Sounds great from a business stand point, but was a big middle finger to long time Duels of the Planeswalkers fans.I'm posting this review now, after the game's been out for almost a year because it seems like Hasbro/WotC is trying to milk what they can from this game and adding new frills that do absolutely nothing to actual game play.Magic 2015 is right around the corner and from what I've heard it is allowing full deck customization, which is something new to the DotP series. I haven't heard what new game mode they're going with, but I hope it's not another shot at 2014's Sealed Deck mode.			"

												Magic is actually a..really interesting card game. I personally like it, and it's not hard to get the hang of once you learn how to play the basics. I do reccomend playing the tutorial if you're a newcomer to the game, but otherwise, you can skip the tutorial if necessary. As you play the ""planes"" (Which are like chapters in the story), you unlock new decks to play with. You may be wondering ""How do I unlock Jace's/Ajani's/Liliana's deck?"". To that, my friend, I have your solution. Click the little planeswalker button in the corner to duel the default five planeswalkers--Chandra, Garruk, Jace, Ajani, or Liliana. As you beat the planes, you can unlock one planeswalker to challenge. I reccomend leaving Jace for last, or until you learn how to play your deck really well.  Anyway, my review score-wise would have to be a solid 9/10, as Magic does have some of it's flaws, but most of them aren't big. And if you lose it's your fault, for screwing up. Not your opponent's fault.			"

I later went out and bought my own deck, and a few weeks later I now have all 5 Gatecrash decks and a 2014 Deck Builder's Kit (plus like 10 boosters). So yeah, this game got me hooked on Magic, and I have no regrets. "

												Great game for either learning magic, or for us oldies that gave up the arms race long ago but dont mind dropping 20 bux to remember how cool this game was. The small fixed cardpool and inability to mix and match cards from decks results in a small stable metagame that isn't totaly overwhelmed by any one deck. While there are some decks that become more dominant or have stronger cards, the addition of new decks through expansions and downlodable content keeps everything on its toes.			"

However if i want a challenging match to test my skills, i can easly play again a good oponent online, or play one of the many amazing levels and skilled AI.All and all this game is more than worth buying if you have any intrest in card games (Yu-gi-oh comes in mind for example), or want to test something new.Recommended			"

												The 2014 installment of Duels of the Planeswalkers is the best yet. There are the expected incremental improvements to the HUD, UI, and game mechanics, as well as a new game mode: sealed play. Sealed play introduces some ACTUAL deckbuilding to the game, and while it is limited, it is better than nothing. The pre-made deck selection is suitably varied and decently balanced, although playing online will inevitably pit you against the same two or three decks. MTG: Online will always be the go-to game for players looking for the true Magic experience , but this is a more casual, and much cheaper, alternative.			"

												First of all I would like to start by saying - This game was aimed at beginners; beginners that are perhaps considering playing the game for real at some point... with real cards. Quote from the game description: ""discover what makes Magic: The Gathering the world’s premier trading card game"" Does that sound like it's directed at experienced players? This game is nothing but a rather long tutorial, designed to promote the real, face to face game to people that are totally new to the game... to give new, or indeed slightly inexperienced, players the chance to learn and try different deck types, discover what different attributes do, discover how to use cards together in a tactical fashion, all in the comfort of a Single Player mode (with a multiplayer option when you start feeling confident).Keeping in mind what it's goal was, it actually accomplishes EXACTLY what it set out to do (help people like me get into a game I would have never had the nerve to try at noob level, face to face with strangers), and it does it in a very nice way in my opinion.If you are completely new to mtg, like I am, then I'd highly recommend that you buy this game.There is so much to learn and try to master with mtg that I really do think a single player game like this is absolutely necessary to give new players a thorough introduction and a basic, but still good, understanding of the game before they decide to head out and buy a kit or something.

												This was an average card game. The strategies present for players early on can be quite limited unless they have purchased the expansion to obtain more cards. The game itself is challenging and especially fun to play with other friends. At times the turns can be a little slow but that gives time for players to become more familiar with the different cards. This game style isn't for everyone but for those who enjoy these deck games i would say give it a try; the online version can save the player money on buying cards. Overall i would say 8/10			"

Good graphics (well, a card game doesn't really need graphics :P ), and they ease the player through learning gameplay and mechanics. Coming from the paper version, there were times where I felt the UI didn't completely work for me (in that weekend I didn't really learn how to manually choose mana to tap, which became an issue a few times...), but in all gameplay was smooth. Some of the harder challenges were quite interesting as well.For something like this I'd suggest always getting the newest version. M15 is coming soon!			"

												I've been playing Duels of the Planeswalkers since the first one was released a few years back and I'll have to say 2014 was the weakest in the franchise. It's only upside when compared to the very first Duels of the Planeswalkers is that you can modify your deck with all the cards you unlocked rather than only being able to replace unlocked cards with other unlocked cards.All Duels of the Planeswalkers games had an extra game mode, and 2014's seemed to be more of a cash grab from Hasbro/WotC than a legitimate game mode. The game mode introduces players (or reintroduces MTG veterans) to the sealed deck game mode, which is one of my more favorite methods of playing MTG. What 2014 did wrong though, in my opinion, is force players to buy (via real currency unlocks) new sealed deck opportunities. Sounds great from a business stand point, but was a big middle finger to long time Duels of the Planeswalkers fans.I'm posting this review now, after the game's been out for almost a year because it seems like Hasbro/WotC is trying to milk what they can from this game and adding new frills that do absolutely nothing to actual game play.Magic 2015 is right around the corner and from what I've heard it is allowing full deck customization, which is something new to the DotP series. I haven't heard what new game mode they're going with, but I hope it's not another shot at 2014's Sealed Deck mode.			"

												+ Great way to learn Magic (MTG), plays like the card game but also includes a storyline and cutscenes that are cool, always more to do or unlock.- Actually has slightly different rules from MTG and the game doesn't explain why certain moves happen in the order they do, the AI clearly know what cards you have, I don't mind not being able to make your own deck from scratch but they really should find a way to do it (especially if the real cards carried codes to unlock them in the video game), you can only duel people with the 2014 version wtf?!B			"

												Personally I found Magic 4014 to be an amzaing game. It has a varity of decks and an enjoyable system to play with.As you probably will see when looking at a few reviews it seems to be aimed more to new MTG players than grizzeled vets who have years of experiance, and this suited me fine. Not having a played a lot of magic this allows you to jump right in and explore how MTG works, It has a decent single player and a good multiplayer option.Though dont buy it for sealed play. You get given very little choice and its expensive to buy more deck slots with no ability to erase you old ones.On the whole if you are new to magic or like a cheap and gentle way to play and explore without investing lots of money in cards this is a good buy. However if you rather a larger choice of cards at a higher cost mabye give this a miss.			"

Beyond that the fact you have to unlock decks and cards makes it retain plenty of replay value on and beyond the whole ""playing with friends"" part :PMy only complaint is that the game's responsiveness isn't super high...not that it has to be but that I notice a small lag between clicks and what not.

												The first thing you should know about this game is that the AI cheats, and it cheats badly. However, if you love CCG's this is a steal. The gameplay is solid and it's a tiny investment for what would cost potentially hundreds in booster packs for a physical game. Magic is the CCG that started it all and it's definitely worth your time whether you used to play the game, or are a first time CCG player looking for some good casual strategy gameplay.			"

												Magic 2014, like all previous Duels of the Planeswalkers games, is an introduction to Magic: The Gathering. In that regard, it is spectacular, giving new players the tools needed to learn the game. It's not perfect, however, and veterans of MtG will be disappointed by the lack of deck customization and alternative play modes. It can also be a drag to unlock cards to use in the prepackaged decks. The Sealed play mode is also very weak, and generally inferior to previous Duels of the Planeswalkers' featured modes (such as Planechase in 2013). Still, if you're looking to learn Magic, there's no better way than with the Duels of the Plansewalkers series, and even those who know the game can still get at least $10 worth out of it.At the base of the game are the various decks you can use. Each one has a different theme and playstyle, with relatively little overlap between them. These decks are pre-built, though playing with them unlocks new cards that you can use. Decks are still perfectly capable without the unlocked cards. There are 30 cards to unlock for each deck, with 1 unlocked per with with that deck; if you want to unlock every card for every deck, abandon hope of that now. Between the base game, deck packs, and expansion, there are about 20 different decks to use, giving plenty of variety and allowing for many playstyles to be utilized.The only mode where you're allowed to build your own deck completely is the Sealed Play mode. This gives you booster packs to open and has you build a deck from the cards you find. Unfortunately, there are problems with this. Firstly, you'll likely get almost no synergy between your cards, leaving you with generic decks each time you play. Secondly, you have sealed play ""slots"" which, once you have a deck in them, cannot be used for another deck. The game comes with 2 slots, meaning you can only actually create your deck twice before you must buy new slots as DLC. It's a bad DLC method for a bad mode of play. Compared to the modes unique to previous Duels of the Planeswalkers games, it's weak at best.As far as other modes, there is a campaign and a series of challenges, as well as free play and online play. The campaign puts you against AI opponents of generally increasing difficulty in mostly standard duels. There are some variations, including the last duel of the campaign, but for the most part it's simply basic battles, the kind you can play in free play at any time. The main draw of playing the campaign is that access to the various decks is unlocked at certain stages in the campaign. Challenges are a series of scenarios in which you are handed the game in a certain state and asked to win the duel before your turn is over. They're interesting, though once you do one once there's no more to gain from it. Most of them will be relatively easy for an experienced player, though the last challenge in the expansion will likely cause headaches for many of them as well. Free play duel types are basic 2-4 player free-for-alls and Two-Headed Giant, which is a 2v2 mode. I don't have much experience playing online, but it worked flawlessly when I played. In terms of DLC, only the expansion and deck packs are really worth buying. Foil conversions give you access to shiny versions of decks, deck keys unlock the 30 cards in a deck that you unlock by playing, Sealed Slots I went over above. The deck packs add more decks (obviously!) and the expansion adds new decks, campaign missions, and challenges; if you're looking for more Magic to whet your appetite after going through the base game, those are your options.Overall, it's a good game, especially for the price it's at. It's also worth checking out previous Duels of the Planeswalkers games to see if the decks or modes of play are more interesting to you.			"

												It's kind of tough to review an every year iteration of a game like this because all you really have to compare it to is itself. I definitely can appreciate the actual in-game game play improvements and a couple of the decks are pretty awesome with some cool improvements and real synergy (Jace's deck immediately comes to mind). On the downside, the initial game startup is a little less streamlined and takes longer to load, if you're playing with an older computer the graphics setting will randomly reset when you start up, and the decks can feel really long to unlock sometimes. I won't even mention the ""Sealed"" play because it really varies from person to person.In the end, new or old player, if you enjoy Magic and want to get a little bit more in your week, this is a great way to do it for cheap.

												Think of this as a training for the ""real"" card game. Then it starts do make fun it will bother you with frustrating limitations and advertisements until you wish to have the real cards to play with. The new deck buidling is a bad joke, an attempt to get your money in exchange for some rare cards, that you can only use in a  seperate mini campain. The campain itself is much weaker than Magic 2012/13. The AI on the other hand is ok and offers3 difficulty levels.Get me right its still a lot of fun, but I have the strong feeling somebody did not wanted that this game becomes a competition to the real card game: - The limitations of the card pools ( its not possible to change the deck significant )- Limited campain options ( you can not even restart it, for a new deck)- Build your own deck fake- and why can you not add the decks of Magic 2012/13 to the 2014 edition - I payed for them and I want to have them in   one game.In the moment you get during the winter sales this game for an decent price ( at least the main part of it) so for fans of this game its the best you can get until there is finally a good Magic game without pressure from the Wizards of the Cost ( or however prevents it).

												Magic 2014 has improved over it's predecessor.It provides more packs than the 2013 game (after finishing the campaign) but in order to obtain all the packs you need to pour quite an amount of money for dlc.The multiplayer is fun;I enjoyed Two-headed giant the most because of the synergy and combos you can pull of with your teammate.Bottom line while it's better than the last one it still limits you by much if you're not willing to pay for Dlc.

												Disclaimer: I don't own any of the DLCsThis was my first official exposure to the trading card game (other than a few casual duels with friends using borrowed decks).  After playing through the main and sealed deck campaigns, I've developed a much better understanding of MtG and had a lot of fun with the variety of decks I unlocked.  There are many things I like about M2014, but a few aspects that I disagree with.The interface is very intuitive and easy to use.  As a beginner, I found the ""More Info"" button to be very useful in explaining various game mechanics like Devour, Undying and First Strike.  Soundtrack is excellent and gets you pumped for the duel.  The main campaign was fun, but I didn't like how the ""encounters"" (non-boss duels) were scripted so that the AI basically plays the same cards each time you duel against it (ahem, Sewers.  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sewers).  It was exciting to unlock a new deck at the end of each chapter, and though the plot was pretty basic it added a nice bit of flavour to each duel.  However, the final battle was disappointing to say the least.Sealed mode (where you get a bunch of random cards from boosters and build a deck from them) was fun in theory but M2014 put on a bunch of unnecessary restrictions.  The sealed campaign is short and allows you to unlock some more additional boosters, but other than that you're stuck with the cards you have.  You can only make up to two decks in sealed - any more and you'll have to buy additional slots.  Because of the limited number of cards you get for each deck (and the fact that you can't exchange cards between decks), I found myself stuck playing decks of the colours for which I had the best cards.  I wish they'd had a mode where you could just build a deck from any of the cards that you collected (including the unlockable decks), without any restrictions.Multiplayer with friends, of course, is always nice.  I've also had matchmade games with strangers, and those turned out alright too.  Two-headed giant (2v2) mode was super hectic fun.  In order to be somewhat more unique, you can customize your player avatar and title, and those are unlocked by doing certain deeds in the game (like achievements, but the objectives are different). Challenges are either easy or tricky puzzles, and the tricky ones helped me understand the mechanics of Magic a little better. Verdict: This is a decent Magic game, and you'll definitely get more out of it if you're a beginner.  The replay value wasn't as great as I expected, and experienced players can probably skip this one unless it's on sale. Either way, you may want to wait for a sale to pick this up.  I'm looking forward to seeing how M2015 will turn out.			"

												Magic 2014 is a challenging experience, friendly to both new players and old pro's. There is an extensive story mode with plenty of ready-made decks, all able to be customized to suit your play style. There is also online play modes, a sealed mode that mimics the concept of buying card packs and building a deck with the cards available, only you can earn card packs through playing the mode. However, There are only two free slots for the sealed mode, and you are unable to delete decks AT ALL. Your only option to get a fully custom deck you want is too purchase the third slot, or new card packs. Also, the story mode decks, while able to be customise, don't have nearly deep enough customization.There are DLC out for the game that provide new decks, new duels, and new challenges for the player, however, not all of them are very well labled. I personally purchased three full decks for the game, and cannot use them because of the prerequired DLC that puts the data the deck feeds off of into the gameFor a casual play experience, it is a definitely good game, but no substitue for a live game when one is available. It IS undeniably flawed, but it holds up as a fun experience.			"

												This game is awesome.  The price is very fair for what you get -->  You get to learn how to play the most loved trading card game in the world and you don't have to spend tons of money, or research how to build decks.  There are MANY fun decks in this game.  Some bomb dropping decks, some toast them quick decks, some Zerg-like decks and even some to derail the enemy's plans.  A review I read said something about the music...     The music?...  Now for the cons:  My mouse arm is killing me and I haven't gotten to bed before 2 AM for 2 weeks straight so my real life is suffering a little.  I only wanted to try it and I'm afraid I might be addicted.  I had seen a nerd on youtube that said M15 is good, but to learn the game go back to M14.  And he was right.  I can see that when I return to M15 I will have the card knowlede to build a decent deck of my own.  I just beat the game a few minutes ago and am still pretty pumped.  The game is easy to learn, that's for sure.  But it's easy to underestimate how deep it is.  If you made it this far into my review you obviously are interested and if you have a mind for strategy then pony up the money for a game you can impress other nerds with.  Like the nerds at Mensa who gave the Magic TCG  the ""Mensa Select"" award at the Mensa Mind Game competition in 1994.  I started not even being able recognize a single card.  But now,  not only can I recognize several cards by site, but also know what they do. Still working on when to play them.   EPIC GAME.			"

												About the best way to learn Magic the Gathering if you have never played it before, or even any CCG.  The campaign is fun to play through and teaches you the basics of the game, enough to understand what is going on if you are watching others play it.  The actual physical card game and even the Magic the Gathering online game can get very expensive, so for a try out and taste of the game I would recommend this at a comparatively cheap price.  The competetive element and deck building isn't so good  so bear that in mind if you already play Magic.			"

												Magic 2014 - Duels of the Planeswalkers: Where are these planeswalkers?  Definitely not in your deck.  This game is a slap in the face to get it when it was on sale at 75% off for the 6/8/14 weekend only to see an ad in the game tell me that Magic 2015 will be released a month later.  Why don't the developers keep the low price permanent rather than taunt me?There are some good parts I admit.  The acting, pre-made decks (can't construct from scratch though there is sealed which you can't reset) and puzzles are fun.  However, the pre-made decks take too long to be unlocked, pressuring you to buy them.  You also can't play by set rotation neither, though there is two-headed giant.I appreciate the difficulty though it feels like rock-paper-scissors with how some decks do better than others based on your opponent, which is why you need to buy the other decks as well (and use promos to unlock cards so you can bring out their full potential).  At $9, it's decent on sale, but at $35 for the gold collection is a bit pricey.Update: I prefer this game to Magic 2015 (I played the demo), so I have to recommend Magic 2014.  I couldn't even get past the tutorial with the lack of a mulligan (which is allowed in 2014) and kept getting mana flooded/screwed, which is inexcusable.  I also hate the overuse of the black/white colors in the interface, which is just lazy.  Magic 2014 looks better though as an older game, should be cheaper than 2015.  I read online that magic 2015 has less modes too, so even more of a reason to play 2014 instead.			"

												As someone who dabbled with Magic: The Gathering when it was first starting out as a card game and then never picked it up again, this game is a great way to re-familiarize myself with the game and the mechanics without being totally lost. The game asks what your familiarity with the game is before you begin, so I don't believe everyone has to go through the hand-holding I requested, too. There are multiple modes in the game, and you can customize the deck you're playing with, but you have to win battles to earn more cards. The auto-deck builder can be helpful, or not. You have to play close attention to the balance it chooses for your deck, but it helps you understand what makes a more powerful deck. Like in real life, each deck requires tweaking. I like that about the game.All in all, I recommend it for some casual fun with the game without committing to buying cards for decks.			"

												Highly recommended if you're new or only moderately familiar with MtG. It'll help you get into the game, understand a lot of the mechanics that are easy to miss when playing in person, and not have to worry about making your own decks for a while. If you're into MtG and want to enjoy having a lot of cheap cards at your disposal, give the game a whirl! You can still make decks from sealed packs, and customize the pre-built decks as you unlock various non-basic lands simply by winning with the deck.Players of MtGO -- the serious hobbyists -- will likely want to give this game a pass unless they want to play the game with friends who aren't as into Magic (and spending money on it) as you are.The game looks nice, has a decent soundtrack (that you can easily turn off in the settings), has excellent AI (a MAJOR plus), and I've found all the DLC to be of great value.

												A very good introductory game to Magic.  Cheap and easy to pick up, and can be a lot of fun.  On the negative, there isn't a whole lot of customisation, and it automatically puts cards into peoples decks, so you see newer players with 100 card decks, which is not very good for consistency.  The multiplayer is fun, but the chat interface is horrendous.  Sealed was a great addition from the previous games and should continue to be in future iterations of the game.  Overall, great fun, has problems, but not super impeding ones!			"

												Magic The Gathering: Duels of the Planeswalkers 2014 is one of the best DoTPs in my opinion.  The decks provided for you in this edition are fantastic.  Once all the cards are unlocked you have the ability to use some serious Mythic madness.  The background color is nice and easy on the eyes, which is actually pretty important to me because I have sensitive eyes.  The GUI is the most cleaned up out of all of them and menus are easy to navigate through.If you are looking for which of the DoTP series to get, I would highly suggest you try this one first.  For the love of all humanity please do not try DoTP 2015 first.  If you do try DoTP 2015 before any of the others, you will most likely end up in the psych ward.			"

												I have purchased this on XBL and now steam, since I have enjoyed it that much. Solid UI. Competent AI. My only complaint for single player campaign, is that once you unlock the harder ""Revenge"" Campaign the computer always seems to draw EXACTLY what it needs early in the match, so if you fall behind even for 1 turn without pulling something useful, odds are you will lose. At that point, in a game in which you are supposed to be pulling randomly from a shuffled 60 card deck, it no longer feels like you are playing a skill game, but more of a game of luck with you having the disadvantage of being the only one with an uncertain deck order. Sadly that means there is not a lot of depth or huge swings of momentum in the campaign. Most duels play out very similiar, meaning I know by what round I need to have certain cards in play. So instead of taking the initial starting hand you are dealt which may only favorable in a longer game, you are now handicapped because the AI will be starting with a quick strike hand, thus you are nearly forced to redeal until you are able to get a favorable draw. While this does make the game more difficult, I feel it does so unfairly. It's like playing 20 different characters in the campaign, but they ALL want to do a Zerg Rush.Haven't been able to find any multiplayer games to join. Dead online community?I still enjoy it. I still recommend it.			"

												*edit* of all the magic ones, this is the best. Far superior to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ money grab that was Magic 2015This game can be described in one word - Mediocre.Awkward un-intuitive controls and an unpolished finish ruin what has the potential to be an awesome version of the classic card game. The controls caused me to accidentally skip attacks, skip turns, not be able to target who I wanted with spells, among many other errors. When you chat during a duel the timer keeps going but the chat window blocks up right where your cards are, so you can't continue to play but must instead chat, without being able to see your timer, and then whoops your turn's gone. I ran into people in multiplayer using this mal-formed feature offensively to eat up my valuable turn time. Some of the cards special rules are explained when you zoom in on the card, but others, like regenerate and its exact mechanic, are not.The game would have benefited with much more thorough play testing, and a focus on making the controls slightly more userfriendly. All in all, I'm pretty underwhelmed, which is too bad, because I was so excited to pick this up before I played it.PS -  I don't know what design genius decided that the continue button should alternate with the button that skips attacks, but I have had SO MANY frustrating moments due to accidentally clicking on skip attacks. It's ridiculous, and there's no double check, which is so unlike a real table top game of magic. It's the sort of error that builds frustration, and is at fault in the game design. Terrible.			"

												Over the years I've watched the digital versions of this series evolve and finally settle into this formulaic approach. This isn't a bad thing. Keeping the series relatively unchanged from the initial release and suffixing the current year lets you know exactly what game you're getting. If you enjoy playing the cards it can expand your awareness of rules and cards with included decks and cards but it has other things for players of all skill and familiarity levels just like the previous versions...with a new take of course. The traditional difficulty setting can be switched to suit the player and the included challenges are fantastic brain teasers for anyone. If you enjoy playing the card game this will probably invariably find it's way into an experience you'll enjoy. It's not as open ended as ""Magic: The Gathering Online"" however this is a great starting point for beginners or cheap offline alternative to hours of enjoyment.			"

												One word of warning if you're considering buying this for the Sealed Deck mode - don't.To get the negative stuff out of the way first, the sealed deck mode is a cheeky attempt by the developers to eat your wallet - you only get two deck slots in which to build decks and take them through a campaign, and while building decks and unlocking boosters is INCREDIBLY fun, if you get an awful deck to start with, you're pretty much never going to win.And you can't delete decks, so you're stuck or you have to buy a new deck slot. It's a paltry sum of £1.59, but you should at least be able to delete the decks you've already made, rather than being strong-armed into spending more money.Sealed Mode's cons aside, this is a great game. It helped to ease me into Magic as a hobby, and allows me to play the game in spite of having no human opponents to play against. The AI is admittedly unrealisticly lucky, but that often adds to the challenge. Add to that the replay value of unlocking more cards, the expansion and deck DLCs (I haven't bought any new decks yet, but the expansion is absolutely worth it - it's a shorter campaign, to be sure, but a very fun one!) and you have a great experience with a LOT of replay value.Pity about Sealed mode, though.

												It's Magic so yeah. Don't expect too much though. The sealed decks give you 2 free slots and you buy the rest, it opens boosters and thats  your deck. The campaign decks are unlockable or purchasable that's up to you. If you want a fun quick game of MTG either online or solo it's worth it.Lots of people on here complaining about the cards etc but REMEMBER MTG offer an online proper MTG game for $10 that you then buy boosters etc and THAT'S the REAL online magic game. This and other future releaseses i doubt will be improved since it will canabilise MTG Online....			"

												Magic 2014 is a card game based on the real card game with the same name. While not being a much greater innovation compared to the previous year, it's still add a little something to spice up the gameplay. One of the new and very fun game mode, ''sealed deck'', let you open six boosters and make your own deck from scratch with it. You can acquire additionnal boosters to improve your sealed deck, but unfortunatly, this mode has you only fight 5 differents planewalkers and does not encourage to replay since you can't obtain any other boosters afterward. Also, you can't play with your own sealed deck in any other mode, wich is a shame since it's the closest thing to deck building you can have. The other mode let you play with preset decks with a specific strategy that you can unlock in doing the campaing. Overall, the game does not live up to expectation and the short sealed deck mode just makes you hungry for more match against other planewalkers to continue build up your deck. But it is at least a decent game for beginners and those who can't get enough of Magic.			"

												Although Sealed Mode is a major disappointment, the storyline is pointless, the challenges are too easy and the multiplayer modes are lacking, this is still a good value for fans of the series. The bottom line is you get a lot of fun out of playing with the 10 decks for $10. For my full review, follow the link below. http://gamerhorizon.com/magic-2014-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-review/ "

												It's a good game. Really! But... that's because Magic is a good game.Duels of the Planeswalkers, unfortunately, doesn't bring anything substantial to the table that you can't get from paper Magic. Sealed is a great new addition, but with a limit to the number of sealed games you can play, it's not that much of a plus. Get this game if you have a friend that you want to introduce Magic to, but don't have the time (or ability), or if you must round out your collection of Magic-related content.Otherwise, don't bother. There are better games to spend your money on.			"

												Really nicely done, folks. I'm enjoying eachgame mode and the sealed play option is pretty neat, though I haven't jumped in to that fully yet. I could purchase the full decks but am choosing to unlock cards for my favorites with more play, which is a nice incentive.This is definitely not a beginner's game though - they throw complicated mechanics in fairly quickly - but I'm not a beginner and I love this game. I'm strongly considering buying the expansion pack to access more decks, campaign, and challenges.Challenges are gimmicky but they are a nice game mode to tinker with when you're needing a change of pace.For the MTG fan I highly recommend this game.UPDATE: I have to agree with the frustrating lack of solid deck-building options; however, I don't have anyone to play with locally and also sold most of my cards, so it's nice to get to play and wasn't a great deal of money to buy. I'm very glad I own it but make no mistake about the differences between buying real cards, building unique decks, encountering more random opponent draws, and...this (a video game).			"

												I'm fairly new at MTG and mostly play in real life as opposed to the videogame versions of it. I will say that this game is an improvement to the previous Magic 2013. The animations and cutscenes are great. The number of cards playable in game increased. The fact that you can create your own deck from cards that you obtain by buying packs makes it that much more realistic rather than being stuck to a two or mono color deck that was already preconstructed. I haven't played much of the online multiplayer part of it yet so I can't say much for it there. Overall, pretty good game for begginners wanting to get into MTG.			"

												An incremental upgrade to the previous editions, it remains fun and the additional deck customization is nice to have. Unfortunately, with each victory unlocking a single card out of the 40 additional ones available in each deck, unlocking everything would require a near endless grind. It's hard then not to see the ability to pay extra to unlock decks as anything more than a quick way to make a buck. Verdict: Buy it on sale, forget about unlocking everything and have fun.			"

												It took me a while (more than 200 hours however) to understand that this is a ""disposable"" game. This is a very good game, but I finally suspect (and have a clear evidence) that the game begins to cheat when you finally unlock all the decks. I explain: The AI begins to grant itself a clear advantage in drawing the cards in a determined order (low first, then medium and finally powerful casts). This is the opposite spirit of this game ! I'm not talking about the campaign when this method is a fact, but in the Free-for-all and Two-headed-troll mode. Result : the game becomes unplayable in solo modes, suggesting you to move to another opus of the series. NO WAY, Wizards of the Coast. You cheated on me once, I won't let you another opportunity.So, the game is excellent and is very good to learn playing and improving. But it's a time-limited game, and I can't approve that.			"

												I've never been fond of playing games against an omniscient opponent, but that's just me. While the tutorial/s seem to explain many of the game mechanics in a very straight-forward manner, any attempt to delve beyond the simplest of opponents will show you just how worthless many of the tutorials really are, especially when your deck/s cannot hope to compete against any but simplest of opponents. Maybe I'll enjoy (read: have a chance in Hell of completing) campaign mode after a couple of years of playing the actual game. Shame I can't get my money back...			"

												Magic 2014, like all previous Duels of the Planeswalkers games, is an introduction to Magic: The Gathering. In that regard, it is spectacular, giving new players the tools needed to learn the game. It's not perfect, however, and veterans of MtG will be disappointed by the lack of deck customization and alternative play modes. It can also be a drag to unlock cards to use in the prepackaged decks. The Sealed play mode is also very weak, and generally inferior to previous Duels of the Planeswalkers' featured modes (such as Planechase in 2013). Still, if you're looking to learn Magic, there's no better way than with the Duels of the Plansewalkers series, and even those who know the game can still get at least $10 worth out of it.At the base of the game are the various decks you can use. Each one has a different theme and playstyle, with relatively little overlap between them. These decks are pre-built, though playing with them unlocks new cards that you can use. Decks are still perfectly capable without the unlocked cards. There are 30 cards to unlock for each deck, with 1 unlocked per with with that deck; if you want to unlock every card for every deck, abandon hope of that now. Between the base game, deck packs, and expansion, there are about 20 different decks to use, giving plenty of variety and allowing for many playstyles to be utilized.The only mode where you're allowed to build your own deck completely is the Sealed Play mode. This gives you booster packs to open and has you build a deck from the cards you find. Unfortunately, there are problems with this. Firstly, you'll likely get almost no synergy between your cards, leaving you with generic decks each time you play. Secondly, you have sealed play ""slots"" which, once you have a deck in them, cannot be used for another deck. The game comes with 2 slots, meaning you can only actually create your deck twice before you must buy new slots as DLC. It's a bad DLC method for a bad mode of play. Compared to the modes unique to previous Duels of the Planeswalkers games, it's weak at best.As far as other modes, there is a campaign and a series of challenges, as well as free play and online play. The campaign puts you against AI opponents of generally increasing difficulty in mostly standard duels. There are some variations, including the last duel of the campaign, but for the most part it's simply basic battles, the kind you can play in free play at any time. The main draw of playing the campaign is that access to the various decks is unlocked at certain stages in the campaign. Challenges are a series of scenarios in which you are handed the game in a certain state and asked to win the duel before your turn is over. They're interesting, though once you do one once there's no more to gain from it. Most of them will be relatively easy for an experienced player, though the last challenge in the expansion will likely cause headaches for many of them as well. Free play duel types are basic 2-4 player free-for-alls and Two-Headed Giant, which is a 2v2 mode. I don't have much experience playing online, but it worked flawlessly when I played. In terms of DLC, only the expansion and deck packs are really worth buying. Foil conversions give you access to shiny versions of decks, deck keys unlock the 30 cards in a deck that you unlock by playing, Sealed Slots I went over above. The deck packs add more decks (obviously!) and the expansion adds new decks, campaign missions, and challenges; if you're looking for more Magic to whet your appetite after going through the base game, those are your options.Overall, it's a good game, especially for the price it's at. It's also worth checking out previous Duels of the Planeswalkers games to see if the decks or modes of play are more interesting to you.			"

												It's kind of tough to review an every year iteration of a game like this because all you really have to compare it to is itself. I definitely can appreciate the actual in-game game play improvements and a couple of the decks are pretty awesome with some cool improvements and real synergy (Jace's deck immediately comes to mind). On the downside, the initial game startup is a little less streamlined and takes longer to load, if you're playing with an older computer the graphics setting will randomly reset when you start up, and the decks can feel really long to unlock sometimes. I won't even mention the ""Sealed"" play because it really varies from person to person.In the end, new or old player, if you enjoy Magic and want to get a little bit more in your week, this is a great way to do it for cheap.

												Think of this as a training for the ""real"" card game. Then it starts do make fun it will bother you with frustrating limitations and advertisements until you wish to have the real cards to play with. The new deck buidling is a bad joke, an attempt to get your money in exchange for some rare cards, that you can only use in a  seperate mini campain. The campain itself is much weaker than Magic 2012/13. The AI on the other hand is ok and offers3 difficulty levels.Get me right its still a lot of fun, but I have the strong feeling somebody did not wanted that this game becomes a competition to the real card game: - The limitations of the card pools ( its not possible to change the deck significant )- Limited campain options ( you can not even restart it, for a new deck)- Build your own deck fake- and why can you not add the decks of Magic 2012/13 to the 2014 edition - I payed for them and I want to have them in   one game.In the moment you get during the winter sales this game for an decent price ( at least the main part of it) so for fans of this game its the best you can get until there is finally a good Magic game without pressure from the Wizards of the Cost ( or however prevents it).

												Digital Card Games are extremely hard for me to talk in depth about. In regards to M2014 it is even harder. A game that revels in its limited capacity of cards as it bases itself primarily on the core set of the designated year. I enjoyed it nevertheless. Great art, great voice acting, great online community; and a story line that provides me with a warm sense of adventure.			"

												Good decks for the most part. However, major complaint about the single player campaign. It's so heavily stacked against you. The AI will always get the best cards in their deck early on guaranteed, and be able to use them at the perfect time. It's predictable, but frustrating because the core of every encounter is essentially down to you being able to draw your core cards before they do.I'd like to actually have a fair chance in the singleplayer instead of losing for ridiculous stacking.

												While 2014 is undoubtedly as fun as any Magic product, it really doesn't play nearly as well as Duels 2013. The Sealed Play mechanic is underwhelming in that it costs you money to play it each time -- a ridiculous concept for a single player game! Two-Headed Giant is alright, but the majority of the game just feels limited and less smooth than Duels 2013. Whether you're a longtime fan of the game or just starting off, go get the previous edition of the game and have more fun there.			"

												It's a fun game, and made some improvements over the previous installment. You now have a bit more control over your deck. Sealed Play is hit or miss. The cards in your card pool are the same permanently even if you uninstall and reinstall the game due to it being generated based on your profile or something. You get 2 free Sealed Play slots with their own card pools, if you don't like the cards you get, you'll have to buy more slots if you want to play with different ones.I'd say it's worth it if you're looking for a few hours of fun and don't care too much about Sealed Play.

												This was my first Magic game. I've known about the card game but never got into it. What sold me for this game was the great tutorial. I started as a complete newb and got so much better! The story's pretty much a great big ""What is this I don't even"" but the gameplay's great. I would recommend unlocking as many decks as you can to find the one that works for you. There's plenty of variety! There's DLC in the form of additional decks but those are very much optional and not needed unless you want to add more gameplay. I enjoy coming back to this game and unlocking more decks so it's got a great replayability factor.			"

												This is a very well-explained, well-designed, well-put together advertisement. They're not even trying to hide it. Before you can get to the actual cards and strategy and Mountain Dew, you are shown advertising for the physical Magic game they also want you to buy. The game which, itself, is an insidiously-designed machine, an engine that runs on nerd fighting and reprehensibly disposable income.I mean, I dig it. I find it fun. I like how it walks you through the mechanics, the traits, the strategy and even the appeal of Magic the Gathering. I like how it presents all this bare-numbers nerdy♥♥♥♥♥♥with a bare-bones doofy fantasy story. I like the online play, which I'm sure is going to be devouring most of my life very shortly. But: I dug Magic before that. I played it as a kid, and I'm pretty sure I like this particular, online, Steam game because of the lingering, salty taste of preteen tears.Magic, like Dungeons and Dragons, is such a niche hobby, and now such an old niche hobby, that it either appeals to you or it doesn't. If you brushed past a hobby shop, saw full, adult grown-ups arguing over why that one cardstock spell shouldn't have killed that one cardstock goblin, then this isn't going to be your thing. But if you already suspect that it might be your thing, or it was once but then you grew up and sold your cards and paid rent with the net, then, well, this is Magic.Don't worry. I'll be around to tap all your swamps with my fat blue deck. We're in this together. We were always doomed.			"

												I collected Magic cards some 15 years ago, but never really got a hold on the rules. I just thought they were cool. But I took the chance and tried purchasing magic 2014, and boy have I missed out all these years. I have completed the campaign, the puzzle challenges and a sealed play campaign, so this is what I now build my small review on.The campaign is not very long, and I must admit that I did not care for the story at all. But it is fun, and the decks you play against, and the decks you unlock, play different and are really fun! It does appear that some decks are slightly OP compared to others, but I have not played online yet, so that is not really a problem thus far. The puzzles are either really easy, or rather difficult, but even for a newcomer like me, they were all managable. But they are fun and a welcoming break to the regular gameplay. It would be fun if they expanded on this.As far as I have understood, the ""Sealed Deck"" gameplay, is what it's all about now. It is really fun to be able to put your own deck together, and I reckon it is a part of the game that really feel like the offline play. But I feel kinda limited, and would like to be able to create more decks, before I hit a paywall.When I write this, I am 17,8 hours into the game, and I have not even unlocked one complete deck yet, and I have not touched online multiplayer either. I am not sure I am dipping into online, but I foresee many hours playing offline in the near future. I even consider purchasing the 2013 edition, to get another campaign.Totally recommended.			"

												For those who want to know about the Magic: The Gathering game, I recommend Magic 2014 for beginners. I will also recommend this game to those old Magic players who have lost touch of the game and its many new mechanics. Playing Magic 2014 will keep them updated on what's new in no time! Magic 2014 is fun but the real fun begins when you start playing the actual game against players in person using a deck you painstakingly completed. What Magic 2014 lacks is the freedom to create your own deck, the choice to mix different colors and lands and so on. The game is also missing hundreds of cards that were not included. So yes, that is the reason why I am recommending Magic 2014 for new aspiring players and old players who don't even know who Jace Beleren is.			"

												Good game as isFANTASTIC once modded.The amount of content you get in the game for $10 seems reasonable. The campaigns and modes can be completed within a few hours but unfortunately there are a lot of things behind paywalls. Which puts a damper on Sealed mode specifically.However, a neat secret people who play this game may not know is that you can infact MOD this game and a simple google search is all it takes.And fortunately through the power of modding, this game can give you hours upon hours of fun. Breaking free from the limited replay value wall that would eventually happen ten or so hours in.I'm talking being able to make fully custom constructed decks for any mode (except Sealed) using any card in the game. And as many as you want too.Even better is the ability to create any type of Magic card from scratch. Whether it's an existing card that's not in the game, or one you create from your mind. There is quite a learning curve to creating them, but there are hundreds of cards others have made already and have done the hard work for you. Even entire sets!Modded decks/cards even work online. Though ONLY if you and the other player have the same exact files. So really only useful for playing with friends and not randoms.			"

												While it does have its fun moments, Magic 2014 - Duels of the Planeswalkers is far from the best card game out on the market. Unable to provide access to the whole collection of cards available in the game, something that many Yu-gi-oh! and Cardfight Vanguard games strive for, really harms the experience. And while they do provide a ""campaign"" mode of sorts, the loose justification for battles is barely enough to keep the game interesting while losing yet again to an enemy that somehow has counters to everything in the premade deck. Other TCG video games tend to provide a larger selection of customization options that really give the player a chance to work out strategies to surpass a tough opponent. On the positive side, the alternate modes do provide some fun challenges and reasons to keep playing. However, there's not enough there to make them last for an extensive amount of time. A disappointing fact as they would improve the game immensely. The fact that not all of the rules are presented accurately, with many being wildly different than how they work in the actual TCG, cause the game to be a struggle to recommend for beginners or experienced players. Avoid this game, the MTG Online available directly through Wizards of the Coast is a better option to get a digital MTG fix.			"

												Magic. the Gathering aka. MTG is awesome cardgame. I originally started to play it with papercards and been playing now about 1,5 years. First standard (3 latest released sets) but changed to EDH (Elder Dragon Highlander) for much more casual gameformat. But on the DOTP version...Magic 2014: DOTP is awesome game for practising the basics of magic. The decks arent any superoverpowered, but enough good to give you some good tips and tricks how to every color could be built. Also its CHEAP way to get into magic. Depending on how you want to play (competitively or just kitchen table) the deck can cost quite a lot If really wanted to work on, even >100€. DOTP gives you already good working cards and for one single price. It also lets you try some drafting and teamplaying (2 headed giant). All in all, if you want to learn MTG, start from this. It also gives you some good way what colors are your favorite.			"

												Magic 2014 is quite obviously designed as a way for Wizards of the Coast to get more people into the physical card game (where they can spend piles of money on real cards). That being said, Magic 2014 offers great gameplay value and is generally very well designed and coded. The look and feel is very polished. The gameplay is easy to pick up (if you haven't played before), and there is a decent variety of cards and decks to play, with several game modes. For players familiar with the physical card game, the chief drawback is that you can not have a general collection out of which you make any deck you like; you must use the specific decks provided. However, those decks have 40 additional cards you can unlock (including the 10 promotional cards; search the web for the promo codes), giving quite a bit of flexibility.For players looking to scratch their ""M:tG Itch"", or get familiar with Magic: the Gathering for the first time, without spending piles of money, this game does the job.

												Worth playing for Magic fans and very good value for magic newcomers.This game is a good introduction to the games rules, and fun campaign for a short time.Sealed deck is, however, vastly over-hyped and quite flawed.In many ways, worth it for the bonus steam pack you can claim in magic stores alone. Scavenging Ooze is a very nice card worth most of the price of the steam game. "

												Solid buy,but only downside for me was Sealed Play decks.I love the idea but they could have made it more usable in all aspects of the game.Also they should have allowed booster packs to be sold rather than deck slots for Sealed Play.I would recommend this to ANY Magic the Gathering fan.And also to anyone who is intersted in online card games.

												one of the best things about this game is how smooth the textures are. i do like the idea of differnt game difficulty starting at mage and archmage. The decks are well made very balanced and very strong if used right. I do like that they made a single player mode with the main boss after going against 3 or 4 before it and u get rewarded with the deck u just went against. the cinamatics are beautiful and the voice acting is very good. the story line is well thought out. the multiplayer is pretty good as well no problems there u can invite friends to duel against or just join someone elses game. You can even play sealed play mode where u open packs and make a deck. Where u can either do the sealed singleplayer to earn more packs or play your deck against other players made decks. card unlocks from winning duels give sthe game more playablility. alot of the duels are really hard. Some i lost so many times to some of them it was crazy. but i still say this game is worth the buy.			"

												A brilliantly complex strategy trading card game ..The first and the most played.  The game is much cheaper than the money sink that is the real physical cards and you can unlock everything ingame without buying its DLC.  I highly recommend if you like a challenging campaign, genuine sense of intelligent gameplay and multiplayer to battle your friends.			"

Experienced Magic players will enjoy the speed and fluidity of matches in DotP14, and those new to the game of Magic will learn it in no time.  Fair warning, though...whether you play online, in person, or both, MtG is right up there with World of Warcraft in terms of its potential to get you hooked and monopolize all of your free time.			"

												There are a lot of things this game does right.  If you're new to Magic (or haven't played it years, like myself) this game does a good job of teaching the mechanics of the game in its current incarnation.  There's a lot of variety and replayability in the base game, between campaign mode, challenges and the number of decks available to play.  The Sealed Deck play is also very nice, allowing you to build a deck from a random distribution of cards.The downsides to me are a lack of support.  If you happen to encounter the bug where you are unable to enter promo pack codes (as I did) then you can expect to spend a lot of time hunting through forums hoping for a solution to the problem.  It should be fixed as a patch, but the official solution is to muck about with local game files and hope for the best.  Another bug is present in the leaderboard.  It's full of impossible scores, which kind of defeats the purpose of having a leaderboard.  There isn't much point in having one if players can't honestly determine where they stand.  Overall, the good greatly outweighs the bad.  Highly recommend.			"

												Very good if you are already a fan of Magic. This contains cards from a number of sets, but is fairly limited. The only time you can make your own deck is in the sealed format. The preconstructed decks each require 30 wins to unlock all the cards, giving the game a lot of replay value.			"

												It's Magic! The Card game on the computer. I have two different opinions all based on one question. Do you play magic offline?If the answer is no,I would recommend this game. It's a fun little game that you is structured very well to help you learn all the neat little rules. I have actually learned some ways to win matches from this very game.  You can pick up and put it down whenever you want and it's a nice way to play the magic game without really paying the cost of making a good deck (Or other people who play it).If the answer is yes,I would stay away. Odds are you know most of the rules. You can learn a little bit but not much. The decks are very poorly built even with all the cards unlocked and the starter decks feel inefficent and stupid. You'll find better and more enjoyable games on cockatrice or in person. I promise you. Not to mention, once someone pulls out elves on here. It just gets stupid.			"

												An interesting game if you're fan of the card game. The pace is a little slower than the 2013 edition, but for new players this might prove to be an advantage. For anyone not into the whole Magic: the Gathering game, this game takes you by the hand and helps you through the beginning, from where you can start advancing in tactics. As with the previous game, the cards and decks included are not all necessarily legal. I doubt there's enough legal cards to make this many decks, but I would've liked it if there at least some.Overall a strong game pick for the price. Tons of hours (and grinding, you have to play and win with a deck 30 times to unlock all it's locked cards, for EACH deck), but it's rewarding to see how you continually improve and develop strategies.

												Alright, here's the thing: If you're a seasoned vet of the Magic card game, this may not be for you.  The simplicity and lack of real deck-building could be a real turn-off.  Unless you participate in Sealed Play (which has a laughably short campaign and limits you to only about 100 cards by the time its done), you are shoe-horned into using themed decks within the game that you must unlock.  There is no way to collect massive amounts of cards and create your own custom deck.  That being said, Magic 2014 is a real solid way to be introduced to the card game, and I think that's what WoTC is going for here.  It explains the rules of the game rather well, introduces you to the strategy surrounding the game, and gives you some pre-constructed decks to whet your teeth on.  In all honesty, what they want you to do is get so interested in the game that you feel compelled to go out and buy the cards in real life... which is what happened to me.			"

												Magic 2014 is by no means a perfect game. It has the occasional game breaking glitch, and has a terrible dlc system in the form of sealed play slots.On the other hand, i'm hard pressed to think of anything else that Magic 2014 fails to accomplish.The game is beautiful, and it has near endless replay value. 21 decks exist in the game, although about half need to be bought as dlc (buy during a sale if you decide you like the game enough to do so!). Each deck has a radically different play style from the others, providing the basis for a solid multiplayer meta where decks tier differently and each have their various strengths and weaknesses (except Avacyn's Glory. that deck is broken as hell).The game's campaign is good fun to play through, and is very well paced. For a novice MTG player, it provides him with a good understanding of the game, gradually increasing in difficulty and complexity as it goes along. For the veteran MTG player, it's good fun in the sense that he gets to relive cards from across the history of magic, find out about card combinations he never thought of, and more. Just a warning: the balance of the tutorial boss battle is rather off, and you may end up having to retry it over and over. If this is your first DOTP game, like was the case with me, remember that you can edit your deck in the main menu to make this battle easier!Multiplayer has some issues where some people complain of connection difficulties. From my experience, connection issues do not occur when you go through the custom game menu or host your own game, whereas the quick game option is a headache to connect to. Occasionally games will hang halfway through - i suspect this happens when the host disconnects or lags out. There's no good fix for that and it has ruined a fair share of games for me. Very annoying when it happens, but otherwise multiplayer plays well enough to provide great fun. The community is very much alive, and you may end up remembering quite a few names that you see around often.There's real value for money in this game, especially if bought for sale like i did. It's definitely a better buy then paper Magic, anyway, where a good Standard deck could cost you $400 USD. Pick it up, have fun, and avoid Sealed Play like the plague.			"

												Magic 2014 is quite obviously designed as a way for Wizards of the Coast to get more people into the physical card game (where they can spend piles of money on real cards). That being said, Magic 2014 offers great gameplay value and is generally very well designed and coded. The look and feel is very polished. The gameplay is easy to pick up (if you haven't played before), and there is a decent variety of cards and decks to play, with several game modes. For players familiar with the physical card game, the chief drawback is that you can not have a general collection out of which you make any deck you like; you must use the specific decks provided. However, those decks have 40 additional cards you can unlock (including the 10 promotional cards; search the web for the promo codes), giving quite a bit of flexibility.For players looking to scratch their ""M:tG Itch"", or get familiar with Magic: the Gathering for the first time, without spending piles of money, this game does the job.

												[This review targeted to those new to Magic] Magic is a turn-based strategy game with well defined rules and unlimited variation in strategic gameplay.  It is a modern day chess analogue, offering quick games (<20m) with a myriad of potential outcomes.  There are colour combos, deck variations, deck size and synergy, and a tremendous amount of variables to control that keep this game appealing from newbie to veteran. This 3rd implementation of the Magic game offers new, well thought out decks, sealed play (random decks), multiplayer options (though I'm not happy with timing issues for mp rounds).  Magic is a visceral visual treat, drawing upon the deep and stunning art assets from the past two decades.  The game UI is the best yet, with the exception of a poorly placed ""Skip Attack"" button which will frustrate you when playing fast.  The AI is very well thought out, however, the fixed encounter decks are repetitive and tiresome, especially when ""card mining"" (Planeswalker battles are random though). My only real gripe is the in-game promotions.  Be careful or you may find yourself buying DLC inadvertantly.  I've paid for the game, so what's with all the ads for Magic?  Paying to unlock a deck, offering foils you can only get through payments, and providing achievements that can only be accessed by buying DLC is a disappointing aspect to a ""A"" title.			"

												On one hand, the deck designs, possible card combos, and some of the actual cards themselves are really fun in this version of Duels, but it feels like the AI has not caught up to some of the more intricate Magic mechanics in this year's offering - there are a lot of cases where the AI seems to make what you might call ""rookie mistakes"" dealing with some of the more complicated cards.The game itself is fun (it's Magic, so of course it's fun), but the various game modes are not as good as in the previous game in the series. Your only real game styles are regular and Sealed, and the Sealed is very limited in that (without buying additional content) you only get one card pool to play with, meaning that the Sealed campaign has approaching zero replay value, since you get the same cards every time. There's no Arch Enemy, Planechase, or any other fun variants this time around.On the positive side, the campaign mode feels a lot more like an actual campaign mode now, rather than just a series of unrelated games. They have added a little bit of story, put in some narration, and made the ""final boss"" fight a lot more entertaining than in the previous games in the series. For example, there is no ""tinker a Mox into Darksteel Colossus on turn 1"" like in the original game.I'd say this game is a good fit if you are either a very new Magic player (what the game was really designed for), or you just liked the first two games in the series and ran out of stuff to do in them. That said, if you're just looking for a Magic game to play, I'd probably go with the 2013 version above this one.			"

												Disclaimer: I don't own any of the DLCsThis was my first official exposure to the trading card game (other than a few casual duels with friends using borrowed decks).  After playing through the main and sealed deck campaigns, I've developed a much better understanding of MtG and had a lot of fun with the variety of decks I unlocked.  There are many things I like about M2014, but a few aspects that I disagree with.The interface is very intuitive and easy to use.  As a beginner, I found the ""More Info"" button to be very useful in explaining various game mechanics like Devour, Undying and First Strike.  Soundtrack is excellent and gets you pumped for the duel.  The main campaign was fun, but I didn't like how the ""encounters"" (non-boss duels) were scripted so that the AI basically plays the same cards each time you duel against it (ahem, Sewers.  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sewers).  It was exciting to unlock a new deck at the end of each chapter, and though the plot was pretty basic it added a nice bit of flavour to each duel.  However, the final battle was disappointing to say the least.Sealed mode (where you get a bunch of random cards from boosters and build a deck from them) was fun in theory but M2014 put on a bunch of unnecessary restrictions.  The sealed campaign is short and allows you to unlock some more additional boosters, but other than that you're stuck with the cards you have.  You can only make up to two decks in sealed - any more and you'll have to buy additional slots.  Because of the limited number of cards you get for each deck (and the fact that you can't exchange cards between decks), I found myself stuck playing decks of the colours for which I had the best cards.  I wish they'd had a mode where you could just build a deck from any of the cards that you collected (including the unlockable decks), without any restrictions.Multiplayer with friends, of course, is always nice.  I've also had matchmade games with strangers, and those turned out alright too.  Two-headed giant (2v2) mode was super hectic fun.  In order to be somewhat more unique, you can customize your player avatar and title, and those are unlocked by doing certain deeds in the game (like achievements, but the objectives are different). Challenges are either easy or tricky puzzles, and the tricky ones helped me understand the mechanics of Magic a little better. Verdict: This is a decent Magic game, and you'll definitely get more out of it if you're a beginner.  The replay value wasn't as great as I expected, and experienced players can probably skip this one unless it's on sale. Either way, you may want to wait for a sale to pick this up.  I'm looking forward to seeing how M2015 will turn out.			"

												I personally recommend this verson over 2015. I see what 2015 wants to do, but as a full game 2014 feels more thought out. 2014 is challenging enough for the advanced MTG player but easy enough for new players to start learning how to play and develop an understanding of the playstyle range that MTG has.

												Hours of entertainment. The campaign isn't difficult; compared to 2013. A great way to learn a great game.Every once in a while the game will misinterpret the rules and make a mistake but it's very rare. After beating the campaign I started playing 2-headed giant against A.I., playing online, and sealed play. The biggest issue is the payments and ads. Also, most of the decks are just ok with like 3 reigning supreme.2-Headed Giant: The A.I. can make some bone-head moves in 2HG. I've lost many matches because my partner decided to play cards that screwed us over. This is where I spend most of my time now. I love seeing all the different deck combos and unlocking new cards. Multiplayer: I've only played a few multiplayer rounds and didn't have much fun. I played 2-headed giant and 2 players didn't speak english (including my partner) and my partner went afk which meant we had to wait 30 seconds each time he had an input and it became 2v1 (I won though, fortunately). It's got a lot of potential. It just needs more polish to make sure every one has fun (form matches based on region and kick afk player). I prefer single player and 2HG with my friends in the same room.Sealed Play: the closest thing to making your own deck so there's some fun there. Unfortunately the experience is completely ruined by the fact that you can only make 2 or 3 decks before the game makes you pay real money for more deck slots and you can't delete decks you've created to make space.Advertisements and money barriers: I'm gonna get a bit rant-y here... I absolutely hate ads in a game I payed for. If it's not an ad for MTG events IRL or something interesting then I don't want it. The first thing you will see when you open this game is an ad for mtg 2015. Second, the game is constantly trying to squeeze money out of you. You will NEVER unlock every card for each deck without paying for it; each deck you can unlock about 10-20 cards when the like 30 additional ones will cost you. There's the sealed play issue mentioned above. There is a ton of DLC that consists only of individual decks at about $3 each. It bothers me that there is so much I have to pay to do when I already paid full price for this game. It's like they're trying to be hearthstone minus the fact that it's not free and the multiplayer isn't very good.I basically just vented all my frustrations but I love this game and highly recommend it to new players who want to play IRL. I whined about in-game payments but if MTG ever went F2P with better multiplayer I would be much more likely to spend money in-game and play online. I played 2013 and I think this improves on that one in every way (except difficulty and lack of planechase[I think]). I heard 2015 ditched a lot of what made this game great.			"

												I recommend this game highly. For beginners, this is an excellent starting point. From a returning player's standpoint, 2014 is by far an easier way to refresh one's memory of basic mechanics. However, no game is without drawbacks.- There is limited deck building. For a beginner, this is reasonable enough. However, building a deck is half the enjoyment of the game. Yes, in this regard one could simply buy a copy of DToP '15, but that is more money out of pocket.- Sealed slots are extra. Yes two slots for 40-card decks come with the game, however, as aforementioned, despite the slots being cheap, it is regardless money lost. Of course you could run only two decks, but the paper game is centered around experimentation. It would seem that way in Duels, but alas, it isn't.Regardless of micro-transactions, the game plays exceptionally well and newcomers will catch on quickly. I speak from experience. Before I picked up an Intro Pack at my local game store I bought this game. I am a better player because of it.			"

												I had been interested in MTG for a while, but never wanted to dump money into buying the cards. This game definitely helped me to get my fix. If you are new to the game or just looking to play casually, this is most definitely money well spent. The only downside to this game is that you are fairly limited as far as deck customization, which I could see as a deterrent to veteran players. Aside from that, it has a lot to offer. Hundreds of cards, multiple game modes, unlockable cards, solo & online play, all for the cost of a couple booster packs.9/10			"

												Being an avid Magic player in real life I have noticed the dwindling numbers of face to face games played nowadays. For that reason I chose to play online, unfortunately I now have to work through the single player to bring my deck back up to what it is in reality. I love this game, my deck is normally a mix of fire, water and land. This works well for me...especially Lava Axe!I have yet to test the MP but I am guessing it will be more interesting because of the varied decks that will be floating around. I also love the Sealed Deck play. Reminds me of my childhood and opening the sealed pack with my friends in anticipation of what laid inside!8.5/10. All in all I would recommend this game to all Magic lovers. Isn't as good as face to face though!!			"

												I first began playing this card game about a year and a half ago. I went to a few tornaments, but I was never that good at it. I bought this game on Steam just so that I could practice playing the game against a computer and a few multiplayer games. Within 7 hours, my concept and grasp of the game doubled and trippled. I am much more confident in this game as a result, and can sit down with real Magic The Gathering cards and play live.  I recommend this game to anyone looking to learn more about the game, and anyone who is good at this game and looking to destroy those who aren't. :)			"

												If you're looking to get into magic, or just want some experience with CCG games, I can whole heartedly recommend this game. It features an exellent tutorial featuring many of the basic mechanics used in the many of the 'contenders' and the structure of the gaming mechanics makes it easy to learn the phases, their order and which cards you can play when - something which can be more of a challenge if you jump into the TCG version of Magic. Beware: Fairly complex, although the premade decks you get to choose between reduces a lot of the complexity, if you prefer less strategy try Might & Magic: duel of champions, and if that to is too complex for your liking there's always heartstone.

												While it does have its fun moments, Magic 2014 - Duels of the Planeswalkers is far from the best card game out on the market. Unable to provide access to the whole collection of cards available in the game, something that many Yu-gi-oh! and Cardfight Vanguard games strive for, really harms the experience. And while they do provide a ""campaign"" mode of sorts, the loose justification for battles is barely enough to keep the game interesting while losing yet again to an enemy that somehow has counters to everything in the premade deck. Other TCG video games tend to provide a larger selection of customization options that really give the player a chance to work out strategies to surpass a tough opponent. On the positive side, the alternate modes do provide some fun challenges and reasons to keep playing. However, there's not enough there to make them last for an extensive amount of time. A disappointing fact as they would improve the game immensely. The fact that not all of the rules are presented accurately, with many being wildly different than how they work in the actual TCG, cause the game to be a struggle to recommend for beginners or experienced players. Avoid this game, the MTG Online available directly through Wizards of the Coast is a better option to get a digital MTG fix.			"

												It took me a while (more than 200 hours however) to understand that this is a ""disposable"" game. This is a very good game, but I finally suspect (and have a clear evidence) that the game begins to cheat when you finally unlock all the decks. I explain: The AI begins to grant itself a clear advantage in drawing the cards in a determined order (low first, then medium and finally powerful casts). This is the opposite spirit of this game ! I'm not talking about the campaign when this method is a fact, but in the Free-for-all and Two-headed-troll mode. Result : the game becomes unplayable in solo modes, suggesting you to move to another opus of the series. NO WAY, Wizards of the Coast. You cheated on me once, I won't let you another opportunity.So, the game is excellent and is very good to learn playing and improving. But it's a time-limited game, and I can't approve that.			"

												Now I want to say that I am a huge Magic The Gathering fan and have many decks and thousands of cards. But this game is not a good representation of MTG. Magic 2014? More like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Simulator 2014. When I play against AI in the campaign, you ramdomly get cards, but the AI don't. I have played multiple matches where the AI will get the same exact cards they got the last game in basicly the same order and at the same time. It's completly up to what cards you draw, and the opponent is always gaurenteed a great syngeratic hand. Its frustrating as all hell. Dont't buy thi game unless you have friends to play it with, and even then, its not that great...			"

While the tutorial/s seem to explain many of the game mechanics in a very straight-forward manner, any attempt to delve beyond the simplest of opponents will show you just how worthless many of the tutorials really are, especially when your deck/s cannot hope to compete against any but simplest of opponents.

Another downside is the fact that very few players use the multiplayer mode and sometines is very hard to find a single player to match a real person.			"

												I used to play mtg as kid long ago, I find this version of magic on the pc quite refreshing and it has a lot of improvements over it's predecessors. I like the multiplayer the most playing against other people, there are few types of game you can choose all of which are fun. If you don't like playing against people online you can challenge yourself in the campaign and the ""challenge mode"" where you are pitted against a certain situation that you have to resolve. All in all, I love this game, if you're a fan of tcgs or are developing an interest in them I see no better place to start than magic 2014.			"

												Approachable and enjoyable but not as polished as it could be. Mouse and keyboard controls were a bit cumbersome, I found using a controller to be much more fluid. Fun challenges, but the campaign's story (its delivery) and cutscenes could have used a bit more polish, and more modes throughout the campaign (intead of the single deviation) would have been welcome. Sadly the gameboard did not change to reflect the different locales... the default tron-like gameboard seemed out of place. Unlocking cards and decks provides a challenge but the decks never really feel personalized. Phases annoyingly could not be skipped, which slowed down gameplay. Magic the Gathering is a really fun card game, and this game translates that well, but if you've been spoiled by Hearthstone this game doesn't quite scratch that CCG itch.			"

												This game is great for novices and experienced players. The base decks are pretty awesome and have different playable variations for each. One great gamemode to see was Two-Headed-Giant. Sadly planeschase did not make it into this game. One downside to this game is that cards are locked for each deck (1 win:1 card,40 cards unlockable for each). Of course the developers wouldn't pass on this to make a quick buck, there is a key for each deck that unlocks all 40. The online gameplay is pretty good. Although some cards do not trigger properly, it's a very fun way to pass time and get better at MtG before hitting up FNM. I recommend getting it on a sale along with the DLC decks. 7/10			"

												 This is a great game! I'm not sure how it compares to 2015 or any of the other Steam Magic games since I haven't played any of them. But it is as close as your going to get on the computer by yourself compaired to playing the real thing with a friend. Nothing compares to that. Unfortunitly you  can't carry a friend around in your back pocket to play whenever you want. the only things I dont like is the way they deal with making you buy decks after you have bought the game. Its not like the real thing where the value of certain cards go up. Or you can trade them. The same goes with Foil cards. Whats the use? You can't show them off, sell them or trade them. They make it seem like it's a low price game at $9.99. But its not. You have to pay another $25.00 to get the rest of the cards. So really the game costs $34.99 if you want the complete game.			"

												one of the best things about this game is how smooth the textures are. i do like the idea of differnt game difficulty starting at mage and archmage. The decks are well made very balanced and very strong if used right. I do like that they made a single player mode with the main boss after going against 3 or 4 before it and u get rewarded with the deck u just went against. the cinamatics are beautiful and the voice acting is very good. the story line is well thought out. the multiplayer is pretty good as well no problems there u can invite friends to duel against or just join someone elses game. You can even play sealed play mode where u open packs and make a deck. Where u can either do the sealed singleplayer to earn more packs or play your deck against other players made decks. card unlocks from winning duels give sthe game more playablility. alot of the duels are really hard. Some i lost so many times to some of them it was crazy. but i still say this game is worth the buy.			"

												There are a lot of things this game does right.  If you're new to Magic (or haven't played it years, like myself) this game does a good job of teaching the mechanics of the game in its current incarnation.  There's a lot of variety and replayability in the base game, between campaign mode, challenges and the number of decks available to play.  The Sealed Deck play is also very nice, allowing you to build a deck from a random distribution of cards.The downsides to me are a lack of support.  If you happen to encounter the bug where you are unable to enter promo pack codes (as I did) then you can expect to spend a lot of time hunting through forums hoping for a solution to the problem.  It should be fixed as a patch, but the official solution is to muck about with local game files and hope for the best.  Another bug is present in the leaderboard.  It's full of impossible scores, which kind of defeats the purpose of having a leaderboard.  There isn't much point in having one if players can't honestly determine where they stand.  Overall, the good greatly outweighs the bad.  Highly recommend.			"

												A brilliantly complex strategy trading card game ..The first and the most played.  The game is much cheaper than the money sink that is the real physical cards and you can unlock everything ingame without buying its DLC.  I highly recommend if you like a challenging campaign, genuine sense of intelligent gameplay and multiplayer to battle your friends.			"

												Hands down the best way to learn how to play MtG.  Experienced Magic players will enjoy the speed and fluidity of matches in DotP14, and those new to the game of Magic will learn it in no time.  Fair warning, though...whether you play online, in person, or both, MtG is right up there with World of Warcraft in terms of its potential to get you hooked and monopolize all of your free time.			"

												This game is a pathetic excuse for a pc game. No ability to change resolution without digging into game files to force change it. The game is fuzzy and looks overall unfinished. Cutscenes look like they are from the 90s. Even more ads than last year. This is a LAZY game. IF YOU REALLY LOVE MAGIC AND REALLY WANT THE CARDS maybe buy it. Otherwise spend your ten dollars elsewhere.			"

												magic 2014 is the next installment in the magic series of games.i really enjoyed '13s planechase game option and 14 has sealed option instead of that. sealed may not be everyones cup of tea and IRL it is probably my favourite game type but here it's nothing special. The deckbuilder is greatly improved (especially for sealed) and there is a very good single player campaign (probably the best so far) i dont think there is as much replayability here compared to 2013 but i guess if you pay for more sealed slots (DO NOT DO IT UNLESS ON SPECIAL) then you might get a good amount out of this.

												Let me preface this by saying that I believe this (Duels of the Planeswalkers) series is an attempt by Wizards of the Coast to have the Magic franchise branch out to consumers who may otherwise never have thought they would be playing a card game, and as such should not be rated down by hardcore magic players for being too shallow or simplistic as opposed to having binders full of cards at your disposal - as that would both lose new players in the confusion and be a technical disaster. That being said, I think the series is really coming to it's intended form in this revision, and while the yearly releases have so far been an improvement over the prior version - this finally feels like the game everyone wanted it to be.The introduction of sealed play is one of the big reasons for this. Sealed play allows you to build a deck from a series of booster packs and has you play a VERY short campaign with them allowing you to unlock some more boosters. I do believe that they could have made the campaign in this version much longer and allowed for a larger pool of cards, but I also understand that as a new feature they likely intended to test the waters as to public reception of the feature (which I hear is mostly positive.The game does allow multiplayer on the steam version (android version mishaps aside), and it's very good other than a few dropped games here and there. I will note that those coming from past games used to just paying for an expansion or two along with some deck packs will see more in-game purchases in this game, which I assume they have adopted from their success in iOS on last year's Magic 2013 .Overall I do believe this game is worth playing, and there's plenty of fun to be had, just don't expect the depth of actual play nor that of MTG Online.  And don't expect to play all the game has to offer without spending at least 20$ USD.			"

												Personally I found Magic 4014 to be an amzaing game. It has a varity of decks and an enjoyable system to play with.As you probably will see when looking at a few reviews it seems to be aimed more to new MTG players than grizzeled vets who have years of experiance, and this suited me fine. Not having a played a lot of magic this allows you to jump right in and explore how MTG works, It has a decent single player and a good multiplayer option.Though dont buy it for sealed play. You get given very little choice and its expensive to buy more deck slots with no ability to erase you old ones.On the whole if you are new to magic or like a cheap and gentle way to play and explore without investing lots of money in cards this is a good buy. However if you rather a larger choice of cards at a higher cost mabye give this a miss.			"

												An interesting game if you're fan of the card game. The pace is a little slower than the 2013 edition, but for new players this might prove to be an advantage. For anyone not into the whole Magic: the Gathering game, this game takes you by the hand and helps you through the beginning, from where you can start advancing in tactics. As with the previous game, the cards and decks included are not all necessarily legal. I doubt there's enough legal cards to make this many decks, but I would've liked it if there at least some.Overall a strong game pick for the price. Tons of hours (and grinding, you have to play and win with a deck 30 times to unlock all it's locked cards, for EACH deck), but it's rewarding to see how you continually improve and develop strategies.

												Alright, here's the thing: If you're a seasoned vet of the Magic card game, this may not be for you.  The simplicity and lack of real deck-building could be a real turn-off.  Unless you participate in Sealed Play (which has a laughably short campaign and limits you to only about 100 cards by the time its done), you are shoe-horned into using themed decks within the game that you must unlock.  There is no way to collect massive amounts of cards and create your own custom deck.  That being said, Magic 2014 is a real solid way to be introduced to the card game, and I think that's what WoTC is going for here.  It explains the rules of the game rather well, introduces you to the strategy surrounding the game, and gives you some pre-constructed decks to whet your teeth on.  In all honesty, what they want you to do is get so interested in the game that you feel compelled to go out and buy the cards in real life... which is what happened to me.			"

												When I bought this game I had never played Magic: The Gathering (MTG). As a fan of trading card games I had to give it a shot. The game has a perfect entry level and an excellent tutorial on how to actually play Magic. When the tutorial is done you start by playing the campaign, which has some really cool challenges and opponents. What I really like about this game is the fact that it runs really smooth, the card animations have a nice flow and some cards have cool effects. Another positive thing is the music, great, ambient background music that does'nt bother you while you're playing or thinking about your moves.The multiplayer mode is quite fun, you can play 1v1, 1v1v1v1 or the so called ""Two Headed Giant"" mode which is a 2v2 game. You can even play 2v2 with a friend against 2 CPUs (and their difficulty can be adjusted so it can be quite challenging as well).The game does not have create-your-own-deck function. however. You start with a basic deck and unlock some more decks to play with. And to play the sealed mode more than twice you have to buy new slots which kinda sucks. All with all the game is a really cool for either beginners or advanced magic players, and if you like trading card games this is a worthy addition to your game collection.			"

												The game is fun except that the AI is a cheat and it will make you want to morph inside your computer for some direct duke nukem action. Playing the sealed deck play matches, You either get too much mana or not enough (adjusted or not) off the shuffles, and the computer player always pulls out the exact card it needs about about 90% of the time... and hardly ever misses a coin toss ! I counted 1 miss out of 5 and 1 out of 7 on two games in consecutive occassions.. same deck, same opponent. If  you like the thrill of getting your posterior whooped at a Casino while still being happy with winning on occasion, (a booster pack that may or may not help much against the next opponent) then you'll probably love the game...... and they will make money when you break down and buy the unlocks cause your tired of losing to the house. I recommend this game if you don't mind this aspect... and if you don't care for my opinion, your welcome to your own.			"

												sure this game can be fun to any magic player but there are a few things that are wrong with it, alot of the cards have broken effects and makes it hard for players like me to even try to dent some opponents and that it would have been nice to be able to customize your own deck or i just have'nt figured out how it works, but yet its pretty good so far and i doubt these unfair bugs will be fixed but one can hope. and if your woundering what i mean by unfair cards the second opponent on the third level is rediculous and needs to stop starting off with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t enchantment that costs like 4 mana before its my first turn i mean if that♥♥♥♥♥♥is somehow valid than im gonna be that pric at an tournament. well after playing the game a bit more and getting farther i realized that this game is completly unfair and is pretty broken because in every fight in campaign the opponenet starts off with the same hand and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t strategy and then you as the player just has to get lucky and get a decent hand while your deck seems to give the least♥♥♥♥♥♥that you want while your opponenet keeps on pulling the same♥♥♥♥♥♥ouy of there♥♥♥♥♥so im pretty disapointed so far and almost have none intrests in this game and might as well be a waste of money. and the only thing this game is good for is learning the rules properly.

												In comparison of the previous Duels of the Planeswalkers series, mainly aimed at introducing players to Magic the Gathering.  Duels 2014 was lacking seriously creativity in deck selections, as they were mainly the same decks that were in previous versions of Duels of the Planeswalkers virtually card for card.  For example Liliana's ghoul keeper deck was pretty much the same as the zombie deck in 2012, the face of M14 Chandra and her Phoenix deck is virtually the same as the 2013 version.  As well as the 5-6th Kor spiritdancer enchantment decks.  Zendikar and Scars of Mirrodin block cards are heavily featured in this version as well as previous incarnations.  The challenges were extremely boring and to easy to solve, as opposed to the other versions which actually required some thought and tinkering with to figure out.  The highly touted sealed deck feature was disappointing, and continuing for another sealed pool required micro transactions.The good side is more customization, particularly lands, which comes in handy for curving mana better and more handily.  For example, Duels 2013 had a goblin deck which featured cheap and inexpensive goblins, unfortunately far to often a mana flood was in order for the deck,  Nothing quite like having 5 lands on turn 5 played and 3 creatures and an action card.  Other good things, an improved artificial intelligence.  Lack of fun and entertaining modes such as Planechase, Archenemy leads to stale gameplay is another bad addition, especially for lack luster sealed play.  At times, all progress on your deck unlocks  often get reset, leading to having to reunlock every card once again, which can be frustrating.			"

												TL;DR  The game is great for learning how to play MTG, but it suffers some bad AI/RNG issues when playing against the computer. It's also disappointing that deck building is so limited.Pros: -Many decks to choose from.-Many cards to unlock-Lots of content in the way of campaigns and challenges-Rewarding GameplayCons:-AI/RNG can stack against you. They will always get the cards they need 80% of the time, having an answer for whatever you play.-Sealed Cards are limited. Can only open a few packs, and you can't use your created deck in any other modes. -Gameplay can hang up on AI making decisions. Sitting there for a few minutes while the computer is stuck on its Main Phase.Overall, the game is a good experience.  You can work your way through the single player and unlock decks and have a lot of fun playing them.  There's even a few decks I've discovered on here that I want to put together for real life MTG play.Don't expect too much from this, but its worth the price on sale, and if you want to keep practicing your MTG skills or learning the best card game in the world.

												It's impossible to beat the AI using a deck made from random packages. And that's just a side thing, the campain makes you use predesigned decks with only some customizability. The best part of any card game is making your own deecks, whether you want one color, two, three or all of them. If you really want to try playing magic against a pretty good AI go ahead but I strongly reccomend anyone who wants to play the game to get a large stockpile of cards, build some decent decks (you can google how to do that) and then search where people are playing the game. I'm afraid we're going to need to be social for this one			"

												9/10I really enjoyed this game. Most of my hours I was offline so add 10-50 and that's about what I've played. Seem like something you'd like? Try the demo. You'll either really enjoy it or it won't do anything for yaThe DLC is worth the price in my opinion			"

												If you've never played Magic before, this is the place to start. Duels serves as an excellent teaching tool, and it's also a lot of fun. I've played through every scrap of it on the iPad, and I'm now starting over on Steam since the iPad version has some pretty crippling bugs in it as of late.Just beware - once you get into this, you're more than likely going to start building real decks, getting your friends into the game, and possibly spend lots of time at your local game shop. Not that that's a bad thing ;)			"

												It's nothing compared to holding actual cards in your hand, but when you can't find anyone else that is in to the card game, Magic 2014 does a good job at keeping things fresh.  Now if only they didn't release a new version for every year like they do with the blocks and just kept adding to what they've already built.  We might actually have more people interested in picking up this series.			"

												I enjoyed the game. As someone else said, it's for beginners learning MTG. I've played the actual Trading Card Game before but it never meant enough for me to go out and spend all the time, money and effort on collecting decks you would spend to get what you get out of few bucks on this program. It's a quick campaign in that you can pretty much beat everything the game has to offer with opening one deck in about 25 hrs complete. But the fun it supposed to be in the challenge of learning all the decks that you unlock and how all their different pluses and minuses. SO then you figure to multiply that across the various decks thru the campaign. You do have to grind to get the decks to open up to their full potential, but what stat buidling game dont you anyway? So that's not really a valid point. I mean how much time would you spend in RL collecting all these cards anyway? Right now the entire season is available for less than what I would pay for a value meal, so as long as it's on sale I say go for it! I definitely wouldn't pay more than $10 for it though to be fair.			"

												Not a bad purchase for $2.50 -that's less then a single pack of actual Magic cards, incidentally.  The UI's a little clunky; you juggle in and out of a lot of nested menus.  There are tool-tips for each ability & rule, but the application of certain mechanics aren't at all intuitive (I.E. ""Protection"" from a card color on a creature doesn't grant said creature immunity to that color of card, but instead makes them invisible/unblock-able to the specified color.).  There isn't much depth to single-player play, though I suppose that's to be expected from a game whose chief mechanic is crafted card decks.			"

												Do I recommend this game... yes, because it is game with ""some values"" but it is also to your risk and perils!I come back to Magic the gathering 2014 Gold complete because I had a very good experience as a kid with Magic the gathering when it was a duel  against AI in a RPG/adventure video game.2014 has nothing of that. It is only duels on table, that's it. I suppose I could live with that.I do not know if this is wrong but I started right off the bat with single player>campaign. I have to go through a tutorial and that is great but here is the deal. I have to beat up Chandra as last tutorial AI and she is plain unbeatable or it is meant from me to be playing a very particular and should I say a very peculiar way with no margin for error if I want to win because decks are not distributed randomly, it appears like there are several pre-fab deck distribution at least for AI which create this bubble gameplay/strategy and in my experience that this game is therefore deck instanciated! In other words, don't choose the wrong deck or simply lose fast, lose slow but lose anyway.Now as noted all way above, the gold complete offer the chance to choose from a vast variety of decks in campaign solo mode which I am happy but I cannot just choose 1 deck and jump to the next because I just lost. Last but not least... what are those 0 to 5 stars next to each pre-fab decks. I understand a couple of those values but others do not say or mean anything like creature size ( I assume the more stars the more ""monstruous/devastating"" creatures are), Deck speed ( I have no idea what this value is for ), Deck flexibility ( I assume the more flexible the more versatile the deck is), and finally card synergy is so far the biggest mystery in this game to me. You would guess that hovering the mouse would provide cues and clues but nope... nothing.Other players that are obviously more experienced stated the fact that sealed campaign is ""fun"" and I agree with them for the simple reason you start with 0 card and it feels like really opening those surprise packets. This said,  while I could beat Chandra with a purely Death base deck + 5 or 6 cards requiring any land types, it appears impossible to do so against Ajani. It really sound like I need to shuffle and build another deck to beat Ajani whom appears to me to have a good defensive base until that AI can just overwhelm the player.I am glad I caught this game while in promo and I recommend to anyone who want to try to actually buy it when it is in promotion. I feels to me the value is just right that way and not a penny more.The game appears easy to dive in and be familiar with the game mechanics but it takes some time to understand AI decks and even more time to get if your deck can even compete against the AI or should you do something about your deck.I am one of those old school perhaps but I am not prone to mix and match. Again I am noob at this game and it is a cool game but just not the same experience as the very first Magic The Gathering, although I am glad the franchise goes on :)			"

												Way back then, me and brother bought a starter pack to try this out. We were left to understand the rules by ourself. of course this meant that our personal interpretation was often taken as self-interest ! Resulted in endless confrontation and frustration. I started fro real with the 2010 PS3 version. Computers are great to teach you card games, no human interpretation. Sometimes the game wouldn't let you do something, that meant you misunderstood a basic rule. Even my bro came back to the game and we had lots of fun over the net, particularly on 2-headed giant.I could play all the decks with 50% chance of aquiring an additional card for one in 2 win. Very addicting. I know very little about programming, but I have a lot of experience with game making. I can assure you this is the simplest game you can program. The mechanics are decades old and playtested to the max, no further balancing is needed, the art litteraly copied from the card game. Why then do we get minor rehashed game engine year after year, buggy, unstable and slow (console is nearly unplayable due to loading). I'm not even talking about AI, there is none. You can fake AI with rules but in the end, unless you write a rule for every possible outcome, you will get consistent mistakes. ie: If you are overpowered (50 beasts at 10/10, 200 health) the AI will stop playing. The game won't crash but the AI will draw 1 card, and disard 1 card at the end of the turn, period.This is clearly a cash-in enterprise. It works. From what I can see, it runs on very limited resources. Bugs can only hope to be fixed in the next one or second advent. I have bought every game, hoping my experience would be improved by as little as 1%. It did. I can understand fixing the minor shortcomings would make this game 10 times more pricey to produce. Is it worth it? Of course not. But I strongly believe the community deserves it.With all this said, I still recommend Magic. Don't fall for the obvious cash-in tricks buried amongst the really cheap deck unlocks (who needs foiled cards?, wallpapers, soundtracks ?)			"

I bought this game on Steam just so that I could practice playing the game against a computer and a few multiplayer games. Within 7 hours, my concept and grasp of the game doubled and trippled. I am much more confident in this game as a result, and can sit down with real Magic The Gathering cards and play live.  I recommend this game to anyone looking to learn more about the game, and anyone who is good at this game and looking to destroy those who aren't. :)			"

												Highly recommended if you're new or only moderately familiar with MtG. It'll help you get into the game, understand a lot of the mechanics that are easy to miss when playing in person, and not have to worry about making your own decks for a while. If you're into MtG and want to enjoy having a lot of cheap cards at your disposal, give the game a whirl! You can still make decks from sealed packs, and customize the pre-built decks as you unlock various non-basic lands simply by winning with the deck.Players of MtGO -- the serious hobbyists -- will likely want to give this game a pass unless they want to play the game with friends who aren't as into Magic (and spending money on it) as you are.The game looks nice, has a decent soundtrack (that you can easily turn off in the settings), has excellent AI (a MAJOR plus), and I've found all the DLC to be of great value.

												It's a very good game. Yes, its similar to 2013, but what do you expect, your playing a card game. the campaign is nice, you unlock a card every character you beat. The online is good except you have to build a good deck, now you can earn booster packs by playing the game or you can do what these people who are not recommending this game arew doing, and buy the booster packs. Thats lame though,  i rather play for free, and i am enjoying the fact that i am doing so. The onlin would be soo much better if you didnt have to earn the booster packs. Another thing people are probably complaining about is probably the deck for campaign, well you can be lazy and buy the complete deck or you can earn it. Problem solved, overall game is good, and magic is awesome, so suck it.			"

On the negative, there isn't a whole lot of customisation, and it automatically puts cards into peoples decks, so you see newer players with 100 card decks, which is not very good for consistency.  The multiplayer is fun, but the chat interface is horrendous.  Sealed was a great addition from the previous games and should continue to be in future iterations of the game.  Overall, great fun, has problems, but not super impeding ones!			"

												Fun little game, but it doesn't allow for much in the way of deck construction which is over half of what MtG is all about. I'm giving it a conditional recommendation because it does play very well - note that I only went through the campaign.			"

												Gaming Mechanics too slow. Interface not state of the art. Magic might be a great CCG in real life, but the eSports version of it just can't compete against the elite of digital card games, which is represented by only one game in my eyes - Blizzard's Hearthstone!Magic - The Gathering 2014 still is quite mediocre, though.Magic<=Solforge<Hearthstone			"

												 First if you don't play Magic this probably isn't the game for you at full price but if it's on a big sale it can be an effective way of learning. The game is enjoyable and this time around you can modify the land count in your decks, even with this I feel it wasn't as good as Magic 2013.  Keep in mind it's all oppinion but I prefered the decks in the previous game over this one and the campaign in this one felt much easier, the final ""boss"" in this game was a joke leaving me extremely dissappointed with the campaign. The custom match options does not have planeschase like 2013 which was another huge dissapointment for me.The major new addition is the Sealed Play option, this gives you booster packs and using the cards inside of them you must build a deck. I found it fun but it's very flawed, obviously being random pulls you can get really lucky or really bad cards to work with. The major problem is you have two slots to work with and you cannot delete your deck, I understand many would delete there decks after there pull if they don't like there cards which would ruin the fun but I would like an option after I finish the sealed campaign but if you want to have more sealed campaigns from scratch you have to buy them using real cash, and to me that's a big let down. I would have liked an online sealed where so many players or AI go into a lobby and pull and make random decks and it works through tournament style. But this didn't happen and I felt this could have made the game so much better. Even with all I said I still reccomend this game to any fan of the card game because it is enjoyable and will get you through if you don't have anyone to currently play with.			"

												I really love magic the card game and the online version. The only negative thing is I feel it shouldn't take as long as it does. Obviously game length is a huge wild card, but individual turns tend to take much longer than they would in the card version.			"

												[This review targeted to those new to Magic] Magic is a turn-based strategy game with well defined rules and unlimited variation in strategic gameplay.  It is a modern day chess analogue, offering quick games (<20m) with a myriad of potential outcomes.  There are colour combos, deck variations, deck size and synergy, and a tremendous amount of variables to control that keep this game appealing from newbie to veteran. This 3rd implementation of the Magic game offers new, well thought out decks, sealed play (random decks), multiplayer options (though I'm not happy with timing issues for mp rounds).  Magic is a visceral visual treat, drawing upon the deep and stunning art assets from the past two decades.  The game UI is the best yet, with the exception of a poorly placed ""Skip Attack"" button which will frustrate you when playing fast.  The AI is very well thought out, however, the fixed encounter decks are repetitive and tiresome, especially when ""card mining"" (Planeswalker battles are random though). My only real gripe is the in-game promotions.  Be careful or you may find yourself buying DLC inadvertantly.  I've paid for the game, so what's with all the ads for Magic?  Paying to unlock a deck, offering foils you can only get through payments, and providing achievements that can only be accessed by buying DLC is a disappointing aspect to a ""A"" title.			"

												The game has more story than the previous one, but I preferred Magic 2013.  It also controls better on the Xbox 360.  Despite that, it's not a bad game if you're into Magic: The Gathering.  It does a good job of emulating the actual card game on a computer, but the UI is a little ""stiff"".  6.5/10			"

												I have never been a fan of TCG at all. I played the occasional game of Yu Gi Oh when I was younger, but after watching some people play this on youtube I was pleasantly surprised at how fun it was. It has so much variation and is extremely addicting, I highly recommend it for anyone looking for an awesome casual game!			"
