												One can fix the bugs, glitches and even contents with enough patches. However, one cannot fix bad gameplay design decisions no matter how much one can pour its money and time. The new Moo is the prime example of the latter.I had been maintaining weapon mod list thread in the official Moo forum until I gave up on the game.This game massively suffers in three areas: combat, content, and game design which is terrible.I am not even going to talk about the tactical battle being real-time instead of turn-based, or staranes instead of free movements, because those issues are actually trivial issues compared to what I am going to discuss here.No, there is no tl:dr version. You can always choose to not read this.1) Combat :The fact is that you will probably feel have even less control of the units in the battle than the games like Stellaris and Endless Space. Only game that provides even less interesting and uncontrollable battle is Gal Civ 3, and Gal Civ series was already infamous for such lackluster battle.You will notice that you really do not have much control on the ship movements in ""AI assisted"" mode. You could try second option which gives you ""total control"" of the ships, which is nothing more than making ships basically immobile shooting turrets unless you order it to move. It's really badly implemented.A good ship movements example would be games like Homeworld, where the capital ships properly make formations (this game's formations are hardly formations except 'bonus' stuffs) while smaller fighters/bombers and smaller ships move around to flank the enemy in fluent way. Despite 2016 game, New Master of Orion provides worse battle than a game that came out in 1999.Also you will realize that you have no clue just how effective weapons or have no indication whether the weapons mods or special modules are actually working due to lack of the information. Even Stellaris provides a nice during-battle statistics such as damage, accuracy, and other useful stuffs. For Moo, this is very hard to tell due to fast nature of the tactical combat. One of the reasons why my thread was popular was that people have no clue whether the mod is working or not, and had to be manually tested each in optimal conditions.This is already a fatal flaw, since the Moo is not really famous for 4X elements, but rather robust tactical battles. By throwing away having good tactical battles, the game is already in mediocre category.Unfortunately, the combat is the least problematic of the three I mentioned.2) Contents :The game basically lacks contents. Even if NGO and Wargaming implement minor civs back in a good manner, the game still lacks a lot of stuffs missing. There is no governors, no interesting random events, pirates are half-baked, and the research tree feels shorts even if one can consider they have changed it to Civ style from binary choice method.The main cause of the problem is... well, starlanes. So what happened? Since NGO has chosen to go from free movement to starlane movement, suddenly there was no need for implementing techs like fuel and reactors. The problem is that those fuel and reactors took a large portion of Moo techs. Because NGO has not sufficiently added additional content to fill this void, the overall tech tree feels short and feel something is missing.Lack of governors and/or general are really missed features and most likely won't be ever implemented since it was NGO's decision to not implement in the first place.However, even this content issue is not the most damaging issue for this game. Again, people can change their minds and spend money/time to implement said features, or you can just suck it up since the game is a bit cheap, however....3) Game design :....One just cannot fix design issues. You cannot fix it with time and money when you have a wrong idea. Try make gold from dirt, no matter how hard you try for next thirty years, you cannot transform dirt to gold.This issue also unfortunately includes UI issues too. Here is copy-paste from my ""My verdict on new Moo."" thread regarding UI and micro-management issues caused by bad game design.There are so many unnecessary, tiresome micro in this game. I think the developers believe making the game micro-intensive would make the game more 'complex' or something. No, it doesn't. It just makes the game chore. Here are the examples of this super duper terrible amount of unnecessary micro.  1) Pollution mechanic : The most insidious mechanics I've ever seen in any 4X games, literally. It is as insidious as Emperor Palpatine with his master's name ""Sidious"" implies. Basically, it works like this. ""You MUST babysit ALL non-barren, non-volcano planets with sharp eyes or they will degrade, forcing you to terraform the planet again!"" Seriously, when the number of the planets goes up 20+, this just makes me crazy all the time. You know, original Moo and other Moo clones have chosen much sane way (by just reducing total production output) to cut off this unnecessary micro-management, for a good reason. This pollution mechanic is perhaps one of the most discussed subjects regarding micro-management problem this game has, and yet no adjustment is being made.  2) Population : Yet another micro-intensive element that does not have to. Even moving people around is challenging.Why we have to individually move them around to properly balance planet output?Why we have to make individual civil transport and disembark population individually in such tiresome manner? I mean for god's sake original Moo and countless of Moo clones got this one right a long time ago. There are just tons of unneeded and unjustified micro-management in population alone.  3) Colony improvement/management : another crucial element that riddled with terrible micro-intensive-ridden stuffs. From EA1, we have been voicing about the fact that there are only 5 (what? why only 5? Just... why???!?) order slots available for planetary improvement building order, and the fact that we cannot make our own building order to save time in the late game.  After 3 months this issue, like other micro-management issues, is rarely (more likely never) recognized despite the fact that this is the most crucial reason why people easily get 'tired' after several hours of the play. Watching a person playing this game in twitch is insanely boring and exercise in futility that forced me to turn off the channel, because of these insane, endless micro-management feast. After how espionage has been implemented, I have no faith that the micro-management issues will be ever fixed.(Reminder: this article was written in May. For more than 3 months these issues were never addressed.)Sadly, it turned out that most of these issues were actually intentional(!!) When someone actually asked why there are only 9 ship design slots available, the dev said it's intentional. Just like terrible pollution mechanics, such arbitary restrictions that cause massive increase of micro-management are all intentional (a.k.a ""features"".)This is actually a huge step back from the original Moo and Moo2. Even Moo2 had MORE building queue slots than this modern Moo. Yes, Moo2 had 7 queue slots instead of 5. Sad but true.So, are there any positives? Sure yes, the game itself is very polished (tho Endless Space is about as polished as this game), and super expensive AAA voice acting, and surprisngly competent AI (then again, the game itself is not that complex to begin with) but none of these can overcome such fatal flaws this game has, particually game design issues.Only saving grace is cheap price. At least Wargaming did not have balls to charge people AAA price for this game. It's only 30 bucks. If you can tolerate it, all power to you. But I'd recommend to spend money elsewhere.			"

												So I am re-writing my review after the latest patch and spending more time playing.The game is a lot better after this latest patch, a lot more fleshed out.  There are still issues that need addressed though.Pros:Voice work is amazingGraphics are incredibleThe technology tree is quite good.Here are the remaining issues and some are quite significant.1.  Limited tactical combat.  You cannot disable engines and shields, board vessels and steal tech.  This creates a huge disadvantage for races that have marine improvement perks over other things - it essentially removes a significant source of tech aquisition.  Races like the Myrshan and the Bulrathi in particular.  It also really removes an important dimension of the original game.  2.  The antarans are game breaking - the way they attack is insane.  They simply create a massive fleet of small ships that essentially crashes the computer eventually.  Small ships are more efficient than larger capitol ships so mostly you die unless you do the same.  But you can control where they go because they will attack the planet that has most of your fleet.  Honestly it's nonsense.  if you get to the Antaran homeworld there are 61 ships - yet they can field a fleet of hundreds just to match a stodgy game mechanic.  Utter non-sense.  I guess random attacks of reasonable size was too difficult.3.  There doesn't seem to be a way to look at the specs of a ship after it is built.  Or to manually retrofit a ship once it is created.  You just apply a new build and that is it - cookie cutter style.4.  There is no way to set a rally point - this is just silly.  5.  There seem to be nebulas and astroids everywhere - regardless of where combat takes place.  I attack a planet and there are nebulas and astroids in front of it.  Thats isn't a thing - stop that!6.  The victory conditions win screen is a huge letdown most of the time.  I was thinking of modding in the one from MOO2 because it was great.  7.  The races are terribly unbalanced.  Thankfully you can do custom but still..8.  Finally anythign that makes marines stronger is essentially a pointless tech or perk.  The solution to your fancy marines is to just ""use more bombs"" - and since marines only get play in ground invasions this makes it a lot of investment for very little advantage.  Maybe you get a few extra turns while your litle marines get thier faces bombed in...Anyway - less of a crap sandwich but still very frustrating.  It just feels like the devs take too much for granted- and this more than anything bothers me - because the original makers were some detail oriented uber-nerds and these guys just isn't.  do better.

												Overall a nice game, brings a very cool nostalgic feel.However, locking races behind special editions and DLCs is just a no no from me, you just dont cut your game in half and sell it later, especialy when the DLCs are just races with no story, special features nor missions to follow.These new selling models that the gaming industry is adopting are just bad, I would not have bought this game if I knew they were doing this.

												I like this game, I really do. The AI could use a little work, so can diplomacy, and espionage... but the foundation is there.While there are differences, the game does re-kindle my enjoyment of MOO 1 & 2. Fortunately with the new support system, there are no more 100+ ship battles to drag on for ever... I'm happy about that but, I understand if others are not.HOWEVER... Do not buy this game...  It is very buggy. For that reason alone I can not recommend it., If that ever changes I will update this.There are some major bugs in this game. And the ones affecting me are not apparent until mid to late game. Somewhere around turn 300-350 I will get a game crash after none in the early turns. I restart the game, load up a save and play... then I will get another crash in 5-20 turns later and they start increasing in frequency. Eventually, I will get a crash somewhere that repeats itself even after a fresh start/load game. I rarely make it past turn 400... and I have not been able to play a single game to turn 500... ever. IT IS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING TO SPEND THE TIME BUILDING UP A GAME ONLY TO NOT BE ABLE TO FINISH IT. Only 2 games out of at least 2 dozen have I been able to actually win... 1 economic, and 1 scientific., But I turned those options of so that I can win by domination and it always bugs out before I can finish.The crash either goes straight to desktop or it builds up memory usage to 12GB slowing down my system before the inevitable crash. Sometimes it is on the diplomacy screen, or the system map... its random... (Though I have save games that will constantly crash in the same exact spot.) I have reported it through the in-game interface, but no real acknowledgement. I have tried running smaller galaxies and lowering my graphics to the minimum and neither help at all,I had to stop playing because the game ending crashes were too frustrating... Hopefully they will fix it in the future... but I am not holding my breath. Until then I wasted my $30 already... hopefully this review will stop others from wasting their hard earned cash as well.edited for typosUPDATE Dec 31, 2016...  Well the bug that was causing me problems *might* have been fixed... There was a buffer overflow bug fixed in patch 51.2 released on Nov 1st. However that same patch introduced a new bug that wouldn't even let me load the main menu; the game crashed constantly before the menu would load.The main menu bug was finally fixed for me in release 54.7; 6 weeks later on Dec 7th. However, the graphics glitch was worse and the UI makes it unplayable. (example here: http://imgur.com/a/PWrhO )The worse thing is that they seem to never read the forums here... not even support... even on topics they start. The main menu bug in particular was reported by multiple users many times and they never even acknowledged the problem. (even though it made the game unplayable for over a month.) People commented in the release notification thread, there were 2 main threads in the support area, a ""known issues"" thread had comments about it, and a few in the general discussion area. As I said... not a single acknowledgement that the bug even existed until over a month later when it was fixed.People have complained about them still changing the gameplay now since release... I wish I could even comment... with all the bugs I have not been able to play a single game in over 2 months, and I still only won the 2 initial games despite trying many times.And for the record... this is the vanilla game, I have not used any mods. With all the problems I have had, I have used steam to check the integrity of the game files as well, and they have always been verified.They are now selling DLC packs... It would be nice if they fixed their game before they try to grab more money.At this point, with all the bugs (and there are a lot of them), when every update changes the mechanics and adds brand new bugs, the lack of developer response, or anyone in the forums, (even a simple acknowledgement from someone in the company... doesn't need to be an actual dev,) I can not and will not ever change my recommendation to avoid this game. Personally, I will not buy any game from these developers in the future either.			"

Early Access Review
								I want to love this game, I really do, but it has some problems that need to be corrected or I see this going into my pile of 4x games that were only touched once or twice and never seen again. I am going to start off with that I do like and why followed by the big issues and what they need to do to correct this.1. Sound! Omg, I was smiling from ear to ear when I realized the music for the colony ship landing was the same from the original. 2. Graphics are great and their attention to detail just amazes me, like having the ship’s path curve AROUND the star. The races are detailed and beautifully rendered. 3. The UI is clean and unobtrusive. This is great because you get the whole galaxy as your backdrop.4. I love the colony manager and how they display your information, it is a great take on the MoO 2 mananger with a modern UI.I have enjoyed playing, but I can say the same for the countless MoO clones. Sadly like them I see this getting played for a bit until the combat becomes so bland I don't pick it up ever again, usually two to three games.1. Combat - The combat is real time and I have no direct fire control of my ships. Sure I can get into tactical mode where I tell them where to go and who to shoot but that does no good if I cannot control the weapons. I don’t want a real time combat, I wanted MoO turn based ship combat. Sure you could get bogged down in MoO 2 space combat if your fleets got really big at the end game but that is why you had AUTO. In MoO 2 you could make some really nuanced ships, and special variants, in this because of the ship combat AI you are forced to make brute force ships.2. Research - I love MoO 1’s research, you could play multiple games and get different techs each time. I only ever saw Hand Phasers once out of countless games. This made research unique and you were always checking in on the other races to find out what they got that you didn’t. Here I find myself making strange and unintelligible choices. Why must I choose between fusion bombs and fusion beams? This doesn’t make any sense, all it does is make an optimal research path that min maxers will figure out and share, it does not add variety.3. Range - There is no range mechanic. In the first MoO games you were limited by how far your fuel cells would let you go. A scout now however can go all over the galaxy and find everything and everyone. So instead of a gradual expansion moving forward and meeting aliens, you are thrust straight away into contact and have to start shoring up your solar systems at the Starlane warp points so you can at least hold on to some of your colonizable planets.4. It has been brought to my attention the 500 turn limit can be turned off. It is the Excellence victory condition in the Advanced Options menu. These options need to be labeled better. I am testing a game with the turn limit turned off. (update) I got far too bored and just stopped playing.5. Star lanes - These don't belong in a MoO game at all! Part of the tactics were worrying if commiting your fleet was going to leave you open at home. You could pick where and when to attack, now you just walk right into bottleneck after bottleneck after bottleneck. These need to go NOW. I had an anomoly pop up near my homeworld in my first game and I thought, ok without a star lane it must take a while to get to it right? Nope, one turn, one turn for a distance the same distance as the star lane going to the next star system. That star lane took FOUR turns. This makes no sense. These need to go.If you haven't purchased it already I suggest waiting. I would rather play MoO 1 or 2 before touching this one again.			"

												Don't bother. There is only one reason you'd be interested in this game: You liked Masters of Orion 2!Now the question: Is this MoO2 with modern tech?Answer: No!Space travel is completely different, since you travel by hyperlanes only. Combat is completely different, because it's in real time with no meaningful ability to interact. The original races and abilities are not all there, because it's more profitable to sell them as DLC!!In short: It's a different game that merely share's the name.In fact, you might as well take a look at this game: StellarisIt's also not MoO2 but better in about every way.The only thing this supposed remake has going for it is fluff: The races look pretty.

												This could be a great game, but the a handful of little details all too often make playing it a bad experience.1st The Tactical Combat was a core element of the MoO games (at least the good ones). Here however, your fleet considers your orders as silly suggestions to be ignored at their leisure, EVEN WITH THE ADMIRAL AI TURNED OFF. You want to concentrate fire on the big bad battleships coming in? Well, there are a bunch of itty-bitty frigates in front of them, so your fleet will waste their shots on them because they get into range first. An almost finished enemy battleship is pounding your fleet from behind? You can grind your fingers clicking on it, as long as your ships have targets in front of them, they will be shot at first, because turning apparently makes your captains too dizzy.2nd Random elements sure add a certain spice to the game. But having a deadly plague hit your homeworld well before you can build your first colony ship? Sorry, that is just bad design.			"

												I played the original MoO back in the day and had a lot of fun with it. When I saw this remake on a friend's computer, I knew I had to buy it.I enjoyed this game so far and continue to do so. But I cannot, with good conscience, recommend this game in its current state. If it were possible, I would give a neutral rating. Since it isn't, I'll go with ""Not recommended"" for now.My first impression was positive throughout: Great visuals. Animations are smooth and pleasant to look at. The interface is clean and intuitive. Not so impressed with the music (repetitive), but in general sound is well done.For me, the biggest nitpicks started to show up, once I was well into the game (500+ turns). Most of them are minor, but they add up and leave a bad impression.# Performance / ResponsivenessSpecs:- 16 GB RAM- Core i5 3570K @ 3.4 GHz- RX 480 8GB VRAM- 500 GB SSDTurns at this stage (500+) can take anywhere from 60 to 90 seconds. This in itself is not an issue and quite as expected. But, during most turns the game will often freeze for 10 seconds or more. Complete standstill. Animations (e.g. CPU bombing a planet) will often lag or freeze. I've even had cases of Windows offering to kill the app before it continued running.Even after a turn completes, the game continues to be slow for some time. I estimate it takes about 30 seconds before responsiveness is ""back to normal"". Even then, CPU load varies between 40-60%. Yes, planets rotate, moons orbit, routes animate, etc., but it still feels a tad too high.This may feel like a RAM issue, but this even happens on lowest details (~3 GB RAM usage). On maximum details the game will take ~7GB, which is still way below my system specs (16 GB). Switching from maximum to minimum seems to make no difference in terms of lag either. Neither do I see any particular CPU activity during these freezes.Example: When another race contacts me during their turn, the animation will often stutter or freeze. It can take 10-20 seconds before I can make a choice and leave the dialogue. Clicking too soon can even crash the game.Note: None of these issues started to manifest themselves until late game. The game ran smooth as butter, even when all seven races were still present (I'm down to three, going on two).If you have a large number of planets, events each turn can stack several screens high (I have 180 colonies). There is no way to filter or group these events. Neither is it possible to disable uninteresting ones. This late into the game, I don't care which planet has grown or which building got completed. The ability to disable some of these notifications would help a lot. The sheer number of them makes you miss the important ones (Oops, my planet is now poisoned).On top of that, the game seems particularly slow until you dismiss excess notifications. By excess I mean notifications outside the visible screen area. And if you dismiss them too fast, the game tends to lag and freeze (again).The ""Empire"" list also starts to slow down considerably at this point. I feel that sorting a list of 180 entries shouldn't be this slow. Neither should scrolling. On top of that, some of the entries in the list are starting to miss icons (e.g. current production). If I would be running out of RAM, ok, but I'm not (see above).Clicking on large fleets (150-300 ships) also tends to freeze the game for a second or two. Which is to be expected, since it displays an icon for each ship, even at this size. Which brings me to my next issue:# Fleet managementHandling large fleets is cumbersome. If you click on a fleet you get a grid of icons, one for each ship. Let's say you want to split a large fleet into two. Left click each ship you want, then move them somewhere else to form a second fleet.You get to see total number of ships, but not the number of ships per type. Neither do you see how many ships of each type you've currently selected.Want to split a fleet down the middle? Better start counting how many of each type you've currently selected. Tedious. Now add in lag, and the ability to misclick and deselect everything. Frustrating.It would be much simpler (and faster?) if the game started to group ships by type once your fleet reaches a certain size. Alas, it doesn't. How about dragging an dropping such a group to form a new fleet? Nope. How a about right-click drag to extract a certain number of ships? Nope again.It's not like these are new concepts. A lot of games where you handle large stacks of items have these kind of controls. Yes, this is a remake but if you upgrade graphics to the 21st century, why not input concepts along with it?Speaking of fleets, I tend to lose track of them. The ""Fleets"" view is just a list of any fleet anywhere, so it doesn't do much to help keep track of particular fleets. The ability to name fleets or place them on hotkeys would help a lot. Right now I'm constantly hunting down my attack fleets each turn, to make sure they attack.Oh sure, the game reminds you to move idle fleets. But a fleet that is en route to some distant planet will completely ignore any other enemy planet on its route. So you have to pay attention and make sure to attack each turn. Or move a single planet per turn to make sure you get a ""fleet needs orders"" reminder.Speaking of long routes:Even if you are at war with another race, your ships will always take the safest route. My 200-ship-strong attack fleet would rather fly 15 turns to reach a planet, rather than blasting their way through defenses to reach said planet in 3 turns. It would be nice to have a ""shortest route"" option, because such roundabout routes aren't always obvious. Or how about an attack-move that takes you to the planet, attacking anything that tries to stop you on your way? No?# Mass managementIn general anything ""mass management"" is lacking. Which makes late game more tedious than it needs to be. Want to find all planets that have a particular building and scrap it?- Click on planet- Click on Manage Structures- Filter the list- Click on the building in the list- Wait for the planet's rotate animation to complete- Click on ""Scrap""- Click on Done- Click on Next Colony- Rinse and repeat 180 more timesWant to find all planets that are missing a certain building? You guessed it... manual click and search.# ConclusionDon't get me wrong here, the game has great potential. I enjoy the nostalgia, the look and feel, the well made animations, the voice acting. If the game was otherwise great, these would make it perfect.I don't mind the (somewhat) broken fight mechanics and fleet-strength estimations too much. Though I feel more tactical, round based, fights might be a plus.The lack of polish and the myriad of papercuts in other areas are what break it for me. I could live with long turns (to a certain extend). But lag, freezes and stuttering to this extend is just unacceptable. What on earth is the game doing (while it should be idle) that causes so much input lag in late game?On top of that, the total lack of fleet management features makes a military win exhausting to the extreme.Give me a minor performance upgrade and some tools to simplify mass management I'll be happy. Until then, I don't feel like I can recommend this game.			"

Early Access Review
								One of my most enduring memories as a young PC gamer was sitting in front of my old 386 well into the early morning hours playing Master of Orion.  I still have my old floppy discs for it, and the manual which was absolutely necessary to pass through the regular security checks the game ran to prevent piracy.  And it was a masterpiece, one only exceeded by Master of Orion 2 in the canon of space 4x games in my estimation.  After the absolute travesty that was MOO3 I thought we would never have another one to rival the first two.Until now.This game is EARLY ACCESS.  That has to be emphasized.  There are races not yet available for play (The Darlok, Klakon, Meklar, and Silicoids), I've had one solitary CTD, and a few graphical glitches here and there but on the whole this is already an amazingly polished title with astounding voice acting (by such luminaries as Mark Hamill and Alan Tudyk) and gorgeous graphics.  I enjoy just sitting on the main game map, watching the stars twinkle and shine, the nebulae shift and flux, and my ships flying through the space lanes with a massive bow shock in front of them as testament to their faster than light speed.  This is the first game since the old MIcroprose days to capture the FEEL of Master of Orion.  Everything about it is immersive, from the extraordinary animations for the alien race leaders you meet, the constant chiming in from your advisors (some of which are voiced by big Hollywood names ... hearing Alan Tudyk as the Psilon advisor just makes me smile every time he speaks up).There is no proper campaign at this point, but plenty of open, free space to play around in, conquer and be conquered in turn.  You can play a game from beginning to end already, through conquest, diplomacy, research, economic might, and several other victory conditions of your choosing.  The game map on Medium or Large is huge, and I know there was some concern that it was only going to contain, at maximum, 100 or so star systems but believe me when I say that at the pace this game plays that is an ideal number.  It feels as grand as games offering thousands of systems to conquer and plays at a more thoughtful pace requiring more attention to detail (unless you automate production and let the game do it for you, which is an entirely viable strategy, focusing your own attentions on matters of military and diplomacy as your governors churn out buildings and units like there's no tomorrow). I had some concerns about the ship design system.  There are still aspects of it not in game, but I will tell you straight away that it lacks the complete customization of a game like the GalCiv series.  You won't be putting together the building blocks or your ship here, choosing from hundreds of hulls and nacelles and fiddly little bits.  But it still manages to be intensely satisfying, with lots of graphical bells and whistles (I especially love the Psilon ship designs which harken to the flying saucer days of 1950s alien conspiracy theories).  I felt no great lack of customization in the end and the polish on these ships outshines much of what players could manage on their own.  I suspect there will be more hull designs to come, more options to choose from, but again it is still Early Access.In short, if you loved the original MOO or MOO2, if Civ5 was your cup o tea, or if you relish getting stuck into the kind of gaming experience that will have you plastered to your PC for hours without a break and every minute of it spent feeling like you ARE the emperor of a burgeoning space-faring race out to charm, deceive, or otherwise conquer all who dare to raise a laser cannon or tachyon beam against you ... this IS the game you've been looking for.For all the supposed successors to Master of Orion that have come and gone over the last 20 years, this is the first one to do it justice since MOO2.  What Wargaming have made is a clear labor of love and it retains enough of what made MOO the father of the 4x genre while blessing it with enough that's new to bring a much-loved franchise into the 21st Century.  Buy it.  NOW.10/10			"

												As a longtime fan of Master of Orion 2, I had, and will have, high hopes for this game, at this time though, it's a frustrating slough through the bugs to get to a good game. The good:The alien races in the game have a loving polish to them, each one has a life to it that is both amazing and imaginative, and the acting talent that was tapped for this did a bang up job.The game is beautiful, more than just an update, there's a streamlined if simplistist look to a lot of the buildings and ships that doesn't detract.The sheer size on the Guardian is definitely appropriate.The Bad - No governors -  noone to run your planets or you fleets for bonuses, as this became more or less a staple of the series since the 2nd game this oversight is glaring.1/2 the races -  holding the topic of weither there was overlap between the old races aside, having a galaxy that diverse with aliens gave more than what's on offer here.Random events -   where are they? having played several games thus far, the only things that seem to occur are the occasional population boom and a random monster sparingly,  which brings me to my next point - No Antarans -  These are THE signature bad guys of the series, the boogie man that puts everyone in the game in check, and they are gone, a footnote to the rest of the game.  Not having this enemy has cut out one of the defining features of this series.  The frustration I will feel if this was held aside to be DLC down the line, I Will pursure a refund, time played be notwithstanding.The Ugly, Want a spacestation that repairs itself after a fight? nope, hope the shields soaked it,Want to see the shield and Health of your ships each fight without reloading the game after one fight? Definitely not here.How about not getting softlocked by the space ameoba because it doesn't actually destroy your ships? sorry, maybe next time.The other alien races are allowed to shoot my scouts down for free, no warning, not at war --- What!?Colony ships too --- ......My fleets as well if I blockade a jump pointall of the above doesn't trigger war either.noncombatant ships are a part of the fights if attached to the fleet ---  I really want to know who signed off on this design choice.Yes, I am giving a lot of flak over these issues, and I feel it's duly deserved because they pushed the game out to full release with these bugs very much in the game and apparent.  A lot of how I would command my fleets in a fight depends on how much damage I see going out versus what I recieve, having to reload the game every time to see this is ridiculous.  The numbers you'll see for damage still appear, but without a total health indicator they offer no idea how well or not your fleet is doing.Finally, if anyone feels I'm making unjust comparions to Master of Orion 2,  This company aquired the license to make this game using the IP, the comparions are I feel fully justified for this reason.tl;dr - can't recommend until the bugs are squashed, and feels like 2/3 a game compared to Master of Orion 2			"

												About the bad reviews: Many bad reviews are from persons who wanted this game to give them the same feelings they had playing the orginal Master of Orion twenty-three years ago and/or Master of Orion 2 twenty years ago.  If you are wise, you know trying to relive the past is a fool's errand. Some complaints in old reviews have been subsequently been addressed by the developer.  For example, the addition of leaders and minor civilizations, and updated espionage and polution management. Complaints about publisher funding continued development of the game through DLC are just plain foolish as they ignore the question: Does the base game provide a complete experience without any DLC?  Yes, it does.The leader animations and voice acting are outstanding - some of the best in any 4x game released to date.  The other visuals, music, sound effects are excellent.The user interface is well designed and easy to navigate with mouse and keyboard.  Most icons have tooltips and it's rare you have to drill down for the information you need.Gameplay (the important stuff): Overall gameplay is a little simpler on average than 4x games such as Galactic Civilizations 2, Endless Space, Civilization 5, and Endless Legend. This allows Master of Orion to be more approachable, but there is depth for vetern players who choose to micromanage and min/max certain aspects of the game.  More on this below. Races: You can build a custom race superior to the built-in races if you design it to fit your playstyle. Reserach: The tech tree is laid out in a traditional horizontal scolling Civilization format, except that many nodes force a choice between two advancments.  While not ground breaking, it's satisfying and allows for different choices on each play through.  Too many nodes focus on military, and not enough advance infrastructure. Colony: You can micromanage population assignments and build queues in each colony or automate it by setting a colony focus and turning on autobuild. Ships: As you research new military techs you can choose to automatically update ship blueprints or completely customize the weapon, defense, engine and special equipment loadouts of each design. Battle: You decide how involved you want to be in battles and how fast you want them to resolve.  For the best result in a close match, you can take control RTS style and command each ship individually.  If you like to enter battle with overwhelming force, you can let the computer call the shots and watch the carnage play out or simply auto-resolve and go back to managing your empire. AI/Diplomacy: No 4x game has satisfying AI opponents, and Master of Orion is no exception.  But the AI is not erratic - most decisions fit the goals they are pursuing - and there is transparency in that mousing over an opponent's disposition bar shows the factors contributing to their relations with you.  One exception - the Meklar - can be erratic; however, since the word is part of their race description, it may be by design. Minor Civilizations can have a significant impact.  They don't spread from their home planet, but offer bonuses to other planets you colonize in their system if you pay to influence them.  For example, I colonized two planets in a system with a minor civilization specializing in farming.  These planets quickly became my fastest growing as the minor civ provided all the food they needed while they focused on resesarch and production. Trade: Sadly, almost non-existant.  You can establish highly profitable trade treaties with other civiliations, but there are no trade ships plying the star lines. Random events, such as space monsters, and periods of research or economic boom or bust, seem to be direct copies from MOO2.  Artifacts spread through the galaxy can be investiaged by your ships, but so far these have mundane results, earning a few credits or a random ship. The timeline graph found in many 4x games, to show your progress in comparison to other civilizations, has a very cool feature in Master of Orion.  You can use it to go back to any turn in the game.  Made a huge mistake and forgot to save?  No problem, click any turn on the timeline to start again from that point.For almost a year now, the developer has deployed patches every two weeks on average, including fixes, balance changes, and free new content.  That is an outstanding level of continued support and development.Master of Orion is worth the purchase price of $30, and on sale it's a bargain.  It has the flavor of the original Master of Orion games, but doesn't try to recreate the past.  It's easy to jump into, with additional depth for those who want it.			"

Early Access Review
Master of Orion is a shallow experience.Here's the TL;DR of my lengthy review as of the latest patch (4/23/16): Although it is in Early Access and most developers and fans will insist there's time for change, the game's core mechanics seem finalized, and it is those core mechanics that are deeply flawed, making for an unsatisfying, unoriginal, and poorly executed experience. Unless you are a casual player, I do not recommend this game.If you're still reading, you're probably curious to know why I feel this way. Let's start with what I think those core mechanics are, and what makes them deeply flawed. There are three, and you've seen them before in other, better games: Planetary management Research CombatI don't believe diplomacy is a core mechanic, and I am fairly confident it will never become one, as spending just a few minutes in-game will show you how easy it is to abuse negotiations, and how illogical--and obnoxious--the AI is; in every match I've played (single/multiplayer) the AI demands credits from me, regardless of our relationship or my behavior, and if I fail to appease them, war is soon declared. If you've played even a handful of other 4x titles, this should sound quite familiar.PLANETARY MANAGEMENTPlanetary management consists of dragging and dropping colonists across three lines of resources: research, food, and production. The resources earned every turn depend on the planet type and the planet's modifiers (mostly positive, and a few negative), mid/late-game research, and specialized buildings, but consecutive colonists in a line provide diminished returns on resources. At a glance, it might seem worth it to distribute your colonists in a balanced fashion, but as a resource, food is overwhelmingly powerful, and as the research tree is terrible (technologies impact your empire in a lopsided manner) there's almost no reason to ever assign colonists to research over food or production.Food is overwhelmingly powerful.The turns needed to produce new colonists from food are on a relatively linear curve, meaning that the sooner you start massing food, the sooner you cap out your colonists. There is no ""soft"" cap on your colonists, only a maximum that the planet can support; you'd think that certain buildings would be required to steadily increase how many colonists you can sustain and provide for--especially on inhospitable planets--but the developers opted instead to determine that ""hard"" cap from a planet's size, not from it's structures, and reduce the available food on those inhospitable planets. This means that it is still desirable to colonize small worlds; in other games, small worlds are undesirable, as many turns/credits are needed to build/buyout structures which increase the population cap. Terraforming a world can increase the maximum colonists that it can support, and a handful of late-game technologies can be researched that also increase this maximum (it is important to note that these technologies apply to all of your worlds), but the turns needed for these two things are substantial, and typically the game is decisive by the time they're available to you.The only reason a player might be inclined to not mass food is the dimishing return, but this penalty is minor, and unless it is tuned to become quite severe, it will remain irrelevant. Immediately prioritizing food will make your worlds much, much stronger in far fewer turns than opponents who do not. Some of you might be saying that I am mistaken, that prioritizing food means you're sacrificing something critical elsewhere, like system defenses or ships, but considering the poor design choice of star lanes and scanners (structures that reveal incoming ships), you have potentially dozens of turns to adjust your production in response to threats. And since you will be earning more credits per turn than otherwise, you can afford more and earlier buyouts.If structures were required to increase the cap on your colonists and/or they tuned the diminishing return on food, it could allow for more diverse gameplay. Unfortunately, that is unlikely to happen, as the bulk of gameplay is tied to what you research, and as I said earlier, the research tree is terrible.RESEARCHThe research tree is terrible.The majority of it feels required, not optional, leaving little room for experimentation or alternate strategies. There's a clear meta. This problem is compounded by the incredible number of prerequisites required for each successive research.You replace newly unlocked technologies--particularly for ships--with even newer ones before the effects of the former are even felt; it is possible to have your newest ships become nearly obsolete after only a handful of turns. Considering how long it can take ships to travel across your controlled systems, they're unlikely to even see combat before becoming obsolete. This happens constantly throughout all stages of the game, and keep in mind that I never prioritize research; I unlock technologies at a slower rate than was intended.Few technologies feel satisfying. The developers had some technologies that were binary; you chose one or the other, and that was it. In the most recent patch, the developers changed a substantial number of technologies to binary. This would be an issue if not for the fact that you can get an upgraded version the technology you did not select in the very next research, making that previous choice completely pointless. This happens constantly throughout the research tree.Outside of structures that modify your resources, the bulk of what you earn from the research tree feels underpowered. This is constrasted by extremely overpowered technologies scattered in the tree, like the battle pods, or an empire-wide reduction in the production needed for structures and ships. Some technologies should require a minimum number of research-oriented structures before they can be unlocked--at least then I'd be penalized for not focusing on it, and players who do feel satisfied when they're given those overpowered technologies.COMBATSpace battles are attrition-based and entirely unengaging, and the AI controling your ships (enabled by default) is atrocious.This is how a battle begins: each fleet deploys on the far side of a randomly generated field. There is often debris, like asteroids, in the field. When you un-pause (battles are paused by default), your ships immediately move towards the enemy fleet, regardless of their equipped weaponry, and they immediately fire any weapons that are in range. I have watched so many battles (spectating combat is only available in singleplayer) where a salvo of missiles fly right into an asteroid. Fire that gunner, please. If that doesn't happen, the salvo destroys an enemy ship. Because missiles have the longest range of any weapon, the first salvo effectively determines the battle. Fully armed, every generation of ships I produce equipped with missiles is guaranteed to destroy at least two enemy ships. There is no reason to equip any other kind of weaponry, especially when you unlock a ""special"" for your ship that gives missiles secondary targets. Point defenses and weapon modifiers that take up more space within your ships are either unimplemented or a waste; and even if they were neither of those two things, the AI that brings your ships into what is basically melee range completely removes any advantages they might offer. Why do my missiles need more speed or armor when they're being fired point-blank? Why does my ship move into melee range in the first place? I don't have enough characters to further explain the other lacking aspects of this game.			"

Early Access Review
								Currently not impressed. At this current time the developer refuses to tell buyers if there will be tactical combat for multiplayer games or even custom races allowed in multiplayer. Worse, if your friend buys the game off a different retailer they cannot play with you, both have to use the same source (Steam/GOG). Granted tactical combat is just pathetic, you have very limited control and the maps will have  nebulae and asteroids at random times with no relation to the system you are fighting in.  For a game out of beta and into its fourth Early Access it is dreadfully buggy to the point the developers had to remove features they could not get to work. Their AI skills are so pathetic that the pirate faction in this game whose tech never improves will completely befuddle the AI opponents. The Technology tree is very unimaginative with a number of higher tier technologies that cost more to use than lower tier with similar or actually lower reward. The ship customization is so constrained as to remove much of the flavor long time players of MOO2 associate with the title. Then to top it off with a tactical combat engine that makes it near impossible to determine what you are fighting and how well your designs really are. Oh, may of the weapon modifications still don't work but the developer will never tell you which as even they don't know.However the worst feature of the game is galaxy generation. While you can set your own random seed you will find a galaxy generator that cannot even offer real balanced starting conditions when told to do so. Even in huge galaxies you are just as likely to start one  star system away from an opponent or six. Worse, it is almost guaranteed that two or more opponents will share adjacent systems at start instantly eliminating those  AI opponents as effective.tl;dr This not WarGamings best effort, while better than World of Warplanes its evident the programming team they hired out of Argentina has neither skill nor discipline in bringing such a storied franchise to life properly			"

Early Access Review
								***tl;dr ***Wait for the full release. Game is unfinished, unbalanced and too easy at the moment. Buy only if you A) Want to support the developers or B) Want to experience all the patches that will come untill release. At this time the game will give you about 10 hours of fun before you will realize that it needs to be finished to give you about 100+ more. It plays well though and I like it a lot.*** See the bottom for updates. ***First impressions from Early access, review will follow when the game will be released.If you cannot bare bugs, strange behavior and missing depth to some parts of the game elements then DO NOT buy this game yet, except you would want to support the developers.If you are a 4X fan in general:* This game is a lot like Endless space when it started, but has a lot more potential. The tactical combat mainly is going to be better in my opinion due to the possibility to control the ships. The production values overall are higher.* Game lacks depth at the moment which is coming in few months I hope but is very well playable now. I will repeat myself here; the game is very similar to how the Endless space was at launch.* The art and voice overs are TOP quality. Music reminds me a lot of Star Trek for some reason.* Graphics are OK for a 4X game but in my opinion the ship models could use some work, especially at the strategic layer.* If you want to experience full depth and engaging game from the start then you should wait a bit... I suppose the game will be feature full in the summer.* Strategic game is turn based and tactical combat is RT with pause.* Map options are limited at the moment. Map size, difficulty and number of races mainly.* If you like 4x games in general then you will most probably like this game too. The gameplay is fluid and quite fast, no HC micromanagements at the moment.If you are core MOO fan and ""old school gamer"":* If you are expecting a graphically updated MOO 2 then you will be disapointed. This game is going to be a bit different. This is in no way a clone of the old MOO games. It uses the same basic structure but the feel to it is not the same.* Game is not finished; you can see it mainly in tactical combat which is lacking a lot. And the combat is not turn based (maybe it will change?).* Research and race stats are done differently than in MOO2.* No NPCs yet.* The voice overs can be a bit annoying if they will not fit your ""expectations"" from how you have imagined them in MOO2 for example.* This game is, in my opinion, for new generation of players. It will have a lot in common with MOO2 but will never be the same...I like how the game is looking now and what potential it has so I recommend it in general but be careful here. Even though it fits my ""needs"", it may not fit yours. Do a bit of research and watch a lets play on youtube first.*** Updates: ***10 hours inSo after playing a bit I've found following things that will be worked on most before the release, or at least I hope so.* Espionage is missing at the moment, but the foundations are there. You can build and research upgrades for your spies.* Ground combat is a placeholder at the moment. No armies battling at the moment, only simple explosion animations.* Tactical combat is a bit better than ground combat but it's still a place holder too.* No story at the moment as far as I can tell.* Races are not complete, the racial stats are too simple at the moment to be considered finished.* No race specific tech at the moment.*** Developers update about upcoming changes in Early access: ***Some of the features that will be added during other Stages of EA.More Playable RacesCustom RacesEspionageNew victory conditionsMinor Races / Independent planets Linux and Mac SupportSome of the features that we will improve are:MultiplayerShip DesignTactical BattlesThe tutorialThe Galaxy generationBalance in general*** Early access phase 2 update ***A lot of thinks added, fixed, adjusted, but still a lot is missing. Game is still suffering from missing key features like espionage, better research tree and rase diversity.			"

Early Access Review
								First mini-review after almost 2 hours playing:+Stable+Beautiful (playing at 1980 and all ultra settings)->i mean 1920x1080 lol+About 80 techs already in+TV news system to tell you about universe achievements and scores+No major bugs until now (just a minor bug when creating designs, but you can create it without problems, it's just text related)+Copy from past MOO lore-Realtime battles (just my opinion, i prefer turn based although you can pause the battle here) -No leaders/governors as in MOO2-Seems there is only 1 universal type of government-It lacks a lot of info popups and a tutorialBut this is EA (Early Access), so except for the realtime battles, the rest can be added and polished. Until now, a very good experience and a game that is so stable that seems already finished (if you don't look at those missing features i talked about, ofc)Really impressed, for now. I will update this after more hours played and more exploration done.			"

												I have stayed away from EA not to have a biased oppinion or find out too much about the game as space 4X are all about discovery.  Master of Orion gets a tough job due to its name - it has to live up to the legacy of its predecessors.  Many people will tell you it doesn't, I personally do not care if it does.It is a good space 4X game, it is nowhere as complex as grand strategy Stellaris or Distant Universe but it is more simplified somewhere between Galactic Civs and Stardrive.  Much more fun to play than gal civs (and I love the series) and much more polished than Stardrive.It is a LOT of fun to play and it is easy to get into for new players.  It also has a lot of stuff voiced which is a plus for me as I get to play in the evenings when I am fairly tired and reading full pages of flavor text can be a bit much.Overall very solid space 4x with enjoyable graphics and artwork.  As long as it gets patched and gets additional content over time it will give you hours upon hours of fun!			"

												This is a great game! But this is whats starting to bother me.The game is not finished... And they are already launching payed for DLC that is putting CORE elements of the old games in there REBOOT game. Why is it that you are making us pay for races that were already IN the old games.IF you are going to do a reboot of an old game DO THAT. The point of doing a beta release is to test and build on your games development untill its a finished product.Then after that you do DLC for NEW content like for instance i want to charge $20 for the 3 NEW Races the Tescerites, Gandromines, and the Yatgaris.NOT GIVE US MORE MONEY for things that were in moo2 moo3 ore moo1.

Product received for free
Early Access Review
Early Access ReviewGood Evening all --So, I received this game from my brother as a birthday gift, and he wanted me to review and advise on what I thought of it, so here goes...So, now I've logged over 100+ Hours logged into this game...I have played MoO 1, 2, and 3, and now here I am playing the reboot of Master of Orion, a well loved franchise.Let me first preface this by stating that in my opinion, ANY developer that takes up the title of a well-loved franchise like this has to have some serious guts.Immediately - when a developer takes up something like this, they are fighting an uphill battle.  This is because that the fans and community of such a game will immediately set the bar ridiculously high for the developer.  I guarantee that the developer will never, ever meet those ridiculous expectations, but they can try really hard.That said - I think this game is a perfect example of the above.The Good --Graphics are goodShip Scaling - Titans and Doomstars are actually Big, same goes for Space Monsters and the Guardian.I like the that the Races actually play up to their strengths and weaknesses.Races are also fairly diverse in cultures.Tactical Fleet Combat - Ok people like to bash this, but hear me out.  I actually like the fact that you need to balance big ships and small ships, and cannot just roflestomp everything with the biggest, baddest ships in the game.  You need to have your small ships take out the enemy small ships and soften up the big targets so your big ships can open up.Star Lanes (Really) - Ok, another favorite for folks to bash - not so with me.  So, basically I like the idea of the Star Lanes because it adds a tactical element to Stellar Navigation which you can use to your advantage, or be used against you if you aren't careful, such as dropping an Advances Military Outpost right in a major thoroughfare.  Star Navigation actually matters with this element, and is more than just how fast you can go from system to system.The UI Interface is much more smooth than previous iterations of the game  and streamlined.Not a bad start to an Early Access Game - a good foundation has been built, even if it has to be developed more.The Bad --Tech Trees are not as developed as they could be.  (Why do I go from Class I Shield to a Class III, whatever happened to Class II?)Diplomacy is a joke.  The AI basically just takes advantage of you and doesn't do any give and take - just take take take, which also makes the ""Diplomatic Victory"" condition basically a joke.Minor Civilizations - Good in concept, but not playing well with the AI - all they do is plow through them and destroy them to get to your civilization.Ascension Victory is waaaaaay too easy even for the most basic AI to do.  Basically unless you floor your Research, or are a complete warmonger, you will automatically lose every single game as long as you have this victory condition active.Ship Design is good, but not robust enough.  I liked the flexibility of MoO2 on this one.  Give us more options.Would like to see more diverse ship designs within a race - 2 variants of hull design is a bit limiting.Tactical Combat has asteroids and nebula, but they are small and easy to avoid, or sparse.Give me more Stars!  Even the Huge Galaxy is a bit on the small size.In Conclusion, I believe that this is actually a good game, but an incomplete one.  You'd think it was early access or something. :)  I believe that honestly, people are a little too hard on this game because development is trying to continue the legacy of a well-loved and famous franchise, and even taking their name.  Give them a chance folks!I do agree however, that it's a bit overpriced for what you get right now.  However, I think that they have built a very good foundation with this game and hope they do more with it, and listen to their community.Hopefully you find this useful, it's my first review ever, so I hope I made it a good one.See you later, keep on gaming!

												EDIT: MoO was given to NGD studios which had no experience in making 4X strategy games. And then they left 2 month ago leaving behind an unfinished game.It is not only the total failure of space combat which I discovered first, there are zilliion of things, from missing informaton about own units, huge balance issues, bugs bugs bugs, and an AI who is totally sucking. NGD tried to learn along the way of making their first 4X game but when Victor Kislyi pulled the plug ... everything left ever since in the state. This game should still be early access. When I am playing MoO I discover so many issues, that I spend much more time in the forum reporting and describing issues and looking for a solution fo them. Leaning back and enjoy a game is something different...The game has a great awesome potential but in the present state I can *not* recommend this game.There are heavy issues (quasi non-existing multiplayer, bad game design aspects which lead that you have to colonize a lot of small planets rather than a few large planets and therefore you lose yourself in mid and end game in too much colonies with too much details instead of having only a few strong planets and clear overview and your head free to think about strategy and decisions instead of doing tons of micromanagmentg - examples for that: growth penalty on large and huge planet and pollution penalty on large and huge planets with big population and strong industry - many small planets with in summary same strong industry suffer not the same pollution penalty, then bugs bugs bugs, a ton of heavy balance issues resp. AI stupidity - even on the hardest difficulty you beat the AI at first attempt, and the developers from NGD studos have abandoned the game, not a word from them and from Wargaming (who has the intellectual property of MoO)  since two months.One of the big things is the TOTAL FAILURE OF SPACE COMBAT: The AI is not shooting back if you keep your distance: With a weak ship you can destroy much bigger KI fleets: You use missiles and the AI only uses beam weapons (which have a shorter range).  If you keep your distance you can fire missile after missile after missile while the KI fleet does not fire a single shot back - simply because ther weapons are out of range and they dont build fast ships to quickly bridge the distance.You dont have to research and build good ships and weapons and shields, armor etc. and build huge armies, if a single weak ship with some lousy missiles is enough to win vs KI even on the hardest difficulty.THIS IS A TOTAL DEAL BREAKER!Furthermore there is no up-to-date manual and apart from the new stuff in the outdated manual even many of the older things are not explained e.g. that population on small planets growth faster (that is a pretty important thing which you might easily miss to discover if you don't know it), how armor penetration and armor resilience is working (these two terms are in the short tutorial - but missing in the manual), how ground combat is working, etc.THE GAME HAS A GREAT POTENTIAL  - IF ONLY IT WOULD BE USED BY SOME CARING DEVELOPERS.Basically we paid for the game and now it is up to us to fix it. If you did not buy the game I would check back in half a year, because there are many things you can not just mod, in order to improve those things you have to change the code. And btw I don't like the idea that you first have to do your bachelor in MoO and install a ton of mods before you can enjoy your gameShould the developers ever come back and fix the space combat system and the other things then I will write a new review.BTW: The space combat is in real time though the game is round based. that alone is strange,  but I could forgive it if only it would work with an AI who is able to shoot back in a space battle. There is a guy who writes one game fix mod after another - but the devs do not even apply these fixes in a new version. It is beyond me how you can willingly keep some known bugs for which even a resolution have been found. This mindset of publisher and developers I can not understand.			"

												It's a pity, but I simply can't recommend it in it's current state. And frankly speaking I'm really dissapointed.Pro:Nice graphicExcellent voice actingIt's MoO :(Cons:Really dull and shallow combat model. Tactical combat was almost the major part of the original MoO2Ship constructor is almost useless due to shallow combatsStupid AI. Some challenge only at Very Hard mode and mostly due to AI cheats.Exploring is dull too. To little possible and unique bonuses. No experience for ships and spies. No governers. There is almost no sense to colonise system with a lot of planets.  No fleet commanders <--added with patch. Though in Endless Space its made betterLags...Just one autosave....No quick saveCan't skip turns without giving ordersNeutral:Lanes. I liked the idea of lanes and blockades. It may add some depthPollution system. Well, it make some sense. But it adds more pain than fun cause it's very hard to prognose what pollution effect will be in next 20 turns.  -- patchedConclusion:Shallow and worse copy of MoO2. After 20+ YEARS of gamedev evolution what we have.... better graphics and voice acting? Really? Endless space is much better. Even with dull combats			"

Early Access Review
								This is a review as of April 3rd where the game remains in Early Access.Master of Orion is a game that deliveres on most, though not all, of the promises that the title makes. No one needs to hear about the 4x mechanics and there are few surprises in the MOO reboot.But a 4x game can be implemented in many different ways, so I'll try to explain what directions the game designers have gone on a couple of key-pointsI go on and on about this things, so here's a summery with scores on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the highest :)Complexity: 4 (Fairly simple)Graphics: 8 (beautiful and functional)Sound: 7 (Quietly immersive)Originality: 2 (Not nuch in the way of innovation)Conclusion: if you're a fan of the 4x genre, and you like games to be simple enough that you don't have to read a 2000 page wiki before playing, then this might well be a game for you. If you're a fan of the MOO franchise and you can get past the fact that there's no turn-based combat, then you won't be dissapointed.If you used to play MOO2 in hotseat mode with a friend and you're looking to relive those times you will however be disapointed. Hotseat not implemented :(If you wanna check out some videos, I've recorded my first playthough here.https://youtu.be/CRbn8LasCoE?list=PLMCa1UUnJ90XfhIWsnnrFBuiJh-LXxhuJAnd then the wall of text...Master of Orion is (at least in the Early Access version) a fairly simple 4x game. This is not neccesarily an inherently good or bad characteristic, as it depends on what kind on game experience you're after.When I say 'complex' I'm thinking about the number of mechanics, or choices that the player has to consider at game start, or thoughout the game. A complex 4x game offer lots of choices at game start, normally in terms of which side to play and certain start conditions, as well as numerous dicisions throughout the game than often are irreversible.Other factors include 'mini-game' mechanics such as tactical combat.MOO has plenty of mechanics, but they aren't particularly deep. For example, you can choose your race or create a custom race using a pointsystem, but the amount of diversity is fairly small and I found that I'm able to play the game in pretty much the same way regardless of my pick. I'd compare the race selection to that of Civ5, where your civilization give you a small advantage in a given field. An example of a complex 4x game would be Age of Wonders 3, where the choices of class, race and speciallities are much more important to the kind of game you can subsequently play.It also has tactical combat (not turn based to the lament of many die-hard MOO fans), but the choices you make do not have a huge impact on the eventual outcome. To be fair, I think tactical combat is something that will receive a lot of attention as the game developes - I'll update this review, when that happens). The game DOES have tactical combat, and it is posible to enhance the outcomes of battles if only slightly, so this aspect is certainly more advanced than civ5 to make that comparision again, where combat is pseudo-strategic but it's nowhere near as important as it is in games that focus more heavily on the strategic aspects, like the HOMM series for example. On the other hand units in MOO who fight, do not gain XP (as they do in Civ5 and most other modern 4x games). This makes losses from combat a matter of economy only - not emotional to any great extent.The Tech tree in MOO is very, very standard, and something we've seen a thousand times. A linear progression of techs from left to right with pre-requisite techs being needed to start research. The thing that made and makes MOO a little different is, that some techs are muturally exclusive, meaing you get to choose between two techs. This is great, but since you can obtain the 'other' tech later through diplomacy, the choice becomes a little irrellevant. I'd have preferred more choices that was FINAL... The tech-tree complexity is only present if you've never played 4x games before :)Planet and millitary buildup is a function of the tech tree, and it is equally simple. Planet structures are unlocked by tech and usually improve either, resources, research, food, or currency either directly or inderectly. Other buildings improve morale  or planetary defences but there aren't THAT many structures in total, and although each building incur an upkeep cost, you'll want to build most builings in every colony. This makes the developement of colonies a somewhat trivial decision process, that you end up automating, either my muscle memory of allowing the AI to handle it. More complex games add dimensions to colony/city/castle developement by putting a cap on how many improvements of a given type you can maintain in your empire or implement some sort of diminishing return. in the 'central star system with multiple planetary colonies' structure that MOO uses, it would be nice to have some structures that improved a given thing (like research in the whole system). The part of the game that offers the highest level of (potential) complexity is ship design. You can create your own version of a given ship-class (frigate, destroyer, cruiser etc.) up to some pretty ridiculous ship sizes. All very cool! This offers the promise of a mechanic, where a clever player might exploit weaknesses in an opposing player's ship design (too heavy on the missiles maybe?) to exploit and defeat. As of right not the ship design feature still feels a little incomplete and you can't review the designs of your oppsing players, even though you've met them in combat. That, in combination with the unfinished tacticat combat makes this a mechanic of great potential complexity. but not quite there just yet.Moving away from the gameplay I'll briefly say a little about the 'wrappings'. A little unfair maybe, for the game is drop dead gorgeous and the music and sound effecs have yet to annoy me.All colonizing is preceeded by a cutscene showing your colonyship landing on the pristine planet, while all space combat shows the opposin fleets warping in. Very cool stuff, in you're into that kind of thing. I don't spend a lot of time reveiwing  this sort of thing in a 4x game as I usually end up skipping them quite quickly, but there's no denying that the game looks beautiful, and not just in the cutscenes.There's a pretty good VO on your various tech advisors and good sound effects on the weaponsystems etc. No complaints there!Finally in terms of originality, I have to say that MOO bring very little to the party that we haven't seen before. This is a reboot of the MOO series and it seems like the developement of the game has been focused on NOT to repeat the mistakes of MOO3 (which I didn't play so I can't tell you if they succeeded). But it means that you're not gonna find a whole new take on the 4x genre here - you're gonna find a game that you can by, install, start and be playing in no time at all, with a very flat learning curve.

Early Access Review
								At this point, I cannot recommend this game. It might be an okay 4X game, but it is not a good Master of Orion title.Positives:+Looks cool+Stable (No crashes)+Good voice actingIn essence, the game looks very pretty and sounds very cool. Many of the voices actors were immediately recognizable, and they do a fairly good job over all. The GNN skits get a little annoying after a while, so I usually just skip them now. They are too time-consuming. The graphics are great and the animations are wonderful. Lastly, it isn't a broken piece of junk like Master of Orion 3 was. The main bugs I have seen have been UI and text-related. This seems to be where they spent their resources.So, on these merits, it is already better than Master of Orion 3 was. That is a very low bar, though.Negatives:-No Turned Based Combat-Excessively Small ""Battle Maps""-Broken Diplomacy-Temporary Treaties-Bad AI-Restricted Customization-Generalization-No Leaders-Star LanesThe game is at the very core, nothing like its predecessors. I know many people who will not buy this simply because it is no longer turn based. I'm hoping that the battle maps can be made larger, or possibly scalable, but I did not see this. Also, the AI is terrible. It will decide to fly directly into and attempt to shoot through asteroids, as an example.Diplomacy is now completely and utterly broken. You essentially have to hand over all your money, all of your revenue, give them a technology, and hand over one of your colonies, in order to obtain a non-aggression pact. I can't fathom what it would take to secure an alliance. This was as a race with ""+25% Diplomacy"", as well. So, I don't think that the system is working at all.Oh, and if you happen to get ahead in technology, the AI will simply demand you give them the technology you worked so hard for. Not even an exchange. Refusal pisses them off, and you cannot edit the ""deal"". Either give me technology, or I get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at you. Great system.Remember how treaties used to work? Both sides initially lose money, but over time the ""trade"" or ""research"" treaty would add to your revenue? Nope. Temporary. Basically, you gain nothing for a number of turns. Then, out of the blue, ""Yay! Get 348 BC!"". The treaty is then TERMINATED, and requires renegotiating. That is now a treaty.While you CAN still customize all of the weapons on your ships, there are less customization options. Also, the ""System"" part of ship customization has been turned into ""slots"" or ""modules"". And yes, they put anti-missle rockets here. I don't understand why.What I mean by ""Generalization"" is that there is a lot less specialization in the game. The races used to be extremely diverse, and had completely different playstyles. Not anymore. I know that ""custom race"" is coming, but the base races are so very similar that I don't expect too much from this right now.This one is easy. Just add in Leaders.Star lanes? Really? This one was completely unexpected. You move around by moving to the ""warp points"" inside of a star system, and then can ""warp"" to predetermined systems adjacent to your current system. Want to get to a system ""south"" of where you are? No Star Lane, no way. Gotta take the long way around.Conclusion:This game has been massively simplified, and bears very little resemblance to the classics. If you are a die hard MoO 2 fan, don't pick this up. If you are, however, a fan of games like Civilization 5, this may work for you. It has been streamlined into, essentially, a space Civ 5 game with cool-looking battles. Oh, and famous voice actors.

Early Access Review
								Review based on 32+ hours of gameplay. Will update review as patches are released.Pros:As a long time fan of the series, this is a VERY welcome reboot of the series. I've played several short games to get a feel for the game, have an ongoing multiplayer game going with a friend around turn 250, and have completed a large 6 race game with the Psilons achieving every tech (was gaining 3000 tech a turn by the end), 24 colonies, 519 population, 646k credits, 1.3 million conquest, 1.14 million excellence, claimed Orion for my own, and after all the other races declared war on me I wiped them off the face of the galaxy by turn 448. Around turn 300 I was already insanely powerful (power through great technology) and could almost vote myself the supreme leader, but chose not to.It feels a lot like MOO2 with a lot of nice new UI features like improved menus, empire management, game summary, etc. Below I'm going to say a lot of things to be aware of or cons to the game, but really the game has a lot going for it, namely it's a VERY good reboot of the game and while it's still missing a lot, it has placeholders to show it plans on implimenting everything we'd expect and then some. I kinda miss the old MOO2 theme music (listening to it right now while writing the reivew), but I like the new soundtrack as well. Graphics are what you're epxect out of a game these days. The game feels a lot like the things I love about MOO. There are a lot of cool newer features like improvements to notifications, but I wish they could add a little bit of customization to them. Also really like the space factories element to the game. Just learned a new feature, if you goto the summary screen you can litterly got back to any turn in the past. You can click on the timeline graph and go back to a previous turn which means the save game remembers EVERYTHING that happened in every turn.Things to be aware of with early access:A lot of systems are not yet or BARELY implimented. Mainly the space combat (just hit simulate because tactical is poop atm), spying, dimplomacy in general needs to be improved, racial traits, AI difficulties, starting tech levels, ship customization (it's there but missing a lot of it's expected depth), half of the planned races, and everyon's favorite: custom race. A lot of the tooltips in the game are not very clear what those things do or even if they are fully implimented right now. The tech tree is flushed out but the UI needs some polish.There are various minor weird UI bugs including hangs and the occasional crash. Thankfully the game autosaves every turn. There are some pretty annoying bugs for example the game insists that Neutron Blaster is stronger than the Mass Driver). Multiplayer works, but can be a little weird when you are loading a previous multiplayer game. Also the invite friends feature doesn't work, your friends just need to join your game.The voice acting is good, but sitll needs work, obviously that's finishing polish stuff for launch. A lot of times the text of what the voice acting is supposed to be saying doesn't match what is said likely only part of the script has been recorded / integrated or they want to limit the download for early access. Some of the characters you start to just hate how they talk to you (unless you're overwhelmingly powerful then they cower and lick your boots which actually is kinda awesome). Overall how the races react to you can largely be improved.Cons:No Elarians planned for launch. The Elarians smell like expansion fodder. No Gnolmans or Trilarians either, but no great loss there. Don't like that they are tying a ""new"" alternate human / pirate faction to the collectors edition but honestly, who cares since if you buy it now you're getting the ""collectors edition"" at like normal release price.It's REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING ANNOYING when picking a race and trying to read the racial traits having to listen to the narrator. Also I miss the old feature where if there was nothing notable happening (everything is queued up etc) then the turn auto passes to the next turn. I wish they would allow me to customize my auto build order.There seems to be a lot less planets per solar system from what I remember from older MOO games. I wish there where more planets. Also I miss the inter-solar system colonization vs colonly ship. Maybe it's something that's less important since everyone is post warp. If they add in pre-warp age that becomes more important.Summary:I might be a fan boy of the series, but it seems pretty damn good for early access and I'm glad they did do early access so I can give my feedback. If you've apprehensive about the game, wait closer to launch. I know I will probably binge on the game for a while then dial back until patches come out and try out the new features.			"

Early Access Review
								Finished a complete match before posting this review, to give the game a fair assessment,Pros:+ Feels like Master of Orion+ Planets are easy to manage+ Multiple ways to win+ Hybrid tech tree.  Most techs advance like your standard 4x (think Civ), but a few techs are old school MoO (you only get to pick one choice and the others can't be researched).  It is a good balance.+ Stunning graphics+ Excellent Voiceovers+ Addictively fun+ Ship customization is greatEarly Access Issues- A few minor bugs.  Ship naming bug, some dialogue doesn't sync to text, occasional frame stutter- Espionage isn't in yet- Only 6 of the 10-12 races are playable currently- Only one AI difficulty at the momentCons- No ground combat visuals, its just numbers- Space Battles are Real Time, which isn't an issue, but there are no combat options other than selecting units and clicking enemies.  Needs some options like hold range, engage, retreat, etc.- Races aren't too distinct when it comes to gameplay, bonuses are minor.- Diplomacy is a little dryOverall, in its current state the game is a 7/10.  Based just on what the Developer plans to add, it will be at least an 8/10 if it all gets in.  If combat gets tweaked and just a few more controls are added, this game could be amazing.			"

												After 74.5 hours of playing (also hours more during the early access stage) I can say that MoO is a mediocre 4x game. It mimics most of the features of its legendary ancestor (MoO 2)I am sad to give a negative review for this game. It is certainly playable and you'll have fun with it. But for a 2016 game, I honestly expected much more... Here is a list of pros/cons.Pros:1. Excellent cinematics and voice acting. 2. Good language support.3. Graphically well designed races, race animations, in game research assistants.4. Fluent game play.Cons:1. Repetitive technology tree. Too few creative weapons or technologies. Most of higher tech nodes in the tech tree just replicate the early nodes by just improving parameters. +1 production buildings become +2, x damage weapons become 2x damage weapons and so so. In some tech tree nodes you can decide from 2-3 different technologies but the better tech is in most cases obvious.2. Although the races are parametrically different (some get bonus to diplomacy, some have better spy mission success chances, some have better ground troops etc.). They all share the same technology tree without a single variation. This makes the game very dull and uninteresting.3. The game is very uneventful. Unless you provoke the AI (by colonizing near their systems) you can be in good terms with all AI races for the entire game. The AI does not challenge you. No random events that may cause a political crisis between your race and some other AI race occur.4. The AI is not smart. They do not colonize the choke points systems to protect their borders. They do not make clever attacks or defense. They just throw whatever they have towards you (2-3 fleets at most) and once you deal with em they are left completely defenseless and broken. 5. As with almost all 4x games, harder AI does not mean smarter AI but rather cheating AI.6. There are no strategically important bread and butter resources in the game. The game needs resources that would end alliances. Resources that will cause every race in the galaxy hunger for them and eventually cause galaxy wide wars. Resources which will enable you to unlock technologies, build buildings and new ship hulls etc.  7. Governing complexity is not scalable. After you acquire 10 or more planets you'll quickly realize this. There is no abstraction method in MoO (such as Stellarsis' sector governing) which will enable you to govern huge empires.8. I do not understand why the number of different ship classes you can design is limitted. I might be ok with a limit (like 20-30) but 5-6 designs? Seriously? Why?9. Some annoying bugs which should have been solved in early access at least a year ago. For instance you cannot save your keyboard mapping if you change it. Everytime you enter the game you have to change key mappings again and again. Also the game may lock up or crash after long lasting space battles.			"

Early Access Review
								edit: Regarding the latest news of their decision to release this without further EA development cycles, I'm very much on the fence regarding Recommend vs Not Recommend.---This game finally feels like it's coming into it's own.But good news and bad, i'll do bad first.There are things I wish had been done differently. I wish hotseat was a thing, tactical combat for multplayer, (in fact maybe a more clunky and turn-based tactical combat too). The entire combat arena feels off, (moo3's was better and thats never a good thing to have to say).  I like a bit more of a dark tone, I feel like this is a bit too cartoony.  I miss leaders, they are a small layer of customization to a game that adds immersion and rp. Speaking of RP, I feel like the space could be bigger and have more lore things going on in it. And how about more events? Where are the Antarans or whatever new big bad? Are minor races coming back? All of these things are great and more space (real estate) is needed in this game to allow a verdant RP environment.And then you have the generic performance issues they're still ironing out, UI improvements needed, etc. BUT, this is a beta. And is important to remember. While most shortcomings will probably make it to launch they have made some moderate steps towards making this a pretty darn good game. I enjoy making my way through early-mid game and the tech tree, it looks fantastic, I DO like the voice acting very much (even you Lt. Barclay). The sounds are all there, the music. The videos of landing your colony ships is gold. I'd like to see more of them, maybe even a colony overview screen where it pans the area (it would be nice to actually SEE my cavernous/grassland/inferno planet) in a  similar video fashion.There's a lot of good to find inside this game. Wargaming has a lot of potential here to go even higher if they want. Or maybe they'll start development on 'Moo 2...2'  and build perfection overtop 'pretty-darn-good'In it's beta state i give this a 6.7/10 crystal ball looks like a 7-7.5/10 for release.			"

								This is a great game, and the first to give the Master of Orion feeling since Moo2.There are some details that arent the best, like you could have some more control in tactical battles, and the AI isn't always the smartest, but In my opinion it is a very good game and with very few flaws to be an early access game.I do hope they improve AI and diplomacy a bit, but I like this game.

												Speaking as an old school MoO fan,  having played all of the originals at release... This game is a pale shadow of any of them.  They dumbed down ship design and combat, made it boring and pointless (two of the biggest factors that made the previous one's so great).  They implemented a space lanes only model, which I'm not againts space lanes, but they should have done something to allow for other ways to play the game.  Look at Stellaris as an example where you choose your FTL method which then determines your method of travel through the galaxy.  MoO 1&2 did not even have space lanes either, so not sure why thats the only option in this game.Graphics are nice overall, a bit on the cartoony side for my tastes, but not something that would prevent me from buying and/or enjoying the game.  Voice acting is very good as well.Strategy seems pretty shallow as well.  Just doesn't have that strategic magic or challenge that makes me want to come back over and over again.Now it seems like they are rapid firing DLC out for the game as well.  Not something I will be investing in.  Maybe this was there plan all along, release some flashy looking/sounding game and cash cow it into oblivion.  Either way, I can't recommend this game unless you get it for VERY cheap.			"

Early Access Review
								As a longtime fan of Master of Orion 2, I've beaten MOO2 on impossible many times, so this reboot was not very difficult at all. But! The gameplay is nice and smooth, and you can micromanage or not, depending on your mood. The espionage feature is not turned on yet, and the AI diplomacy didn't really seem very complicated which could be good or bad. If in single player with more complicated features turned on/ added, I could see a good reason to make the game unlimited turns but at the present it's fairly easy. I like that I could mine asteroids or gas giants before I had the option of transforming them into planets. The combat is not turn based and although I have run through the game, I have yet to figure out exactly how much I can manage the combat. It's in real time so clicking on your ships and changing thier focus of attack seems to be as complex as it gets. You can upgrade/ design your own ships personally or you can allow the computer to auto upgrade your designs. I like this reboot on pretty much everything but the combat---I've always liked the turn based type space battles in some 4x games and being able to choose which weapons to fire. Overall, a thumbs up~!			"

Early Access Review
								At this stage I have about 9 hours on Master of Orion and overall I enjoy it. I plan on keeping up with the EA releases and giving my feed back where I can to shape this game into one of the best space 4X titles it can be.Believe me there is so much potential here and I really hope that it continues to move in the right direction. A lot of players don't really like the real time battles but I think they aren't too bad and when they work (aside from minor bugs) they work really well. Almost makes this Total War in space (if they continue on adding more tactical options in ie perhaps experience and ship captains or even some morale system).The game is overall pretty well polished and runs very smoothly with some minor UI annoyances and bugs here and there but remember it is EA so it's bound to improve. Audio and sound affects are awesome and once you've fully explored a galaxy it looks pretty sweet.As far as content is concerned that is my current bug bear. Like exploration just doesn't feel like eXploration. Needs more events and things to keep the early game fresh. I hope this doesn't come in the form of DLC either... I expect DLC down the track to give the game some longetivity but not an empty game with fast DLC releases. I guess time will tell.My last negative for the review is that they really seem to be balancing the game out a little more at this stage and I can see why it's needed but I'd rather see the time go into adding content and fixing bugs. Balance will work itself out once more players are playing, but without content, you aren't giving them reason to play in my opinion.But hey I'm not a dev so what would I know right?I bought this at full price and for what you get it isn't too bad, but at it's current stage of EA5 I would recommend waiting for a sale. Otherwise if you are a fan, then go for it. It's been fun so far and hopefully get's better. "

								I was afraid to buy this when I saw all the negative reviews, but The Early Access version of this game is infinitely better than Stellaris.  I can say this now that I've beaten both games.  Don't get me wrong, MOO is still unpolished and there are some random crashes and it could be better.  But Stellaris has way more ""stupid clicking"" and frustrating game mechanics than MOO.  So if you're in the mood for a space sim and you're deciding between the two, then pick MOO.  MOO2 is still better in a lot of ways but I really love how the reboot did the graphics/voice acting for the diplomacy screen.  Makes me feel like I'm dealing with real aliens.			"

								I wanted to love this game so much, as an avid fan of the franchise and someone who still plays MoO2 on my tablet all i wanted was a worthy successor. Sadly though the developer really dropped the ball, there is no tactical play for multiplayer, no custom races for multiplayer, and despite many glaring balance issues the races are all but indistinguishable. The game has no replay value, and although many of the iconic features from previous MoO games did make it in they're underwhelming from a game-play perspective. After sinking 263 hours into the game's early release phases (right up until the day before release) i just can't recommend anyone ever spend money on this.			"

Early Access Review
								A lot of people seem to think that this is a continuation of the series or a sequel to MOO3 or some other complaint to that. Instead, it is a re-envisioning of the first Master of Orion and since I have played from the beginning when I was a kid, I find this to be quite exceptional that it is already in the Early Access stage. Yes, there are currently some bumps that are being worked through, but overall it has the same excitement as when I used to play Master of Orion I or II. As for Star-Lanes, that's a Catch 22 as to whether or not you like it, but you know what? In this game it works. And it works well. To be able to use strategy to block off your enemies and force them into a choke-point in order to push your troops through when you are ready, it is really quite thrilling. The ship designs are extremely exciting to look at and watch in the cinematic view during combat or colonization, and I like the designs/voices of the races. The population view even seems to feel slightly Fallout-4'ish with the Cartoony look, and that is even MORE awesome. Overall, I'm enjoying this and can't wait for the updates to bring in more races, more changes, and more moments of pleasure.			"

												Summary: They tried to clone the extinct MoO species from Civilisation-DNA, sadly loosing some essential traits in the process. A good deal only for casual players, or to rekindle old MoO-memories without much available play time. The game looks good and starts very accessible.If you're looking for a deep 4X experience, look elsewhere.Explore (yawn) - scouts without range limits plod through a circular galaxy to map the stars. Rarely a reward beyond some credits or a vessel. Meeting races early to reap in trading boost.Two other setup options separate sections of the galaxy until midgame. Prevents early diplomacy and stresses expansion and research.Expand - planets operate separately. Their properties matter most in the beginning. Some good, close fertile planets boost growth excessively, while hostile environments cripple colonies. Much later in midgame, solar systems may pool their production and planets specialise more.Exploit - planet food and production slots are limited, with small spread and decreasing yield. Works only well at start, in the long run technology levels out differences. Planet size matters most.This is far from the old system where the galaxy might look completely different according to your race.Exterminate - Stationary defences add initiall resillience, invasion tech is delayed. Using star lanes feels more like combat along mountain passes than in space.There's tactical decisions and challenges. Still battles failed to excite me. Went to just calculate combat in the end. Invasion looks unfinished. Conquered planets don't revolt.In mid-game, portals may connect a side's systems, specialised shipyards churn out fleet. Travel in enemy territory stays slow; mopping up a war becomes a drag.Science - Instead of independent fields of research, we get a Civi tech tree with crowded nodes. The frowned upon old choice system is consciously reduced to a few select applications. This means that more than 85% of technology can never be traded, stolen or conquered but must be researched instead.Money - main source is population tax, with trade second. This is probably the biggest design change, as the forerunner used industry for taxation. Money and production were interchangeable then. No more.All ship upgrades can no longer be produced but must be bought, and there's no alternative to a large population base to fund your buildings or excess fleet.My brand's canary chokes on several features, mechanisms and concepts that often match the forerunner just in name.UI problems pop up in midgame and with huge positions. The game increasingly reacts sluggish and information is missing. MoO2's UI could handle 100-planet empires, MoO can't.Zooming into a planet looses the strategic view. Event list can't be scrolled, when overflowing you must klick through the least important items first. Some events pop up first, ignoring your selection. Planet list can't be sorted by production type, to e.g. check fleets in construction. Planet uniformity makes sorting by resource (food, science, production) way less usefull. And the list goes on...All this is known and unadressed since EA 4Diplomacy is listless. Incoming offers can't be put on hold and checked, no counter offers possible. Swap charts without knowing what you trade for is the most frequent offer. Get an embassy. Trade and research deals have to be continually refreshed, with the AI later often too broke to accept. Cultivating AIs is possible to get access or alliances. Otherwise the AI is simplistic with no real grasp of reality, demanding when ready to strike, or crawling when currently involved in another war.Espionage mostly consists of offensive spy micromanagent. Some Intelligence; stealing of the 'choice' techs is best done at lowly, undefended outposts, the rest is sabotage.Sabotage works like a separate game, after succes the victim can't react, e.g. can't attack a revolting planet but must wait it out. Defense is static by race traits or expensive buildings, or dispatched spies, without a good view to coordinate. Races - Most predefined ones work, but use way more perk points though than a player gets for a custom race. Race differences are noticeable, but very timid. Ship customisation has some wellcome improvements (like scout autoupgrades or the UI layout). On the other side a convoluted system obscures this. Payload is consumed at rates differing by class by essentials. A 25% payload extension consumes part of this for itself. And so on. You can't just compare the numbers displayed.This also hurls another wave of micromanagement at the player, e.g. each new drive is slightly bigger, often forcing a ship redesign. The final result is a wasted opportunity - a good looking time waster, not without appeal - but too shallow and boring for me.			"

												On the plus side, graphics are well polished and the UI is functionnal and I like the news anchor, unlike many other people.  Now for the bad.  COMBAT IS BOOOOOORRRRRIINNNNG!!!  Here's how to win all of the planetary engagement:  sends all of your ships at the bottom of the map, then pick all of the defenses one by one using long distance weapon.    It's as if they decided to pick all of the worst part of MOO3 (combat and starlane) and stuff it in there.They took great car of removing the only cool feature of MOO3 I could remember were the diplomatic cutscenes in which Aliens really looked alien and they were speaking some cool unintelligible giberish.  In that new version, the aliens just looks like guys in a suit.Even worst, they limited the number of planets around a star to 5 and seemed to have made it a point to have a very dull exploration experience.  There could have been strategic and trade resources, minor race with special tech or abilities, galactic menace, etc...  Nope, just a few planet types with no real differences aside the size and a few bonus modifiers.Speaking of limitation a production queue limited to 6 items?  Limited special system slots on ships?  Geez, as if we were running on Windows 95 with 100 MB ram...A missed opportunity, really disappointed.  I wanted to love that game so much.  They could have reproduced MOO2 as is with updated graphics and sounds I would have been happy.  Afterwards, they could have build up by adding stuff (more detailed ground combat, possibility of choosing between real time and turn based space combat, more complex economy, more complex diplomacy), I would have been extatic and throwing away money at them.

Early Access Review
								Early access so not to be judged as is, but as it will be, lots of features missing to be added.I enjoyed after 15 hours what I have seen.Battles not turn based well there is a pause button so if you wish to slow the battle down and hit the pause button to issue new orders, seems the same as turn based.I like the jump lanes very much like a board game I played in my youth.Systems look great pretty good, capturing the feel of the original MOO Liked the tech tree its a bit to predictable does not reflect the unpredictable nature of research after all lines of research can take you down rabbit holes and blind allys. May even be worth throwing in random tech events slowing or speeding up research.Espionage to be added ok early access More races to be added ok early accessMore difficulty levels Normal is a bit to easy for me I always played on the harder levels, ok early accessMore ship models ok early accessI could go on early access covers it all, I like the frame lets hope the finished products lives up to the exepctations of those who played MOO II just joking that is never going to happen			"

Early Access Review
								As it stands now, Master of Orion is an okay game. Not a great game, not an awful game, but a rather generic 4X. Much of what made it's predecessors sucessful, their quirky humor hidden in the descriptions of technology and buildings, the ability to truly customize ships to a greater degree, the ability to build numerous fleets without being limited by a ""command cap"", and the ability to build as many orbital bases as you wanted, is gone. The parts that made it great and unique are gone. Perhaps they're just waiting in development? Who knows.Where once we had the ""Mystery X"" researches if you found them, they've been replaced by the standard ""economic victory"", ""research victory"", ""diplomatic victory"", and ""conquest victory"". While fun, it takes away some of the fun, y'know?So I will recommend it, but not as Masters of Orion, but as another generic 4x space game, until they make it truly as good as it's predecessors.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is amazingly polished for an Early Access. There are a few locked-out races and a warning that features may change, but other than that, it could easily be mistaken for a full-fledged release, or at least a solid beta.I never played MoO 1, 2 or 3, so I cannot compare... But I have played my share of 4X and this one is really scratching the ""just... one... more... turn..."" itch.It is a teensy bit on the easy side and diplomacy is a bit confusing (IA seems to make up their mind about me pretty much regardless of my behavior and negotiations with them), but those things might get fixed in the months to come... and it's already a great way to kill time.

								Just finished playing my first game in a long while. I have to say they've made some pretty awesome improvements. The spy system is simple yet powerful. The AI is much, much better at everything... The faction design is more indepth but your not being overloaded with attributes like in GC (I love simple and meaning faction design). The custom faction creation is everything I was hoping for. Still doesn't have turn based chess like combat but it's got pretty much everything else. Thank you for making this game worthy of its name.			"

Posted: August 27, 2016
												Davor's Opinion of Masters of Orion. Or is it a review? :PAh Masters of Orion. One of my most beloved games of all time. I still play the original game still. Even MOO2 as well and MOO3 modded. Of course a mention of Star Trek Birth of the Federation modded needs mentioned as well. The 1000's of hours spent playing those games. Before I go on, I played this game from Day One Early Access. I have over 220 hours if not more now playing it. I was very harsh on the Devs about their choices and decisions of the game. I think NGD Stuidos hate me :P. But I would also say I am fair and I have praised them when they did good. So what do I think of Masters of Orion Conquer the Stars? I like it. Is it perfect? HELL NO! Still it's a good to great game with warts and all. When Masters of Orion Conquer the Stars (MOO for short from now on) first came out in Early Acess (EA) I hated it. I let it be known what was wrong with the game. For me it was just another game pretending to be MOO but with the MOO name only. It really should have been called something else at the time I thought. Hopefully this gave NGD Studios more incentive to make the game better. Did they make the game better and improve it from EA1? I can say in my opinion, yes they did.But I can't review a game of previous builds, I need to review the game on this build. MOO is a game to be played in a day (small settings) up to a few days or weeks (huge settings). It's a simple game to learn. While it's simple to learn, there is some complexity to the game, but nothing complex that you give up playing like I have when playing Hearts of Iron or Europa Universallis games. Sometimes I love playing complex games, other times I want a simplier game. Playing Civ in Space is what MOO is, and I love it for it. I am so glad it's not complex and made everything more streamlined and simplier to do. While I liked HoI and EU way too many screens and complexity that I don't have many hours in them. Maybe 10 or 20 hours each game I have while I have 1000s of hours in previous MOO games. I am already at 220+ hours with MOO and can't wait for the mods to start coming in once they are implemented into the game. I can see 100s hours more still to come.Let's get the biggest issue out of the way that is for me the biggest problem of MOO. Combat. Tactical Combat to be precise. It sucks. I hate it. I can swallow it like a bitter pill because the rest of the game is so much fun for me. (Not yelling I will use CAPS to indicate my RECOMENDATIONS.)Why is combat bad for me? I feel like I am watching combat instead of taking part of it. I hated Gal Civ series games over this, and same thing for Stellaris. I don't want to watch combat I want to take part. Combat has improved from previous EAs but still I wish there was more to do. First off, I don't like the Auto Fire. I rather have the ships do nothing until I tell them to do something. I think that has been fixed, but I am so use to do it now after playing over 220 hours, not sure if fixed or not. Also I would LOVE to be able to pick out single ships instead of just the fleet. Since ships auto fire, you don't know when they will shoot next. WHY DON'T WE HAVE TIMMERS ON OUR WEAPONS? I want information, and I am not getting it. WHY ARE MY SHIPS NOT MOVING AND JUST STANDING STILL. Again we need information. Besides timers to give us information I wish missles were not unlimted like in MOO1,2 and 3 but I can understand the Devs have a different vision. Still It doesn't make it better when I keep thinking the things I can do is taken out of the game. The ""arena"" or combat map is too small. This is 2016 not the 1990s where the combat arean is small because of limitations. WHY CAN'T THE COMBAT ARENA BE AT LEAST TWICE THE SIZE? This way at least it will give the illusion I can move my Big sized ships around and I am fighitng in space instead of a small Gladiator arena. Bigger ships need to be slower and smaller ships faster. At least now we have a choice to keep at the same speed, but I feel Big sized ships are too fast still. Also this would give having faster engines and what not more important. FOR COMBAT TO BE BETTER AND MAKE THIS GAME A MUST BUY, WE NEED MORE INFORMATION IN COMBAT AND A FEW MORE ABILITES TO TAKE PART OF SO WE FEEL WE ARE DOING SOMETHING besides just watching. Good things about combat, is we can pause it. (Annoying though how it doesn't pause where the camera is facing and defaults to top view or the other view which I forget the name.) Also we can speed up time or slow it down. Another great option. WHY IS IT WHEN WE PAUSE THE GAME THE TIME DEAFAULTS TO 1X????ARGH!!!!! So we can see combat is the weakest part of MOO for me. Does this make the game a No Buy? HELL NO.***corection*** It seams there is a new options I just found out when you can choose when you pasue in combat that the view stays the same.What makes the game good/great? Let's get onto that now.Exploration is fun. When discovering a new system, all the planets 0-5 are blacked out. So you have to send your scout/ship to each planet to see what it is. Is this a bit tedious? Yes but it's fun. Why? Because now we have to discover a tech that will let you choose to see all planets at once. Thing is, once the tech is discovered, do you take the tech that lets you see all the planets or do you choose the other tech that gives you something else? NOW WE HAVE CHOICES :D. Tech tree is a spitting image of Civ V. This can be good or bad depending on your tastes. Lots of techs to discover. Also one discovering a tech, like in MOO2, sometimes you have to make the choice do I take this or do I take that. If I take that, then I have to trad for to get this. A few times they are no brainers, other times you need to think what is more important to you. This for me is a great feature.OOPs I got away from exploration. Sorry. Only draw back I have for exploration is goodie huts. Like in Civ you can get a free unit, money or tech. Sadly the only time you can go off road from the Star Lanes is to discover an Anomoly. While fun, they are not as exciting as in MOO2 when discovering a planet and seeing what it might be. Artifact planets don't give a bonus to research but just a +2. So basically a free tech building. But now we have Gold to give a +2 Billion Credits (basically a BC think of it as a dollar). Dark Quartz for production +2 and fungus or what it's called for a +2 to food. It's a nice little bonus to make the colony start a bit faster.So I am having fun in exploring now. I choose to go into the options menu and use fast animations for me and the AI so the game plays quicker. I am glad we get this option. While nice in the begining seein ships zoom here to there, it gets boring. After 220 hours so glad for this feature. What else is exciting is will this planet be an Ultra Rich Gaia planet? Maybe, maybe? Dang it's not. But OOHHHH there is some nice Rich planets with a Terra Biome. Bonus. Others a poor planets or ultra poor or not good biomes. Well we need to extend our borders and they will make good bases for our ships to repair at. The AI. I find it good. Really good. Yes it still makes stupid decisions sometimes. What is this a strength 500 fleet about to wipe me out, but thank god it went in a different direction other wise my game would be over. Phew. Wait a second, shouldn't the AI try and wipe me out? Dumb stupid AI lol. Thankfull or unthankfully that doesn't happen alot and I have been wiped out on higher difficulty levels. I guess playing on a normal setting the AI wants you to play more. But on extreme settings, I basically gave up. The AI woudln't wipe me out, but I swear the AI is mocking me letting me live just so they can crush me some more. That said the AI is pretty good. In diplomacy the AI is offering alot of trade at me. Sometimes when I ask for a trade the AI will say no, but then a few turns later will offer the same trade back at me. Now to be fair, I			"

												I'm really trying to like this game but I just dont.- Galaxy map zooming is an issue.  It's either too close or too far away.  This makes system exploration and ship movement very clunky.- I've tried playing as most of the races and I truly can't see any difference in gameplay.  MOO and MOO2 were better at this.  With those early versions there were some races that were easier to play than others, some harder, and a few well balanced.  This game purports to have the same mechanics but I don't see it.- Ship to ship battle is awful...  That's all I can say...- Ground battles are non-existant.- Where are all the races?  Gnolam, Trilarian, Elerian?  It would be Ok if they weren't in the game as long as there were some new races to choose from, but not even that!  Let me guess, future DLC??I'm just disappointed in this game.  It's not horrible, it's just OK.  MOO2 is the better game by far, so if you've never played it, pick it up.			"

Developers failed at two possible purposes for such game - they didnt resurrect old master of orion, neither they did something new. They made something really really bad and not worth of playing.Score: 4/10Master of Onion 4, buy it - and Conquer your tears.			"

								This review is being writen by someone who's favorite game probably has to be MoO 3. I know I am somewhat of a blacksheep but I grew up playing MoO 3 and will never get bored of that game.I don't want to go into incredible detail so this may not be the most helpful of reviews but for this game I have to write it.I am a huge MoO fan. I didn't play MoO 1 or 2 because I grew up playing MoO 3. After playing and beating this game, I have to say the developer has done a great job at bringing the universe alive. Although it doesn't feel like MoO 3 as much as I would personally like it to, they did a good job with the HUD and Sitrep. Combat is interesting and needs a little more work, as well as personilizing ships. On the conquering end, I am not a huge fan of part of the story which I won't go into as a spoiler preventer.All in all, the developers have done a good job but I am excited to see this develop into a full game with features that will satisfy most people's desire in a MoO game.

YouTube™ Video: Master Of Orion Early Access Impressions 

			Views: 6,366		

			The Master of Orion series is being remade and I can assure you the soul of the game is already there! Boasting some insane voice acting talent, great graphics and bug free for me at least, it...		

With an amazing voice cast, updated graphics and all the basic core of the MOOverse.You'll see alot of comparsion between this and Galactic Civ 3. GC3 is more polished but you always feel like the universe is rather static at times. Doesn't have an in depth as of yet ship designer yet but that is a work in progress.Tech tree is fairly rounded out but could use a bit more depth to my liking. The Diplomacy branch is well rounded esp with the voice acting really captures the original feel. You will find a simple tutorial in the beginning that you will have to repeat every time unless there's an option to turn it off I didn't see but it's not bad. Galaxy size and the opponent AI is fairly ok. More races are incoming and custom races are also on the way. This is basically the meat and potatos of MOO. The bad is space combat which has been simplified to pretty much just watching the lightshow much like GC3 but it's not a bad show. So to sum it upPros:Voice acting-Mark @#$#$ Hamill! Robert England etc!Really buggy free so far. MO1,MO2,MO3 for free on steam with your purchase. Easy to use AIReally good soundtrackIf you've played MOO you'll ease into it like nothingAddicting gameplayCons$50 early Access entry does put alot of people off even with free stuff.Early access so you will be playing a waiting for content game at times. No turned based space combat GNN reports seem rather stale right nowI would heartily reccomend this 7/10 atm will update review as it progress.  "

								Played this for a bit now and i really enjoy it. Put me back in the feeling of the old MoO games.Didn't run into any game breaking bugs, mostly a couple of minor ones, like planets created from asteroid fields stayed barren visually, even when terraformed to Gaia. Making custom ships with the alternative models would just make em revery to original model, and at one point i couldn't pan the view, but was fixed by alt-tabbing out and back in.Other than those, i had no problems, ran very smooth even on max settings no stuttering.There are some balance issues that probably need looking into. Like early game its really hard to get going, but late game you have such an easy time. I was losing money in start of game, and by the end i was making over 3k per turn. For example, i had to raise taxes not to have a defeciet early game, but in the end game i could build buildings to make my minions so happy they didn't care i had max taxes. Maybe add some mechanic to promote smaller planet populations, and with getting higher populations you lose some happyness due to crowding? Kinda how they did it in Civilization games.Its kinda the same with Credits and Science, you struggle hard early on, but mid-late game it becomes so easy to manage.That said, game still quite fun. Needs a little work, but i really enjoyed it.			"

Keep in mind it's still in Early Access, so it's not something I would recommend right away, unless you are a space 4X fan like myself. What I see is a solid product, especially for its price. Production value is of highest standard in space 4X, but I can't say it's of XCOM2 level (which has left all competitors behind). What's good and new:- overall feel is good, it's interesting to explore and exterminate and there's clearly 'just one more turn' effect- controls and UI are overall good and easily understandable and the game seems to be well optimized- systems have planets now and navigating inside a system takes extra turn, warp points become choke points and allow interesting space control strategies- bases (something like in GalCiv) in choke points and asteroids, which is fresh and keeps you wanting to research them- research has interesting choicesNot cool but bearable:- lacks polish in some elements, for instance, icons and pictograms on research targets look like placeholders: it may look like unimportant detail, but in reality it adds a lot to anticipation of discovery- customizing your race is not implemented yet: and that was very important part of MOO2- some things are dumbed down and while some of these are good, like instant and mass upgrades of blueprints and ships in your planets, some are questionable: like fuel tanks / outreach concept is removed- tactical battles are of the kind you'd rather always skip, designing your own ships is not very helpful as wellTL;DR Not likely to be as memorable as MOO2 or something of ratings higher than 8/10. But it's definitely not as bad as MOO3. When released, new MOO would make an excellent choice for all newcomers to the genre.			"

												I really want to like this game.  It’s not quite master of Orion 2, but it’s the closest ever anyone has come.  This game definitely has gameplay that invokes that “one more turn” feeling, and the universe is definitely full of color and life(something almost all other space 4x lack.)  However this game is horribly optimized, I have to wait a long time between turns, sometimes minutes.  I’m very disappointed with the developers taking some of the original races and making them dlc only.  This game suffers from so many balance issues I had to rely on a community balance mod to fix everything. One thing that really makes me hate this game though is that each empire starts out in their own little star cluster/sector gated by worm holes that require a tech really deep into the tree to unlock so you basically spend 100+ turns all by yourself. The pollution system that everyone is complaining about would be kind of tolerable if the way new population units are allocated would make sure that they don’t get placed where they would make a ton of pollution.  As it stands if you are using a food rich planet to create a lot of civ transports you will constantly have to micro manage where new population get allocated to keep the planet clean.And finally the ai is dumber than dirt, but to be fair I’ve never played a single 4x space game that’s had a good ai…			"

								A good successor to MoO2. It's a lot simpler than the old MoO games, and it mixes in a lot of light-hearted humor.The only major problem I have with this sequel is the ""Tactical Combat"" section, which is... well, just not worthwhile using: simulated combat will almost always give better outcomes and there is almost no tactics you can employ, the classic MoO2 turn based combat system was infinitely better.I feel as though they should instead take a page out of Fractal Softworks' ""Starsector"", where you can maneuver ships to spread damage across different areas of the ship in a semi-realtime fashion.Another major flaw in the game design comes in the form of the fixed warp points, something which other games do, but in this implementation feels very flawed. In a few of the games I have played on medium sized galaxies I have been confined to an area of approximately 8 stars, with one enemy race. Unable to get out because of the unstable warps blocking off the remaining 75% of the galaxy.This situation never would have happened in the classic MoO games which all inter-stellar travel was purely based on distance. If you had a ship with infinite distance you could warp from the top-right to the bottom-left star system.			"

								I have been fairly impressed with this game considering the developer. Graphically its nothing too special, lots of the effects are clearly just the early placeholders but the models and lip sync are pretty good. The original music for each race is in whenever you have diplomacy which is great. Speaking of diplomacy, the voice acting is way more than I had ever expected it to be.  All in all for early access its a 7/10. With the addition of new races it could easily get to 9/10. My major gripe is that it just feels a lot more shallow than the previous installments but then again, we did suffer through MOO 3, which is a travesty.			"

The game is far from finished but in its current state its playable without any bugs. I will be updating my review as the game progresses towards release date. I would sure recommend it, even at this stage.			"

												To put my overall score into context, understand that on a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate MOO1 at 9.0, MOO2 at 9.5, and MOO3 somewhere around 4.0.  To summarize my impression of this latest incarnation (wish I could just call it MOO4), I'd say 7.0.There are many aspects that are great ... I find the voicework by various well-known sci-fi actors keen and enjoyable including Michael Dorn (Worf from Star Trek: TNG), Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker from Star Wars) and Alan Tudyk (Wash from Firefly and Serenity).  An amazing amount of features and tidbits are carried forward into this incarnation from MOO1 and MOO2 including elements of the technology tree, race customization screen (though bizarrely -- and really frustratingly, one of many unexpectedly lacking features that reduce my rating of the game -- not able to retain a customized race between games so you have to re-create it each time from scratch, particularly frustrating in multiplayer) and all but one of the races (the Terrans, not to be confused with the Humans -- the Terrans are basically evil humans) are carryovers from the first two games though some MOO2 races are notably absent -- the Gnolams (gnomish folk) and the Elerians (dominatrixes).Unfortunately, the interface has not been improved -- in some aspects its taken a step backward from all predecessors -- and can be cumbersome in terms of how many buttons you have to click through to get to things you want; using the technology tree as opposed to a one-deep technology, for instance, requires clicking on the science screen from icons at the top right, then a 'View Technology Tree' button at the bottom right, then scrolling sideways through the tree to find the tech path you want before finally clicking on teh tech itself.  You have to do this every time you finish researching the 'tech path' you previously chose -- you can only click on one tech to pursue; it will automatically select the requisite techs to get there if you haven't researched them yet, but you can't shift+click another tech to queue afterward and you will have to start this process again after finishing the one particular tech and its requisites -- including, yes, re-opening the technology tree and the tree always opens all the way to the starting techs at the left; the tech tree is several screenwidths across so you will have to scroll more and more as the game goes on before you can pick a tech you want.While its okay in single player, this really consumes time in multiplayer.   So do animations like colonizing planets -- there's no option so far as I have found to prevent those and if you go through heavy expansion, you may find yourself unable to colonize planets when your colony ships reach them because of everything you need to set up on a new colony (and no, there's no copy-and-paste-able build queue ... and the build queue is only 5 buildings/ships long -- I recall it being much larger in MOO2 -- which means you have to fiddle with your build queues much more frequently and it gets too cumbersome to manage in multiplayer much past 20 or so colonies).There are also frequent crashes and bugs ... I find, sporadically, one particularly building for some reason cannot be built after researching the tech even though it should be; this bug persists between saves.  On one game, I was unable to build terraforming -- so I could not terraform my planets; on another, I was unable to build Robo-Miner.One frustrating missing feature of multiplayer is locking players to the civ they start in the event (more like eventuality) the game has to be continued from a save -- so when a host reloads a multiplayer game due to a crash or folk just having retired from a long game to continue another night, random players connecting in will be assigned the civs that previous players had been playing and block the original players from being able to play them ... seems silly they wouldn't code in a 'lock' of some sort so only either the original player can play the civ, an AI or if the host decides to open up that civ for other players, but as it stands you can't really stop this from happening except to ask the new player to change to a different previously-AI-controlled race or leave the game.Overall, I like the game, and I do recommend it to fans of the series.  Its nowhere near as bad as MOO3 ... but don't expect it to quite be at the level of MOO1 or MOO2; it has some shortfalls and some bugs.  If you find it on a good Steam Sale, and you are a fan of the series or at least the genre, I definitely recommend a grab.			"

Early Access Review
								Overall: I am very impressed.  MOO was great for the time, I loved MOO2, and hated MOO3 before the community patch.  There are multiple areas that need depth, but the outline of a very complex games is defintely in place.  It a gorgeous game that will make any further attempts of nostalgia playing MOO2 difficult. So far the game seems really good for early access.  The game is playable and only crashed to desktop twice in the past 10 hours.PROS:+This game is beautiful and has that sense of discovery missing from GalCiv or SOTS+The additions to diplomacy and the diplomacy screens are awesome.+Voice acting is usually verry well done.+The RTS battles are pausable, and you can slow them down by 1/4ths to easily control you units and special abilities.+The research tree really makes you make some tough choices on what you want to specialize in.+The ship customization is easy to use, but still allows for a lot of variation.+Space Lanes, now you can have defensible systems and war fronts. Careful of those techs that let them get behind you.+Weapon Arcs, it's important to maneuver around to flank big powerful frontal attackers.+The AI reacts well to what you are using against them and pools their fleets for large powerful attacks to break through your defenses as well as going after undefended planets. Cons:-A lot of techs aren't fully implemented (Alpha)-Weapon customization doesnt change the base stats so its difficult to determine if its worth it-Ship appearance custimization does not allow you to change colors making patterns difficult to see-Some of the voice work is annoying: Looking at you Psilon Science Guy-Auto save is only for the immediate turn.-Very little Game customization allowed currently. Not sure if more will be added.-Does not allow you set formation before battles and formations are very wonky.-Races have very minor variation (Hope this changes) Not sure if some get specific techs or not.This is going to be a great year for the Space 4x.  Will Wargaming or Paradox take the title for the GOTY?			"

												People who are interested in this game fit into four categories.1: Old school MOO fans.  2: Space 4E players waiting patiently for a title that innovates.  3: People new to the genre attracted by marketing.  4: Those uninterested in the genre, attracted by the cast of voice actors.  Regarding Group 1  This game lacks the majority of MOO's features, does not recreate the feeling of that game, and generally should not be considered as MOO HD.  Regarding Group 2Space empire games' downfall is that they all basically clone MOO with their own twist.  If you're waiting for one to finally advance the genre beyond that basic, stale foundation, then getting the one named after MOO probably isn't the best bet.Regarding Group 3It's not balanced at all, and the AI is so cheated that it's obvious from the beginning of the game, onward.  Absolutely any other space empire game would make a better introduction to the genre.Regarding Group 4The voice actors read description cards and greetings.  The rest is poorly-written sophomoric humor from intrusive cinematics offering little useful information.  In ConclusionIt's also simply not fun.  The same game can only be cloned so many times to be sold with misleading ""screenshots"" and ambiguous marketing before you can practically smell its stench within two turns.			"

								Master of Orion is still in Early Access so I won't type up an in-depth review yet.  What I will say is that if you were a fan of the series in the old days, this new version is shaping up to be even better than any part of the original trilogy if the developers play their cards right!I finished off a campaign yesterday and it was an absolute blast.  You can tell it's Early Access, but just barely, and the game as it is, I feel, is already worth the money.  The fact that I also got the original trilogy packaged in was also a nice bonus.I recommend it to Master of Orion fans and those who love 4x games in space!			"

								I lived for Master of Orion 2. The sound of colony ships landing, the blast of plasma cannons, the excitement of Battle at Orion and Antares... Just awesome. I've also been hugely dissapointed as so many others have failed to recreate the magic (MOO3 being a total disaster). Even the recent Stellaris didn't capture my imagination. I'm pleased to say that IMO, this game gets the magic right. It's fun, it's creative, it's challenging. It's the magic of MOO but with a new twist. They get the little details right and that's what makes this a fun experience and is already ruining my sleeping pattern...!Buy it!			"

												Master of Orion 4 is not a remake of Master of Orion 1 or 2.It's pretty much the game we needed instead of Master of Orion 3.You see, back when MoO3 was announced I was very interested in it.MoO2 was one of the games that kickstarted my love for videogames and boostedmy switch from consoles to pc. The horrendous ui, bad ai and terrible gameplay mechanics in MoO3 killed my dream of a more modern and refreshing MoO experience and as such left me with replaying MoO2 countless times.Which by no means should be interpreted as bad, because to this day I still love booting up MoO2 and the original CD-ROM plus euro box are on display on my shelf.However as much as I love MoO2, it has flaws and with these flaws it would never survive a simple remake in today's gaming world.Game franchises of the older days like Civilization, Total War and X-COM have shown that slow paced 4X games aren't dead, but at the same time require careful updates to keep up with today's audience.And all of these changes are usually either dumbing down game mechanics (Hi, Total War post Medieval II) or changing the franchise itself to a certain degree, making it far more accessable for newcomers (X-COM 2).I have to admit it's not the worst approach, it's actually not even a bad one when done well.X-COM 2 and Civilization V have shown perfectly how we can get very fun and deep 4X games that proceed to build the bridge between ""casual"" 4X and the ""number crunching"" ones.Master of Orion 4 is such a game.Hate it or love it, it's the Master of Orion I would play in multiplayer with people younger than me or those who had no previous interest in 4X games.MoO2 would just make the average joe turn away from the genre with it's focus being more on the number crunching and in-depth game mechanics rather than the steamlined approach of MoO4.Now of course it's great that the game caters to a wider audience by including those that have no previous experience with the genre, but what of the ""veterans"", those who have played 4X games since their earliest incarnations?It's pretty simple, either you can appreciate what the game does in it's own way, or you'll never like this game.I wrote in the very beginning that MoO4 isn't a remake of former games of the franchise.It's a new game in the franchise, taking new approaches and changes to not only simplify existing game mechanics, but also adding new ones.Take the change from tactical to real time combat for example.I like that change, I also liked the real time combat in games like Imperium Galactica II, I loved the newer Sins of a Solar Empire for it's great real time 4X approach.It's not only more graphically pleasing, but also interesting in it's own way.Turn-based combat leaves a lot of it's representation to the player's imagination, which is enjoyable, however also confines it into a corner of the room.To put it simple, turn based combat is methodical, more like a puzzle, while real time combat also relies on player instinct and ability to adapt to situations quickly.They're too different to each other, but interesting for exactly that reason.Turn based combat in any game makes me want to min-max my troops performance as much as possible, granting me perhaps the chance to turn a devastating loss into a victory by making the puzzle pieces fall into the places I want them to be.Real Time combat fills that itch of mine to do my best possible within the time granted.It's decision making on the fly, identify the outcome, proceed or change the tactic used and work with the results to prepare for the next step.And that describes MoO4 perfectly, too.It's not MoO2, it didn't try to be to begin with.It's a game on it's own.Does it have flaws?Oh yes it does, some of which prolly won't be fixed until later and some of which are flaws of the genre itself and are unlikely to be ever ""fixed"".MoO2 had flaws, too.Different ones, from a different genre subtype.Did these flaws make it a bad game? By no means.Do the flaws in MoO4 make it a bad game? By no means.As such I recommend to buy MoO4 to anyone who likes the 4X genre in itself and not just certain subtypes of it.It certainly isn't a game for someone who only appreciates the number crunching Paradox-esque 4X games of this world, but for people like me who enjoy all the subgenres it'll be a good gaming experience.Major negatives on the current build (As of 26.08.2016):- Tactical combat maps are too small- No tactical combat in MP - Tactical combat duration still feels a bit short			"

Early Access Review
								Just finished my 200th turn, and decided I've played enough to give some substantial feedback. They game of course is in early access, and several races are not playable at this point as well as some features that are sure to come at a later date. That being said, the game is absolutely playable, no bugs that I have encountered, and is entertaining as it is engrossing.MOO and others like it are the sort of games that take up HOURS of your life in an eye blink. You are so enveloped in what your are doing that you are eagerly advancing turns to get that colony ship to that prime real estate planet before your neighbor, or rushing that ship to change the tide of war in a contested system.  That is what I want from a game, and so far I have not been disappointed. The game's workings are fairly easy to understand, there is no tutorial match available (that I was able to access at least) but they game has an abundance of hints. Some things were a bit of a mystery, like worker strikes, but playing long enough provided the explanation needed. It's a straightforward game and unlike MOO3 (which was my favorite, don't judge) its streamlined things to a point where you aren't having to micromanage every aspect of gameplay. I am surprised with how well the game plays so far that it was put into Early Access. Stellaris may have a thing or two to do with that. We are still missing some races as I mentioned above, but other than expanding the map sizes, adding the races, beefing up the tech tree, I don't see much else that needs to be done. Space combat is pretty much just like MOO3, over in 30 seconds. I don't think it has ever been MOO series strong point. The bombardment screen is really disappointing. I loved MOO3's planetary bombardment, It was visceral and made me feel like ""This is genocide, the systematic extermination of all life on Arrakis!"" Now it's ""bloop"" you dropped a bomb, there goes item A, B, or C. That's something I would like see fixed up before leaving Early Access.Planet management is similar to other 4x titles, but like I said previously, you can fully automate planet management and no micro management required. I picked a large map and was a little miffed at first. It seemed so small, especially compared to MOO3. But as I played it became clear that just 4 or 5 planets is enough to keep you busy. Still, I want 200 plus star system maps like M003 in the future (Huge map size perhaps?) The AI is fairly predictable, scooping up and taking every available world and stellar object available to them. I would have to play longer to say this isn't the case for all AI, but so far it seems to be. A little more variety would be nice to see, but with Early Access things are going to change. Some variation besides the rush, turtle, and other playstyles would be interesting. Maybe a randomized ""arch enemy"" that the AI will go after over all else, even if it's on the other side of the map. I've played Star Ruler, Endless Space, Distant Worlds, Space Empires, Galactic Civ, etc. For me, MOO is the most fun to play and the one game that I believe will manage to keep my interest for longer than a few hours. However, I am eagerly awaiting Stellaris, and that could change things up quite a bit. Masters of Orion has more than just an homage to look and lore of the games previously in the series, it is very much a game of its time. Smooth gameplay, nice graphics, an easy but useful UI, I'd venture to say this game is about as good as a successor to the Master of Orion series as there could be. TLDR: The game is a solid 8/10 even in Early Access. With the collector's Edition it's worth its 50 dollar price.UPDATE: Finished a playthrough. Dissappointed by the 500 turn limit, wanted to see more of the tech tree than I did. I only ever lost one battle, and its because I didn't simulate it when I probably should have. AI needs to up its game. If I could tell the developers one thing it would be this: Expand on everything. More detail, more ship templates, more systems, more more more.			"

												Not a good game, wouldn't recommend at all in fact I've asked for a refund.I found it to be very formulaic offering nothing new or interesting to the 4x scene. I knew this was not going to be revolutionary based on the reviews but there's literally nothing that's even slightly interesting to set it apart from it's competitors.Elements of the UI were pretty badly designed (the build queue for starters) and felt very unsatisfactory. Sadly this is a poor reflection on what was a great series of games in the past.Stick with Endless Space or Stellaris, neither of which are perfect but both are better than this. "

												The new Master of Orion is a good game. Not great. Not terrible. But good. Something that you'll fire up for a few hours, get some joy out of listening to Mark Hamill voice a bird man, mindlessly watch two gigantic fleets blow each other up, or maybe even have a furry identity crisis staring at cat cleavage. All-in-all a good and campy time, which is exactly what I'm looking for in a game of this price and size.Now, MoO ""fans,"" most of whom are fairweather or never even played MoO 1 and 2, are coming out in droves to trash this game for being a ""shallow"" experience. Yet half of them raved about Stellaris at launch, which was and continues to be an unpolished, unbalanced turd that slows to a crawl at midgame, has less than minimal polish, and goes for months without a major update.So, do I think this is a better game than Stellaris? Hell yeah. If you want to capture some of the magic of MoO2 and play a 4x game with some actual production value, give Master of Orion a shot.			"

								I will say that this  is probably one of the most polished Early Access games I have had the pleasure of playing so far.  No crashes so far and the UI is not unnecessarily cluttered as other games of this type tend to be.The empire selection screen sealed the deal for me.  Michael Dorn narrating each species back story was a very pleasent surprise.  The characters look great and I actually took the time to go through each one even though I an very familiar with them from the previous games.  Finding out that all the species have voice work from actors I love just makes a good thing even better.The team has done a great job so far with everything and I am looking forward to the remaining species going live.

Early Access Review
								A real big shock!!!!I went into this game thinking it was gonna be another remake i would hate. This game had me hooked from the word go. The fancy intro, to the talking help the game really does grab you quickly and game play quick to pick up. So where to begin First thoughts did not seem promising from the download. Even though this game is in BETA it was still a really small download which did raise initial concerns. These however were quashed quite quickly from starting the game. Graphics are good but nothing fantastic and the intro is relatively short. Not complaining myself as i like to get stuck in, but anyone wanting a background story there isn't much to go on. (however this is still a beta and could change). The initial character selection is as would be expected with the description of races and perk. However i find the perks to be a bit lacking of a decription and so far don't make a noticeable amount of difference. Once you have selected a race you jump straight into the game, which has helpful advice on how to play. The game play had me hook. Once i started i had to finish, this game really does draw you in and has a sins of a solar empire sorta feel. The AI is quite poor though but as the BETA stands you cannot change the difficulty. Fingers crossed the hard AI will have some kick when the game is finally released. The battles look amazing but have limited ammount of input from the player. Anyone who has played the previous games might find issue with this. However i do feel that the battles will benefit the multiplayer aspect of the game, hopefully cutting game times down from a full day  to complete a small galaxy. Diplomacy on this game is still as bad as the predecessors, the AI is unreasonable and trying to set up any advance treaty will take so much time and effort. The diplomatic victory is also easy to achieve if you expand quickly. This does have to be my biggest bug bear with the game. If 4X would make the AI vote tactically i would be so much happier with this already awesome game. Planetary interaction has been improved slightly so has the monetary and tax systems. With this game you will find you are paying alot more attention to tax rates, pollution, construction etc. Also there is a new addition which is warp point structures. I really do hope they develope these just alittle bit more as the idea is great but as they dont provide much protection unless you camp them. The game runs very smooth, sounds great and has relatively low load tiimes. The sound is pure excellence and have found no real bugs with the game so far. Pro's and Con's Up Side1. Looks great2. Gameplay is simple 3. Alot more thought to multiplayer4. People who are new to Master of Orion can jump straight in5. Planetary interface has been improved6. It is the much needed update for Master of Orion7. Not many bugs for a BETA8.Quick start no messing around Downsides :(Most of my downsides are going to stick out more to Master of Orion enthusiasts 1. Battles are really lacking user input 2. Diplomacy still sucks3. Warp lines. gone are the days of direct travel4. Ship range mechanic has been removed5. Pirates are terrible6. AI are not very tactical7. It feels more like Sins of a solar empire than Master of Orion8. This is a biggie bear with me..................................The Psilon assistant is the most annoying thing in the world. I cannot count how many times i wanted to jump through the monitor and fart in his face. Everytime it talks i feel the need to eat my stereo system. I hate him so much the annoying little troglodyte.My personal rating as it stands would be an 8/10.			"

SINGLE PLAYER REVIEW30 hours of play (Steam + Non-Steam)Strongly recommend this game to players who like X4, general strategy games or building games and have some patience to see its empire grow.First of all, the actual game cannot be compared to the Early Access. Much has been improved.Some highlights+ Taking care of the development of your planets is a very rewarding experience. There are tons of structures that will definitely affect its growth and specialization.+ Can play at ultra-high settings with an old video card (GTX 670)+ An excellent tactical and diplomacy IA. It will squeeze with efficiency every available action.+ There are so many ways to play the game like industrial producer, warchief, technocratist, expansionist, diplomatic negotiator, and much more.+ A complete espionage system with many possible actions that also affect diplomacy.+ Every race takes decisions respecting their natural traits. Even when they should betray you or not.+ Artistically beautiful and diverse.+ The game works flawlessly. Never crashed.+ The game, as it is now, has solid potential for expansion.+ Every time I want to exit the game it might take me another 10 turns, it keeps you going for some more managing.+ Some tech researchs will require you to choose one and loose the other, but then you can trade the missing tech with other races via diplomatics.Cons- The game is complex and could be hard to learn for non fans of the genre. But it's worth to pass the initial complexity.- Micromanagement can make a difference so this could sometimes make the game longer if you wish to get the most of every turn.- I miss the possibility to stack several actions for the space factory and scouts.- When you have to choose between two technologies sometimes is not very clear which one is better on the advanced tree levels (Just a few descriptions that might be improved).- I didn't get to use often the land troops.Completed MMO three timesThe first time I played the game I was fully focused to win it by warfare, but then my second playthrough was like a tycoon industrial producer, almost zero confrontation and some diplomatics. Then my last one was as technology victory with spies and full diplomacy.I think this is remarkable. To be able to play the game as you prefer and win it in it's different paths. It has a good internal balance.I give the game 9.5 as fan of the genre and 8.9 as general gamer.			"

								It's good, but could be great. It needs more faction differentiation and it desperately needs more in the way of combat tactics, but this is a mostly successful reboot of the classic Master of Orion franchise. If the devs hear us out from here on and make some smart decisions, it could be a great platform for future content and a great start to a new franchise series.			"

												I followed this game all through out the early access and had high hopes they would create a timeless hit much like the first two Master Of Orions. I am sad to say they have failed.First thing, this game is not all bad. It's just not spectacular or really different in any areas. It has sharp menus and some good (and some not so good), voice acting. Everything else is just plain and done several times over, sometimes better, in other games. They even removed minor races from the early access and they never returned. They claim they return at ""some point"". Space battles could be way better. It feels like you have limited control and are always fighting to get your ships just to do what you want them to do.If you want a game that offers nothing new, and plays like a bare bones iphone game. Give it a try. If you want something more, pass this one up for now.  "

								Yesterday afternoon I sat down skeptically to play a game that I enjoyed greatly in my childhood.  This morning when my game ended after killing enough of everyone else to vote myself as dictor, I sat back and really had a great time.  I know it is early access and tried despertately to find a bug, there were none that I saw. Yes items were not implemented, but that was expressly told to us.  The things that were put in the game worked fantastic, the artwork was great, and the AI was fun! Looking forward to adjusting them to be more difficult but this taste test was a real nice reminder of what makes this series so good.  Highly recommend even in this early access state!			"

								I am a fan of MOO2, and I do feel that this new version really does keep alive the humourous, fantasy feel of that game.  A great deal of effort has been put into the looks and music of the game, both are very good and give a very polished feel. I've played it three times now, and each game has been a great deal of fun.  However, each of those games, the last being on 'Very Difficult' difficulty was so very easy to win - something really has to be done about the difficulty of the game (and please don't let the AI cheat!).  Given this is early access, this can be forgiven for now though... it'd be great to see the Antarans from MOO2 brought back in to weaken the player with the most star systems or some such.  Oh, and a more impressive ending animation wouldn't go amiss! "

												When you first play the game, it looks very polished. Many of the characters are well voice acted and all have interesting animations. You feel like you're playing something that COULD have been a AAA title. Sadly, that's not the case. As I explored the races and played the game quite thoroughly I found that in the combat aspect, most play pretty much the same as the others. On the economic scale, there are differences. On the colonization aspect, there are differences. But in warfare, which ends up being a significant portion of the gameplay? Almost none.I began to realize that the given assistants you have aren't as charismatic as the race leaders, and some are down right so annoying with their overly cartoonish actions that I began to avoid specific races.After trying almost every race, I began to realize the game felt essentially the same. The long campaigns often ended similarly. There was nothing guiding me to different victories. Win or lose, it always happened in the same way.I thought the game would have new life with its expansion, but I realized after its release that it was essentially content that SHOULD have been in the game from the start, and this might be another case being fed an unfinished game in order to get you to buy the rest of it later.The initial bundle pack wants you to pay quite a bit for very old previous games and a new race which is even more ""more of the same"" in that it's just humans with a meaner leader and no new ships, technology, etc.Then I looked to multiplayer. My friends enjoy games similar to this. It could be fun working together or against each other!The multiplayer is completely gutted, for reasons I don't really understand. Although the team tried to fix some of the issues with the game, this was never anything more than numbers fiddling, and resulted in many people on the forums reporting that the game was virtrually unplayable.I want to note that I never had an issue monitoring pollution, and thought it was an interesting aspect. But I may not have played it since the last patch.The multiplayer also lacks actual combat. Your fleets autoresolve their battles off screen.The combination of poor AI (reportedly going from offering no challenge, as I often experienced, all the way up to utterly unbeatable, with little to no middle ground), lack of combat, and generally poor management pushed me slowly from being super excited about this game to realizing that I was offered something shiny.. but that was just the wrapping, and underneath was a rusted hunk of junk.I can not strongly enough push the importance of this to you. They made it look good, but only enough to sell the game and keep you playing just long enough that you can't get a refund. By the time you've explored the game, it's too late. They have your money.IT IS LITERALLY A TRAP.I held out. I hoped. But it's been 3 months now since the Devs left with out a word. This game is dead and despite its real potential, it will never be allowed to become what it should have been. I'm not angry just at my money lost, but at the potential tossed to the ground. It COULD be SO GOOD. You can see it while you play it... but they won't let it be. And that disrespect to both the customer and the product they themselves created is why they don't deserve your money.That is all.			"

Early Access Review
								Like Many others, I have been waiting for this game for a very long time.  I spent countless hours and many lonely nights as a teenager playing MOO 2, and it was revolutionary.  Only to have the francise and name get dragged through the mud with releases that were progressively worse with each release.  This latest installment is not excluded from that plummet from greatness, and downright borderlines on being used as coaster... Well if it were an actual Game CD and not a digital download, but you get the idea.Like many have said before, the AI is terrible and completely boring.  A faction whom you were friends with, all of a sudden asks for money like a crack head in front of the gas station, and when you refuse the will declare war on you within a few turns, unless you are considerably stronger than them, hey even crackheads know what battles to pick.The diplomacy is completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  It is so easy to exploit any other race on any difficulty level that it does not even seem fair.  Imagine telling a 5 year old that you will give him a $20 baseball mitt for his leather satchel full of $100 bills, don't ask me how he got that satchel, I just know he has it.Combat is atrocious!!!  Visuals are decent, but get very redundant and boring after the 3rd time seeing the exact same thing.  If this were still 2010 the graphics would be amazing... Unfortunately it is 2016, and for today's standards, they are quite poor, with little to no interaction.Even with all of the die hard fans, pleading and begging for the developers to change the combat on every forum that I have read, there does not seem to be any change in sight.  If I had the control to do so, I would fire every single one of the pilots and captains of my ships, because they fight like they have been drinking everclear and doing bong rips all night.  Not utilizing any of their weapons (yet another steaming pile of dung aspect) to their potential or capabilities.  Don't even bother with guns or beam weapons, just build all missle ships and you should have no problem, as they are way over powered, and anyone who happens to be on the recieving end, literally has no defense...  Yes point defense weapons exist, but they too are being operated and developed by the same people that have been pulling all nighter parties with my digital pilots.Tech tree = Garbage...  Unlike MOO 2 where I was Sooooo excited that my little digital aliens worked their butts off to get the newest cool techs to help me conquer the galaxy, these little guys do the same thing, however its so boring and redundant that I could care less, at no fault of thier own... These little alien nerds are doing the best they can with what they are given.The early access games have now are an amazing way to for developers to make money from us poor saps, to help them continue development and make it better for the fans and players.  But these guys seem to have taken the money and ran.  Seemingly none of them have been listening nor reading forums, for what the true fans want to see in MOO again, because none of it exists.I cannot recommend it to ANYONE!!! I can say pretty confidently that both fans of the series will feel just as violated and sad as I did (like a virgin on prom night), and even if you have never played the MOO series before and are just looking for a good Space 4X game, there are far better ones out there for much cheaper, that will give you so much better experience then this failed abortion will.Now with all the bashing out of the way... If this is truly NOT the end product, and the devs decide that care more about putting out something great again, as opposed to a money making scam, then I would love to give it the old Siskel and Ebert two thumbs up.  But until then I shall remain in a disarray and wish that I would have quit after 2 hours of play and requested a refund.			"

												Stunningly mediocre.  Pick up Master of Orion 2 for 5 bucks somewhere and play that instead.  It's a much better game.Specific complaints: - The AI is terrible.- The tech tree is poorly thought out, lacks differentiation on many techs, and the choices on some techs are a joke: there's one clearly optimal tech (i.e. Microbiotics vs Cloning Center) and one trap tech.- Pointless micromanagement of things like pollution and spies.  Adds nothing to the game and simply forces the player to waste time micromanaging basic stuff.  Poorly thought out mechanics.- Not much difference between racial traits compared to what we saw in MOO2.  The radical differences in gameplay between Silicoids and Elerians in MOO2, for instance, are pretty much smooshed into ""Silicoids don't need food.""- The real time combat is OK, but shallow.  Face weapons toward target and focus fire.  Done.- Ship design is pretty simple, and that's a shame.  Instead of putting in nonsense like pollution cleanup micromanagement, ship design is where that effort should have been placed.The game as a whole is just shallow and half-baked.			"

												I really tried to like this game, but what drives me ultimately away are the technical difficulties. Besides several bugs ( for example a freeze in the space battle screen, you have to abandon the battle as a solution), the performance makes it unplayable for me. After several turns, of course in a large galaxy with maxed out numbers of NPCs, the time between turns grows up to ten minutes. If you want to change the profession of your population, it often takes up to one minute, to change one unit.I tried it on two PCs, one is more powerful and has a SSD, and the problems stay the same. ( I didn't use a stop watch so I can't say if it gets like 10% faster. But it's still tediously slow)I doubt that a real high end PC could handle it, it seems to be a problem of the optimization.There are also balance issue, especially concerning the AI, but that's partly subjective and a lot got balanced out by the 5x mod.(The AI never uses big ships, except for antarans. And even though it takes so much processing time, they don't use intelligent tactics) "

												A dummied down game compared to previous installments in this franchise and the genre in general. This game is lacking in depth and complexity and from mid game onward it becomes quite podantic. Many features and elements that made previous MOO games remarkable are missing or understated in this game. I have played since day one of early access and with each update my frustration grew to the point where I'm almost ready to delete it and never look back.The way to fix it for me would be to introduce the missing races and features from previous MOO games like tactical combat, unique feeling and playing races, heroes and govenors, expanded custom race creation, to name a few.The way to lose me forever, releasing any of the aforementioned items as DLC that costs extra.

								Great Game mostly Crashes on exit and most of the races dont attack when at war with you though but hopefully these will be fixed Main issue is with the Kahnate since they are just a reskin of the Human race Considering Alpha Centuri is likely to be one of the first systems to be colonised then their ships should look different from the Humans unless they split within the last (in-game) decade or so Personally I feel that the Meklon ships suit the Kahnate more while the Meklon should have ships that look more like intertwined tubes And with all the terraforming tech in the game there is no way to freeze a lava planet?The diplomacy is also painful as the other race will ask for money and hate you if you say no but wont give you money if you ask, if a system similar to the diplomacy in the Endless games was used were you could see a rough idea of what each item is worth like:Their maps are worth 20 'favor' and a bulk payment of 50 cedits are worth 25 'favor' Then when they ask for free money they are giving 'favor' for you to use later			"

Early Access Review
								Master of Orion 2 is my definitive favourite strategy game, no 4X game has ever gotten as close to near perfection as far as I am concerned. I have played MoO2 for probably thousands of hours since I first bought it about 18 years ago, and still play it a couple of times every year.From the first early teasers I was really hoping this game would be a true Master of Orion sequel. I went in to play for two hours. Forced myself to stop just before the 2 hour mark due to feeling VERY, VERY dissapointed, then I went to watch several youtubers to see more of what the game has to offer.*The races are dumbed down variants of their own MoO2 counterparts, the traits are little more than minor stat buffs in different fields. Not game defining traits that you based your core strategy around, and give each race a unique play style.*Technology has a civ-style tech tree, which do feel bland, thin and very constricted. I am happy they decided to hold on to one of MoO2s defining features, that you could only choose one discovery per technology. In MoO2, that was something that further allowed you to gradually define your empire and playstyle as the game progressed. However, this feature feels somewhat dumbed down in this game, as at the first tiers of research you get all the discoveries, cutting out some potentially very difficult decisions. Later on you will need to make choices however, which is nice.*Combat is very boring. While you CAN control your ships to some extent, especially if you repeatedly pause and overview their orders, they fights mostly manage themselves rather quickly. In MoO2, combat was a great, it was the climax of the game, where you finally got to test your ship designs against the enemy, and where your actions and tactics mattered the most. It was far from perfect, but it had potential to be FUN. There were definitely possibilities to improve, perhaps by getting rid of the coarce grid, reducing fleet-sizes or making huge fleets easier to manage, adding MORE weapons types, tactical options, etc, etc. But rather then keeping what was good and improving on it, they decided to make combat uninspired, dull and nothing like Master of Orion 2. (It is pretty tho).*Ship customization was the last huge feature of Master of Orion 2. Each ship had a maximum mass, and you could add ANY mix of weapons and modules into it. Mostly, each type of weapon was interesting and offered a unique tactical option. The process of creating ships was always interesting and challenging. This new Master of Orion does, very unfortunately, dumb this down... I feel constricted when it comes to customization. Weapons feel bland and lacks uniqueness. This lack of interesting ship design also further hurts the already boring combat. I was hoping for a reinvention of one of the best games in history, an improvement on what already was great. But this is not that, at least not yet.If they want to get my thumbs up, and amount to anything but being another failed MoO2-clone in my opinion, they need to do a total design-makeover and adress the immense dumbing down of the races and technology, find a better and more interesting way to design ships (likely with more subsystems and weapons). And most important of all: make combat something that is actually something more then a mere cinematic experience with minimal interactions.I will ask for my moneys back, but I will keep my eyes on the game. Perhaps eventually it will grow to finally be a decent game. But I doubt that will happen, as major design changes rarely happen this late in production.[EDIT] Thinking about it some more; this game is actually not that bad if you don't compare it to MoO2, there are no obvious game-breaking features that actually ruins the game. If you are in the market for a uncomplicated, mainstream space-4x, you might very possibly enjoy the game.			"

								Just completed a run through and have to say they really kept it true to the origonal.  It was like meeting back up with an old friend.  The map, ship creation, research, and overall feel is all there.  However there is a few things I wouldn't mind seeing:1.)   I would love to have an option to enabled turn based combat, even tho the tatical combat is nice with live action, I still feel your more in a rail cart ride then controlling it at a deep level like Master of Orion II.  However as I got near the end of my play through I started getting used to it but a 3rd option for FULL turn base would be nice2.)  I'm not sure if it just because of early access but I would like to be able to turn some of my weapons off while in tactical mode.  This would add a nice level of demension for when you take control of your ship.  Many times I didn't want to use a weapon and wanted to hold it off till I was in a more tatical situation but was unable to disable the weapons.  Hopefully they will add this prior to release3.)  Some of the effects on some of the weapons I wouldn't mind seeing enhanced along with the sounds being improved.  The death ray for instance I didn't even know my ship was shooting them until I zoomed in.  The same goes for the steller converter and some of the missels.  You should be able to tell the weapons clearly apart from each other while being a little more zoomed out on the battle field.  Also the sounds should give some indication as to what is being fired to help assist with this.4.)  I would like to be able to drill into my ships settings after they are built without having to dive into the ship design.  There was a few times with tech being updated so frequently I wasn't sure if something got updated or not on a current ship.  Maybe there is a way to tell and I just didn't find it in the GUI but it would be nice if you could see the load outs of current ships on the map.5.)   More Skins on the ship design, I know its early access so this is probably coming6.)  Would be nice if there was some other mechanic other then your allies getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off when you won't give them a tech that is 3 jumps up the tech tree from where they are sitting.7.)  Being able to tell what tech level your opponents are at in the diplomatic screen would be nice as well, just a general score or something.  This could even be locked behind a tech but would be nice to know.  The new network thing tells you every now and then but its not that frequent.Aside from these small gripes its the best Master of Orion since Master of Orion II.  It will really bring home some good memories and some good times.  Looking forward to retail launch!Conslusion (8/10) would recommend to friends, with a good possibliity some of these small things could get ironed out prior to release. "

								This game is a really good game for being in Alpha.  It is crisp and responsive and has many ideas taken from the original.  There are still some elements not implemented yet but the parts of the game that are live seem to be glitch free.  As of fan of the original MoO I think this is a worthy successor.			"

								I loved the original, and I like this. As an early access version, the graphics are pretty great, and the sound and voice overs are awesome. I'd like to see the tech tree a bit more complex, and more complex ship design. I believe these are coming in later versions, and I'm excited to see what the release version will bring.			"

								Great game for how early access it is. Given enough time, this game could be a 9/10. In it's current state, I give it a 6.5/10, due to it's lack of depth, terrible AI, and just how easy it is. Only purchase if you want to support the devs/beta test the game.			"

								Yes, absolutely yes, I -can- recommend the new Master of Orion (4?) already now with tons of content still missingI consider myself a longtime fan of the series (by which I mean Master of Orion 1 and 2) and yes I was certainly not sure what to expect when I heard Wargaming Net had picked up the rights.Though I was happy Orion was finally seeing new life.For the most part? They've played it pretty safe,  you'll recognize the technologies, the alien species (based on Orion 1's style/look) being able to design ships and put them to good use.You'll reckognize tiny little details like the Master of Orion 1 colonization theme when establishing new colonies.You'll see creatures like giant ""Space Eels"" and many many other things you'll reckognize from the originals.That said? There have been changes, there's now a space-lane system (that you might reckognize from other4x games) rather than the fee jump where you want (that's within range) , to me this works, though you'll have to play the game differently (fortify key systems to avoid the enemy pushing through)So, if any enemy empire has hidden their weak/developing systems, behind an wall of fortified systems? That's to bad, you won't be able to hit them.As before you can simply ""roll"" the dice to see who win starship battles, or duke it out. Though ...the ""tactical"" combat leaves much to be desired for now, I imagine this will improve.Had they simply stolen ""Sid Meier's Starships"" combat, I would've happy with it.The game is still in early access, but it's already really well polished, there's obvious stuff missing (features and more playable aliens).  The potential fall for this series was a HUGE one,  I'm happy this game doesn't disappoint.Is it the deepest space strategy game out there?  Absolutely not, and that's a good thing in my mind. It's easy to get into, and there's definitely a lot of strategies to master.On a scale from F to A, I'd give it a B minus. I expect this grade to improve :D			"

								I feel it's way too premature to review this build. The package itself is a decent value purchase. There is a lot of work that needs to be done, more than I would expect for an initial early access on a major brand featuring the voice of Luke Skywalker. I'm worried that hype and brand is stronger than the content to drive sales. So far, I feel very skeptical while wishing a concerted effort to improve this game because I want it to be great. The AI is worst part right now as there is no challenge. The tech tree is far too linear and uninspired to be enjoyable. I feel like I'm being given the illusion of choice. It just doesn't feel tactical. A second, third, fourth, and fifth, playthrough and I can't seem to will myself to do any research choices differently. The advisors you are forced to interact with in game make you feel like a young child with the exception of the humans. I wasn't expecting that from a complex strategy game, and if I wanted a cartoonish casual experience I'd go play candy crush. Overall, there's potential, but there has to be some real changes in direction to encourage replay value, challenge, and choice. The graphics are much improved over previous titles, yet the interface isn't as good and often annoying. Think pop-ups and try not to puke. Package value and potential change from this early Alpha have me providing a thumbs up.			"

								This game is clearly based off Master of Orion 2 and has a distinct feeling of that game. I have to say I do prefer the art style of MOO2, this game is kind of cartoony the way the X-Com remake was compared to it's original. A lot of the functionality is still missing as this game is in early access, you can not make a custom race and about half of the races are still not playable.As far as I can see there are currently no sign of the Antarans and I am not sure if they will make it into the game in any way. In terms of bugs I have noticed some spelling mistakes in the game and a few glitches but nothing game breaking at all.If you are worried this game still has the stink left from MOO3 on it then you have nothing to worry about. It is far more like MOO2 than 3 although I personally still feel 2 is the better game at this point in development.			"

								I would like to start by saying I wish there was an indifferent option for reviews. Because I'm on the fence about this game and my review. There are many things I like and many I don't. Overall, though, I feel like it's a pretty decent game and if you like 4X games you should check it out - just be prepared for some of the cheese.Pros: Really polished graphics and effects, transitions, user interface, artwork - they spent a good amount of time making a refined, professional game that looks and feels good. The voice-over cast is amazing and they did a great job breathing life and character into the game. The gameplay is smooth and intuitive and allows simple management and stats without overloading you with information and details and micromanagement. Overall the FEEL of the game is excellent - one of the best-looking 4X games made to date. To summarize - the game is very pretty and gets a lot of geek cred for the voice actor fame. Fookin' space bears man!Cons: Beauty is only skin deep. While there are some interestingly new minor elements to this game, it's pretty instantly recognizable with (and almost identical to) it's genre brethren like GalCiv3 and Endless Space. In fact, if anything, MoO:CtS is a more simplified version of the two other games with fewer options and a scaled-back depth of gameplay and management. What's especially bothersome is that the tech tree FEELS completely ripped-off from GalCiv3, down to the names of the techs themselves and the weapon systems (not to mention the cheesy newscasters announcing empire/galactic events of note). After all that, they added space bears with cheesy Russian accents - I love space bears but giving them a stupid name like ""Bulrathi"" and giving them Russian accents... Oy 9.9Summing it up: Despite its cons, I still enjoy playing the game and it's very pretty to look at. The lack of depth also means you can play through it faster than its 4X brethren. It's also a lot easier without FEELING like it is - you still feel like you're about to be overwhelmed at any moment by the opponents ganging up on you even if they never have the teeth to back it up. Is it worth $50? Well, since you get all of the other MoO games bundled in with that and you can still get a refreshing, new 4X gameplay experience for a good 20-30 hours, I'd say yes. YMMV!			"

								For a lot of 'filthy casuals' and modern gamers this game is much more approachable than MoO2 will ever be - no matter what you try to do to it. The combat system was boring. The tech tree was enormous and a lot of it pointless - this game does away with a lot of what made it hard to get into MoO2 for a new player. The new MoO has virtually ignored Spreadsheets of Orion (MoO3) save for the starlanes (which is actually a pretty smart attempt to keep the map from being swarmed by one race through bottlenecks) and in simple speak this game is what it says it is on the cover.It is a reimagining (NOT a reboot or a remake - notice the word) of the ORIGINAL (MoO1 folks - not 2 or 3) Masters of Orion that is on a level that most casual and new players can enjoy without having to get out a txt file a mile long or cover their walls in spreadsheets.

								all I can say is my experiance.as a long time hard core 4x turn based strat gamer fan all I can sayfrom the bottom of my heart wargamer is thank you, thank you, thank you. its perfect (for early access).truly a worthy successor of MOOII. from what I have seen so far its like the producers plucked my dreams from my head and made it reality. I have always wished that what to me was the most perfect 4x game ever created-MOOII- was brought up to date graphicaly and fleshed out for todays computers. looks like you guys did it. in spades.you captured what to me made MOO 1 and 2 special, the perfect intersection of easy to access and engage UI and the deep balanced tech tree with rich diplomacy and espionage combined with nice and easy but deep ship design,for the perfect just one more turn addicting effect. THEN you added beautifull rich graphics and race specific intros, great voice work, everything i can imagine the original programers wished they wanted to do but could not because of tech limits. Then you stoped meddeling ""briliant because then you avoided loosing the magic alchemy of MOO and MOO2 and instead would have become the disapointing MOO3.  perfect.  Its christmas times 1000.great job!!! now the only problem remaining is how i justifytaking the next week off work lol.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxok seriously if you were a fan of the original legend MOO and MOOIIjust get this game. I wont say anymore other than bring a lot of tissue paperto mop up all the tears of joy you will be crying.again to the producers of the game.thank you from the bottom of my heartthanks for showing the gameing worldits not all about DLC and micro transactions.I can feel the love that was put into the game.for me it makes all the difference.

												It's too bad because it is a great game in theory, and you can see all the reasons why in other reviews, but I have never been able to actually complete a game. It takes longer and longer between turns until it reaches the 5-10 minute point, at which point I usually give up. Setting it to save only once every 10 turns instead of every turn does nothing to help this. I will recommend this when I can actually play it.			"

								Played through one full game last night as the Bulrathi.  This is definitely on the right track to relive the glory of the past MOO games.  It  should only get better.  Right now as it stands it played smoothly except they do need to may find a way to speed up the council voting sessions.  There was the only spot it seemed to dog down a bit on me with some time in between each one stating their vote and moving to the next.  Maybe a few more phrases would be nice during the voting too since I was already repeating their lines in my head on abstainting by the end.  The graphics are looking good.  The different lokoing ship designs I saw througout for each race are great.  The interface is overall a pretty easy to manipulate around to what you want. Diplomacy is there, but definitely feels like it is still a work in progress.  It seemed pretty swingy at points for the way they got angry over things and was pretty hard to raise for me it seemed.  I do like how if you are friends with a race and you try to be friendly with their enemies they take notice.  There was always that aspect where wars and treaties were concerned, but just in general they appeared to pay attention to even the smallest trade of information.Space pirates were kind of interesting, though never seemed much of an overall threat.  They did destroy a reasearch outpost on an asteroid field at one point on me when my ships were halfway across the galaxy hunting down the remanents of the humans.  Usually I hunted down where they were coming from, took out their base, and then found a planet in that system to settle to make sure they would not try coming back from there again.I wasn't sure if the Council voting was at set intervals/turn marks or if something else was triggering when those came up.  So was a bit annoying at the end when it was down to me, the Alkari, and Mrrshan and we were all just hanging around for the next vote.  I was pretty sure I could win the next vote on my own, but requested/bribed the Mrrshan to toss their vote in with mine to make sure it was sealed.  Things not in yet, but are coming and will greatly improve the feel of MOO:Spying:  There are some techs related to spying in the game right now, but none do anything since there is no spy network option.Race options:  Currently not in are some of my favorites including the Klackons, Darloks (makes sense with no spying and that being their strength), Meklar, and Silicioids.  Also no cusotm race.  However, they are greyed on on the startup selection screen so you do know all of those are coming :)Difficulty levels:  Right now can only play on average difficulty, which overall for veteran MOO fans or those that play other similar games a lot is just a walk through the park and enjoying yourself as you do.Would like to see: Planetary queue:  It'd be nice if I could queue up a few buildings/items at a time so I don't have to bounce back to the planets as often if everything is running well in the empire.  Obviously being able to modify/cancel the queued items will also be a plus in that situation.Galatic laws:  I could see this being a pretty cool addition if done right and let the council of races have something else to affect the state of the universe and of course relations depending on which side of the voting you go with.Technology splits:  I liked how some of the techs you were making the choice of which you would learn specifically and then you had to trade or eventually steal with espionage what you ddin't already learn.  I would like to see some more of those decitions within the tech trees, if it is possible wihout convoluting things way too far.			"

								I have to agree with most of the reviews.  For me, there are several failings:1)  Tech Tree.  It's basic.  There's no differentiation.  You plough through basically the same way regardless of race, and ultimately you don't really ""feel"" like any of it is making a difference.  You're simply clicking buttons to progress along the tree.  Sure, you're getting better ship firepower, but that's about it.2)  Race differentialtion.  There isn't any.  Yes, there's some pluses/minuses at the beginning but there's no feel for one race versus another.  Ships look a bit different, but as far as technologies go; you all have the same stuff.  The devs could learn a lot from Sins of s Solar Empire on this one.3)  Opponent AI.  It's terrible.  I managed to get everyone friendly and then ally with me.  Yes, all races.  You would think the game would be over since we're all in one big alliance.  No.  Then suddenly, one of them leaves the alliance and goes straight to hostile.  Not one other race keeps their word on the alliance.  They all leave, and all declare war on me the very next turn.  So don't bother with diplomacy.4)  Specialization.  It would be nice to have the ability for planets to be more specialized.  But you can basically build all developments on all planets.  Since you can terraform and even convert gas giants to planets laster in the game, there's almost no point in aggessive expansion.  All your planets can be turned quite habitable.  So, grab enough planets so you have have a solid defensive fleet...and sit there.  Race through the tech tree on the econmic advancements and get enough money to buy the market and win the econmic victory.  Every other victory takes much longer, and there's frankly no point.  Wars happen because of resource shortages.  Since you're not fighting over resources, then what?  They need a complete rethink and take notes from Civ 5.  Not everyone gets iron, oil, or aluminum.  Either trade for it, of fight for it.  That creates politics.  Since no planet (except for Orion itself) has any unique value, then I could care less fighting over any of it.5)  Pirates.  Outright atrocious.  They randomly spawn on any uninhabitable world and start creating ships.  Then they randomly attack anything they see, even if they are completely outmatched.  Again, Sins of a Solar Empire had a better pirate concept.  They were almost a faction of their own, and could be manipulated to attack your enemies.  I feel like they tried to go the Civ 5 route, but that doesn't make any sense in space.  This game is just way to dumbed down.  No one is going to play this game for 8 hours for a single playthrough for this dull of a game.			"

												It's not a terrible game in its own right, but compared to the original and MOO2 it is lacking.  There are no heroes and the gameplay is overly simplified.  If you played the first two in the series you will likely find this remake execptionally boring after a short period of time.  I wouldn't recommend spending more than $10 on it.  Perhaps it can be redeemed through DLC, but right now it's just not worth it.  It is really disappoing that both attempts to revive the series (MOO3 and this title) have really fallen short of even basic expectations.			"

								Masters of Orion 2 was on my list of top 10 games for their era.I think the people building this iteration of master of Orion want to recapture the magic of Masters of Orion 2, but bring things up to speed with the technology we have at hand. In that this game looks spot on. I do not see vast innovations in gameplay either, but this is better than changing what obviously worked so well.I have but one real complaint thus far, and because this is early access I won't get too upset about it just yet. I am playing on my MacBook Pro Retina on OS X Yosemite. It runs great, until for no discernable reason the game crashes. It crashes in a way that won't let me window out to Force Quit. I can move my mouse but not select anything, so I have to do an Emergency cold reboot. I was enjoying the game very much, until this issue. I have a request. Although I love the races in this game. I hope users will be able to use mods one day to load in new names for races, upload new alien race pictures, perhaps even upload new ship models into the races in play, if they feel like playing  private games with other well established science fiction milieus. Flexibility will make the game even more popular in certain circles.Anyways keep up the good work. I am going to be positive  and trust that the Mac crash problem will be resolved soon.Now someone please make a new version of Masters of Magic!			"

Early Access Review
								Master of Orion (reboot), so far ...(Editor's Note: I would classify this as ""Maybe"" as to ""Do you recommend this game?"", but there is no maybe catagory.  I would say on a scale of -10 to +10 it would fall around a 0 at this stage.)  Right now, what we have is a reboot of MoO II, with not all the functionality implimented, but with the graphics updated and reimagined.UPDATE: If you are looking for a remake/update of MoO II, this is not it!  It is a reimagining of the franchise into a ""beer and pretzils"" game that can be completed in an hour or so, reguardless of size or complexity settings.  Not much strategy involved, just build and kill.  Die hard fans of MoO II will be disappointed.  If you're open to a simple, not very involved game, much like World of Tanks or World of Warships, then you might warm up to what WG is serving up here.Graphics are what you would expect from WG, fantastic.Depth of gameplay is minimal at this time, only 6 races are included at present. (Warning: The voiceovers have been processed to the point of being nearly unrecognizable.  Dorn sounds like Shultz.  Pity, Dorn has a great voice.  Only Hamill's and deLancie's voice are identifiable.)Map is way too small for 5 races.  There needs to be a readjustment as to the size ranges as even the largest map is only sutiable for 3  players.AI all play the same.  The only distinction I see is the Sakkra breed like rabibits (despite the Buthri being the first to get three planets) and being the most agressive, usually win.  Psilons never seem to get a good setup with other races running into them by turn 5 or 6, even with three players.Latest hotfix seems to be moving things in the wrong direction.  AI home systems will be within 5 systems of yours, causing you to be hemmed in between all of them before turn 20.  Talk about strangling the baby in the crib.Diplomatic choices consist of extort, gift and war if you go with the default 5 AI players.  Also be prepaired to fight after getting your first colony as this will trigger the neighbors to curb stomp your butt.  On the other hand, if you start with fewer than 4 AI opponents, and you have the luck of a good set-up, then you have a chance to actually negotiate with the AI... for a while.  Fail to agree with the AI once triggers a negitive slide in relations.  A second disagreement with the AI's attempts at extortion are met with war.Research is pretty much ""choose, wait, complete, refit, rinse repeat"".  I presume this will improve, though it will be interesting to see how.  Also take note if the tech icons have a bar between them (the OR sign if you're a programmer) or not, if so, you only get one of the techs, which you get to choose after research is complete.As I proceed further and WG adds features I will update this review.  The skinny on this ""early access"" (2/26/2016) is ""Don't expect much right now.""Side Note: The early access also includes MoO I, II and III.  I have to say the folks at WG did a smashing job of repackaging these games.  MoO I and II run under Dosbox, MoO I is a bit finicky though and will crash on start up unless you set Dosbox to the game's original resolution (800x600).  MoO II runs flawlessly.  What really amazes me is they managed to repackage MoO III to run without having to install all the crap that it required when it was relesed.  My psyche still bears the scars of making my system unstable just to ""run"" (using the term loosely) the darn thing and arguing with the developers that it was a stupid idea to have 4 external dependancies.  Good Job WG!			"

								Although in Early Access, this game feels a lot like a finished title - WG Labs has done a pretty good job at recapturing the classic feel of Master of Orion in this reboot of the series.  A lot of people complain about some of the game's systems being 'dumbed-down' but if you are going to reboot the entire series, perhaps approaching the newbie to get them into the franchise is a good thing.There are some rough edges, truth be told - but the developer seems to be actively working on it, so I'd have to give this two bear thumbs up!

This impression is based on playing 36 hours of the Early Access game.Even in the early access state, this is a very enjoyable space 4X game with the following standout attributes:Well designed, intuitive UI that provides easy access to fleet control, research, and colony managementGreat graphics all around (planets, ships, and cutscenes)Visually impressive, cinematic battlesGood game pacing, eliciting strong a ""one more turn..."" urgeThere is only one big gameplay issue that may turn people away - the choice to have all battles played in real time (with slowing & pausing) rather than the turn-based in previous versions of the game.  This is a personal preference that some players may strongly object to.  I played both the original MOO and MOO2 and loved them both and find this version as fun as the originals.There are other gameplay tuning aspects that anyone could make about the game in its current Early Release state.  These include number of playable races, diversity of the tech tree, quality of the AI, etc.  I would fully expect these to improve as the release date approaches.  Nonetheless, I am thoroughly enjoying the game across multiple replays even in its current state.			"

								I haven't really done any reviews up until now but after seeing some of the negative reviews i thought I'd clear things up a bit. I'm old fan of the Master of Orion series so I will compare it a lot to the best one in the series MoO2.The developers took the same road Firaxis took while making the new XCOM Enemy Uknown compared to the 20 years old game. The extreme micromanagement has been dumbed down which is not a very bad thing. This new game has some very good ideas into it and still it keeps the old spirit in place.I know a lot of people are complaining that quite few aspects of the game are missing but this is an EARLY ACCESS!!! The developers have pointed out that a lot more is incoming before the game is officially released.I would recommend every fan of the Master of Orion universe and any 4X space fan to give this game a try and support it so we can make it become the real MoO2 successor!

								If you like 4x Games, this is a pretty good one. Not playing the other 3 Master of Orion games, this review comes from a brand new player.The $50 price tag is a little high, but it is collectors edition with the other 3 MOO games in the bundle. It may be more suiting to see if this game goes solo and get a cheaper price.With voice actors from Star Trek, Star Wars, and other well known sci-fi tv shows and movies,  the developer has put alot of time and money into this game.It's only early access now but it looks and plays great. It looks like a Triple A game.There's some things that need to be worked on and fixed, but that's a given for an early access game. Nothing is game breaking and it works great. "

								Recommended for big MoO fans. It's a lot like MoO2. Almost too much, at times, but it's a great game. Still, I would like to see more original stuff in there. I'm hoping that they expand it with DLC much like Stardock has worked on Galactic Civilizations.That said, this is still in Early Access. There are many big pieces missing. Get it now if you are a huge MoO fan or interested in the genre--if you don't have MoO 1 or MoO 2 they are great games that are still worth playing, and the come bundled with the Early Access last time I checked.I am optimistic about the game, but ultimately I do hope there is more depth added in the core game and into the future with DLC.

												I wanted to like this game, but unfortunately I could not play more than an hour or so. At some point, I need to block a pirate fleet in a node. I set my fleet to block, and when the pirates arrive, I say Simulate. The game goes in an infinite loop, nothing happens. No problem I say, I will play manually. Alt-F4, reload, then the manual play button is not there! All I can is Simulate, with the inevitable infinite loop.OK, I say, I will take the fleet off block, and just initiate the battle myself and fight manually. Alt-F4, reload, start battle. 10 seconds into battle, infinite loop again. Parts of the interface were still working, but play/pause were doing nothing. If the game is not able to handle a 2 vs 2 ship battle, sorry. Refund time. May buy again if ever it's fixed, but taking into consideration that over 8 months have passed since release, I won't hold my breath. Playing MOO2 now.			"

It's amazing, worth the money, and they're hard a work to make it good.  It's got some bugs (duh its EA), but I feel this is the right direction for Moo, and hope you try it out for yourself!

Early Access Review
								Recommended, with a but...I played a vast amount of MoO2, and I've spent decades waiting for a worthy successor.  I've enjoyed many 4X space games, but all of them had something that made them not quite as engaging as the granddaddy of them all.  In that sense, it's nice to see the Psilons or the hapless Bulrathi back.Unfortunately, in its current state, nostalgia is what the MoO reboot primarily offers.  The game plays essentially like MoO2 with some relatively minor gameplay changes.  The tech tree will be instantly recognizable to a MoO2 player, as will most elements of planet management, ship design, and overall strategy.  Real-time pauseable combat is new, but not terribly engaging, since most battles involve no more strategy than ""fly straight at the enemy and open fire"".In theory, I'd like to say there's nothing wrong with a new MoO2 updated to modern graphics.  But the reality is, as much as prior 4X games might not have unseated MoO2 as the best of the breed, they've each done interesting things.  Endless Space had neat unique planets plugged into a complex backstory, GalCiv III had complex ship design and a more strategic feel, and I was even a fan of MoO3's planet habitability and client species spontaneously colonizing your worlds.  You'd hope that the MoO reboot would incorporate some of the positive developments of the last 20 years without losing what made the original game great.  Unfortunately, at least in its current version, there's not much more game than we had in the 90s.  So at the moment I find myself hopeful that there's a lot more coming in Early Access than what we've seen right now.TL;DR: A gentle recommendation for nostalgia's sake; otherwise, wait to see how Early Access comes out.

Early Access Review
Time to be honest (take 2)Some time ago I wrote a very negative review during the early alpha of this game. But many things have changed since then, and it is fair that I write a new one now.Interface, graphics and soundtrackThe interface in this new MOO is really similar to its predecessors. It has, however, some new tabs that are a delight for the macromanegement fans. The Empire Tab, that permits you to change your taxes, check all your colonies' production, research and food generation, as well as checking in a glimpse what each one is producing. The diplomatic menu is simple and intuitive, as well as the ship production one (but I'll go in detail about this one later). However I find that the fleet menu is useless -I literally could not find an space factory using it!Graphics are beautiful and work very well in the MOO game style. While they are not excellent, they are pretty enough to make your MOO experience appealing. The planet zoom looks gorgeous, with the colony lights, aerospace traffic, etc. The soundtrack follows the same path: It's not a OST that I would listen normally, but it works fairly well with the game itself. Ship designThe ship design is here this time, and it works fairly well. However I noticed that it has some problems; more particularly, your own designs may not work at all if you auto resolve the battles. In one example, if you design a missile specialist ship to stay behind the main combat line, you may find in auto resolve that your ship will be the first to die -as its defense values will be very low-.This may force you to control your own ships directly. On the other hand, while the ship designer is quite easy to use, it REALLY needs a filter system for the weapons and systems. DiplomacyAll right, now I can say this: it works. Previously all diplomatic stuff would go like ""give me that or I get grumpy"". This time I found more interesting things: alliance requests, allies driving you to war against another ally, requests to stop colonizing, and many ways to influence your relationship with the AI. Not a really complex mechanic, but yet complex enough to make you consider the diplomatic impact of your actions. ""If I ally the terran, would the humans get angry at me?"". Spies are thereThe spy system is very nice, indeed. You get your spies, infiltrate them in an enemy planet, and start performing your operations. The problems I see: First, it is absurdly difficult to accomplish a ""3rd level"" operation. Even with the darlok and specialized in spying, I manage to accomplish maybe 3 out of 200 failures. I also see that the AI will never kill one of your spies if they catch it. No matter if you are at full war, they will always deport the spy back. Thank you, AI!The diplomatic consequences of spying are really something to keep in mind. It could literally change a relation from ""friendly"" to ""Cautious"" in just one turn.Game changing: RTS space battlesAnd FINALLY they work properly! Basically, you can either full control the ships yourself or let the AI assist you. And the AI this time is smart enough! Ok, it uses pretty pre-programmed movements -battleships and bigger ships to the front, while frigates and destroyers try to flank the enemy-. But the important bit is that it really works, creating space battles that are realistic enough to enjoy.Still, the cinematic camera is very bad.Final review:Previously I said that this game was not worth being part of the MOO saga. Proudly I retract my words: After the last changes, Master of Orion is a very good relaunch for this franchise, and I recommend it to any 4x fan.			"

								From what I've seen so far Master of Orion is a modernized version of Master of Orion 1 with elements from Master of Orion 2. Artwork and general production values are extremely high, the voice acting is a nice touch.I am an avid fan of both MoO and its sequel and so far I am enjoying this game very much. It has a slightly different feel than the originals but it's definitely a strong 4x title. The realtime combat may be unexpected in a game calling itself a Master of Orion remake/reboot, but works pretty well and is in my opinion superior to the turn-based combat in MoO 2 which could sometimes turn into a chore especially in the late game. Starlanes are also something which I usually don't like and which are new in a MoO game but it works surprisingly well and leads to a lot of interesting gaming choices and opportunities. Pros:- Great visuals, awesome production values overall- Very stable for an early access title- Feels definitely like a MoO game- The UI is modern and very user friendly- The starlanes add a lot of strategic opportunities to the gameCons:- 4 races and a couple of features (like spying, several victory conditions etc.) haven't been implemented yet- No tactical combat in multiplayerOverall I am enjoying the game a lot and at least in my opinion it's a worthy successor. If you expect a 100% copy of the older games with visual improvements you'll probably not like this title, but if you are open to the thought of a new interpretation of the source material you might be in for a treat.

Otherwise the Terran are interesting to play with. They like you a lot if you're willing to go to war with a lot of different races.			"

It really does feel like it will be a true successor to MoO 2.There are a few graphical bugs.  Sometimes my fleet fires weapons, but I don't see it.  Sometimes I click on something and nothing happens, but it works when I click again.  None of these are major issues.TL;DR:  The game is unfinished but playable.  A few minor bugs.

												I have to say that this is just a very generic and bland 4x game. Nothing unique about it. It doesn't bring anything new to the genre or implements one of the well known mechanics in an outstanding way. In comparison to MOO2 it has lost a good portion of its charm. Most of the entertaining elements and game mechanics have been simplified to an extent that it is just boring.- Ship-Design is so simplified that they could have left it out- Combat is so boring- Travel is now limited to fixed routes- DLCs for races that used to be core racesI cannot recommend it. There are a lot of other 4x games on the market that are way more entertaining.			"

								Generally I am hesitant to purchase early access games, but I did so with MoO as I knew I'd be playing it. I sat down just to give it a try and...well there went five hours! I highly enjoy the new incarnation of this game. It's simple to learn and control, but has enough depth to keep me interested. The Early Access is stable (no crashes at all in a 5 hour play session) and the game is surprisingly polished. There are a few features that will clearly be added later such as espionage, but I didn't feel like I was missing any major part of the game when playing it. At first I thought the real-time combat might not be as fun as the more traditional turn-based, but it's quick and easy and pretty to watch. The entire game is pretty gorgeous so far. All in all, if you like 4x space games, this one is going to be a keeper!			"

Early Access Review
								new review December 2016: Well then, currently this is Civilization in space. With starlanes. And a loss of immersion by all races being very much alike. 10 months ago I thought the game was on a good track to become a worthy successor, but so far it didn't manage to become that - well, hope dies last. The way that game is at this moment, I'd recommend it to newbies in the 4x genre but pretty much to noone else. It lacks depth, becomes monotonous rather fast and imho the only way to play it is snowballing faster than everyone else - most races are suited for that.Still not sad to have bought it, as early access gave me copies of MoO 1 and 2 (and the lamentable third part which noone like to speak of), but as a game it does not hold the thrill of the originals nor their depth nor their complexity. Therefore I spend my time in Stellaris and MoO2, letting this game slowly rot in my library.So, current oppinion: Nice 4x starter with obnoxious advisors, low complexity and nice artwork. Not a game recommended for anyone who liked the gameplay of the old series though.old Review from February 2016: Well, after a playthrough of one game of Master of Orion 2 and this new iteration of the series, I feel it is prudent to write a review ;)First of all, it is NOT a real remake, but a reinterpretation. Secondly, this reinterpretation is done as faithful as can be (within reason). You'll  find lots of techs, buildings and modules that are basically the same in both games. At the time of this review, there are only 6 playable races, all of which have the flair of their counterparts of old. No, Psilons might not be creative any more, but their research boost is gargantuan if you tend to expand a lot like me.All in all, this is the first game that might really be a successor to the heritage of Moo and Moo2. Keep up the good work!			"

								When I discovered this had been released, I was very excited.  I saw ""Mostly Positive"" and read the reviews, because I felt burned by Master of Orion III and I didn't want to waste $50.  It scared the hell out of me that all the reviews were negative.  It gave me the impression that I shouldn't buy it, and I carried a bitter taste in my mouth for a couple hours.  Then I decided to do it.  I played MOO1 when it was a new release, and I keep the disks on my desktop.  (the only floppies I have that are not in the attic)  I'm a game developer, and this game has always been a personal inspiration.So this review is coming from someone who knows and loves MOO.  I think this game is every step in the right direction.  I had so many concerns, and now I have none.  It looks to me like the designers went back to MOO1 and updated it.  I notice this isn't MOO4, it's MOO:CTS, right?  You could call it MOO4, if you wanted, but that sort of validates MOO2 and MOO3.  Now, I got MOO2 on release day, and I played the hell out of it and enjoyed myself very much.  I don't keep the CD on my desk, though.  I'll probably never play it again.  So I'm now happy to forget MOO2 and MOO3 existed, because these wonderful people have remastered a classic.Each part of the game stays true to the original, yet is reimagined using modern game development techniques.  Systems are fun to fly around, look great, and make good strategic choke points.  Ship Design and Tech Trees have familiar technologies.  Planetary economies are simple to manage.  Realtime combat is great.  I am very happy with the decisions that the designers have made.  It is a beautiful game, and lots of fun.When I reread the negative reviews now, they look like a bunch of people who don't understand the concept of Early Access, and that upset me enough to come on here and share.  I am a fan of the original MOO.  I enjoyed MOO2.  I thought MOO3 was horrible.  This game is MOO 2016, and it does justice to the original.			"

								If you ask me, and you have done by reading this. Wargaming has made not only THE best remake they could have made of MoO they have also made theire best game so far. The graphics are great, the voiceovers are not intrusive or boring, balance seems to be good allaround. The diference in the races are immersive and not game braking. All in all if you are at all in too 4x games this is the title you want this year. Plus if you buy the collectors editon you acctualy get 4 games. 2 thumbs up, keep up the good work Wargaming.			"

								I played the original Orion some 20 years ago and I loved it. I even bought a new computer to make sure I had the hardware to run the second when it was released. I played many hours and had a blast.This new one is going to be as good or maybe even better then any of the others. I strongly believe so and I recommend both new and old gamers to get this game. Its simple right now and no challenge to play the AI yet, but all the good basics are in place. Some tweaks here and there and some more content ( thats is promised to come) and this game will be THE game of this year.			"

								Great game, and it feels a lot like MOO2.The only thing I don't really like, is that battles are instantly calculated when battling in multiplayer. I understand that it's hard for them to implement a turn-based or real-time in multiplayer; but they can still take a different approach, similar to Civ 5, where it shows a bare clip of the battle (I know Civ 5 isn't the best example here, since it's really rough), and gives you a preview of the battle. It's hard to swallow losing a bunch of ships, when it all happens in the background.			"

												Cons:1) Diplomacy = AI's proposals are ridiculous, and it almost never agrees to yours:E.g,Neutral AI gives 10 gold + their map, and for that generous proposal I should start war against their enemy. If I refuse, AI gots massive relationship hit with me. Funny? Not at all.Another example, AI asks to open borders, but refuses not to settle colonies near you, and then gets mad when you close your borders.2) Ship Design = cool at first sight; but much worse when you get into it, resulting in ""more guns = win"".Almost all modules are horribly worse compared to additional weapons.3) Warfare = waiting game if you want to conquer:just wait for midgame massive ships... and wait again for AI to get into another war and then declare on it...  and then wait again to build your troop-ships who will sieze planets...   and then wait again and again to gather all them in one sector, so that you can destroy any enemy fleet...    and after that wait again to build your troop-ships who will sieze planets (they are disposable)...     and after that wait again some more time to gather all in one sector, so that troop-ships won't be destroyed...      and even after this and that wait some more time again...4) Economy = two ways: rush to +5 population // +2 additional gold per population; OR conquer (not colonize!) more planets.Otherwise, buildings, including defensive ones, will eat all your surplus.5) Assistant voices = female voices are nice, but other squeezy 'alien' voices are a way to harsh for my ears.6) Technology = you need to frequently choose one of two/three bonuses; although, you can still trade the other bonus with an AI, but it is dumb and dully stubborn in its considerations.7) Polution = the more you have workers and the better is your planet, the more polution you produce.This means that a dump with -150 polution is the only reasonable choice in technology tree.8) Warfare 2 = loosing a massive battle is a disaster, especially for AI. They never have even a ghostly chance to get back on their feet, so they are eventually conquered.9) Espionage = you can easily play without any of them.Pros:1) Graphics = A+ for 4x space game.2) General gameplay = despite all the cons, this is still a good game to play for several days (it becomes too bo-o-oring early).

												Master of Orion is a pretty neatly polished game. Overall I havent really seen that many bugs, and there still seems to be patches coming out regularly. When I first saw this game on steam (trailers) I was super excited, it reminded me of the game we all knew and came to love. But thats where it all ends.Moo2 is probably the game that I wanted this to be like, unfortunatly its not. Games like Stellaris and Star Drive 2 are more fun, dont fall into the trap I did.			"

								Does a reasonably good job at generating the MOO feeling in a soothing modern jacket.SP is okay, AI is way too dumb though. Also there are many (minor) bugs and a lot of tweaks are necessary (I will not sum them up here to avoid TLDR and they are mentioned in this forum extensively already anyway).Where the game convinced me was in MP. I play MOO2 a lot with a friend, so we couldn't wait to try it out. We had issues to start a game, but with some help we managed to start a game. Boy, were we in for a treat. We started at 10pm just to check it out but continued till 4AM.... The 'one-more-turn'-syndrome is strong in this one :)No it is not MOO1 or MOO2 but as a MOO enthusiast I am happy with this game as long as they finish the game properly (that is fix the bugs/issues and tweak it properly).I'm okay with the RT combat, as long as they improve that.7/10 right now. Will probably become a 8/10 after EA and has the chance to be 8.5/10 or 9/10 if they really push it.			"

Early Access Review
								This so far is a great game. The main difference here is that this new MO is made for multiplayer. Just try it if you haven't.This is just the beggining and there is much more content to come for sure. Key points of notice so far:1. Star lanes is a huge + to gameplay as it makes  for a much more strategic game. In MO2 without warp inhibitor it would be impossible to stop all e nemy invasions at once when they have good drives. I think that was MO2's weakest feature although still a great game.2. Missles were fairly useless in MO2 past mid tere. In this version they seem uber powerfull. I don't think they need  nerf just a study of the eefectiveness of counter measures. ECM seems uselesss so far.3. AI needs work. That is almost 100% certain for any new strategy game.4. A better outline of each races special attributes is needed. I think though the creators f the game are planning to release this when the full version comes out.5. Enabling tactical combat for multi-player is a must. I'm undecided if the game needs the old style tactical from MO2 back. It may make multi player games to dragged out. The new stye tactical combat does have some great benefits for what it sacrifices from the old turn based,. Time efficient resolve, a more realistic battle sim and you still have full control of the ships.That's it for now enjoy.			"

Early Access Review
								Very similar to Master of Orion 2 (this review requires some knowledge of Moo2).  I sat down and couldn't stop playing it.  A few differences that could be seen as detractors to some.  This is going to sound like a giant bash of the game, but I'm just putting the difference out there, I'm not going to stop playing it anytime soon.  Tactical combat is real time - however you can pause during it, so not sure why so many people don't like it.  There is less to do in combat, you can make your large ships go first, eat some shots and make your small ships move in to do more damage.  You can also position your ships behind asteroids and missles hit them (a really cool addition to the original).  I like the combat myself, but right now you can't disable weapons and select specific ones like you could in Moo2 (say to stop your missles shooting an asteroid).  Ship building is also fairly difficult because you cannot chose to refit specific ships in a specific manner, this ability to micro might be added later, but for now you have to change your base design, then either refit or build a battleship, if you go to upgrade it later because you got better armor or shield tech, you have to redo the schematic.  To refit or upgrade a ship there isn't a production option, the only way is to spend credits on it at a starbase or starlanebase.It feels like food and population growth is too easy, you are able to farm ""barren"" planets, and with soil enrichment technologies, they provide alot.  I haven't yet settled on ""toxic"" or ""volcanic"" planets... so maybe barren just got an upgrade.The Diplomatic victory is a misnomer - right now it's all about your current popluation (other races don't have to like you, you can be at war with them all).   If you can grow your empire enough, you win the game if you have over 66% of the galactic population.  That does seem like alot, but I've won 5 games by just expanding and maxing food growth - all vs the standard AI.  It seems like with the current setup you'd never win by pure combat - the vote would probably finish when you conqured 2/3 the galaxy.  Also, if you start to conqure the more numerous faction you are likely to win faster.  Obviously the AI is weak, and technology victory isn't in the game.  Actually I think I would have won all 5 games with tech victory faster then dipolmatic, so I guess it's a moot point, still strange there is no diplomacy involved.Heavy/Low gravity needs balance - Low gravity isn't a negitive at the moment, you can still settle on ""normal planets"" - actually Low grav is a bonus, I'm pretty sure if you have lowG you can settle low and normal with no penalty and HighG with -50%.  If you are normal low and highG get you -50%.   Moo2 was HighG = no penalty (maybe -25% on lowG it cost points to pick up), LowG -25% on normal and -50% on highG (it gave you points to spend).   Normal was -25% on Low and HighOne of the biggest changes is there is no ""creative"" - you get all the techs, except a few where every race has to pick between two or three choices.  Some are really tough, you have to pick heavy armor OR reinforced hull, you can never have both.  This is a good balance option and hopefully the AI choses different things so you can either trade or steal it from them (spying not in game as of yet).Oh another big change is ""Starlanes"".  I actually really like the stratical implication of this and is one of the best things.  Every star system has only a few ways to access it, and from only specific other systems.  This creates chokepoints, and makes it much easier to decide where to go. I have settled on farther planets with less physical value (poor/small etc), just because it protects 1 or 2 other systems that I want full control over later.  One game I settled pretty far out and close to an AI, and he got completly boxed in by myself and another AI and only had access to 3 systems...  It does make actually finding your way to Orion much harder though, there is an ""open borders"" option in diplomacy, so I guess you can spend a few credits or whatnot to get through someones terrian.In Moo2, you kinda had to have your fleet centralized near important planets, then once you saw someone moving there, you'd have to respond.  I never really played multiplayer, but I think it would be impossible to defend anything, because once you got tech to tell your ships to change direction, you could tell them to go to somewhere nearby, and just instantly stop at a closer planet... there was a tech to help prevent that and increase movement to it, but seems kinda silly.One thing I'd love to see in the game is ship and colony heroes, but they have some touching up and retweaking ship design and refits before a custom ship hero is going to do too much.  At first I was thinking of putting off my purchase until they got added, but after reading everyone elses review and the forums I decided that heroes are just kinda a garnish add-on that make the game fun to player longer.I have no idea how long this is, and I've probably skipped some changes (well there are no antarians... no ship to ship combat or boarding - one of the best things ever in moo2 was capturing an antarian ship and scrapping or using it with its really good tech)TLDR;A few changes - Still Moo IMO - I love the game.

								Since this is an Early Access game, its a subject of change, so I tried to focus more for the recent reviews, than the older ones, yet, I was a bit worried. Then a fellow forum mate told me that its a pretty fine MoO game... I LOVE the second game, so I wanted a good MoO game soo much. So I bought it... This review is based on my first 10-12 hours of gameplay:Man this game is fun even in this stage. The graphics is beautiful, the races and the characters (leaders, advisors) are great, and the voiceover... They nailed it. The pollution has now an actual effect (I always ignored this in MoO2, i could win without dealing with it), you can build on gas giants, asteroids, etc. Its much more limited (but more logical) how you can pass people from one planet to another, the time when you could jumpstart a new colony with near-full population in a couple of rounds are over. The ship upgrades are more convenient, the tech matrix need some re-learning, but its ok... The space battles are quite spectacular (especially when you arrive), but a bit chaotic for me, at least now. Ofc there is plenty of space for improvement. I would like to see more ship design per race (I like the Meklar race, but I dont like their ships), it would be great if you could choose your color, and ofc more custom race skills and talents... I can't decide about the AI yet, since I played just an easy and a normal game for checking my possibilities. Nonetheless, I recommend this game for the 4X fans.Edit #1: With the EA3, we got 2 new races and spying. You can finally turn off the advisor talk and popup, so its definately an upgrade over EA2... And most importantly... It keeps sucking me back into game. I play a ""round"", after 10+ hours I'm done and I had enough from this game... But after 2-3 weeks, I just want to play again. And that is good. Edit: possibly more comments will come later on.			"

Early Access Review
								After 21 hours into the game, I can definitely say I recomment this game IF, they continue to improve it. If Civilization 5 and MOO2 had a baby, it would be this game. I'm a 35ish year old man-baby who loved Moo2, so the main reason I bought the game was that MOO2 was include with it as I lost my DOSBOX version. The Steam version is still just the DOSBOX version, but that's ok... at least i won't lose it. Pro/con time.PRO:Draws heavily from MOO2/CivilizationPlays very smoothly and quickly, even on large maps you're not waiting too long between end turn clicks.CON:1) AI is very bad. 2) Only half the races are available.3) Only two options for spaceship design per class.4) Most of the game is clicking until you watch a cutscene.5) Autobuild queue not customizable, it just starts building crap instantly.6) Music repetitive.7) Leader is not customizable at all. 8) No random heroes to pilot your ships.9) Blueprint/upgrading your fleet is still a mystery to me after 21 hours and multiple playthroughts.10) Too many cutscenes, which are nice, but if you've seen it once you've seen it enough and they play all the time. 11) Very limitted map design, every map feels roughly the same. 12) Lack of options to change things such as disabling tutorial, or turning off cutscenes,13) Too easy.14) Spend most of your time moving around the map, constantly zooming in and out as the game will force you to change zoom levels when events happen.15) Tactical combat is severely limitted, best you can do is maybe avoid a missle by luckily moving behind an astroid or adjust which ships arrive to the enemy first. 16) Most games turn into a game of clicking next turn while you sit in a stalemate with your enemies until you get a DOOM/TITAN class ship to destroy them or win the Elections.So the CON list is much bigger than the PRO list, but most of the CON list is stuff i hope to attribute it to be a non-complete game. And despite this list, this game still stole two of my days away almost completely and I don't regret an ounce of it, but i still had an enjoyable time playing the game in the current state and look forward to spending many more hours into it as it becomes complete.

								Really good game for fans of Master of Orion 2 or Civilization series. It combines old Moo2 elements with modern game design from latest Civ games. One minus for me is that you can't refit ships with production like you could in Moo2. At the moment only way to refit is by credits and that sucks.			"

												Most recent changes totally ruin a game that was needing good improvements to begin with. This is a step backwards. I will save myself time. Read the other reviews about gravity, changing up custom settings point values, and for me the big one; choosing a bonus item to already be researched through custom character no longer works at all.Edited 12/4/16: Making me pay for fixes to correct problems from their last patch as part of a DLC is unacceptable. Adding AI improvements that the community asked for and then telling us we listened to what the community wanted and charging me for it is also ridiculous. Charge people for the 3 new races if they want it. Do not charge me money for something the community asked for as part of AI improvements or reversing a previous patch that was bad. I am done supporting this Dev! One member of the community you claim to listen to has spoken!			"

								So far this early access game has a surprising amount of polish. I enjoy the new additions as well as the classic aspects taken from the original game. Given this isn't a final released game there are some iterations that are ongoing on balance and some further tweaks and bug fixes needed however it runs well on my system with no crashes to date and only some slight frame rate drops in massive tactical battles. I am also running it at 4k so it's probably not the most optimized resolution. I enjoy the real time tactical combat and the voice acting is superb!			"

								EARLY ACCESS REVIEWI have played four full games versus AI with various parameters and I believe I have enough game time under my belt to do an intelligent early access review.  I am a long-time fan of the Master of Orion IP and I must have played hundreds of MOO2 games.MOO is well polished considering it’s an early access title.  The game did not crash once and performance was excellent. There were no hiccups or glitches as far as I could tell.  There were some minor UI errors that caused some data to not display correctly and the game does not scale for various resolutions perfectly.  It’s a solid base for a game with excellent voice acting.  (Mark Hamill, John de Lancie, and Michael Dorn!)Early access is missing a great deal of content including 5 races (6 if you count the missing custom race), two victory conditions, and certain game mechanics like spies and leaders.  Also you can currently only play on ‘average’ difficulty with a maximum of 6 total players and limited galaxy selections.  Games are quite easy to win if you’re a veteran 4x, turn-based player. As expected, there are no dedicated multiplayer servers, but multiplayer players of this genre tend to only play with close friends anyways so I don’t see this as a negative.  Ship to ship combat is in real time and works well, but actions and choices are limited to fleet formation and movement.  Otherwise combat is quite automated.  This is a negative for those players that enjoyed the turn-based combat of MOO2.  Ground combat is very basic (well, non-existent) in the current build.  Conclusion:  If you are a fan of the Master of Orion franchise and certain that you will buy the game no matter what, by all means purchase the collector’s edition. For those of you looking for a challenging, complete-game experience, you will want to wait until release.  Also there will be a version of the game offered for around $30 so if you’re really on the fence, wait for that.  In its current condition the early access game is appropriate for nostalgic, die-hard fans and players that have already decided to buy the game no matter what.You can check out the game on my stream at Twitch.tv/purplepoloplayer "

												As someone who did play the original MOO but was never really a fanboy of it, I came into this reboot with less lofty expectations than many others.  But even still I was left disappointed after my initial attempts at the game.For starters, there is no readily accessible manual.  Not a huge issue, really: you've played one 4X game and you've played them all, and there is a ""tutorial campaign"" provided...which appeared to last for about 4 turns until it just assumed I've got everything.  Again, not a gamebreaker, just a bit of a put-off.The game itself is the gamebreaker.  Initial attempts at a playthrough resulted in many resets as I slowly figured out that the AI will destroy my ships without warning if I happen to blunder into ""their"" territory (which isn't really marked during the early stages of the game), yet will merrily cruise right through my own star systems with their unarmed scouts.  Several of the special attributes granted to the various races in the game (or to your custom race builds) don't work; specifically, anything which says it grants a technology, doesn't.  The UI is clumsy, to put it kindly: at the beginning of a turn you are inundated with alerts on the right side of the screen, letting you know any time a planet's population grows, or a construction project is completed, or a threatening fleet is nearby (even if it's just the space eel that's happily flitting back and forth between the planets in a neighboring system), or a technology has been researched, or a crisis is going on anywhere in your empire, or...you get the picture.  On a small map this became an issue in the late game; I can only imagine how bad it would be on in a huge galaxy.  So you've got this notification telling you that your capital has just grown in size, so you click on it and see that it's also finished building whatever it was building (exactly what that was is not displayed on the planet screen.  Anywhere).  You plop your citizen into whichever slot you want him in, click on the empty build queue, choose a new project, click on that, click on the button to close that screen, go back over and click on the next ""alert"" icon...and end up right back on your home planet screen, because that was the alert letting you know that it'd finished building whatever it built.Every time you research a new technology which grants any new weapons, modules, improvements, or whatever for any of your combat ships...hoo boy.  First you're going to click on the screen letting you know that you've finished researching whatever and letting you know what you can do with that technology.  Then you are automatically going to go to the ""blueprints"" page to change your ship designs...all of them.  With every new tech.  Which merely involves clicking on the desired ship design, then clicking on the ""edit"" button, then clicking on whichever hull slot you want to change, then going back and forth a couple times because it doesn't allow you to compare the old weapon setup vs. the new one, then finally figuring out exactly what you want & will actually fit into the hull, saving it, and...doing the whole process again, for each individual ship class.  With.  Every.  Tech.  You.  Research.Then you will inevitably run into the bugs.  And I mean the good ol' fashioned bugs in the software, and not the insectoid race in the game.  Once upon a time those were ironed out before a game was shown to the public.  Then progress meant that they were fixed during live beta tests with volunteer gamers.  Now, you're offered a convenient ""Report Bug"" feature right there on the in-game options menu.  No, seriously.  I discovered that if I clicked on a specific alert, it caused an infinite loading loop in the game.  I discovered that if I go for a technological victory and opt not to build the final piece of the game-winning item in the first city screen that happens to open...well, that option is gone.  Forever.  Kind of annoying after 450+ turns of gameplay.Others have pointed out that there ~are~ good things about this game: the graphics are beautiful, except that after the first couple times you see the same cutaway showing your colony ship landing on a barren planet, or the leaders of each race teleporting onto a platform in the middle of an asteroid belt to cast votes for galactic leader, or the robotic news team letting you know about the latest disaster to befall your empire...well, you're just going to be mashing the escape key to skip them.  Many technologies that you research cleverly give you the option of unlocking this ~or~ that, with the various items geared toward specific game strategies...but this promising aspect of the game is undone by the fact that you can then go back and trade with other races to gain whichever capabilities you didn't choose (or play as the Psilons and get all of them).  The ship design tool can be interesting, and offers you the ability to cater your blueprints to counter a specific threat from a neighboring race...until you get to the end game, and it's just a matter of cramming as many doomsday weapons as possible into your death stars.  In the end, this is litle more than a diversion which I can't see myself putting more than a dozen gameplays into...and even then only if they fix all these gamebreaking bugs.			"

Early Access Review
								I completely fell in love with this game. If your a syfy geek this game is a must have however there are some pros and cons to this game that I will go over.Pros: 1. This game is exremelely easy to control and understand how to play.2.Plenty of story for all the races even if their is no campaign.3. There is a progression system for your technology research and what you decide to research will affect you later on in your mission.4.  Plenty of sizes for maps to choose from and you can enable or disable features such as Pirates,etc.5. Random events happen throughout the game to keep you interested and keep and playing.Cons:1.  For those of you that dont like simple games this game may be too simple for you to play.2. The mouse is your only control function and you can hardly navigate during other player turns.3. The custom race option is not really made to well no matter how customized you make it you only get 100 points to play with but some perks require 30+ just to select and no matter which race you choose to be descended from your basically playing the origional race so no point in creating your own race.Now this is just a brief summery of some of the things that Ive come across so far and who knows it is in early access so maybe they will fix this changes early on.  I for one highly recomend this game!			"

Early Access Review
								In one sentence, I would say that the early access version shows a real committment to being the spiritual successor to MOO/MOO2 that we've all been waiting for. I hope that in a few of the areas that the original MOO/MOO2 didn't do very well that the new development team can innovate enough to bring the game into what we should expect out of a 2016 release.I can't comment too much on things that still appear to be unfinished - for example, numerous reviews have been pretty critical of the current ship battle experience and I would agree that it is missing a lot of features, but based on its current state compared to how other elements are fleshed out I would say that it will probably get better before the developers are done.What I would say is that there are a few aspects of the original game that should be more significantly revisited in this version of the game. Two examples are the way that technology influences battle outcomes and how the tech tree implements the restrictive either/or choices from MOO2.If you played MOO2 you know that a) a more technologically advanced ship pretty much always beats a lesser one and b) a bigger ship is pretty much always better than a smaller one. Because the current combat system is so close to the old one, that's still true, but that's really not the best way to balance gameplay in my opinion. The developers should probably try to evolve the game a bit more so that new tech isn't the automatic win that it is in the old game.On the tech side, it's improved from the MOO2 system where you were generally given a choice between two or three useful technologies that didn't really make sense to be mutually exclusive; there's only a few times where you have to pick between two different options. However, the ones that are there don't make a lot of sense; for example, you can have either fusion bombs or fusion beams, but never both. It seems like it would make more sense to provide a more sensible system if they want to prevent full access to the entire tech tree. Maybe an affinity system that lets you do certain things better than others in the combat realm - for example, maybe some races can build better shields where others can build bigger ships.The final comment I will make is that it costs a pretty hefty price and that there are a few things that they need to do to really make it worth that - the textures are currently pretty low resolution in a lot of cases and the art assets are limited in ship building.Even with the current flaws, I'd still give the game a thumbs up, and if you were waiting for a MOO/MOO2 remake, this is definitely it in my opinion.

								Finally a worthy successor to Master of Orion 1 and 2 has arrived. The game runs smoothly on my older system and looks fantastic. I'm not real happy with the combat mechanics yet and I'm a bit on the fence about the star lanes aspect. Need more stars on the map but this is really looking like they did a lot of things right. The game runs well and is playable as is. I haven't run into place holder text yet and it's clear they are putting in content updates when they are complete and ready for inclusion in the play of the game.I'd write a long review but I must get back to the game... It's finally here! :DUpdated for Early Access 2 release:Updated combat is a LOT better than their first Early Access 1 release. Diplomacy still stinks badly. New additions and rebalances of the racial traits are showing they are making some progress towards a very playable release. Indicators are that the difficulty slider is just an economic boost. Would be nice if this were more impactful than just BC per turn.Game still runs very smoothly and looks quite nice. They did a rebalance on some audio and that makes the intro to the GNN clips a bit low volumed when they start out on my system.Still eager to see how they impliment the espionage aspect of the game. Playing as Darlocks was one way I really enjoyed playing in the originals. They were quite under-estimated with their spying focus and could really wreck opponents.			"

								If you need a breakdown of what to expect from a MOO game then look at one of the many other reviews.  I just wanted to take a moment to compliment the development process.  I jumped on this game early on because I was a huge fan of the old MOO games, and for the first couple iterations of the Early Access, I sunk a lot of hours into it but still would have given it a ""meh"" or ""alright"" review.  Now, though, I have to say, the Developers have been tweaking and adding to the game relentlessly, and it's turning into a very well-designed and finely balanced game.  I'm extremely impressed with how far this Early Acess title has come and at the competence and productivity of the team working on it.  Keep up the good work, I hope this game is a success!			"

								I have played all of the moo games, was addicted to moo until moo2 came out then been playing it for 25 years and waiting for a sequel woth playing, moo3 sucked played it a couple times but had to throw it in junk pile. I am so incredibily happy with this new MOO, even in alpha is shaping up to be a awesome game. Is it exactly the same, no.. and imo it shouldn't try to be, yet it has captured all the main elements of what made moo2 so good imo.the artwork and visual feelling of the game is just beautiful, I would like to see it fleshed out with female choices for the races, also be able to choose whatever color i want for which ever race i play, but like i said, this is in alpha and they have time to add/implement some features, the overall game is very intuitive and easy to use, even as you get into late game play you are not bogged down with nicro managing, I love the queueing for the build and research systems. there is room for work on diplomacy but the seeds are in place for it,  and the combat system is looking very good already. I love the auto upgrading function available to keep your ships upgraded easily.all in all i rate this at 8.5 of 10 and its still in alpha, I paid 49.95 for this game and would do so again, I feel i have a game I will be playing often and having a lot of fun with for another 20+ years if i am lucky enough to beat breast cancer and still be around that long. cheers all and look me up for a MP game!~Clariti aka Sassaii "

Early Access Review
								Quick summary:Master of Orion is a game that I really think will be fun with more development, but currently is not really complete or polished enough to enjoy for a long time.Good points:The faction leaders and assistants have great animation and voice acting. Related to this fact, the diplomacy backdrop screens are a blast.The starmap is gorgeous and I was surprised at the amount of polish it got. In terms of interface, it feels like a hybrid between MOO1 and MOO2 in that it has systems and planets and moons and asteroids (like MOO2) but maintains a simple interface that allows me to easily see what's on the map without having to click through menus (like MOO1).Spaceships are neat looking and space combat looks pretty cool. Fun races, overall a classically zany feeling to everything.I like the UI and think it was pretty well designed.Bad points:The technology tree is currently pretty messed up. You achieve a new technology like every 5 turns but most of them don't feel like they make a difference. Many just unlock a building type which has to be propagated over your empire for a million turns before you see the benefit, and in general I feel like the real bottleneck in getting to cool things is always production (making research pretty unattractive, since there's no point in unlocking another thing when you won't be able to capitalize it for 500 turns). There also doesn't really seem to be any reason to strategically cherrypick your way through the tech tree either; with a few exceptions the best approach is just to research everything in the current tier and then move on.There are too many buildings, and the game encourages you to build all of them everywhere. What this results in is spending your midgame tediously making sure every one of your planets has a research lab and a biosphere and a hydroponics farm and a spaceport and a cloning facility and a marine barracks and a spaceport and a robotic miner and so on and you get the point so I'll stop listing all of the buildings in the game but believe me when I say that it keeps going on for quite some time. It all makes me wish that planets had a limited number of building slots so that I could just make a few smart choices per planet and move on.It's not possible to make interesting diplomatic exchanges until you have convinced another empire to accept your embassy, which requires being friends with them. In an unfortunate catch-22, in order to become friends with an empire, you perform advanced diplomatic exchanges requiring an embassy. Some races even start with unfavorable relations with others and in these circumstances there's basically nothing to do except watch the AI refuse to let you establish an embassy until they ultimately declare war on you because you colonized a lot of planets. Obviously this is silly.The real time tactical combat basically involves moving a big ball of ships at the enemy and hoping that you have more ships on your side.There are a few other things but those are the big issues that come to mind right now, and I'm hopeful to see them ironed out before the release.

								So I bought this game on saturday and worked both days this weekend and I still have 50 hours in game at this point on Wednesday or almost. I am a Masters of Orion fan. This game and its copy cats I have played well for a long time. When I go to load MoO3 my graphics are messed up so can't play it. But I like and enjoy what it had in freatures that this one doesn't. For example the way you could control spending on the different screens. I would ask that the game developers get an old laptop or desktop and go back to MoO3 and look it over.  MoO always beat out all the copy cats because of thier freatures and how it was controlled. I like the auto build option and how you can apply it planet by planet, so far the AI builds wrogn for a brand new planet instead of focusing on building up population and then defense it spends all it valuable first development time focus on making defenses. But this is the same way the empires nuild no matter the races. I have not spent enough time in this new release to see how its changed. But the AI is much tougher. The ship to ship combat is worthless, and you get a huge OP fleet lost bc the controls are counter-intuitive. But the Auto is fun to watch. I only will do the ship to ship if I have a smaller fleet and know how to kill the other ships better than the AI. But in later parts I just do OP and let computer do it whiling focusing on overall big picture, and logistics of resupplying my fleets. Having said that I enjoy this game AI and balancing that be tweeked but overall it is a good game for one of the copy cats But not worthy of the Masters of Orion name yet.			"

Now remember one thing, it's a turn-based game which means you have be patient to see some ""action"" don't expect to make a full yolo game like in FPS games.I've been playing it for some time now through the builds.Although some things were removed and added, the core gameplay remained the same and is simple and enjoyable.One annoying that remained so far (but can be easily fixed of course) is the ""diplomatic IA"" which is asking you stuff and if you don't comply then your reputation is getting lowered and if you do comply you gain nothing.For example they ask for a tech for credits and you say no, then you reputation with them decreases and they will ask you every turn which means at some point they will just declare war.My favourite race are the Psilons because I like to tech stuff and they are the best at it of course, I actually don't play any other race to be honest because I'm used to a progression with this one but that doesn't mean I don't like the others :)My conclusion is that I really like the game, it's a good turn-based game and has great potentioal so with some time it will be a great game.

								Great Gane a Bit slow for me. the interaction is better than the Last Game ( Moo3 ) the Voice actors are good for the Game, only bad thing is that Only the Primary Races are ready for the Early Access. I think that the Game will be that Much better when all the Races are finished and Included in the Game			"

								I grew up with MoO and MoO2, and  I still play MoO2 occasionally.  This game does a great job of keeping the nostalgia of the series with a slightly different style of game play.  If you want turn based combat play the originals, (not MoO3 because it was horrible).  It's still early access and each release it gets better. The dev team has done a good job of listening to player feedback.  The voice talent is amazing: play the Psilon and try not to laugh; I dare you!			"

Early Access Review
								Updated.Ok, so I am now in 90'ish hours, having now played all races through to victory in all available victory conditions, so here are some initial thoughts - in generalised rather than specific form.Yes, I recommend the game; that doesn't mean I don't think the game is currently without its issues, but it is early access and I expect that there will be continuing support by the devs for what is a high profile franchise (I note they have already patched in some content to reflect early player feedback).  General So it's MOO. For those who have played the MOO franchise (let's ignore MOO3), yes they have managed to imbue the game with some of the same kitschiness that its predecessors had. The races offered with the initial release are humorous enough and offer some amusing gameplay via quality voice acting, and more races are to come. The UI is largely functional, operable, logical and without much in the way of glitches. That might not sound like a ringing endorsement, but the fact it enables you to get on and play the game without really noticing its there, is a positive for me - it means nothing is wrong (the same can't be said for all 4x games).The battle intro cutscenes are some of the best I've seen in any game, and seriously I want to get into battles just to see and hear my ships warp into the combat zone. These are some of the only cutscenes in any game that I don't want to Esc through after the first few times. Similarly, most of the graphical/audio content in the game is polished and of a high level. The ships are decently rendered and you have a choice between two models/designs for each race-based ship (as well as three basic ship artwork choices), which is a nice bonus.The game hasn't paused, slowed, glitched, locked-up or crashed on me once. When you're in late-game, turn cycle calcs take the game a few seconds longer, but that's about it.It's enjoyable to play, and has a lot of promise. Specific Thoughts   Technology Tree.  Each race starts with its own 'advantage' in technology, but pretty much all end up with access to everything. It would have been nice to see a race-specific technology line, or even one specific mega-technology, that sets each race aside from the next. These would still be tradeable (or perhaps not?), but either way, some more tangible differentiation would be great here.The technology tree itself has (rightly so) been compared with Civ5 and I find it, while functional, lacklustre and linear, without any means of manipulating to achieve markedly different ends. It is possible to min/max to a degree, - or to just flatline cruise through it - but there is neither any great jeopardy nor reward in the manner in which research is able to be conducted, and I think the tree could be reworked to provide sufficient scope for achieving more varied outcomes. Again, it would also be good to see some standout race-specific tech in there.   Star lanes.  People are going to argue about Star Lanes. The jury is out for me at the moment; while I had a moment of consternation when I first saw them, I can see a practicality in their use and I'm not convinced its game-limiting. Ships can't enter battles if/when they cross each other heading different directions in a Star Lanes - but this isn't wildly different to previous games.  Combat.  People will also argue ad-infinitum about turn-based v real time, individual weapons control v ship/fleet based, but for me there are no great highs and no great lows. You have control in terms of pausability, navigation/targeting, use of mega weapons - but at the end of the day, if you have bigger ships, with up to date tech, then you will *usually* win. In that way current combat could be seen as a little bland, with no opening for detailed strategy or even tactics - but then it is, in general, hard to argue with 'My ships are bigger and better-armed and outnumber yours'  - notwithstanding what Sun Tzu has to say. You can, however, still lose with a theoretically more powerful  force if you just let the battle roll out and have your ships do a frontal assault on the enemy - while at the same time, a 'weaker' force can take out a stronger enemy by flanking the enemy positions, circling 'behind' them and drawing the enemy ships away from the support structures (usually the enemy will start with its ships 'behind' the enemy starbase and missile platforms - if built), so as to attack and defeat the enemy ships outside the support of its defence structures, then pick the defence structures off separately.I don’t want to see the game devolve into a combat simulator, so this is more than enough for me at this stage. Combat is always a contentious area in 4x games, but I don't feel disappointed or slighted with it here at all.   AI.  This remains my biggest beef with the game. The AI is completely and mind-numbingly linear. No matter what you do, or what style of gameplay you adopt, within 10-20 turns of meeting another race, it all ends up the same from there. First the alien contact will want to share Star Charts with you, followed shortly thereafter by your bank account codes, deeds to your house, script from your unpublished novel, husband/wife and first-born child. If you refuse, then the alien's attitude toward you is immediately 100% hostile, and remains that way for the rest of the game until you annihilate them in blinding fire. They will become scared of you when you outpace them, but they'll still hate you and, even if they drop out of war with you temporarily due to other conflicts, they will always re-declare war with you in due course (even if you have no further direct interaction). In fact, they'll choose to remain at war with you even when you have obliterated every colony they possess and you are currently hanging over their home planet in a massive fleet with your finger poised on the 'exterminate' button - rather than yielding to the inevitable and grudgingly accepting a Peace Treaty.All the races are the same in this respect and none of the native characteristics make any difference or show through in any manner other than in voice acting. E.g. the humans are intended to be diplomats and the Psilons explorers (generalising), yet they both (like all the races) become immediately upset if you decline to share charts and then, upon refusal of the next request (usually of cash, tech and conceding a system) become enraged and declare war. Is it possible to elicit any different relationship progression or behaviour from them? Yes, but only by playing such an absurdly exaggerated game style that it makes it not only ridiculous and unenjoyable, but completely self-defeating. There is no realistic possibility of diplomacy or subtlety. In summary, the AI is completely common to all races, with only the voice acting attempting to be a differentiator.MOO fans (of which I am one) are going to point out that divergent AI was never a strong suit of MOO races, or indeed any 4x game out there - and they'd be right - but this is a really obvious short-falling (or opportunity in waiting), particularly so because the way the races have been portrayed and brought to life by voice acting gives the expectation that they are actually going to be interestingly and amusingly different in game play. The devs have a great opportunity here to make this a stand-out aspect of the game.I will be mostly playing multiplayer, as PVP is really what I enjoy, but of all games, I want to enjoy the AI and distinct racial attributes, quirkiness and game play that MOO can offer. I am optimistic that this will be forthcoming, as I am pretty certain the team is determined to make this something special.I am still enjoying the game and will wait to see how things develop.Cheers			"

Early Access Review
								First off I am an old school gamer. I loved MOO and MOO2. Would not wipe a convicts♥♥♥♥♥with MOO3.  Ok that being saidI want to love this. The game is getting a very nice polish after years ont he shelf. But LIke XCOM you CAN NOT TAKE THE SAME GAME and just update the Graphics. The Reason XCOM reboot worked is becuase they made it thier own. it brought the familiar and added enough new to make it great. I want the same thing here very bad.Pros.1. Graphics and Sound are top notch. - the voice acting is spectautlar and if you are a geek like me most of the voices will be familer to you. (see things like Firefly and STNG). The graphics show real polish. the detail on the GUI and tactical maps are scary good. 2. Stable--ish - some poeple are saying they did not have crash issues. I hit a few bugs in my playthorughs both single and multi-player. Forcing me to reload the turn ( thank god for Autosave). But other than that smooth.Cons-1. Ok easy one first. Labels and discriptions.  Many times. the discriptions were not accurate enough.  For example. When you are resarching a beam weapon on the tech tree you get that weapons damage, size, and cost.  Then you get to the Ship design Screen... and all you get is an inaccurate DPS and a frustating 'fleet value' more on that later.   Another example, is the Jumpgate discription... all you get is ""this helps you travel between your colonies faster..."" that's it.. nothing else. It doesn't actually say that it will let you travel Directly between 2 colonies without using the warp lanes. A better discription here would have made me jump on the tech much sooner in my first time through ( I obviously did in subsiquent playthroughs)2. Ship Design in general- The ship design screen is problably my biggest headache. Small bugs like the ""this ship is already being used.  to the 'Auto' update that actually overwrites your ship designs with less efficeint weapons and even older armors and computers..""3. Tactical Combat- And here we have it. the ONE thing that NO 4x game seems to get right except MOO and MOO2(and even they had some flaws). Real time combat in this game is point and click you have no control over most weapons.  This problem was solved in MOO2 by a simple ""on""/""off"" switch. The asteroids do offer a SMALL amount of stratagy. you can use them to hide ship and engage on close combat, but that is a crap shoot and most weapons seem to go around or over them, Honestly the only truly great 3D realtime space combat I have seen is Homeworld. Soo unless you can steel a game engine or two I would suggest a switch back to turnbased. (might not be possible.. but hey I can dream)4. ok lastly  Warp lanes- Lets get one thing straight I LIKE the idea of warp lanes they segment the galaxy and it makes empire building interesting. Especially because you cannot jump through all of them right away and there is tech (jumpgates) that negates the lanes somewhat. THIS IS A GOOD THING. you can build the defense stations to give your empire a true 'border' without having sentries at every single frikken one of your colonies.  What I do not like about them is that they are BOTHnNot limiting enough and it takes to damn long to just use them. First you have to spend a whole turn to get to the point, Then you send X number of turns traveling through the lane then you Finnaly reach the destination and it starts all over.  In the early game I would expect this kind of limitation but I would also expect Techs to negate the flaws.  For example.. All ships no matter the tech are only able to move ONE spot in a system a turn.. Better engines/fuel cells should allow for more mobility..  And the final engine in previous games allowed for instantanious travel between systems. ( Warp Gates and Transwarp drives).   Ok that covers the time it takes to use them now the  ""not limiting enough"" you can LITERALY SCOUT the ENTIRE GALAXY no matter what tech lvl you are. As I said before there are some warp lanes you cannot travel through, but it just doesn't feel epic when you can see and speak to every single race in the first 50 turns... I miss the limiters that  pushed you to research better fuel Cells so you could get that xtra parsec. On the whole I would say this game is a GREAT alpha. I hope beyond hope that some of the issues above will be solved before release and I am looking forward to seeing the final product.			"

								I'm a huge 4x fan which means I often end up buying bad ones. I'm happy to report that so far MOO has a great foundation.  The art style is spot on, the effects and graphics beautiful.  The sound is a great mix of old & new.  I'm definitely getting sucked in already and experiencing that great ""just one more turn, just one more turn"" feeling that a good strategy/4x game will give you.Bugs - Nothing really noteworthy so far, just a bit of barely noticeable frame stutter on a large, well explored galaxy during AI turns.  There's some minor UI elements that could use some polishing/streamlining.Some work needed - Diplomacy is a bit shallow, it would be nice to have some more subtle ways to make friends or enemies.  It seems like all the AI will do right now is get progressively more angry with you even if you don't do anything to offend them, even buying them off doesn't really do much. The auto-build is way off base for what new colonies need.  Pretty surprised that this got a public release without a working tutorial.....but that's the only real ""buyer beware"" I encountered.  Even as a 4x vet, I always like to give the tutorial a whirl just to get a feel for the game and all its features.Wishlist (not really a knock on the game) - I know its probably a tall order with all the art & voice work required but even more different races would be amazing.  Bigger galaxies.  More ship variants.  I'd also love to see some sort of Ship Design Testing Room feature that you could access from the main menu that would take you straight to ship design and let you really play around with the ship building and then perhaps test them against some basic enemies.  I love the ship design part of a good 4x but I'd love to see some sort of testing lab feature to really get to play with various ship classes and loadouts.  With so much else going going on during a full game, you might spend some time on a new ship design, and never actually get to really get a chance to see if it performs well in combat.  A ship lab/fight AI ship minigame that you can access directly from the main menu would be a lot of fun.Summary - great game, definitely recommend (even in early access), I'm having a lot of fun with it.  A few minor things to polish up and a few ""above and beyond"" things I'd like to see added.			"

												I had high hopes and a lot of patience to give the game time to impress; but it ultimately failed and disappointed me. Why? Mostly because it just doesn't feel as mature and earnest as MOO2. The aliens including the Antarans mostly seem out of a cartoon, the ship design is limited compared to MOO2 and the tactical battles feel silly. Same for the galaxy design. At the same time, the UI often gets in your way of doing things efficiently, the AI of both the colony governor and the scouting routine is grievously stupid. Some features seem well-meant but badly executed, e.g. the Silicoid's disregard for food being totally ignored in the tech tree.Summing it up: If you're looking for a real Master of Orion experience, I'd still recommend MOO2 (runs on DOSbox); if you're looking for a great 4x space game, look somewhere else (Stellaris or Endless Space).

Early Access Review
								First off I want to say I am a classic moo player from way back that never stoped playing. Ive even gone way out of my way to get it to work multiplayer even after that aspect of the game went down. That being said, I have seen a lot of negative feedback about this new verson of MOO and I just wanted to address some of the unfavorable responses I have seen.  I understand there gripes, It is not a MOO clone exactly.  But to be honest, i didnt want a moo clone or i would just boot up moo 2.  Yes the trade lanes add a different feel to the game. But IMO they can be used to add a stragety element to the game.  I can colonize a planet in strategic places to block off entire sections of the galaxy to myself.  Some people claim that you can have every tech in the game. Well, when i first played i was given this impression myself.  but on closer inspection there are some techs that are one or the other.  An example would be I can choose to have either Fusion Beam or Fusion drive.  On the tech tree it appears as Fusion Beam | Fusion Drive.   I can CHOOSE to be faster in space faster, or have better beam weapons right now, if i choose one, it will be a while before i have something better in the other field i didnt choose.  This is not the only example on the tech tree.   Now for the battle system.   All together I think this game is a great addition to the moo franchise. It is AMAZINGLY better than MOO 3 at any rate and the best addition I have seen to the game in decades. We should be thanking NGD studios and WG Labs for taking a chance on a game that took a lot of hard work for a fan base that doesent seem to appreciate a gift.  If this game does well, they may attempt yet another version down the road.  And maby they will incorporate the things you dont like about this game.  As it is now, it is a well polished game, with a few bugs for them to work out. Its in early access, give it a break while it is a work in progress.			"

												Only played fours so far but love it. Very much like MOO 2. Going to be good'n me thinks.Played over 400 hours and I still love this game. It makes you think but not to hard depending on what level you play. The devs still keep tweeking the game which is good to see. The Ai is certainly getting more cleverer and I have had to watch them more closely as they are becoming more devious, makes for a more challenging game. There is still so much more to add to the game and I'm sure we'll see updates and DLC's in the next few months.			"

								This is one of those times your prayers come true. A prayer that somone would come along and remake one of those classic 90's games you loved so much, without changing anything. (Almost) If you played Masters of Orion or Masters of Orion 2: Battle at Antares just buy the game, don't think, you'll thank me. If you've never played a game in the series before think of this as Civilization 2 or 3 in Space, or a more fun Galactic Civilizations (sorrynotsorry). The civilizations you can choose to play are all the classic sci-fi alien archetypes: Cat people, lizard people, greys, robots, and so on. Overall this game at the moment is an 8.5 out of 10, taking into account it is unfinished. I have spent probably hundreds of hours playing Masters of Orion 2: Battle at Antares, and this game replicates that experience almost perfectly. PROS: The races are all solid and familiar, but their abilities differ somewhat from previous versions of the game. This is more interesting than problematic, and it should be clear to the new player what race reflects their play style.The tech tree is pulled right from Battle at Antares, as well as ship classes, weapons and upgrades. The new voice acting and art for both the racial models and ships is much more immersive and brings the races to life.The biggest change to the game from Battle at Antares is the way you can move between stars. One can no longer travel to any nearby star within range of your ships, but rather, follow pre-determined hyperspace lanes that only connect to certian other stars. At first this was a con to me but I've come around. Although this map setup can lead to the awkward situation where the nearest star to your homeworld can only be reached by passing through several other star systems. It creates a lot of interesting strategies to control star systems with a lot of cross traffic in order to control large sections of the map. Because you are able to build military outposts on each node that leads out of a system you control, you can ""seal up"" whole portions of the map from races you aren't allied with. CONS: These are all minor and non game breaking, but cons nonetheless. I also know some of these complaints are because this is based off MoO1 not 2 Missing Races: Elerians, Trilarians, GnolamGame is a bit unstable and I have lost progress due to game crashes, though this may be fixed by the final buildThe hyperspace lanes thing still kinda irks me so a bit of a conThe GNN news robots sound like trash, though this may be fixed by the final buildSometimes when you open the colony menus they don't pop up right and you have to escape out, and re open them.

								If you enjoyed Master of Orion 2, then get this. This game takes that formula and really makes some magic; it's better in almost every way. Forget Stellaris, this is the real heir to the MoO crown.			"

								Plays for 200+ turns in one sittingAttempts to fight the guardian of OrionLoses entire fleet in 30 secondsLoses game a few turns laterImmediately restarts    In all honesty this game is great. The voice acting is spot on, the graphics (aside from leader backgrounds for some reason) are beautiful, the music is spellbinding. Honestly, I am impressed by how good this game is, even at such an early state. Yes, a few races are still MIA, and yes the combat needs to be fleshed out a bit more, but the game at its core is still super strong, and the game is well set to become the best MoO to date.			"

								This game is EASILY worth $50-$60, at least to me. I am not poor however, like a lot of Gamers on Steam seem to be. Or perhaps they are just cheap. Yeah, this game is a no brainer for me.SIMPLY PUT- This awesome space game is a really fun ""4x"" or whatever you want to call it, I call it a space game. Period. I can tell it will also be a fun game for years to come. And at the end of the day, that is why this game has so much VALUE. Anyway, EA or not game is fun as hell, looks cool, sounds cool, and really just itches that scratch you know.Could it be better? Well of course, everything and anything ""could be better"", though this one does pretty damn good IMO, all things considered.Slum over and out.			"

Early Access Review
								So i first started off playing stardrive and SD2, and i really enjoyed those games. But after playing this game, im definetly more into this game. Great graphics, great UI, and extremely interesting ship models. Although i would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys 4x strategy games for sure the only two cons i can think of at this moment is that the Newly released race Terran Kahnate (sorry if misspelled) has the exactly same ship model as the human race, and i know they are the same species but cmon that kinda seems lazy, they should have their own ship models, maybe they are a little more rebelious looking, think to star wars, like the rebels are to the empire. Then the second thing im not a fan of, is that it almost seems impossible to make the alien races happy when playing vs. AI. Even if you say yes to every little thing they ask for, they eventually will just ask for something so rediculous like giving them all your credits and a planet or two, and you say no obviously then they declare war. It seems like they want it to be a shooter vs AI instead of winning by deplomacy.			"

								For an early access game, it is quite fun. It definitely has the feel of the older MOO games. There's still a lot of work to be done - tactical combat is useless at the moment and diplomacy is very basic. There is also the occasional bug. But that said it is a playable light strategy game even in alpha early access. Plus you get the three older MOO games in the bundle.			"

Early Access Review
								Just finished first play-through!Having played MoO and MoO 2 back when they first released, (ended up skipping 3) , its truly great to see this game updated.Being an Early Access title, hopefully there will be more features added in. Its very playable as it is right now, and definately worth doing so!One of the many  things I loved about MoO2 was the planet colonization sequence. Was a joy to see the colony craft landing on each new different type of planet, most of them so exotic and alien, at times made me wish i was was there. This newest edition takes the colonizing sequence to a new level. Beautifully rendered panoramic breathtaking cinimatic cut-scenes of your race's Colony ship descending from the atmosphere and camera pan flyby over mountains or into valleys, across lakes / oceans, through clouds, mist, or snow-storms to land in the perfect spot. Definately a ""Whoa!"" and pause to appreciate moment. I'm so glad they didn't skimp or cut-short this part of the game.GNN is back and tongue-in-cheek with comedy. The GNN sequences still seem a bit rough, but this is early-access after all.Galactic Council sequences has nicely been kept true to MoO 1 & 2, with a nice 3d facelift.Love the ""Next Planet"" button, mind you it cycles through in the order of planets colonized. The Planet Screen this time around is an Orbital Space View, with the planet slowly rotating with the daytime on the left, median, and night-time on the right. As for the buildings - are 3d iconic representations placed randomly on the planet's surface (poping through the atmosphere and right ino space), larger than life much like you'd expect from the units representation in the Civilization game series. Kinda takes the realism away but gives you an idea what you have. The downside is for bulding management, you have to click and hold to rotate the planet and click on the structure to remove it (takes several tries to find the correct bulding if you can't recognize it). A quick fix to this could be added later - would also list the buildings you can scroll through.Love the new updated ship graphics. Ship edit screen gives you a selection of hull paint patterns (no colors though). Your able to view and rotate the 3d models. The space combat is spectacular to watch. They added a new Cinematic Camera mode, lets you watch the combat much like it were a movie. Needs a little work, seems to randomly pick where to ""point and shoot"" including actual ""Smart Missle Camera viewfinder"" mode complete as you see in hollywood movies right up to the point of impact. Wish there were a few options to refine or pick / cycle / toggle the current camera selection. Only thing missing is the true-tactical turn based fleet combat mode. Hope it gets implimented. To be fair, having seen the new 3d ships and graphics, it was fun to watch the automatic RTS mode, as the battle is over in a few minutes - fast, flashy, guns blazing and ships go ""Boom!"", litle star fighters zipping around in formation,  kinda watching a space battle sequence from Babylon 5. Still, would be nice to have the option to have the turn-based hands on combat again, control your fleet - movements and weapons.Doomstars!!! These are a sight to behold in space battle - quite massive and dwarfing most ships but at the same time they're not ""Moon sized"" planets either. Gone is the ""rounded borg cube"" type design. Instead, the pyramid design is a nice nod to Stargate SG-1 - Goa'uld warships, and dwarfs all the other ships. These bad-boys do give you the option to actually blow up the planet. Interestingly, there hasn't been any GNN newsbreaks about it either when a planet does get blown up (turns into asteroid field you can later reform into a new barren planet). There isn't any ""Planet-busting"" visual sequence either for now just a second attack button icon, maybe will be added later.The voice acting and rendering of the species is really good. All in all, for an early-access title release, with only a handful of species available its definately worth playing. Been fairly stable, Lots of features still to be added, such as the Espoinage Training Center (even states that in the description - ""to be added later"")			"

Early Access Review
								I had all of the previous MOOs and I like MOO2 very much. Until today I consider that “the best in class”. This game is not MOO2 anyway. But I found the game good and promising enough, so make sense to buy. However also need to consider some aspects that are not so gentle. Close look of space map is looking like Galactic Civ with some StarDrive flavor. Or the opposite. Not bad, but nothing special. Tactical space combat is realtime and somewhere between StarDrive and Endless Space. There are minor issues, like ship weapon firing arc is not working, ships are turning over and over (ship movement control is close to nothing), ships are shooting missiles and beam into asteroids, etc.This tactical combat part of the game is really what have to be re-considered. I prefer turn based game with turn based tactical combat. Need to give control to the players instead of sit and watch what is happening on the screen.Another area is the ground combat. Hope, the developers do not follow bad example of GalCiv III that was not ready with this aspect when released. StarDrive2-like ground combat would be good, with some fancy upgrade in the graphics and weapon/gadget selection. (Nobody is expecting XCOM2 type…)Leaders / governors are missing today, hope it will be in the scope. Also nice to have some special ship weapon or extra module to find / buy / manufacture. Or merchants selling goods, or mercenaries, or armies to hire, etc.I understand that some of the issues will be fixed after having early access feedback.I recommend the game anyway, it is fun, and the game is pretty. I had one crash only, easy to reproduce so I am going to report it to the developers. "

								Masters of Orion 2 was by far my favorite game overall in my history of gaming 25+ years.  Today, after playing the early access of Masters of Orion, the title has been taken by this Early Access.  This is my review after playing two full games as the Psilons and Humans.  PROS:-They stayed true to the old Masters of Orion 2 secret sauce-Fantastic modernization of graphics and UI (Star Map is beautiflul!)-Races feel as they did in the previous game (and improved).-Game feels very polished and I did not encounter any issues other than some labels that need to be updated.Recommendations for Improvement:-Bring back ground combat that is visual like it was in Masters of Orion 2 (This may simply just not be implemented yet).-It's really hard to make an alliance, and keep one.  It's a little too punishing and I was not able to create one without giving them all my money plus monthly payments and giving them one of my best planets.  I did this playing Humans who are supposed to be diplomatic and had technology to improve my chances.  Also when I raised influence with other races, over the course of about 5 turns my influence would continue to reduce until it sat back at the middle neutral point.-The pollution mechanic is interesting, but causes more micromanagement of planets which I didn't find very enjoyable.  -I would recommend making the icon of current population of a planet larger on the galaxy view.-Playing as humans (blue color) it was sometimes difficult to see where my planets were when I was zoomed out.Exceeded my wildest expectations.15/10			"

								Despite being an ""Early Access"" title , this is one of the best examples of that much abused genre. There is plently to do already, and I played through a full campaign with no crashes at all. As a 4X game it is most excellent. Having ploughed many hours into GalCiv 3 I can happily state that MOO is more fun. In it current state it is not, perhaps, quite as deep as Stardocks behemoth, but it is immensley enjoyable with a deep tech tree and endless options for customising your ships (which is something i have not really delved into). The voice acting is superb, as might be expected from a cast which includes Mark Hamill, John de Lancie and Alan Tudyk.Yes there are still missing features, and it could possibly do with better documentation and a tutorial but the game already feels like a finished product. In terms of extra features, the only thing I would add would be an experience system for your fleets, and possibly the option of adding Admirals who level up with them.Overall, if you are looking to scratch the 4X itch, and GalCiv is a bit heavy (and graphically suspect) give this a whirl. I don't think you will be disappointed.			"

								Interesting layout for the new MOO.  I am unable to launch the Steam-modified MOO3, however.  Suggestions for the new game:  Please let us know when you are going to be adding the remaining races.  Also, please ensure that those who have bought the Early Access ""Collector's Edition"" are gifted with the Terran race when it is inserted, as you promised.  For tactical combat in the new game, I am unable to zoom in.  And of course,  PLEASE PUT A HOTSEAT FUNCTION INTO THE NEW GAME.   Also ... LARGER GALAXY SIZES and MORE PLANETS PER SOLAR SYSTEM!!! Please allow for more variety in the planets of the home system at the start of the game, and give us a RESPAWN BUTTON on the main menu.  AND PUT A ""DO NOT REAPPEAR"" CHECK BOX on the advisor screen.  We need to be able to DISMISS that. Overall, this game plays like a half-evolved beta, and it should at this stage of development.  I think it's a GREAT start, and look forward to continuting developments that will make this game an amazing addition to the franchise.			"

								I, for one, recommend this game in this phase for the vibrant (well, vibrant for a 4x means you can get games together with 4-8 players on a regular basis) multiplayer scene. 4x multiplayer hasn't had a decent outlet since civ 5. This is not perfect, far from it, but if the devs keep up with updating the platform and ironing out some bugs, this might work perfectly for people who want a smooth, streamlined multiplayer experience.In single player, the AI is stupid enough to lose on very hard. Or I've played long enough, could also be. ) "

												 If you like having to painstakingly micromanage every single planet and not being able to efficiently produce or do anything anymore, and you like having the game slowed to the painful plodding pace of a turn every 5+ minutes then this is the game for you.The latest update to the game has made it unpleasent and tedious. Such a shame. I played it at my mates, hence no recent play time on my account.To fix the issues introduced with the latest patch, the developer has a few option: 1. Roll back the update in it's entirety. 2. Roll back the update in it's entirety. or 3. Roll back the update in it's entirety. Seriously though, the changed made to the pollution and production system are attrocious, a thoroughly awful idea; Can't recommend the game anymore and I can't stand to play it.			"

								I am a big fan of Masters of Orion 1 & 2. I spent many, many hours playing MOO2, even re-installing it not too long ago.Thie is just the BETA - so I have a lot of hope that the game will only continue to improve.First off, I really miss the turn-based combat. That has been removed. The combat in this re-boot is pausable real-time, where you can only direct your ships what targets to attack. The combat feels a bit like Gal Civ 3, but you have a little more influence over the battle. I did not see an option to retrat from combat - but thay may be coming later.No leaders, yet.Ship design, which I really used to enjoy feels watered down to me. The game is pretty, the music/sound is nice and the voice acting is solid, although the GNN anchors voices are annoying.The game locks up while processing the AI's turn pretty regularly, but it auto-saves, so you don't lose anything.I like it, but I was hoping for more complexity and more strategy.That being said, I will continue to play it.

												I waited to play until full release, and I have to admit I do not regret this purchase. The game is very easy to get into, and once you're into a game it has that one more turn feeling. I have Stellaris as well as Gal Civ 3 and I think all three are great games, but Masters of Orion doesn't have the punishing feel of Stellaris with pirates, nor the learning curve of Gal Civ 3. I hope to see a lot of great DLC down the line, and I hope to sink many, many hours creating mighty empires in the game as it is!!!			"

								This game is really starting to capture the spirit of the the MOO series while (thankfully) showing much more influence from MOO II rather than MOO III; it also takes inspiration from other 4X games. Not revolutionary, but most certainly a fun game. most people who dislike this game are complaining about the lack of turn based combat (it is real-time) which is not a problem for me. in the case of multiplayer, real-time is superior and a huge time saver for an already massively time-consuming game.

								Do I look forward to playing this game?  Yes.  Do the kids look forward to playing this game?  Yes.  Do we all look forward to exploring the game with each new early access incarnation?  Definitely yes.  I have had this game since early access 1 (EA1).  It has been and continues to be a fun ride seeing the large and small changes the developers make along the way.  As of the time of writing this review, the game is in EA5.The game is not yet perfect, but you can sort of feel the trajectory the developers are taking with changes to certain areas of the game.  Feeling nostalgic, I played through a couple MOO2 games recently for comparison.  I now feel colony management on this game is much improved over the original.  This has been something the developers have been making steady changes to with each EA incarnation.  I feel that ship design in the original is still a bit better because one really gets a sense that the way the ships are designed, what systems are installed, really affects their viability.  I was surprised to find that the turn-based combat I used to love in the original game became a bit tedious and I was actually looking forward to the real time combat we have here in this new Master of Orion game.  However, the addition of some turn-based elements to the combat system with the addition of hotkeys to activate various ship systems real time shows to me that the developers are addressing my concerns about ship design but doing it in a real time combat world.  Kudos.  Lastly, with the EA5 update they even brought back the beloved creative/uncreative options as well as added some other novel bundled “Special Abilities” picks to the race creation scheme.Come, join this journey with us.  Provide constructive criticism of what you do not like.  Provide feedback on what is working well.  Make this game into something worthy of bearing the name of Master of Orion. "

								So far being only 10ish hours into the game, it so far has captivated me and proved to be a good purchase. But it does have its falws, also keep in mind that I was not an player of the original trillogy and this game is my intro into the franchise.PROS: - Game looks beautiful- The races have uniquie looking ships- Game play feels smooth- The tactical battle view breaks up the monotony of a 4x game- Voice acting is superior- Ability to focus a planet on a certain task weather it be food or production or science- UI is east to undertand and use- Easy to pick up and play for newcommers to the 4x gamesCONS:- The tactical screen doesnt really provide any real benefits to combat- Plant management where you sell buildings is a pain- GNN bots are so annoying (thank goodness for the baility to turn them off)- Planets with specials dont seem to have a large impact/ need to make that more important to get good plants (research & tech wise)- All races feel much to simlar (I find this wiht Civ V as well so lets hope it gets changed)- Ship customization needs more of an impact on combat- No unit XP system, there is no care for any speicif units, if oen dies, ""ooh well, ill build another""- No ""hero"" units of any kind, again makes the races feel very similarOver all I would give the game a solid 7/10, its great, plays well, and is overall a great time. That being said there is a lot fo room for improvement and I think if wargaming listens to their community this game could easily draw par or even surpass the Civ franchise.			"

								Even in the early-access stage, the game has managed to capture the spirit of the earlier Master of Orion games, while streamlining colony/empire management and tactical combat. The tech tree is still my favorite in the 4X genre. Ship design is exactly the same as in Master of Orion 2, with firing arcs, targeting computers, shields and utility modules.As to the new additions, I'm surprised how well the real-time combat works. Pause the game, issue orders, resume. It's much faster than moving each unit individually, and it doesn't sacrifice any tactical depth.I also liked building up the new military outposts. They restrict enemy ship movement, allowing for the creation of a militarized border zone on the outskirts of the empire.The only thing I'm not sold on is the unlimited travel range for all ships. Discovering other races is much faster now, but somehow feels a bit out-of-character for Master of Orion. Still, this minor gripe hardly affects my overall enjoyment of an excellent game. Highly recommended!			"

								I like this game very much, its like civilization, but in a different style. What style I like.It is clear that the game is still in development, but there are little things that confuse and reduce the fun of the game. Some of them -  limit to 500 strokes. Civilization by an infinite number of moves I like a much more. I hope the game will be deweloped and then MoO become my favorite turn-based strategy!)___________________________________________________________________Мне эта игра очень напомнила Цивилизацию, но в другой стилистике. И это стиль мне нравится. Понятно, что игра еще в разработке, но есть мелочи и не мелочи, которые смущают и снижают удовольствие от игры. Главный для меня - всего 4 расы и ограниченность 500 ходами. Цивилизация за счет бесконечного числа ходов мне нравится много больше. Надеюсь, недостаток игры исправят, и тогда МоО стент моей любимой пошаговой стратегией!)			"

Early Access Review
								I played Master of Orion 2 and 3 when I was 15 or something. Those were completely different times, when I had days and days of free time and could see how the galaxy reacts when I move a little knob somewhere deep in my empire.I am amazed at how well new Master of Orion plays in this new way. I expected to get basically a copy of the older games with new graphics. You can see the comments from all the diehard fans from 640x480 pixel version commenting here.And the new graphics are there, with great voiceovers, but the gameplay is much closer to the rest of the AAA industry today. It plays more like a really advanced casual empire-building game, but without all the crap about freemium and pay-to-win. This is exactly the game I wanted for my no-longer-so-completely free schedule of an adult gamer.Make no mistake, this is an early access version. I played so far EA4 and it's playable, I enjoyed a few games already. Some depth is missing and some functionalities need balancing and more polish. I'm really happy to support the development since it's already cool in the current state. I just hope developers will survive the onslaught of comments from people who actually just want to go and play MoO2 again instead of a new game.			"

								While it is still in Early Access, it shows great promise to recapture the spirit of its predecessors.  Its implementation of classic mechanics (such as  with new featuers and a modern UI, not to mentioh the most polish I've ever seen in a 4x title, makes it more than just a clone. Altogether, it is a game I would recommend to 4x fans even now at collector's edition price in early access.The extent to which they develop customizable races in a future update will, for me, make or break its replability.

								Great Game so far,, few technical things that im sure the community is hammering the team with... my biggest one is the location in the research tree of Positronic computers.. makes no sense to get +75 beam accuracy after you get cybertronic computers which were 100 or 125 forget the detail of them.  the lack of a Harder difficulty at this time really bums, the Average setting is way to easy to face♥♥♥♥♥♥the NPCs.  Multiplayer works great minus if you trying to reconnect to a saved game. host gets blackscreened and only background interface loads (could of been a once off error or corrupted game, not sure how to verify) Lack of Gnolans gotta bring the greedy goblins back. Increase space pirate difficulty as game progresses.  they are just pushover late game and cant properly harass a race as im sure they were intended. Rates on research treaty's way to high to maintain (not sure if was a flaw or intended) 13k BC to open a 20 turn Treaty is intense at turn 150.  Infrastruct administration hella OP and game breaking for production. 3 turn Titans / = down hill easy mode.			"

								For an early access game it is good, reminds me of the previos titles in the series that I used to play quite a lot. The game is still in it's early stages and the fixed difficulty setting in the single player felt a bit easy. Even though it is a new game, it only took me minutes go understand the gameplay and ins and outs of what's what. The easiness of the combat, the vast researches available and so forth. All in all I feel like the developers have done a good job, and it's miles ahead of other early access games I've played and bought. I recommend picking it up, and if early acces games isn't your thing, then give it some time, maybe buy it at a later stage or wait until it's finished. Perhaps watch some developer videos on youtube in the meantime.NOTE: I only played the single player ""campaign"" as that is what I feel like the game should be. Multiplayer will surely be more difficult when playing against other humans, rather than AI.			"

Early Access Review
								I loved MoO2, played it a ton. But one of the huge problems with MoO2 was the late game, having huge fleets and battles that took forever; it stopped being tactically fun and just a tedious and laborious inconvience. So with this new iteration, I'm glad to see they have tried to address that by adding in paused/realtime combat. It's too early to say they will have it spot on but the direction is quite exciting to see.I like the introduction of starlanes, I feel it adds in choke points and the ability to have a war front and not have surprise attacks on some odd random system miles from the rest of your fleet. I also think they have done really well in capturing the spirit of the original MoOs.Really looking forward to see how this evolves.			"

								If you are a fan of the game you will definitely appreciate the new version. Very well done with lots of polish and fluid usability. All the colony micromanagement of the past but with a very nice job of hiding superfluous information when you need to make a decision while keeping all of it available if you want it. So far very impressed. My only negative comment is my Psylon buddy and how annoying he gets saying the same thing every time we discover a new technology. Hopefully they will add more variety to such things as they did in other areas.			"

Early Access Review
								Like so many others, I still regard Master of Orion II the epitome of galactic 4X games.  I was surprised to see this update materialize unheralded, and intrigued enough to purchase an Early Access game for the first time.  Watching the videos, one has to commend the studio on its selection of actors who give life to the various faction leaders.  ""Worf"" (Mr. Dorn) is back!  The animated characterizations of the leaders are a treat to behold, a huge step up from the caricatures of the original.  There is a subtle humour in the exchanges, as well as with the GNN commentators and news stream.  Granted, the variety is limited, but if the game continues to be developed, I hope dialogue and events will be increased.  This IS an early release, and the development team focused, sensibly, on getting the main mechanics right.  This game plays true to the original, except as already noted in other reviews, with warp lanes/points.  The technology tree has been streamlined, ship building is refreshingly easy and enjoyable.  Colony development will be familiar but with a few new twists.  Effort was made to make the star map attractive.  While not 3D, it is perfectly fine and gives the illusion of depth.  Ship models are distinct and detailed.  Battle animations are well done, basically a video to watch, but one cannot help admire the fighters, missiles and torpedoes streaking towards their target from your battleships and Titans.  Does it, as some have mentioned, get a bit repetitive?  Yes, but then so did the original.  This just looks far better.  For an early release game, I am impressed (and surprised) that it plays so well.  It is better than several supposedly ""finished"" games we could all name.  After two playthroughs, I had no crashes, glitches or lockups.  My hope is that the developer will continue to refine, expand and add to this game.  There are four more races that are suggested.  As well, at this time, there are only two map selections.  Steam offered a package which included the new update along with all three of the old series.  I already had them.  I don't regret the purchase. All in all, I appreciate the love that went into this update/remake of a cherished classic.  Kudos!!!			"

								Okay, lots to say (and I do hope the devs are taking a gander at the reviews!)This game has the potential to surpass #2 in my opinion, as someone who still played #2 as recently as a month ago, and as long as a good 20 years ago or so. I'm going to summarize that the key thing that makes this game better is the focus on balance. Everything modification wise is low to the ground from race traits, to weapons, buildings, everything. Power level is just simply toned down overall, and simplified. Simplified does NOT mean less strategic options, in fact stacking modifiers becomes very important in this, and every single turn almost you're making critical choices as a result. Colony ships don't take 70 turns at the start where you have to sit there clicking next for 30 minutes for the game to just get going.... by turn 50 you're going to feel like you're knee deep in a game, and ordering a pizza for the long haul. Your research is absolutely critical because the board state changes so fast. Likewise movement has changed entirely, for the better. The addition of military outposts is major, and you can use warp lanes as choke points. Loving it. The new changes to troop transports? Epic. Next colony button? Genius.Also, the first time you get a battleship you're going to feel pretty epic :) Mine just wiped out a whole fleet by itself. So here's the very long list of stuff the game kinda needs and in no way has missing these things stopped my friend and I from playing:- Leaders, even with very minor attributes, will make a nice difference. I'm sure this is planned, but both my friend and I were missing that.- More hover over information, notably there is no way to access a stats screen for my ships beyond going into the blueprints area. If I wanted to assess my fleet it would be a pain right now.- Tactical combat in multiplayer as an option. I'm sure this is coming too, but can't hurt to mention.- More meaningful ability to understand the various scores breakdown and army strength. My friend seemed to have much higher army values, but holy cow was my army performing very well. We're not sure on any level why my excellence score is higher than his. - Slow down the GNN reports, they're over really quick and this is the kind of game you can really sit back with. Just keep options open!- When streaming it is really hard to avoid the race selection being a problem because the narration happens every time you click a new race. Maybe it could be a toggle or a button or something. Will alter this list as things change or as I remember the minor issues which came up.			"

												I'm updating my review for MOO, they definitely didn't keep any of the things to leave master of orion as it once was, simplistic and more focused on the actual gameplay, instead they opted for the micromanagement nightmare of pollution buildings like moo2 and moo3 had done.I hope that someday someone gives the original Moo the love it deserved, there are far better 4x titles now that don't require us to put as much micromanagement as this game does.. see sins of a solar empire, stellaris, etc, it's really hearbreaking because when they first announced the remake, I was excited I was expecting them to stay with the roots of the game, instead it's just another lifeless simulation with eye candy graphics, battles that are unfun, no control whatosever over them, one track minded Ai.

								What a great remake! I enjoyed this beautiful MOO version very much.The graphics looks awesome, the voice acting is excelent. The tech tree is very smooth even for Early Access. The balance of the game in general is really enjoyable although for true 4X fans like me you would probably find it too easy now, but hey it´s Early Access, so I´m sure it will have difficulty levels for the full release for more challenging sessions. If you are a fan of the original MOO or even a big fan of Civilization like me, buy it right away, it´s really worth it. If you rather wait until they end up polishing the balance, difficulty levels, so on, you can probably wait until full release, but once again if you are a strategy games fan sooner or later this great game will end up in your library.,			"

								As I frantacally search for that one game from my childhood that had these big ships, tactical grids, and colonizing of planets, I at first wrote this series off as ""Not being it""Later to my astonishment, it is the series that I was looking for. In that instant I bought it. It was worth the 50$.The one I remember is Master of Orion 2. You build your empire, you have your ships and research to do. You interact with the other races. Played a game then moved on to the Reboot.Oh boy, the Reboot. You build, you explore, you talk, and you conquer. Each race, as the previous versions, have their own style of ships. One looks like a cat's head and another looks like a flying saucer. The more you research, the bigger gun you have. They stick true to the predisessors, you make the ships.You can't beat that, you can't beat a game that it's your choise to rule or rule beside. If you push your people hard, they push back harder. If your out of money, there goes most of your stuff. Once you reach a certain number of planets that you own, almost no one is willing to touch you, unless they have 10K in millitary power at their disposal.All and all, this is a game worth buying if your a fan of tactical space sims.

								I bought this game about 48 hrs ago , spent large part of yesterday afternoon playing it , for an early access game played very well , only had it freeze up 2 times when combat completed - I played MOO2 ,and liked it , but I like this one better , have seen some complaints that it was not a remake of MOO1 and MOO2 , I personly really like this game , that said , I got MOO1 , MOO2 , and MOO3 free as a bonus when i purchased this game while in early access , a great deal . - it does of course need some work I played as nature loving bears at default difficulty , i managed to get a jump on all the other empires/civs in game by quickly exploring and grabbing 2 or 3 key star sytems  , colonizing said systems 1st , fortifying the outbound routes from my territory , and placing warships there ASAP - then after the fact sending out colonization ships to the many planets i bypassed while seizing those key systems - I have the largest economy , largest tech and largest military  and while I am not liked none dare to attack me since I have 2 large and powerful fleets at each end of my empire - I am not really that good at these games so I suspect I either just got very lucky and got the jump on the other races by grabbing key systems or the balancing and or AI need more work - ALL IN ALL A VERY GOOD GAME LOOKING FORWARD TO THEM COMPLETEING IT .

								If you are looking for a game that is close to the original then you found it. If you are wanting it to be exactly like the original than you can just play the original because it comes with the purchase. I feel however that the management is much more streamlined and the technogy tree that is present also gives new players the chance to learn what plans they should make. The originals required a lot of reading to really get good. Here there will me a lot of hover messages that will explain not only what something does but why it is at that current value. What do you have +9 to food on a world with 1 farmer? Hover over it. Want to know why that race hates your guts? Hover over the colored bar that shows their attitude about you. Spying is not quite out yet, but I cant wait to see how that will be improved. I have heard people complain about the AI not being good because a race hates them but is giving them colonies and joining an alliance. They probably never played the original. Each race values things more than others and some races will fear you for different reasons.			"

								""Status""""IN PROGRESS""Fantastic so far on many levels.If you have not watched the videos you should, they spent good money on fantastic actors for the voice work! That in itself really drew in our curiosity.As a developer myself, many different chairs(diversity in choices), allows me to review not just based as some 12 yr old wanting to read like an adult. I dont compare to anyone, soley the craft of what I am reviewing, their work, their effort and development route.If you enjoy Galactic Civilizations III, Master of Orion and its new state is just terrific in comparison for Early Access. They did well for balance and such for Early Access which was my only concern. They layed out the production and development with the professionalism we have come to expect from Wargaming.net.In over 7 hours of play, only a couple of graphical glitches, but fully operational and with no bugs that do not impede gameplay.Great 60FPM. Not extensive on pc demand, so if you have 1 year or newer video card and solid state drive, your good. The writing is done very well too and I hope they continue to add more because it can be a bit redundant in longer games.The artwork and time spent is fantastic... but the voice work and all the acting stars that did this game including Mark Hamill(Star Wars), Michael Dorinm(Star Wars), Alan Tudyk(First Knight), John Delancy(Star Trek), John Cassir (Star Trek), and Robery England(Nightmare on Elm Street)!! I actually expected a terrific game like this from the makers of World of Tanks, World of Warplanes and World of Warships (Wargaming), who aldo just made WoTanks the most immersive tank game from sound effect and realism to date breaking a guiness record. So what do they do... take to space since they completed all war games on earth LOL.Get it, they give your all the old ones and this one... 4 games for 1 price. You wont even know its Early Access and spank people in a way you have not imagined! Old school or new school, this is a game with a nice smooth learning curve, and hard to master once you think you have it down. Replayability will give you hours to try so many races and so many tactics and world development.Put on a fresh pair of panties and hold on tight.... its one enjoyable ride and still huge amounts to come. Their updates have been bountiful and they are interacting with the community often.Solid Buy and underestimated and underrated.. but we plan to change that!It is still Early but this game, you would not know when when in the drivers seat!Discalimer; The Review Crew's evaluations are based on paying close attention to forum response and activity, system demand, fun of the game genre, position of originality in respective genre, growth of the project in its current state at time of review, graphics as a whole for end user, presentation of the game and display, replayability, patch/tweak progress, beginner friendliness & gameplay direction, content & depth, attention to detail on small things(polish), lag and multiplayer application if applicable, badge card availability, with a minimum 8 hours of gameplay and interaction with customer base after release.

If I were to grade it now it would be like grading the rough   draft and not very informative of the final product. _____________________			"

								My thoughts after an abortive play through and then a full play through in 7 hours...Fairly enjoyable, but hopefully some features and AI aggression yet to come. The game had some interesting moments, but did get a touch boring as well. Building the 20 somethingth planet up got boring, but the auto-build seemed useless.The AI basically left me alone. The cat people destroyed my main fleet and I madly build another one while waiting for an attack. There was one attack which I barely repulsed, but that was it. The AI could have taken much of my empire if they had tried. Or another race could have attacked me while I was weak and several did dislike me.It looked very good if a bit cartoony. There were no crashes. It seemed quite a bit like MOO 1/2 re-skinned, which is good for me. The relations between me and other races seemed fine if a bit simplistic.I just auto fought the battles and didn't worry about the RTS, so I didn't count that as a negative. I didn't have a problem with the Civ style tech tree. You still have some techs that require you to pick one tech out of two or three options. Also spys and marine invasions seem to be coming later.Weak AI, some boredom and no custom races are my main negatives. Note that custom races are ""coming soon"".A few notes that could be fixed easily. A way to see and sort pollution percentage from the empire screen. A way to see which planets had repair ability for my ships. A way to tell a ship to stay at a planet until repaired. Custom lists of things for the planets to build when first colonized. I may have missed some of those already being in game and I just didn't see them.From a fair old-timer, it wasn't bad and might improve so a thumbs up.			"

								It is early access game. We all know how many games in this stage turn to be worse than they should. Whatever state it is now, I really hope they won't stop with development. Quality over quantity is all I ask.Message to developerI bought it in early access, so that you can make it even better than it already is. Please don't waste your chance and people will be forever grateful to you. That is all I have to say and will take my stand on this opinion regardless of hours played. Thank you.			"

								MoO2, how I've missed you! So far, games looks great, very stable product, scales well to various settings, tech tree is pretty much MoO2 in a Civ4/5 setting, exploration is a little too easy (no range restriction), pacing is a little off (especially pop growth and science; will be adjusted), combat is non-strategic (will be updated). Fun bonus: you get a Trekkie nerd rush every now and then, as Worf narrates the destruction of a Bandit Camp, Barclay updates you on galactic events or Q tells you how much of a♥♥♥♥♥♥you are for not trading with Humans.Couple of small bugs here and there, nothing game breaking. And it's fun! It does not recapture the essence of what was MoO2 for me, but I'm sure it should cater to those in need of a 4X thrill in space! p.s. I personally prefer Stellaris. May be because I played 5,000+ hours of MoO2 as a teenager.			"

								If you're looking for a wall of text -- I don't do reviews that way.With that said, overall, I'd recommend this game.  It's already a lot of fun at this early point.  However, as someone that played the original MoO and MoO 2 (mostly the latter), it doesn't feel quite right just yet.I think the game is off to a good start, and if the developers keep moving in a positive direction, this will be a B+ game easily when it's officially released.The game is definitely not read for an official release just yet though, so don't buy this unless you're a fan of the series and don't mind playing something that's not quite finished yet.

Early Access Review
								Since the game is still in development, there are still small bugs and many blocked/not-yet-implemented features.  With that caveat out of the way, the game so far is great.As someone who played a great deal of both MoO and MoO2, I had great expectations for this game, and so far it does not disappoint.  Obviously there's still a lot to go--spying, for instance, doesn't exist yet, and at least six more races are in development--but it's fairly faithful to the original games.  It is 'closer' to the MoO2 gameplay, which is no tragedy; while I did greatly enjoy the simplified colony management of the original game and the massive fleets of stacked ships, the gameplay in MoO2 is more 'interesting' being more hands-on and everything.Interestingly, and quite pleasing to me, the character models were more based on the original MoO races rather than the (sometimes greatly changed) MoO2 races.  The Psilons are like greys with 4 arms, the Mrrrshan is a cat-lady, and the Alkari are birds, not pterydactyls.  Nice shout-out to the original.The voice-acting, particularly for your chosen advisor, can get repetitive, but it's a nice touch.  The narrator (Michael Dorn, Mister Work himself) rarely gets old, although the GNN is my least favorite VA collective (they can still be amusing, tho)All-in-all, it's hard to recommend an unfinished game for $50, but if you are a die-hard MoO fan it might be worth it to leap into it now.  Otherwise, if you're interested, you might want to wait for the finished project or at least for it to be further along before picking it up; but in the latter case, you should keep an eye on it, because it is already looking to be as successful a go-back title as XCOM.

								I am baffled at how idiotic some of these peoples comments are, crying about the turn limit being a problem?I am on my first game which I have managed to drag out to 40 hrs worth of game play, I am on turn 386 meaning I have 114 turns left, but what does that matter, I doubt I will hit turn 500 because I am partly in the middle of wiping out the last 3 races, all while I am colonizing every star system.That is not the point though, by turn 386 I have enough points to vote myself as the Supreme Chancellor of everyone, I now abstain my own votes as wiping out every single one of them is more fun this time round, I will venture into the other victory's when I play this over again.I have every piece of tech researched except ""Evolving Techs"" either because Scientific Victory is not fully finished, or because I need to build the 2nd building before it unlocks, I have not ventured to check because domination is my path for victory.I own 43 planets, my Colony ships are in the process to flying out to all other planets to take them over too.Out of them 43 planets I have Terraformed 16 into Gaia biome's, the best biome you can upgrade too, most of the other planets are in the process of terraforming as well, I basically have every building unlocked on nearly all these planets and max population.I have done all of this while playing as the Mrrshan, who I think are pretty enticing....But apart from that 500 turns is a fine number of turns to hit the peak at everything, I will play all the other races just because the game is fun.The only thing I have issues with is that I started getting lag the further into the game I got, but its Alpha, fact I can play this game on fantastic graphics is great, the game looks graphically beautiful.Scouting does not fully work, sometimes it auto explores, other times it doesnt bother...they need to make it so my scout can auto explore all the time, even if I have seen all star systems, mainly because its handy to have/do.There is not enough description I think for certain things, like the University, it does not tell me what requirements I need to have it at certain places, being as I have one on nearly every biome, every size planet, all the different colour star systems, and yet I cannot get it on random planets which would meet the same criteria as ones I have it on.I like that the game has things like population growth spurts, certain star systems have the possibility to go super nova, even one of my planets got infections to cure, it is all interesting and fun as its random to happen...nearly forgot one of my planets had an earthquake which killed alot of my population and destroyed most of my buildings,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, but I still liked it and the randomness of it all.In total this is the 2nd turn based game I have played, I have not played the previous versions of Moo, nor do I care if I have or not, I find people compare games too much these days and that leads to stupidity in the gaming world.Look forward to things being patched, new content being added, so keep up the good work and please get working on making it so you can play at harder levels, or make average harder as it feels like I am playing against an AI lower then easy and being locked at average is the only boring part about this game so far :)			"

								Just played a massive first session for hours; this game will quickly suck in any MOO veteran. Honestly it is pretty far along for an Early Access game. There are a few bugs and some features are not programmed yet. Also, they need to do more work to differentiate it from MOO2 - it is very similar to MOO2 but with updated 3d graphics. However,  it's an amazing product so far, and definitely has the potential to be what MOO3 should have been.I would give it a 7/10 and say that if they make the right choices it could easily be a 10/10.

Early Access Review
								I tend to agree to what many reviewer have already noted: The core mechanics are now in place and there is litle chance that we will see major changes to them, I assume mainly tweaking, balancing and finshing the implementation of tool tips/special features will be coming in the next update prior to a release. Pros- . The product in it's current state is playable and can be enjoyable, depending on what you are looking for: it'sclose to a polished finished title +++. The dev have done a great job (as developpers) the game has very few bugs, the dev are listening and addressing bug reports, and quite busy updating the game with patches, and updates. ++. Some of the changes implemented (start lanes, polution, victory condition, etc) are ok, those add-on fit in the spirit of the franchise. ++. Empire management, research, ship building are fairly well done, well streamlined and intuitive: improved on the franchise previous titles. +-Cons . AI un-challenging --. Tactical battles. ---I get no enjoyment from the above. It's actually the part that makes me lose interest in the game after a 100 turns or so. Past the 100 turn mark the next thing that wakes me up is the battle with the Orion guardian.Before and after no matter what I have done I will dread that boring tactical battle screen, clicking every ship formation to step back, move on,  go right or got left behind that block of asteroid to avoid a volley of missile: I do all this charade to try to get a feeling of control on the outcome of the battle when there is actually nothing critical you can achieve in those tac battle screen.More importantly for me: have fun.Fun firing my newly researched  plasma gun, fun testing what that new experimental design will do on the battlefield, fun trying out a fleet with a new module, trying to disable a specific enemy threat, and so and so.The battle are incredibly shallow I don't even think there is a need to RTS this mascarade within its own instance when you engage a fleet: the game could RTS the combat in the space map directly.That would save us screen loading time and we would get to the same result anyway.-My conclusionI am disapointed in the result of the reboot.I feel that I have been commercially abused, using such an old franchise  and rebooting it to that level of tactical dullness. Are they looking at people to take selfies in front of GNN robots and start a trend on facebook? That franchise was old, a reboot of an old franchise is going to attract old gamers and requires some respect...This game goes mainstream, I don't even know what public they are targeting.So I want to return the favor to you WGS and I will recommand readers to go and get Sollaris, you will get the same Boring space battle but it doesn't have a reputation to live for and it's actually a refrehing title in the 4X genre.MOO franchise and core strategy was built around space battle (research, econmy etc) here space battle are a side mechanic to manage, like diplomacy or spying so it's not a reboot it's a single title in the competitive 4X market, go for stellaris if you are considering M004.Dev you did a good job.The one(s) responsible for the depletion of interest in tactical battles in order to mainstream this title: you've changed.I hope you get a mutation in the next tractor SIM simulator game: go reboot that franchise it's a niche market.

								So here are the pros and cons about Master of Orion in its current state:Positive:Looks very prettyHigh profile voice actingVery stable buildVery few bugsComes with Master of Orion 1,2 and 3 (runs in Dos Box)Of course I take a lot of things in the game for granted so I cannot list them as positive... they are supposed to be there.Negative:The introduction of Star Lanes might not be everyone's thing... I'd prefer the old system + fuel.At this point the AI is fairly stupid, but this is subject to change according to the devs.Technologies need to be more balanced (Missiles need ammo or a nerf), also future technologies do not make older tech cheaper and smaller.Racial traits are very limitedObviously the game is still in Early Access so a lot of things can change.Also be aware that right now only 6 races are available and you cannot create a custom race yet.There is no espionage in the game yet.You also cannot change difficulty settings or the galaxy size (locked to medium for now) - you can chose between spiral and circular galaxy though.Ground combat is only simulated - I hope there will be a proper one in the future.Conclusion: Right now it's an easy going 4X game but lacks depth. Buy if you cannot wait for other similar games that are going to be released this year.Otherwise wait a bit before getting it.Also mind that this is the Collector's Edition. A cheaper Standard version will be a available at a later time.			"

								WARNING: Early Access PraisingAfter spending some hour in this game I can tell that it's, well, not bad. Unfinished, of cource, with a lot of empty spaces, but pretty and not hardcore as the MoO3. The game itself - pretty and stable.The real-time combat actually can be tactical - I killed some enemy vessels with my rocket ship without taking fire. The ship building is not ""dumb"" it's just designed simpler for the today's tablet-users: instead empty hull player receive some slots for different equipment - shield, armor, electronics and weapons. So he can't miss something valuable. All other seems the same - set some devices and fill the rest space by weapons.To buy or not to buy - that is the question. Game is an early access, which is a lottery with a high chances to fail. There is a lot of abadonware this days. But the Wargaming is a good company, after all, and you will receive all previous MoO games, if you don't have them already. But now they are on steam and working,And there is the Cat Empress! All love the Cats!			"

Either would be fine, although I understand RTS offers many more possibilities for strategy according to it's developers.Bring it on, I say!To the nay-sayer reviews I will add, ""What part of STILL IN DEVELOPMENT did you not understand?""

								I've played every incarnation of the Master of Orion series, literally from the beginning.  This installment reminds me of the original game in many respects.  I rather enjoy the feel and strategy of the game.   The bad first.  The interface map defaults to a zoomed configuration on every turn.Warp corridors, I rather miss having a limited range and fuel tech to restrict searches.A few techs are positioned to late in the game to be useful (i.e. core waste dumps)Turn based space battles.Some of the voice overs seem a little too processed, to the point where the actors virtually identifiable.The good.The feel and appearance is coherent over all aspects of the races.The interface is very streamlined and intuitive.The pace of the game is smooth, and to the point of wanting to play just one more turn.The economic victory is an interesting addition, which adds an additional dimension to game.The missed.A additional races from Master of Orion 2, especially the telepathic one.Fuel tech, found it to be an excellent limiter to expansion.Capturing enemy ships.I've really enjoyed this purchase and the changes that have come along in the early access game.  I look forward to seeing how the game continues to change and hope to see new additions in the future.			"

Come on!) but I believe most old school fans won't be disappointed,  I like some of the new units added but it's missing some useful ones (I thought anyway), no custom Scout class ships?Overall: I like what they're doing.

								Summary: A good space 4X at the moment, with potential for greatness as EA progresses.  It has its flaws, but my main points of contention are things that the developers have already stated are being worked on.Full Review:(Disclaimer: I barely played the original games, so this review will not compare this game to the previous entries in the series. It is being reviewed solely on its own merits.)I had been looking forward to this release for some time. I love 4X games (and strategy games in general), and several friends told me that the original Master of Orion games (1 & 2) were among the best there is. So when I saw a new entry in the series was being developed, I thought this would be my chance to get in join the action. And I immediately picked up the EA version, because I was interested in seeing how the game grew and evolved as it was developed (The game development process has always fascinated me).So far I have not been disappointed. The graphics are beautiful, the sound design is excellant, and the voice acting is superb, as one would expect given the quality of the voice acting talent in the game. While these aesthetic qualities are nice, the gameplay itself is also quite good. I like the decison to limit space travel to star lanes, as I think it lead to some interesting strategic choices (for example: do I expand to this high quality planet that is easily accessible to all including potential invaders? Or do I expand elsewhere and stay behind this easily defended choke point?). The tech tree is what I've come to expect from a 4X game, though I liked that some of the advances made you choose what the advance gave you. Again, it was a mechanic that allowed for interesting decisions.That being said, there are a few points of concern that I have. The tactical space battles themselves, while defintely cool looking, felt limited, and not all that tactical (I do like the real-time with pause approach though). However, the developers have stated that this is something they are working on improving. Also, the opponent AI, particularly in matters of diploamcy, seems bit off. They drop in to Guarded or Hostile status way too easily, often for reasons as simple as rejecting a trade deal. Also, they opponents as a whole aren't too smart, and hence not too difficult. Again, the AI is something the developers have stated is a work in progress, so I assume as more difficulty levels are added, and the AI in general is improved, these won't be much of an issue anymore.As the game currently stands, I enjoy it, and am looking forward to the further additions as EA progresses. It's a fun game, and as long as the developers keep up what they're doing it has the potential to be one of the greats.Side note: Is it just me, or does it seem ironic that I won a diplomatic victory (as the Psilons) by buying votes from the leaders I wasn't at war with, while simultaneously blowing up Alkari planets (about 10 before the council session where I won) with my Doom Star?  Is it weird that there's no diplomatic penaly for this?			"

												My updated Review after recent patch:Updated 3 March 2017After 100+ hours... Get this game, they have improved soo much and it is just fun as hell.________________________________________________________________________________Old Reviews:35+ hours of game experienceMaster of Orion Version 42.6Game is simple but getting more complex. It is clear on how to progress and upgrade both ships and planets. It is fun building up a empire and crushing a enemys with it. An this game does it well, with out all the head ache of a few other titles.My previous complaint of the diplomat system has been vastly improved.  As were before the AI refused to back down from a war, even when there was no hope of winning is fixed.  Empires will often bow down and agree to vote for you if you are dominating them.  Tho they do tend to pick a fight over not giving them credits, even if you are the strongest military in the galaxy.  I was able to maintain a few alliances since patch as well, which is a huge step in the right direction.  My only complaint about the allys is more often than not they don't support you if your attacked.  They break alliance and stay friendly with you, but avoid fighting other enemys.  Atleast until your serval times stronger than the enemy.  Thats when they fall back to the old logic of better not♥♥♥♥♥♥the player off our he may very will use my empire to wipe his♥♥♥♥♥with.Also with the launch of the new races, I find the new races struggling to match the old races that get a science buff.  Sure you get manufacturing bonus, but its only helpful early on and late game.  Mid game any race with science bonus tends to be vastly supiour to you in tech, which makes your fleets hard press to beat them.  You literally have to friend them or kill them in the first 100 turns our your in for a painful time.Over all this latest patch has been great.  Diplomat system got a lot better and gameplay became more dynamic with the new races and the creat your own race option.  But game does need some mad race bonus tweaks.Update: 29 March 2016Noticed AI now builds ships to counter your designs.  I tend to love rocket boats, but since recent patch they seem to be less effective.  An noticed AI is guarding against missles a lot more with point defense builds.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Cons:Would definitely be the AI.  Its actions could be improved, and  a better way to barter them down to a agreement would be nice.  Right now it feels like its their way or the highway if they ask for somthing.Would be nice to be able to make a race a slave race as well instead of just killing them off and loosing thier vote.An the other problem would be balance of the classes.  I feel the races with science bonus diffently has the advanage past turn 100.Anyways thats my 2 cents on the game. Differently recommend it in its current state.  Especially if the improvements keep rolling out like this lastest patch.			"

								An excellent successor to MOO2!   It's been a great deal of fun playing since launch and seeing the game evolve and the bugs get fixed.    I'd highly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed MOO2.    There are some cons to the game, but, I don't think they outweigh the fun I have playing.  Buy the pack with all of the MOOs available, great deal of fun playing the older versions as well!			"

												This game is so broken on linux that I think it should have the SteamOS icon removed. In fullscreen mode it defaults to the monitor's max resolution and doesn't provide any other options. In windowed mode, it offers plenty of other resolutions. Those settings don't save, so you have to change it each time you launch the game. As if that wasn't frustrating enough, when the game switches from fullscreen to windowed mode, it often times crashes. That is all before you even play the game but the problems don't stop there. After playing for a while and saving your game multiple times, the game sometimes loses your savegames!			"

								So nice to see an old type of game upgraded in both form and method to produce what will be the best.  Take what works then improve on it.  A masterwork of game design and so looking forward to the final product, even at this stage it out performs so many so called finished games of late the devs here need to produce YouTube videos on how to make a game  then send them to the likes of the xcom2 devs who have made a pigs ear of a game.Only played a few hours but no lockups, CTD or anything odd for that matter.  This is so poished that if they polish it any more will need to wear sunglasses when playing. "

								It's still in early access and it reminds me of what the full release of Endless Space was. To quote Howard Jones I'd say things can only get better.It may not be enough for some people though, right now I'd advice those who aren't fans of MoO to wait a bit before buying so they don't get the wrong impression about the game, but for the rest of us I'd say it's a worthy reboot that takes the best from every other game in the series.

The Interface looks good und is easy to understand. Problem as of now is that it is missing content so it is impossible to say how long you are going to have fun with it. If you don't want to risk your money on an UNFINISHED Game keep away. If you like 4x Games and don't mind the risk go get it.			"

								So far thoroughly enjoyable. I played my first complete play through as the Sakkra. Didn't do too badly. I will try to screen cap the score screen in my  gallery.Game stays true to the principles of the original game. Still needs a lot of work to bring it up to competitive speed with current 4x's, but a truly magnificent ground work has been laid for a good game for early access. The game is enjoyable in its current state with few noticable bugs or glitches. Interface still needs some work, especially on the combat screen. It still is much better than the combat screen from MOO3 which had little more than shadows for ships.I think this game has a lot of potential. I bought in early to encourage its devleopment.			"

								I give this game a 9/10 only because it is still pre alpha.  This game is very well made and the interface is beautiful.  As annoying as GNN used to be, its actually entertaining to watch in this new version of MOO.  The races are well done and I had no problems with the custom race screen.  Also the advisor is very helpful and all the information is there by highlighting over anything.  This game is superior in everyway to the original and I am pleasantly surprised by that.  What I also liked immensely is a bug report screen in which you can report any descrepancies you might noticed.  On that issue there was only one I could find so far and that was a placeholder for race name in GNN which showed up only once so far.  The only thing I would reccommend is a better upgrade or shipyard screen advisor for it is a little hard to get a understanding of it.  While it is fairly intiutive it would be helpful to have an advisor or something there.  Other than that very well done.			"

								I'm a total fan of the series from back when the first one game out, I’ve played all of them to death in my younger years so to me it was a non brainer to get this. Just one of those people that liked the original so much that they still regularly play it, and I like this. It  like an updated version of the older games with better graphics some nicer toned music and a few little quirks here and there such as the tech tree works which forces you to make choices. If I had to put on my none bias hat I would sadly have to say there are better 4x space games on the market, but for those getting into this genre of game it is easier to get to grips with than some of the more complex ones on the market. If new to the genre its worth a look, but if an old hand at these style of games and looking for something with a lot more depth then not your cup of tea. For me however both thumbs up!			"

Early Access Review
								I've played a lot of Master of Orion 1 and 2. Third was an absolute travesty, damned space Excel. The new Master of Orion under WG shows promise, yet understand that it's in early access for a reason.I'm eventually writing a preview of Master of Orion for Gamereactor Finland and thought I'd share the issues I've encountered while stabbing at it. Some of these are plain feedback. Some are bugs, some are not. Some are minor, some are more severe. Some are calls for features.TL;DR: Great potential, tons of issues. Early access material. Main issue really is how easy the AI is to play against -> it's not fun when there's no challenge.Here's a list of fixes I'd suggest, should give you an idea where the game is at.EMPIRE SCREEN........................... Population redistribution is not available as it should. Add it.Population on strike does not show correctly on 1920x1200 resolution when player has 10 or more population on strike. Only first digit is shown.UPGRADING SHIPS.............................. Should be doable with production too, not only currency Confusing and bugged. I'm often seeing upgrade option to blueprint I don't even have any longer but no options for ones I do // Yes, correct ship sizeGALAXY MAP..................... Star lane transit direction is very hard to see. Adding an arrow wouldn't hurt. Player color is not shown when you zoom out.Military Bases are very hard to separate. Eg. as Bulrathi, opponent military bases still have the red outline circle (same color/hue as your nation color. There's only a microscopically small area on the military base (requires you to zoom in), which is colored per player unique color. Ideally the military bases would look different from race to race.Add a glow effect to fleets that have actions/movement left.Combining fleets is bugging / acting weird sometimes happens automatically, sometimes you have 4 fleets in same spot, not able to combine them (I've had like 3-1-1-1 ships with movement left)Can't build military base on a system I'm on for some reason. I've one there, can't build another.Add a more visible effect for planets with moons.Add auto bombardment option. Cycling around for multiple fleets to manually bombard is an unnecessary burden.If a ship could finish an action after movement, the game should allow resolving that before ending a turn. eg. unloading / attacking. If you're using automatic movement, you'll lose a turn currently.Players should be able to drag & drop ships from selected ships/fleets.Civilizian / Combat ships should be more clearly distingushed from each other. eg. different background glow / icon size?COLONY SCREEN............................Add multiple worker redistribution. Currently you will have to move them one at time.Pollution tooltip / overlay isn't giving enough information. Pollution reduction buildings are confusing.Pollution change % does not update when you start production for pollution removal. You need to move a colonist first.Science/Food/Production values aren't always upgraded correctly with eg. heightened intelligence causing +0.5 science/population. Adding a population to science adds +3 total science, but shows +2 science on the planet. The values should calculate the bonuses too.Hard to find out when a planet is ""wrong gravity"" or radiated. It should have a large info screen right awayManage buildings"" is useless with the 3D planet that you'll have to turn around to locate a building you'd want to scrap. Add a 2D list option at least.Area where the colonists can be activated to move them from an assignment to another is is very small. It should made much larger.SCIENCE SCREEN.............................Breakthroughs are confusing. Apparently you do not have to choose a tech if you get one? Or this could be a bug that there's some tech that was marked as split | option, but yet I got both. Clarify.Tech that is non-cumulative should also show gained net effect, not only the ""compared of having no previous tech"".FLEET SCREEN.........................Shows player ships, but doesn't allow players to do anythingSuggestion: Fleets could lower the command point cost of the ships in them when certain requirements are met. The amount would be tech dependant.Suggestion: Fleets could have a slot for a flagship, which would gain some sort of offensive/defensive/command point buff. This way players would also have more personal attachment to their ships and fleets.DIPLOMACY...................A.I. races tend to throw same offers to players, which just feels ...not right. Suddenly in one turn, 4 races want to offer you whole 90 credits for a certain tech, oookay.Exchange tech should show tooltip for what the tech is. Not only the name.COLONIZING....................Too cheap / becomes bothersome when players aren't penaltized anyhow from having colonies. Ideally you'd just colonize every single planet, starting from the better ones. Easy quick fix would be to eg. triple colony ship production cost.No colony bases in same system available?COMBAT..............Often starts with opponent's military base/missile base/star base showing explosion GFX // graphical glitchMissiles/torpedos and kiting just stupidly powerful. Balancing required.A.I seems to take over player ships, even when you disable the AI.Add an option for permanent weapon range overlayAdd a retreat option.Proton torpedoes do not always show any GFXAdd scrolling combat text options, eg. ""50% damage dealt"" on side when 50% of the weapons miss. Ideally even with reason ""beam defence"", ""ECM""Add turn based combat as option. That way you don't have to explain all the work made on the real-time one to publishers/investors. It's there, but you want even more!SHIP DESIGN......................Proton torpedo description says they move light speed and hit instantly, but in combat they're very slow (as they should be)Description screen isn't always showing all the text and is scrollable, but does not show any kind of scrollable area, even when there's enough space to show all of the descriptionMilitary power value tells absolutely nothing. It's confusing.Attack and defensive values <-> military value all pointless and confusing. Instead add various damage/DPS numbers. eg. missile salvo damage.Armor and armor penetration is confusingSystem / weapon descriptions are terrible. There are tons of modules that show NO effect only random description. eg. dauntless missile systemWeapon modules should be technology linked. Weird that players have all the available options right away, eg ""enveloping"" before you even know what shields are...Weapon modules (eg. heavy mount) show no effect on any of the values but size/production costAllow players to add too much stuff on the ship and change screens. Just prevent them from building an ""illegal"" ship.Highlight pausing of combat somehow. Pause is the hotkey, perhaps add a large ""pause"" button on the middle bottom with binded hotkey shown?MUSIC............While the current music is quality production, why 100% classical instruments? I'd love to hear tracks with electronic elements too. *points to Master of Orion 2 OST ...and Civilizations: Beyond Earth!*Racial tracks would be great as well! "

								From playing this game now for 23 hours so far it seems to be a very stable and fun game. Played the tutorial with a couple races and it functions well. Yes it is a text box tutorial with some minor voice-overs but all in all it works well and decribes the basics very well. There are a few bugs in the later game but this is still an EA game and does need a bit more polishing. Anyone who has played MoO1 and 2 will fall back in love with this game. It even has some of the old sound effects from MoO1. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a true 4x game. 8/10 for me so far!!			"

								As a person who talked to the Designers of MOO 2 back in the 1990s was thrilled to see this being remade. Will say so far I like what I have seen. I know there is more to come so reserving final judgement. But right now recomend this game.  But the final verdict is still out. Some features missing in game that can make it great. One is Hotseat from old MOO2. That simple edition made MOO2 so entertaining with friends at home for so many nights. One thing I disliked about MOO2 is still in this game. Too few star systems and too few planets. I had to get the online editor to fix the problem in MOO2. Sad to still see that this game limit is in this new game.Ship design and building is another key feature. Will have to see how this is implimented. Like the new version over old MOO2 with technologies. Hated the limit of having to only chose one of three techs in a group. Really need to see that removed finally.Finally would love a tech adjustment filter. I downloaded a mod that allowed tech discoveries to take longer than MOO2 allowed. Always hated that tech changed so fast making early weapons and tech so useless to even find.Good luck with the game !			"

								Being an old MOO2.EXE owner, I didn't expect much after MOO3, to be honest. That said, MOO:CTS (?) is a nice Early Access game, so far.I think that it is a great 4X game that will disappoint some MOO fans, but I'm sure it is interesting to fans of MOO-clones such as Endless Space, Galactic Civilizations, Star Ruler etc., for perhaps the following reasons- At this stage, it is a full game with tons of features already- Nice art and sound, and (surprisingly) a decent AI with alliances and such- It is not ground-breaking, nor experimental though, so it's easy to learn- It is of a higher art and design quality than many other 4X games- Space combat is RTS with an option for auto-combat- Less micro management than old 4X gamesFor old MOO brats I'd say- It is quite a shiny Disney evolution of a dinosaur- Not so many fresh gameplay ideas so far- It's like CIV4 and 5 are its best friends, MOO2 is its dad, and MOO1 its grandpa- And quite some lack of depth, of story, due to Early Access, I guessEDIT: Now that Stellaris is coming, I think that this MOO shows its weakness. Stellaris did show so far more fresh and interesting game mechanics, depth and even some story, while MOO:CTS seems to be rather a nice looking remake than anything that will push 4X forward.			"

								As a light 4X fan and someone who played Master of Orion 2 when it came out years ago, this game was very easy to get into. Other 4X games have a steep learning curve and have a lot of information thrown at you. This game has a great UI that was pretty intuitive and easy to figure out without constant tooltips. It also definitely gets you in the nostalgia if you played Master of Orion 2. The major complaint about this game so far is that it is too easy. Can't say I'm really surprised about that for an early access game however. There is currently no difficulty setting in the game and the computer seems to stop researching and expanding after reaching a certain point. I wouldn't be surprised if this turns out to be the beginner or easy difficulty. Obviously it comes down to how the game looks like at release, but there's plenty of time for them to address this. Computer difficulty seems like something that's the easiest to address before release. Worth keeping an eye on as it nears release.			"

								There are lots of minor things that are limiting my love of the game currently, but it is still in its early access stages and I am hoping many of these will be changed/corrected/fixed as time goes on.My biggest dissapointments of this newest edition of the Master of Orion series is the lack of the ""Hotseat"" multiplayer options that would allow people to game against each other on the same computer and the turn limit that has been placed to restrict the amount of time a game goes on for.As an old fan of the original trilogy, I know this latest edition to the collection has quite a reputation to live up to. But as a stand alone game, it is fun, it is playable and totally worth it just to hear Mark Hamill talking in a squawky voice.			"

Early Access Review
								so far this game is amazing. and it's Early Access... I feel bad that so many Steam users don't understand what that means and end up disgruntled. I hope they revisit the game when it's fully released.  Meanwhile I feel like we EAs have *some* influence over what the game will become.I bought MOO in 1993 and have been playing it since.  I was one of the many disappointed by MOO3.MOO4 (as I'm calling it) totally delivers.  Before I bought the CE I was super skeptical. I also told myself I was going to wait for it to go on sale.  But then I just couldn't wait... and I'm glad I got it.I am enjoying the new addition of space lanes and warp points, it totally adds another element of strategy. Never thought I would like something like that until I actually played it and see how it shapes the game. It is different.I was very worried about the well known names they got for voice acting... but ultimately it came out way better than I thought.  Although the GNN team isn't great, they are not really that noticeable and it's easy to SKIP or disable entirely.Combat was the thing I most worried about.  I want something tactical and something that delivered the same enjoyment from MOO1 battles.  So far in Early Access it's just the ""bones"" of what is to come and so far it's great.  I never thought RTS battle would work, since it didn't at all in MOO3.  But it totally works so far and it's a lot of fun - it is however in the early stages.The ship building is the same, at least the outline of it. I just hope they give us more options for making unique looking ships.I love that the devs are reaching out to the community trying to make this the best game they can.  Overseeing the entire production is Chris Keeling.  He's made it well known about his love for MOO1&2 which really shines as this game has obviously been made to truly honor it's heritage.   First great game I've played in a  LONG time.  Strategy games usually take a long time to play and take time to develop into the fun that they ultimately are..this title totally delivers.

Early Access Review
								I have spent a lot of time Playing Master of Orion. Granted, the majority of it was Master of Orion II back in the 90s. I did give Master of Orion I a shot around then as well... and I had pre-ordered Master of Orion III and gotten my disappointment just as quickly as I possibly could have.That being said, as I see it, Master of Orion is a worthy successor to the franchise. The game-play feels almost nostalgic in a lot of ways. The updated graphics really lend to the overall universe and flesh it out even more than before. It feels like an immersive experience, just like Master of Orion II did. It will pull you in and hold you for the next turn... that turns to 100 turns...I have to say it has been more than what I had hoped. The Early Access was more than a fair deal for the price (and I really rarely do early access at all) and the features aren't as limited as other early access games I have seen.I look forward to posting on the community boards as the dev team said they would be interacting with players regularly for feedback and to possibly implement changes. The few things I have found missing (I've got about 200+ turns and a boatload of tech research under my belt. I have found Orion and made first contact with half of the AI):1. Governors and specialists for hire to assign to colonies - I didn't think they were all that necessary until you don't have them... and sometimes they really gave an edge. Not    really central to the game, but a great mechanic. - Psilon research: At times, you have to choose what tech is granted with the research. This may have been a way to try to balance the races a bit. Classically, Psilons did not have to choose what advance to gain from a tech, no matter what the tech might be. Things implemented that were kinda neat:- Pirate colonies that had varying levels of ships coming at you (easy at first and getting harder as time goes on)- Unstable warp gates (impassable until you could research the appropriate tech)- Unique ship designs (thank you so much for Psilon Saucers)- Amazing voice actingand many more features...Definitely get it. Try it. Make your loved ones miss you as you disappear into the galaxy. Victory is always just a few turns away...May update the review as time goes on... I look forward to the rest of the game coming... and being Master of Orion.Edit 2/29/16:After a couple of play-throughs (one as Psilon and another as Sakkra), I wanted to amend the review I had put up.- The graphics are great. On my machine, the graphics detect did not work, so that feature may not yet be available. - Micromanagement AI could be a little better using auto-build/colony focus. I find it building some buildings that are odd at the time (ie. Marine Barracks while not even close to war-time or food buildings whenever there is a surplus instead of productivity buildings)- Combat is really nice. Real time combat vs Turn based was a surprise, but not bad. Managing combat can be tricky, however, if you do not make use of the pause button.- Some bugs are very apparent in the game. I have had to submit several bug reports in a single play session.- The beginning star system seems to have a planet and a gas giant. Always. Seems like a big bug to me...All in all, even with the bugs, Master of Orion is a very awesome game and still worth the play time and the money. I look forward to the future of development and the bug fixes and to see where all of this leads to.			"

								Best way to describe the new Master of Orion? Imagine if Sins of a Solar Empire was turn-based. That pretty much nails it.Look, I've never played MOO before this, but I have played a ton of CIV, and various Space-faring games over the years, and here's my take, as a simple guy looking for a simple Space strategy game.This game has held my interest like no other. EVERY SINGLE OTHER Space game I tried either bored me, the mechanics were too difficult to grasp properly and I gave up after 5 hours, or I just didn't like the way the game worked. Other than SoaSE, but that was real-time strategy, not so much Turn-based 4x.This game is simple to grasp, fun to play, looks amazing and runs brilliantly, and is just a joy to breeze through. That being said, I have gotten to points where I just got bored and ended up clicking the ""Next Turn"" button repeatedly because I had pretty much done everything that there was to do at the time, and I then had ages to wait for the next big thing to happen, but I do get that this game is still EA and not all content is there yet. I mean, I'm hoping I'll see ""more"" things added to each race (I doubt it at this point though) and I am still looking forward to seeing the remaining races being added... However, managing planets is so far very basic, and trying to set up colonies on ""bad"" planets is an absolute nightmare.But yeah, so far I've really enjoyed this game, and I'll reserve judgement until release. I do think it might get boring the longer a session goes on, but we'll see, I suppose it also depends on difficulty and number of races playing (last thing you want is to be overwhelmed and hate the game) and I will admit I was playing rather ""light"" games in systems mostly blocked off with unstable wormholes.My score so far for EA: 7.0 / 10Edit: A few niggles I just noticed. One: In real-time space battles, your ships just charge the enemy, and while they are being pummeled by gunfire, they start CIRCLING AROUND the enemy and STOP SHOOTING while they do this!!! So I'm left with half my fleet flying around in circles doing nothing for up to 30 seconds at a time while they get hammered. WTH?? They will try to shoot through asteroids instead of waiting until they get clear line of sight (asteroids block shots) and it's impossible to position them tactically because they just beeline straight for the enemy every time. This is a big no-no.			"

								I'm reviewing this while playing the unfinished version and I am enjoying it more than I have most other 4x games since my time playing the original. There are a few things I'm hoping get ironed out-1. A way to dedicate enough production to clean up that you eliminate waste build up (like you could by just clicking the arrow in the original?) 2. I would like to be able to bypass warp points and cross pure space with large penalties later in the game 3. Large planet or system wide construction projects that would require the resources of at least a half dozen planets for the small projects (halos, specialized planetoids), and even perhaps half a huge galaxy for the big ones (ring worlds, Dyson spheres) Production could easily be rerouted to such projects from an Interplanetary Administration. 4. I would like to be able to negotiate exceptions to treaties to prevent conflict and make it easier to maintain relations by allowing you to do things they might not like, but needing to pay a large cost to mitigate their displeasure. An example of this would be offering tech or credit in order to settle a planet that's closer to them then they'd like. I like the flexibility of the diplomacy offer/counteroffer system letting you feel out what they want (and then negotiating for less). Looking forward to seeing espionage implemented and unlocking all the races again. I am very curious to see if mixing races of your empire by conquering planets populating other races will have any impact on espionage; and possibly eventually improving relations as your populaces get used to intermingling. This could be a way for both sides to bypass some of the planet wide DNA detectors whether your empire n captured a planet or had a planet taken. "

								First off Im just going to say that this game... IS AMAZING. Every cent was worth it. I honestly do not understand the other negative reviews of this games because much of what they are not true, but I´m not here to bash other people around, I really want to review this game and highlight it's potential.As you can see, yes I have put a lot of hours into the game. Having playing Civilization, Galactic Civilizations, and many more stratigic game I can surely say this game does not fall behind.The graphics, the battle mechanic and the way you can control battles, the economy, and the victory paths that you can do really are complex and fun (specially if you go with espionage). But the best fact is that this game that I have had so much fun, played with many friends, and have impressed them all, all this is still just Early Access. People might argue that the devs aren't going to do anymore which is not true but even if it were this game is more than great enough to launch.Try out this game and don't fall for all negative reviews and bashing it's recieving, More than a great game to play now I can safely say it has an amazing POTENTIAL (becuase I want to highlight that word) and I trust the devs of what they are making because they have already made great work up till now.

								Not feature complete, regardless of what the devs think. There is a lot of flavor missing that was what made MOO2 such a charming, replayable game. Worst of all no turn based combat and no pilots/administrators. Less humourous and more repetitive GNN. Underneath all that, though, is still a pretty solid game. It just needs more work and more polish. And a few more features.			"

Early Access Review
								First off:  Good game, for an Early Access.But to be clear:  It's not MoO2, and if anything it seems to have a lot more in common with MoO3.  If you go into this expecting a MoO2 clone, you're going to be disappointed!Major Complaints:-- The races are cartoon-y.  All of them.  It's not TF2 endearing, it's not tasteful, it's not amusing. It's just embarrasing-- Currently a 500 turn cap, or so I'm told.  I haven't hit the counter yet.... but I have no desire to have one, ever, in any strategy game I play.Minor concerns:- Diplomacy is barely implimented, extremely rough- Tech tree is limited, with almost no branches- Ship customization is there, but also extremely rough- Your advisors are annoying as f*#!.  Not even kidding, I had other people in the room yelling at them to stop repeating the same lines over and over.- Sadly, the Galaxy News is the same.- Tactical battles functional, but bare...... but you DID notice that it's Day 1, right?  And still early access..... so NONE of the above should suprise you!  If you're looking for this already out of development, play GalCiv 2/3.I, on the other hand, love where this game already is at Day 1, and as long as the developers keep in touch, I expect to see the Masters of Orion that never really was...+ Crisp galactic maps (I look forward to bigger maps and variety!)+ Natural barriers (advanced starlanes) to limit early game expansion.  No, you don't have to like it... but you're limited to your little corner until you grow up and can fly the big star lanes like all the other Big Kids.  No rushing for the enemy capitol and nuking them from orbit... not yet, at least.  Stop complaining.... if you remove it, the AI will nuke you ever time on turn 30 if given a chance.  It's there for a reason!+ Ship designs have all the basics for a well thought-out design program.  It's fundamental, but the basics are there.+ Building / Development trees for colonies are REMARKABLY well-fleshed.  If anything, they need to get a bit more restrictive of setting up colonies in horrible locations, like dumping all your giant cats on a giant aquatic infertile rock.+ While combat is rough, it seems extremely fair and grounded in a good place.  They need to add features, but there doesn't seem to be the need for overhaul.+ Graphics are smooth, with some intentional art-styling.  Hopefully they will move over to ALL art-styled or ALL crisp graphics, rather than a mix.+ Mechanics are more or less intuitive, with the need for some minor UI tweaks.  If you've played Endless Space, MoO2/3, or GalCiv, you'll feel right at home.Neutral Concerns:There is a lot not fleshed out here, and we're going to optamistically cross fingers for further development.  If it was left in this state, it would NOT be a finished product... but I'm sure they know that.I'll re-visit this as time progresses, and update as features are implimented.  If they listen to even a quarter of what I've seen posted on the Steam Forums, this game will be a gem polished to a stunning luster.Right now it's a rough gem, with a little unpolished beauty poking out.  But I'm certainly smiling as I'm imagining what it's going to look like in 6 months.			"

								Although I'm still on my first playthrough of the game, I'm really enjoying it. Some UI still needs better explanations such as workers being on strike.Also, I think the UI could do with a bit of streamlining, it's a very klunky system where selecting a building opens a new window where you select the one you want then press build, then leave the menu. It could in some ways benefit from using a similar UI to CIV when working on your planets.			"

								O I've played the originals and loved them, this isn't far off with a few elements missing and a few updates could make it really good, so lets see who listens.Dont get me wrong, still love this game, far better than that MOO3 rubbish, just needs some tweeks:1.  Ships - could do with more options for the looks, currently they only have 2 looks per class could do with a few more to make your fleets look different.2.  Customisation - is very similar but they limit you to slots as well as space, 3.  Races - All the races seem to have the same personality, they used to do diffent things like be best at research, expand, lots of ships, now they seem to be the same and do the same in negotiations as well.4.  Random Events - could do with more random events/monsters, this seems to have been cut down as well.5.  CNN News - I know there robots but jesus, make them a bit more interesting they are so boring you just want to skip them.6.  Combat - can we have an option like Homeworld where you can follow one ship or a squad by clicking F on the ship.  Also could do with some diffent combat grounds, not just asteroids on the screen.7.  Doom star - I know this is the end game ship, but dont think it should automatically have the destroy planet option, I was leveling entier star systems  each turn with this, would have it as a research option and have to equip it as it makes them far to powerful.

Early Access Review
								This is the game that Master of Orion 3 should have been and beyond. As a veteran MoO2 player, I was at first hesitant about this reboot, but as time went on WG showed that they were extremely passionate about this project, and it has now been proven in the gameplay of this game. Something to note if you're also a veteran MoO2 player, the new tech tree is going to seem simplistic to you, because instead of researching individual techs, you research things a group at a time. At first I thought it was going to be lame, but honestly, it's a good way of modernizing the game flow and it speeds up the gameplay without taking the strategy out of teching - it's all still there, just a little bit quicker.The UI is clean and gorgeous - there are some things I'd still like added, like being able to buy production from the colony overview screen to save me from having to go to each individual planet, but that's really a quality of life thing that isn't necessary right now.The voice acting is stellar, the visuals are clear and concise, and the galaxy layout is different now using a ""warp node"" system - and what this means is that now you can predict where enemies can attack you from and defend them. This is another thing that I thought would be a far departure, but again, it really just modernizes the same gameplay style we all love, and actually keeps you from getting merc'd by tech rushes and such.This game is just going to keep getting better as more content is added, and I'm so happy that WG decided to pick this us and do something with it. Absolutely get this game. Now. Please and thanks.			"

Early Access Review
								My overall feel:It has all the terms, sounds and races anyone familiar with MoO games will recongize.  The graphics are really stunning for a 4X strategy game and it feels very well optimized for a game still in early access.  The voice acting is really on point and the people they got to play the voice roles are very noticable for anyone that really loved sci-fi TV shows from the 80's though the early 2000's.  From where it started and to where it is now really has me feeling this is going to turn into a really outstanding game once its completely polished, tuned, and most importantly completed.  So below when I say some thing still need some work or are kind of bad right now take it with a grain of salt.  They have been working and fixing many of these things as early access as continued.  I sespect that to continue without a doubt.  But I am just tossing my opinion on those things as they are at this point and in my opinion (of course).My warning to rose tinted glasses people:The only warning I give to people about this game is that if you go into it expecting it to be MoO2 with a new engine you likely are going to be disappointed.  Certainly if you plan to kick, scream, and complain constatly about it not being other wise.  This game will not be that.  It will most certainly be its own stand alone title with differences and changes.Here is my quick breakdown as of NOW (early access - so subject to change)Whats good:-graphics-sounds-voice acting-""feel"" of space and space battles-""direction"" the alpha is heading feels good as well.-listening to fans that maintain reasonable character on the offical forums (respond often as well!)What needs some work still:-tech tree (feels dry so far, but getting better with patches!)-AI response and reactions (its very much in the angry teenager stage but has shown improvement)-diplomacy (its not in the game yet, so I put it here -- but for early access it makes a hole noticable in game)The bad:-over time repeatitive voice calls can annoy you (bird tech guy anyone?).  Be sure to set your volumes here correctly!-needs more options and choice in space battles (which have been coming in patches but still more!) "

I've seen games that were ""released"" with less polish than this one. The UI is simple and intuitive and the animations and voice acting are top notch. Graphically the game is beautiful for a 4x space game. So far I've only had one or two VERY minor bugs and certainly nothing game breaking or even hindering. The different factions all seem to be pretty unique but I'm still figuring out how much they differ. Overall, if you are a fan of 4x space games or even just turn-based strategy games, definitely pick this one up. I haven't been dissapointed yet.			"

								EA Review, from a MOO fan..OMG!! A little history of me, I've played every MOO game, my favorite is MOO2, then MOO1 (never got into the new design and feel of MOO3). I got MOO1, played the hell out of it.. I then preorder MOO2 at a local radioshack, and waited and waited, till two months after the release date i still hadn't had MOO2 in my hands, canlced the preorder (now an order at this point). I found it at Walmart weeks later, and the rest was history.  Story there was never pre-order anythign at radioshack.. :)Anyhoo, Why am I talking about MOO2 so much, well this feels just like it with improvments that I've always wanted in the game.. I was worried they would take it a new direction, like I felt they did with MOO3, but they stuck to the roots of the game.Stuff I like so far:- Nice UI layout, simple enough to decipher things as other MOO games- Technology Upgrades that effect ship building provides an option to upgrade the rest of the fleet (at a cost of course)- Build Queue's That's it for now, still in EA I'll update when full release and more game time. So far, I'd say a solid buy for MOO fans out there.. Also nice perk of the Collectors pack is you get the old versions too, always good for some replay value, and I might give MOO3 another go..  "

								Certainly has the Master of Orion flavor in there for me from the originals. The early access build feels surprisingly stable, even though it's missing loads of features. Real time combat doesn't bother me. I like the idea that weapons have facing, and can't wait to see all combat features fully implemented.For research I'd like to have possibility of allocating my research points to different fields like weapons, defense, diplomacy etc., instead of selecting one tech I want to focus on.  I think I haven't seen that implemented in long time and I miss it.For some reason I'd also like to rotate my map view, especially if I start on top of galaxy. I don't know if this is possible.But overall very good job so far! "

								Currently this game is in EA. So obviously it has flaws. But!The Dev's have excellent communication between them and the community. This will be key for greatness to come from this game. They have given us a very detailed roadmap which they hopefully will fulfil. As of what is in the EA it's great! Sure there are bugs and all that but the structure and the potential that can come from this game is huge. I'm very much looking forward to the changes that will come soon. Things i personally want to see,*The continued introduction of more minor races after realease.*More unique traits of races. Need to have the feeling of wanting to be that race because of their traits. Currently it's because they look better haha*MORE TECH.  Needs to feel like it's different every time you play a different game. To me I don't like the civ look of the tech tree. I don't like seeing want comes from a certain tech. I like exploring and working out for my self what techs give what.*More more more customizable options for ships.*More natural disasters and random events that force you to respond. Love the galactic news!*STORYYYYY :))))To wrap everything up, i love where this is going. If the Dev's continue showing their love for the game then it's going to be a good one on release.			"

								F&%King sexy.  I probably sank 3000+ hours into Master of Orion 1 and 2.  I even got 1 wokring on an android tablet, and added hours that way.  Needless to say 4x space games are my absolute favorite, followed closely by the Civ series.  This is a fantastic start.  VERY easy to pick up and instantly enjoy.Things I'm, in love with..a) The best early access game I've ever played stability and content richness wise b) really REALLY does a solid job at bringing back the MoO feel but also adding in some new mechanics.  c) The tactical ship fighting is amazing..purely amazing.d) Graphically I'm running the game at 4k, 60fps constant, vsync on, graphics all the way up with an i7-6700k and 980 ti.  It's beautiful..real 4k textures.Things I'm not in love with..a) Difficulty is meh, average is pretty easy, but AI difficulty and behavior will come, and will get better, thats one of the things that's pretty easy to address..

								Very Impressive for early access, 90% of the bad reviews complain about non implemented features, which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as they are comming up...It's literally Moo2, but a layout that will permit the dev to make of it a better gameplay experience that Moo2 way. I'm very optimisticAlso, again, the game is NOT COMPLETE as in current state, wait if you don't want to experience of early access.			"

User interface is simple and looks like it would work well with a touch screen.As a big fan of the old game it was funny to see the news casters talking about space monsters :)Hoping to spend many quiet evenings with this game.

												Finished in it after about six hours I guess.......well.....there are still two races left sort of......anywayAfter about two hours of messing around I got down to playing properly and found it all very enjoyable even more so as the game progressed.Top tip......don't get hung up about what planets you colanize to begin with. Its nice to find that sweet goldilocks planet but thankfully you can eventually research planet terraforming minus the Xenomorphs....Its Early Access but apart from a single bug which just seemed like a graphical glitch this game feels complete even more so than a lot of other released games from certain publishing houses. Its got the full support from Wargaming so its not going to vanish and is certainly worth the money.If you are looking for something that hits the sweet spot with being just the right mix of challenge and relaxation without ever feeling stressed or too challenged then this is it. I built the 'Titan' battleship and it got destroyed by six enemy cruisers so I built ten cruisers and carried on stomping the enemy into the ground without having to reload or pull hair out. Something goes bang.......just build another one. There is a 'tactical' element to the game but at the minute it seems more just who has the biggest gun/guns wins. Its all relative to size and numbers as I mentioned earlier 5 cruisers can kill a Titan but it also depends on their tech level and you can use different abilities in battle but if you like you can just sit back and let the A.I do the work.The game almost sits happily between the adult and child audience that it is no doubt targeted at but there are a notable few things that do seem more child friendly than adult and if you are looking for a hardcore space strategy simulation or even civiliazation in the stars then this will probably not quite be what you are hoping for but it is probably the closest thing to it and who knows where it might develop.Would i recommend you buy this game right now; Yes. It feels complete even though you know when playing through it that there are certain element missing none of it detracts from the game experience. Running everything on max in 1080p with all civilizations and the largest galaxy I would guess that everytime I hit the end turn key it was my go again in less than 5 seconds and that was still almost the same after 300+ turnsOne word of caution though; it does at times to me feel sometimes overly simple and not as indepth as it could be but then again by the time of the final release it may feel deep and complex.Update Final RelaseSo it didn't turn out to be the Grand Space Strategy game we hoped for but for playing with your kids its great.

								Ahh the good old days of the original Master of Orion, simpler times eh? Well I'm pleased to say that while this new Master of Orion is true to the spirit of the original but that's not just what brings to rave about this game. It's GORGEOUS. I mean everything from the design of ships and planets to the little touches like the cutscenes are all first class and really make you feel like you're ""boldly going where no man has gone before."" Now technically speaking, this game is incredibly stable and buttery smooth. I've seen very few early access games that are so smooth and have so few bugs right from jump. Achievements and other in-game annoucements via a couple newsreading robots which I think is a cute way of delivering the player useful information in a relatively immersive fashion. Basically, if you're into Sci-Fi or 4X games or you've been dying for a better sci-fi version of the Civilization games than Civ: Beyond Earth you should really consider Master of Orion.			"

Early Access Review
								As an original player of MOO and MOO2 (I go back to that one every 3-5 years) I am pleasantly surprised with the new Master of Orion. The best way I can describe it is a mix of A Turn Based Sins of a Solar Empire and Endless Space. You start in a sector of the galaxy which itself is made up of a combination of planets, asteroids, and gas giants. Leading out of that in what I think are called warp points, they take you out of that sector and into a connecting sector. And so on and so forth. The game is beautiful and nicely detailed, the races are well animated and have great voice acting. I esp like the Terran Kahnate, I guess they are like the Klingons of the game but in human form. I was making the game harder than it had to be by just clicking through the turns waiting for this or that, but it's important to manage every planet, every turn, to maximize population effectiveness.My only real complaint is the A.I. are very bold jerks and I don't like that you can't try to compromise on a deal they want you can only agree or disagree. They also seem to work in unison againest you, know where your ships are, and will come together if you are doing slightly better than everyone else, no matter how much they hate each other. I have been a faithful ally to the Humans in one game, went to war againest a common enemy with them, and they just decide to abandon me when someone declared war againest me. Then declared I was taking too many sectors for my own good. Oddly enough, I asked for an alligance again the next turn and we were buddy buddies again. Except I was in two wars and they were in one.Game features custom race option like MOO2 and I really enjoy it. I didn't like that the game didn't feature different government options but thats not a dealbreaker for me. But you can build a Doomstar and blow up planets so that's a relief, though I still haven't gotten that far in the game yet. Looking foward to how spying will be handled in this game, probably my least favorite part of MOO2, though I do love the Darloks.Ships can be customized to suit any loadout you want, but I think you can only have 5 Custom loadouts at a time? Kind of a Bummer. Make that 8-10 slots and I think that issue wouldn't be a problem anymore. The other issue, though I guess it's not a plus or minus is the command point limit. I had twice as many planets as another empire and I still felt like I didn't have enough fleet strength to close off key sectors to keep them from expanding, and for every point over the limit, you lose about 10 or 20 BC a turn. It can add up quickly but it is managable as long as your constantly working on improving your command point limit by building more star bases.All and all a very enjoyable experience, I'm glad they took the time to reboot a much loved series but I think most people are either going to really love this one or really hate it. But I'm looking forward to many more game time with this one.			"

												This game feels *very much like the classic masters of Orion 2. The space combat is great, the civilization management stuff has been streamlined well. I really *really* want to give this game a thumbs up, but I can't. The time between turns, especially in late-game, is excruciatingly slow. Be prepared to wait a full minute for a turn to cycle. When a game lasts into the hundreds of turns, that's pretty damn bad.Months after release, I'd expect initial bugs like that would be fixed, but alas they've failed to deliver. Thumbs down, can't recommend the game based on this game-breaking UX issue.			"

Early Access Review
								First, a little about me. I don't write reviews. I hate getting emails asking me to write reviews. I find them tedious and generally unpleasent to write. On that note... I will write a review when I feel strongly about something and feel others should know my thoughts.The game is a bit buggy... but I'd expect that in any early access game. Like a beta or even alpha release the bugs will be there and if no one ever reports them they may go unmissed until after the pool of players grows after release and get reported then (maybe). The game play is similar to a CIV game with its own unique flare. The fact that the existing races have their own ship design styles/models is impressive when you compare how many unique styles there are to any other rts. I've seen games with 12 - 15 ""unique"" groups that shared the same unit models across all of groups. Cutting corners to keep costs down and deliver a game quickly. Is it all unique... maybe not. Heck some of the models are incomplete or in design process still and display as ""unavailable"" frames. Don't let that distract you from the magnitude of effort that is going into this game to make it unique. The AI is decent and the pirates are annoying. I've played with a couple of the difficulty settings and they all, for the most part, affect the game and AI as you would expect. Harder difficulties = more aggressive AI.I will keep this game and unlike other early access I've participated in, Master of Orion has become a favorite. A hopeful favorite. I hope others will give this a shot. Help developers find the bugs and get the squashed. Enjoy a CIV like game that pulls away from the CIV style just enough to keep you interested. Play for hours on end. All in all this game has amazing potential and I can't wait to see what lies beyond the next star as I explore the galaxy that is Master of Orion. "

												Original:At the current state, it's fun but it lacks depth.it fun and I loved MOO I & II so probably playing on a bit of nostalgia too.Nothing truly ground breaking but solid.Current (Release):I'm adding this bit just to let people know that sadly not much have changed, no major bugs I could see, solid fun, good music, great voice actors. good looking game :-)Sadly (for me), not much have changed in the way of content and depth, research is flat and similar to all races. no race is special in any ways. biomes are just names most of the time.No animations for ground battles (I miss you MOO II !!), planet view is the same.Battles are solid if you control them but nothing like what I felt in MOO II.**Yes, the comparison to MOO II is fair because it's the spiritual succesor or remake as some would say AND also this is !!2016!! can we see something new? can we expand on those amazing original ideas?If you are looking for more of the same or a bit nostalgic... go play MOO II !! :-) or buy this one for the graphics.

								I'm glad to see this title return, and in such a positive way. The game is solid, and while at this stage certain aspects aren't fully flushed out, it still has a lot of potential. The tactical battle is one area of concern. At this point, I don't feel as if the real time battle really adds much and leaves much to be desired at its current state. Turn based combat would be greatly appreciated. This one area especially I hope to see more from as time goes on. I wish this game had governors/leaders as MoO2 did. Perhaps a feature to be added later? I like the reimagnined designs of the races, although  the characterizations can be a little cartoony. Nothing that seriously stands in the way though. That being said, I don't see how the different traits of the races impact the overall game yet, at least not in the way traits impacted previous games. Also, I'd like to see government types play a larger role if any at all. Overall, a solid start and I can't wait to see how this game cotinues to develop. Definitely recommend!			"

There are still some small quirks with the game and some of the races and features are still in development but that is to be expected in an early access game.  Gameplay is smooth and simple enough that you don't need a physics degree to understand while still allowing creative strategy to grow your empire in you own special take over the universe way!			"

Early Access Review
								First off let's be clear, I haven't spent a great deal of time with the game yet, so my opinion is certainly subject to change. First impressions however are good. The game evokes the feel of it's predecessors right out of the gate. There are certainly differences though and I suspect purists are going to take issue with several of them. I myself have been playing Master of Orion and Master of Orion II off & on since they were released. Master of Orion II has been installed and played on every computer I've owned over the last two decades! So while I may not consider myself a ""purist"" in the manner I'm using it, I'm certainly a fan. And as a fan I can say that I like this game.The ""feel"" of the game is just about right. The visuals, audio and the like are all well done and I find that barring a few missing options that the UI is well put together. The races are well done, though the racial traits have certainly been toned down from the previous titles. In some way I'm glad to see this, as traits like ""creative"" provided too great an advantage, but the flip side is that the races seem a bit less unique. One or two more traits per race would be nice to see.Much ado has been made over features such as star lanes v free travel and real-time combat v turn-based tactical combat. In the case of the former I've found no real issues, star lanes simply don't change the gameplay in any negative way I've seen so far. The tactical combat is a bit of a let down as it stands right now though. Shield facings, careful use of weapons and specials are all more or less gone now. Even turning off the auto-AI and pausing combat to issue orders doesn't stack up to the older combat. Luckily for me I never played Master of Orion for the tactical combat. Some do though and it's a point to consider.Overall, as a sort of tldr, I find the gameplay engaging, fun and it reminds me of playing the games of my youth. So it's a win in my book so far.Anyway, as you can tell I'm not going to make pro-con list or anything of the sort, but I am going to recommend the game to those interested. Keep in mind though the game is still in development and a lot is subject to change I'm sure, so if your wary of the title because you don't think it can match up to the games of old or because you dislike WG (something I've run into as a reason to avoid the title) then keep your money for now and see how the game develops. No reason to part with your hard-earned cash if you're unsure. For me though? This was worth it.			"

Early Access Review
								Pretty good for an early access release.  Some highlights:* Graphics - awesome, looks great at a variety of resolutions and qualities, a lot of attention to detail in the models* Sound - Excellent music and voice acting* UI/Controls - minimalist and unobtrustive* Gameplay - exactly what I'd expect from an MoO gameThat said, here are some lowlights:* Tactical combat is pointless and slow and not fun.  Just simulate it, you'll save yourself 10 minutes per fight* The AI is sort of stupid, especially when it comes to diplomacy.  It got to the point where I could just ask other races to give me planets, and they would.  That seems like a thing that should almost never work.* Research tree felt a little shallow.  Nothing in the way of domestic skills (different government types, for example), just lots of more or less sequential upgrades to ships/buildings* The endgame can be super slow, especially if you're not fighting with anyone.  I went down the science path first before I realized that it was unfinished, so I switched over to the ""Elect me king"" path (after negoitating treaties with enough races to support me, something else that seems like it shouldn't work too easily), and man, there was a long time of me just hitting the end turn button over and over again.Those are pretty minor gripes for what is shaping up to be a pretty fantastic game, and a worthy successor to the orignal MoO series.  Is it worth $50 for early access?  Meh, maybe not, but throw in the original games and you can overlook that in exchange for knowing that you're supporting the cause a little bit.			"

												So I'm making a whole new review of this game, the previous one was when the game was still in early access, and let me just say prior to playing this game from the early access to official release the game has made a lot, a lot of changes. more good then bad, overall I'm enjoying the game.The U.I. and settings and whatnot are all nice and clean, I haven't experienced that many bugs, actually since release I haven't ran into any bugs at all. A.I: they've improved the A.I. a lot... I recommend playing them on a normal/hard difficulty because that is when they're best and decent. if you play it on Very hard or Extreme then they just become super aggressive and for some reason they're all out to get you. but I've been playing it on Normal, the A.I. make fair trades, I don't have to feel like my back is gonna be stabbed.Star Lanes: I still think Star lanes are really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I mean I can play with them, but oh my gawd, it can become really hard to defend planets if your fleet is way out of position. and you don't get jump gates till mid game.Military outposts: they're still one of the most useless things in the game. they can't defend worth crap. they're just there to be able to upgrade your ships if you don't want to go all the way back to a planet you control. I was disappointed when they didn't change it.Races: Each race has their own unique traits and whatnot which is good, cause in early access, it actually didn't matter what race you played cause they were all pretty much the same lol.The game isn't very fast paced, I have 2 monitors and I like to play it while I watch something, and if I need to go do something its nice that I can go take care of that and not worry about being attacked. or something happen without me knowing. Overall I give this game a 8/10			"

Lots of guys are having similair issues, and reported them at discussions section, but no direct reaction of support whatsoever. Wargaming support answers when asked directly through their ticket system, but they were unable to provide even an estimated date of when the fixes will be released.It does work on Windows. Kind of. But since I'm not using it, and the devs announced Linux support, I assumed that even if it'll be poorly optimized, it'll run at the very least. Boy, was I wrong.So there you have it. It's pricey, it's made on Unity, the support is mediocre at best, and it doesn't run at all. Way to destroy the franchise and my childhood favourite, Wargaming. Attaboys.			"

								Its been a long time since I played Master of Orion I. Playing MOO today was fun and enjoyable. Great Graphic overall, with expection of GNN new report...just didnt look correct.Wondering about the real time space combat, if the combat area would increase for larger fights?Note that the combat video can be record, but how does one review those files?First game I got restricted in a small area of the known galaxy by worm holes that took special research to use. I lost that game by turn 200. It was fun.Good graphic and voice over for the advisors....very cool.Technology tree interesting....would like to see special race technology added in too or random technology.Haven't done ground combat yet...looking forward to that.Like to be able to slow down the speed of space combat.Dislike the way planet's buildings were show. Couldnt see it all, without clicking on each one.Dislike the screen that showed all the discovered planets...no way to organizied viewing it.  THat was my first game...Overall MOO was good.			"

								If you are hoping to play Master of Orion II, please kindly purchase Master of Orion II.  It is a brilliant game that has stood the test of time.  Do not purchase or judge this game out of nostalgia or unrealistic hopes this game will be exactly like Master of Orion II.This game, in its Early Access stage, is pretty good.  Yes, there are several mechanics that are not fully implemented, and yes diplomacy still need quite a bit of work.  However, if you are wanting to buy an Early Access product, you shouldn't really expect it to be completely polished.As for myself, I already quite like this game as it is.  The design is pretty neat.  The learning curve isn't steep.  And it's really a game that I find myself drawn into.  I've owned the game for only a few days and have already put in over 20 hours.  I even experienced the ""one more turn"" syndrom... a pleasure that I haven't experienced in a good long while.I know this may not be a glowing recommendation; but, this game has actually got a lot of good going for it, if you give it the chance to mature into its own product: not a shadow of Master of Orion II.  I am quite optimistic to see where the developers take it from here.			"

								I cannot understate what a wonderful thing this game is to me. MOO2 was my favourite childhood game, and this game is the highest tribute that could be done for MOO. I am so appreciative to those who created it and made it happen. Just.. no words for how i feel. They kept true to the objective too. Every key MOO-istic trait of the game that I'd expect to find was there to be found. And new twists on the game to add to the MOO legacy.			"

								I find this game slightly more enjoyable than GalCiv3.  Although Master of Orion may need to catch up on the community development portion.  Thus, allowing players to create and custumize race and maps.  Since I am playing the early access version, I expected bugs and crashes.  So far, it crashed on me twice after playing 15 hours.

A little cartoony with the Psilon personally, but from my brief encounters with other factions they are pretty spot on. Pollution is a nice addition to the game in how it is handled. If you liked the original and/or 2, then this game is definitely worth watching.			"

												Walked in not expecting a complete copy of MOO with better graphics/ UI and ended up really enjoying Moo:CTS. It's a very solid 4x game that benefited from a decent and efficient early access phase. Two things that stand out for me is the awesome presentation and impressive AI. Great for beginners and casual fans. Although I feel veteran players may be put off by some of the mechanics in the game. Such as late game colony management. Ugh. Oh. And Luke Skywalker and Worf are in it , that's worth the entery level price of $30 dollars alone. Buy. Enjoy. See you in the stars			"

								great start for a successor to MOO2 which has been my all time favorite.  Changing from turnbased combat to RTS is interesting once they implement the facing of weapons (pro's / cons to doing it).  I disagree with the way they created tech tree to resemble the CIV 4/5 style of teching.  I loved the MOO2 version which made for harsh decisions when going up the tech tree.  There were a lot of critical decision making as far as tech is concerned in MOO2, not so much in this version of the game in which you can tech it all eventually (the choices for certain tech seemed inconsequential because one side of the tech is usually better than the other).  Overall i believe that wargaming could successfully make a decent game out of the bones that they have layed out in this iteration of a wonderful series (i mean MOO 1 & 2 because 3 is utter crap).

												The game is hurt by the insularity of the Devs and the small community with which they got feedback from.Technologies:  Many of which are just filler minimal +1's to something previous.Espionage:  It makes no sense and is gamebreaking.A 10' tall walking mound of stone can ""sneak"" onto your planet by hiding under a bush can can then incite a revolt which makes the planet unusablefor 5% of the entire game length (each time).  90-100% happiness before the mission.  Logically if sucessful ithe mission should drop the happyness some.  NO.  Your plaet goes from full happiness to zero happiness and as soon as the LONG arbitrary period ends everyone suddenyly remembers they are happy again.  The entire espionage system is like this and there is no defense against it.But, if you look at the official forums this is WAD.			"

								Played this new version, and I like where its going, but I must say the Guardian battle was a little easy... I would have expected such a large ship to need a small armada to take it out, but instead one lone titan seemed to be enough. I only saw very little in the way of monsters too, probally one on the whole map.  Planet interface re-worked and looks like the classic moo2 but with improved visuals which is nice. Diplomacy is pretty good also. They need to get the custom race creation working, and the science victory finalised too, otherwise I am pleased with my purchase so far.			"

												Played the heck out of this game when it was new and loved it.  Got old and went to other games and just came back after a bunch of updates and new races.  Now I hate it!  They changed how pollution works, creating your own race, and a few other things.  After a few play throughs a custom race is a waste of time, the Antarian victory condition is a PITA and then lackluster IF you can manage to make it to the end, and I always find myself scrapping factories till I research the damn core waste dump.  Meanwhile, even on ""very easy"" the AI is taking over other clusters while your empire recovers from pollution, ecenomic crisis, and getting slapped by Antarians.  This game used to be fun, now it's a stress inducing waste of time that I'm sorry to even have in my game library.  Devs really messed this one up IMO.			"

								It's fun...ish. It feels very bare bones in every aspect, and no matter what you do it feels like you will end up destroying everyone anyway. Also there's a curious ""bug"" where the AI will stop building up their military power beyond cruisers. The strongest race in my most recent match wouldn't go over 20k whereas I was well past 100k.6.5/10, will probably get better upon full release (whenever that is)EDIT: It's full release and... I still feel like this game could be better. Don't get me wrong, I did spend  +30 hours (probably more because my client doesn't always record game time when launched via the desktop icon) and I didn't hate that time i played, I just wouldn't call it my most memorable gaming experience.7.5/10 for the added features, but lets keep the features coming eh?

Early Access Review
								So, first off a few things: This is not a re-skin of MOO2.  If you want that, this game will sorely disappoint you.  That said, I went into playing this game with that exact mentality.  I have had many systems over the years, and MOO2 was almost always among the first games to get installed on it.  I cannot even begin to imagine how many hours I've spent playing the game and inventing new ways to try and beat the game (Single Doomstar Antaran win, anyone?).  So, when I heard that a new MOO was out, I was excited to have my old MOO2 back with better graphics.What I got was a game that is far different than that.  For starters, star lanes and non-turn based combat was a huge turnoff.  In fact, those two items alone almost made me uninstall initially.  But I decided to give it another shot, and what I ound was that, even though those elements were different, they were ultimately changes for the best.  Gone are the days where a Darlok fleet randomly drops a giant fleet in the furthest backwater area of your empire out of nowhere, and that's fine.  Do I miss that sort of random thing?  Maybe.  But does it make for a better strategic framework for a human vs AI game?  Absolutely.In regards to combat, a few things need tweaked, but it is quite playable in its current iteration.  If you are thinking the real-time combat is like that unspeakable mess of MOO3, it isn't.  It likely is an issue where you are misunderstanding the controls (like I did initially), but a sticky on the official forums will bring you up to speed and bring you around on it.Now, to the overwhelming good of the game.  The voice acting and research trees are great.  Are they great in the conventional sense?  Eh, it isn't Mass Effect or something, but as a huge sci-fi nerd, hearing familiar voices from my favorite actors is a fine bit of nostalgia.  Similarly, the tech tree creates many of the same feelings.  Researching jump gates, battle pods, and other techs from yesteryear are fun, and the more I play, some of the choices forced by the tech tree are genuinely meaningful.Some areas of the game, still in early access, are up in the air for me.  Diplomacy seems pointless right now, the AI is a little too pacifistic, tech research a bit too fast and a passive afterthought (think autolab x100), and the spy process seems promising, but under-defined currently.  Also, MOO2 races need to come back, and even some of the races from MOO3 would be nice (races is one of the few things that game did right).In summary, if you loved MOO1 or MOO2, buy this game and give it a chance.  If you can't stand early access titles, wait a bit and get it on release.  While it isn't a re-skin, it is a genuinely good title, and one that makes up for the abomination that was MOO3.			"

It likely is an issue where you are misunderstanding the controls (like I did initially), but a sticky on the official forums will bring you up to speed and bring you around on it.Now, to the overwhelming good of the game.  The voice acting and research trees are great.  Are they great in the conventional sense?  Eh, it isn't Mass Effect or something, but as a huge sci-fi nerd, hearing familiar voices from my favorite actors is a fine bit of nostalgia.  Similarly, the tech tree creates many of the same feelings.  Researching jump gates, battle pods, and other techs from yesteryear are fun, and the more I play, some of the choices forced by the tech tree are genuinely meaningful.Some areas of the game, still in early access, are up in the air for me.  Diplomacy seems pointless right now, the AI is a little too pacifistic, tech research a bit too fast and a passive afterthought (think autolab x100), and the spy process seems promising, but under-defined currently.  Also, MOO2 races need to come back, and even some of the races from MOO3 would be nice (races is one of the few things that game did right).In summary, if you loved MOO1 or MOO2, buy this game and give it a chance.  If you can't stand early access titles, wait a bit and get it on release.  While it isn't a re-skin, it is a genuinely good title, and one that makes up for the abomination that was MOO3.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm a MOO2 player for years, so the following comments are based on my MOO2 preferences.I've played about five MOO4 games so far and have enjoyed the experience, though there are some things that could be improved to make the game more interesting/ challenging.1. The first thing I noticed was that any race can colonise any planet, regardless of it's type. In MOO2 you had to research the technology to allow colonisation of different planet types. The lack of this requirement in MOO4 makes it too easy. It also removes any advantage of choosing Silicoid as your race.2. Star lanes are new but I don't mind this. Star lanes can be used for strategic effect so I'm happy with this change.3. Technology progression is too fast in MOO4. It's too easy to get the technology you want and it doesn't feel like an achievement. 4. It's difficult to see the impact of new technology in MOO4 and some of the new technology seems to have been diluted in its value eg; Ground Batteries.5. The duplication of the voice hints in the technology screens is annoying.6. Diplomacy is still clunky in MOO4, It would be nice to be able to counter-offer proposals from other races rather than just accept/decline.7. Space combat isn't very interesting. I just use auto-resolve to save the time it takes to load the graphics.8. Space Pirates are just an annoyance really. It would be more interesting if  you could negotiate with them.9. Minor civilisations are an interesting feature in MOO4, though they seemed to get wiped out before you can interact with them. It would be better if you could somehow offer them protection from other races.10. The new GNN characters are funny. I'd like to see this further developed.Anyway, those are my initial comments. I'm looking forward to seeing how the game further develops.			"

Early Access Review
								Well, u must give the game a chance.Last patches made AI little bit smarter and they finally started to make huge armies, terraforming etc.Developers do their best to improve game performance, there still some things to fix (weapon target system, non-working autorepair etc), but still they did lots of good changes already.Yeah we do remember all that good vanilla time, when u make excel table to calculate ur doom ship in older moo's but this one is really getting more and more exciting.By the way, tech tree is great and if u try to play vs Player (for example against me :) ) u will get it - there are way too much tech's u want asap, but u have to balance between planet's, population, research, production, fleet power, credits and so on - and u will always want all it at once.I'v played lot's of galaxy games, like Stellaris etc, and i do get fun from playing remastered moo most of them.

								So far I'm having fun with the newest MOO.  Still needs a bit of polish, a bit of tweaking but overall it is fun to play.  The RTS battles I wasn't sure of before release, but they are fun now that I haven played them.  Had a nice battle where I did a hit and fade and ran behind some asteroids and half of the fleet followed and got wiped out.  Made it a fair fight against their station and remaining ships.Overall for a early release on its first day, and it being a MOO game with a lot to live up to, it is a very positive experiance and worth checking out.

								From the small amount I have played so far:This is a solid, albeit lightweight 4x game. The learning curve is straight forward for both seasoned players and new alike.Being this is a direct sequel to the MoO universe, it will no doubt bring a lot of heat as there are key changes to the formula (non turn based combat) for example.However I really like the combat...the cinematic camera is a great idea but dear God it needs some work...and I think the blend of real time and turn based is a great step forward.The price point is far too high imho, despite it including other games in the bundle. It is very well polished for early access and although it is worth the money for die hard fans of the genre, knock a tenner off the price and get more people playing it.All round great game with so much possibility			"

Early Access Review
								This is an early access game. It's not complete by any standards. I have not played the older games, so I am able to come at this with fresh eyes. If you like the newer Civilization games, than this is Civilization in space. Combat is alright, I personally enjoy watching my ships battle against others. Ship customization is fine as it is, but I can say I would like to see maybe some more design choices and color choices. Diplomacy in all games is hard to balance, so expect the A.I. to make stupid requests (Oh? You're kicking out butt in this war? Alright, we'll go easy on you if you give us 1,000 credits and two colonies. No? Guess you'll have to conitnue to kill us!). Wish the A.I. was a bit more....aggresive, a bit more of a threat. Maybe it's the difficulty I'm playing under. Heroes would be a cool addition, but maybe in an expansion.  Overall, this is still an early access (First update should be soon right?), so don't expect a full game. If you played the older ones, this is apparently not MOO2....whatever that means.			"

								Not a bad game for a pre release game I am enjoying it considerably. The voice acting is very well done <though the GNN robots get annoying after a while>. I do miss the turn by turn based combat system from the previous games though, you do have to understand this is not MoO2. Cant wait for the other races to be released. The races do feel a bit different than each other, but they get to a point to where they are all the same. Mind you my review is not complete I have yet to play any Multiplayer.+ Good way to kill time <I mean thats what games are for right?>+ Very Sreamlined and easy for someone to play if they have never played this kind of game before+ Voice acting+ SOUNDTRACK < LOVE ME SOME SPACE SYNTH MUSIC!>- Not all races released as of yet 2/28/2016- The Tech tree needs a bit more explaining.

												Having played the Original Masters of Orion, the solid sequal (MoO2) and the pretty disasterous MoO3, I really wanted this game to be awesome. It's not. It's also not bad, there's just not a lot too it that 4X gamers haven't seen before, and other games are doing space based 4X bigger and better. Galactic Civilizations offers a MUCH bigger, more customizable 4x space experience. Even older, lesser known titles like Distant Worlds have New-MoO beat in terms of size and scope. It pains me to say it, but there's nothing here but a vanilla 4x game. No scenarios. No campaign-type play. Not even a hint of a story. Sure, it's got some big names doing voice over work and some of the graphics are pretty shiny, but as any gamer knows, your game needs to do something better than it's competitors (of which there are many in 4x land), and New-MoO doesn't.Maybe via expansion and update this game will become better but the bottom line for me, in a short review format, is that there are quite a few titles that are doing what New-MoO wants to do, and doing it better in many or all aspects of 4x gaming.

								Yes, I would recommend this game. Even thought it is still in development it promises much. As a big fan of the original Microprose Master of Orion 1 and 2 games I really like what I have seen of this one so far. Even a few of the better elements of the best forgotten third game have been incorporated. The updated graphics are great. They have stayed true to the turned based system. They have a clearly developed plan and seem to be sticking to it. Even though the Alpha test has only been going on for about a month, at the time I am writing this, we have an update coming. They are explaining things in the patch notes as go. Best yet if you come on board during the alpha they will include a copy of the original games, all three, that will work on modern machines.			"

Early Access Review
								I like the game so far.  I think it has captured some of the spirit of both MOO and MOO2.  Although it is early access, its playable and fun against the computer opponents, although they can be somewhat predictable.  Settle a colony near a computer opponent, when they ask you not too, and in my experience they almost always attack soon.This is my opinion after playing a few EA2 games, and 2 EA3 games, one  I'm about 500 turns into.Pros:Voiceovers - well done and I appreciate the celebrity choices to do the voice overs. Ship graphics - I like the ship graphics.  Each alien race has a unique style which I like.  Watching combat between the ships in tactical combat is fun, especially when you have a Titan launch a bunch of Plasma torpedos at a Star Base or hit a ship with 10 Graviton beams at once, or watch point defense phasors wipe out a group of missiles coming towards your Battleship.  :)Colony cutscenes - Well done and fun to watch, and the cutscene includes the colony ship that matches the ship style of the Alien race you are playing.Galaxy map and overview - I think its well done and I can usually follow what's going on and where everything is moving over a section of the galaxy.Sounds and music - I like most of what has been done so far.Colony view screen - shows most of the information I need to know and I like they way the build queue is setup.Alien Diplomacy screen - I think this is well done and I like the different backgrounds and animations for each leader.Tech Tree - A lot of tech to research and most of the weapons from MOO/MOO2 seem to be in the tree.  Takes a while to research up to Doom Stars, stellar converters, mauler, sub-space teleport, etc, so it seems like the game is reasonably well balanced in this regard.  Its addictive and fun - If I start a gaming session, its difficult to stop without playing at least a couple hours.Cons:Some Bugs - The game is still early access and has some bugs.  Its very playable, but it has crashed or locked up on me a few times.  The new ship designer in EA3 caused one crash, and I've had the game lock up going into tactical combat on 2 occasions.Advisor Voiceover repetition - For the research the advisor animations and voiceovers are fun for a bit, but since they pick from a limited set of dialog, it does start to get old in a long game.  Although I will call out that each alien's advisors say a different set of dialog and they can be a bit humorous at times.Combat - I have tried to take control of combat from the AI, but its not real intuitive how to control all the ships systems.  I did figure out there was a min-max range slider control and another control for ship speed.   That was EA2, I haven't figured out how to control combat in EA3.Colony auto-build - the auto build doesn't always work that great.  It always seems to build a marine barracks first on a new planet, and then goes to missile base, starbase, etc.  It seems very defense/military biased even if you have the colony set on ""balanced"".  This can be a problem if the new planet needs food or production as a higher priority at the moment.Bombing doesn't seem to work much better or differently after you upgrade to fusion bombs or anti-matter.  I was playing an EA3 game last night and had to bomb colonies 5 or more times with 2 cruisers and several destroyers and sometimes only a couple buildings or one population would get knocked out.Antarans aren't around as far as I can tell, and there is only the guardian at Orion and some space monsters.  I hated the Antarans in MOO2, but they did make the game more interesting and it was fun once you had enough ships and tech to beat them.  It might be nice to have Antarans attack as an game ""option"".Limited AI Opponents - I have played against up to 5 computer opponents, but the game won't support more than 5 as far as I can figure out.

Early Access Review
								First and foremost, the thing to remember is that this game just launched in Early Access.  Comparing it to Master of Orion 2, while a natural instinct, would not be fair at this time because the game is just far too new and unfinished.And the largest detraction I can currently label to this game is that it is very much unfinished.  At least four races are missing (possibly as much as eight depending on how far the developers intend to go), race customization is not yet an option and the racial traits thus far appear to be watered down, ship design and combat are not as intensive as they once were, and despite the wonderful narration and voice acting the story does not yet seem to be entirely in place.Let's double back and remember, though, that this game is hot off the Early Access presses.  There can and will be additional content to come, and even if the detail work from before is missing the foundation for a game as great as MoO1 or MoO2 appears to be there: the races we know and love are present (mostly), the gameplay absolutely feels like a Master of Orion game, and there has been some evolution in how things are managed.  Did I mention that now there's a beautiful voice cast narrating and interacting in the game?If you're looking for a re-skinned version of Master of Orion 2, I would recommend going over to StarDrive 2 for the time being.  If you're looking for a game being built on the same blocks as its predecessors, this is the game you want.  It would be fair to say it's more worth it when it goes on sale, but one way or another any MoO-loving, 4X-playing gamer will sooner or want this in their library.			"

Early Access Review
								+ Cinematics give the game a great vibe and immersion.+ The ship design allows you transform ships to fit different roles. Although there are 5 ships models right now, you can create roles like support, bomber, long range, scanner, carrier, etc. with all the ship supplements that are available.+ The GNN to inform the state of the galaxy is a great addition.+ It’s visually ok, not mind blowing. Sounds on the other hand are great and it seems that a lot of effort was made with the voice acting that it has.+ Real time battles are great with the addition to pause and still be able to give orders like old MOO’s.- Diplomacy could have it fixes, I’m thinking of a robust, well-explained diplomacy interface like the Total War series. Diplomatic Victory also feels weirds.- Even at war with the AI, it didn’t seem too aggressive nor building a large fleet.- Racial traits are shallow right now but developers already said that they are working on fixing them to make them feel more unique.Overall it feels more like a demo than an Early Access due to the fact that feels and is a very stable version. It has its bugs and glitches but nothing game-breaking. Is it MOO2? No, modernization may have scarified some game elements to create a more fluid version of it. It lacks content but hey it’s early access! I’ll continue to closely watch what are going to be the future additions.			"

								This is early access, and it shows. It has its ups and downs. Despite my short play time, I have a list of positives and negatives. Edits will come as the game is rolled out further.March 31st updates---Positives:+Better balancing of gameplay.+Diplomacy now functions properly.+Klackon, Meklar, and Terran added.+Technological victory added.Negatives:-Meklar are massively overpowered in research.-Terran have major environmental issues.-Spies not implemented.(Original Alpha release comments below)Positives:+Very good looking reboot of an excellent 4x game.+Easy to play, and intuitive.+Extremely stable, I have had no instances of lag whatsoever.+It's as addictive as it should be.+Excellent voice acting, audio, and music.Negatives:-Racial implementation is incomplete, several races not implemented yet.*-Diplomacy needs work. Wars are next to impossible to get out of short of total genocide.-No spies or espionage implemented yet. I suspect that the Darloks will be released with spies.*-Combat needs balancing, it's like a less effective combat system from MoO 3. ~see additional comments.-Ship design feels far more limited than previous Master of Orion games.-Random events need to be balanced. Every one I have seen has been a planet's mineral classification increasing.-Star systems need better balancing. Most systems are 2-3 objects orbiting the star, a (very) few have 5.-Techs sometimes force you to choose between two things AFTER the research is complete. I experienced this several times before I finally noticed there is a bar between the icons in the research box. This needs to be clarified. I like the idea of having to branch research in some areas one way or another, but the choice should be when the research is beginning, not when it has concluded. ~see additional comments for furtherance.Additional comments:~Cannot rename stars and planets!!!!! --This drove me crazy with MoO 3 until it was patched.~Cannot choose flag colour. --This also was an issue with MoO 3 before patching.~Run spellcheck, there are several spelling errors throughout the game.~Real time combat can  be nice, but MoO had very well balanced turn based combat before 3. Why not have a setting for turn based combat as well as real time?~It might also be nice to branch the techs out further with the choosing specific research areas. With Fusion, if you choose fusion beam, you should get later research for enhanced targeting computers, if you go with fusion bombs, you should have later research options for hardened colony structures, or another defencive area for planets.*Annoying, but it's early access, and these will be put in. I look forward to the full release!			"

								A good base to work from, I have high hopes that the finished product will meet my expectations.Combat needs to be deeper, too shallow as it is now. I can agree that it needs to be fast for multiplayer, but it should still be a mini-game that gives you real choices to make... that creates strategy and strategy is why I play these types of games.Planets are not different enough, found myself building most of the same buildings on every planet, should be different paths you have to choose when developing worlds. Any real sense of making hard choices is not there when developing planets at the moment.  Once again choices creates strategy and strategy is why I play these types of games.Research should have more branches, that result in more choices, which creates strategy and strategy is why I play these types of games.So to sum it up: I like what I see so far and hope that the developers take this game the way it needs to go.  As of right now I have that ""one more turn"" feeling but do not have that ""Ahh this is hard, which way do I decide to go here?"" feeling that I love getting from a well designed, fun strategy 4x game.

It is only a passive viewing of the battle.  I'm sure this is being worked on since this is a large part of what MOO was about.  As a plus, the cinematics looks beautiful.Diplomacy:  I actually agree with most of the criticism.  It is very one dimensional at the moment.  Even MOO 1 had a much more sophisiticated diplomatic feel.  Over all, I believe the developers will do the right thing.  Here's hoping... "

(similar to an RTS)Cons: Copycat diplomacy from CIV 5 (same menu & similar options) Bad & annoying AI (every game feels the same) Custom races are very limited in options. Spies are pointless / useless There is no real exploration in the game No option for merging fleets. (There is no button for merging them. You need to have 2 fleets on top of each other and ""guard"" to merge them.MOO is basically a LTE version of CIV 5 in space... You would be better of to buy a different 4x game, as this game feels weak for a 4x game...OR better yet...  Just wait for Endless Space 2 to be released.			"

Early Access Review
								I am a big fan of ""Master of Orion II"", but had no experience with the first game and didn't like the third game very much.This new one is really good. I think it captures the spirit and gameplay essence of MOO2, and adds in some lighter moments and humor in addition to some good action during space battles. I am also a big fan of the new faction, the Terran Khanate.It's still in development, and there are some little things I would like to see improved, but I am happy with the product as it stands and would definitely recommend this game for MOO fans. It's particularly good for more casual players, and doesn't require all the micromanagement of some other space empire games.The music is also well done; I kind of wish the main galaxy screen had different music for each species (or maybe if it varied by the general stress level of current events), but I look forward to when the soundtrack is released.

												I would recommend this to anyone who loved MOO 1 or 2, and wanted to return back to that universe.This is a loving reconstruction of MOO1 (so no Antarans). It has all of the buildings you're used to.The voice acting is top notch. The music is excellent. The races have distinct personalities and their ship designs reflect this. I found myself playing through multiple times as different races just to enjoy the different ship graphics and voiceovers.Ship design is also very well done. You can favor beam weapons, pulse weapons, or missiles. Each has unique advantages and defensive options.The music will be familiar to players of Master of Orion 1, although it's redone with an orchestra.As for cons, I would say the AI is a little patchy. The team has done a lot to improve it, though. Anyone who tried the early release should give it a second try. I've been playing this game since early release (having put in over 90 hours before release). It has improved significantly in the past few months.This is well worth the $30, considering how replayable it is. Relive a bit of your childhood.Edit:The game is also very well optimised. I play it on a windows 10 tablet with a mobile-series dual core processor, and It's smooth as butter.			"

												I really loved master of Orion II and was thrilled to see a modern remake. Unfortunately, the game is still buggy (missing icons, Titans won't mind control a Psilon colony [it worked on other Psilon colonies bofore]) and a drag. It is increadibly slow! On normal difficulty it is easy to dominate the game quickly, but then it takes hours. MOO2 had a much faster UI with less animations and loading time. Here it adds up to rediculous amounts of time you are looking at animations.			"

												Master of Orion 1 and 2, 3? not so much... How I have missed you. With the recent (past few years) crop of clones and ""spiritual successors"", I have wanted to play you. Wargaming.net and NGD have made that possible.The aliens have attitude, and are animated. The ships are beautiful and the explosions are grand. The planets, the monsters, the music. It's all back. The AI is meaner than ever and manages to challenege me. The Civ like tech tree mostly works for me. Thank you.Master of Orion: Conquer the Stars, you have conquered my heart, for the most part. Now, I just need more eXploration. Less micromanagement, and lots of unique things to make each faction play differently,a nd perhaps some unique planets and tech. That should make this game even better.For a more in-depth analysis, here's what eXplorminate.net thought of it - https://explorminate.net/2016/08/25/master-of-orion-conquer-the-star-review/If you'd like to hear a 93 minute podcast analyzing MoO:CtS to death, here is another link - https://explorminate.net/2016/08/26/the-4xperts-show-1-master-of-orion-conquer-the-stars/Bottom line. Do I recommended the game as it? Yes, I do. It is streamlined, plays well, crash-free and mostly fun. A 4X game can be completed in a single night if you play on a small enough map.12/4/16 update: Revenge of Antares is out. This DLC brings three more races into the mix. The ship art, voice acting and animations for the Elerians, Trilarians, and Gnolams are spot on. But that isn't what this review update is about. No. It's about the free content that was added. Leaders, a reworked espionage system, updated pollutiona and gravity mechanics, the return of the minors, and the Antaran threat. AWESOME additions. This feels, looks, and plays like a Master of Orion game. An easy recommend by me.Go check it out, and do not hesitate to play. This game is fantastic.			"

								I love the game, played it for 50 hours. But every time i win, I think the ending is dissapointing. The game starts with a cgi sequence and it should end with a cgi sequence. Now we see a short victory message and suddendly the main menu. I don't feel the excitement of winning.GNN is annoying, i love the concept but can't handle the robotvoice. I skip the news and that's a pitty. The Sound Editting really ruined his voice by cutting it in short phrases.Please add the possibility for choosing turns, I personally would extend them to 700, the game really comes to live after 300 turns and 500 turns is short.I would like to have a list of factories and facilities instead of searching them on a planet. I would like to see what their function is and how useful they are.Add some easter eggs in certain maps, map 666 is realy asking for a diablo planet. Maps 314159265 is asking for a PI planet. Just a few ideas. By adding easter eggs you feel the urge to share maps with each other.			"

								I really recommend this game because it is a lot of fun! I found great joy in the gameplay. The voice acting is amazing. The sound effects are really cool and the music is astonishing. The replayability is enormous. The number of different ways you can play the game is mostly shown in the tech tree, where you can't pick them all, because you get to choose between few techs at some points. The game feels already full of content and ready to rock and roll. Of course it has a few bugs and places that just does't feel right (come on it's in early acces what do you expect :D), but the developers have shown every single intenssion on working to improve. If you can bare a few bugs and want to support the developers i highly recommend this game.Have a nice day :)			"

								I see not to much difference between the last one MOO and the 2nd one. The general is multiplayer option, evidently.Disadvantage: absence on race configuration and the interface. The first in comrehensible (and espected soon)The Interface: I supose, the best way for such game is one-level game menu, included all the general preposes: Financial state, access to the List of colonies (why the hell I should look at the planets, where there are no colonies?), Fleets, Science, Diplomatic, Load/Save Menu (Quick Save is always welcome also). Now the greatest weakness of the interface is: a lot of grafics and not too much info on the most screen and few miserable letters and bottons in the coners.It's uncomfortable. And... YOU THINK, the Orion true fans like a nice picture with the joyful effects? NO! They like the strategy and tactics! And everything, that's slowing the gameplay... aggravates. Yes, it really does!But I recomend. I hope, it's just the early access			"

More of a reboot than a sequel, the game play harkens back to the older games.  Dwight Schultz, John DeLance, Mark Hamil, Michael Dorn are some of the voice actors to lend their talent to this game, just to name a few.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a fantastic addition to the MOO franchise!  If you are a gamer of the 80s and 90s and experienced the death of your social life due to MOO 1 or MOO 2 then you must pick this game up.  All of the pieces that make MOO 2 such a fantastic game of ""...just one more turn."" are in this game.  I've seen a lot of negative reviews on this game and I admit there is much to still be accomplished, but that's why it says it's an early access game.  That said, I played Master of Orion in the beginning of March 2016 and now at the end of March since the latest patch was released and the improvements are impressive!  The new races are a fantastic add.  The balance issues I saw before with the Psilons massively dominating with no negatives to those big brains of theirs have now been put in place.  Combat is much improved with the ability to set how fast your individual ship classes will rush into battle, and at what distance they will attempt to keep the enemy at bay.  At this time I will not create a pro/con list because it's just silly.  This game is not complete.  Spying, space combat, ground combat, diplomacy, and several other features are still being worked on.The bottom line is this.  If you were one of the unfortunate few like myself who purchased and played MOO 3 and then cursed the sky for the game being so terrible look no further than this latest installment to restore your faith in the franchise.That's it for now.  Time to return to Master of Orion and keep my social life at bay.			"

												Well if you played the ones before you will probably get this one as well. Be prepared for a let down though. It is extremely simplified and dumbed down compared to the previous iterations. There are lots of quirks present with the AI. AI can attack and destroy your whole fleets with impunity for example while you cannot do that without declaring war. Sometimes the game really makes you want to smash the monitor.Research is pathetic. Usually I reach the end of research tree before I destroy 1-2 civilizations. After that I usually get bored and simply quit the game because the result is clear.As it is I would not recommend buying this game as an incentive for the developers to finish their jobs. Each sale convinces them that the game is fine and they can finish it with DLC's. This game should still be in beta with the content it has. MOO has a special place in the game world and you cannot do a half-arsed job with it. This is blasphemy...			"

												It's uninteresting (there's too little to motivate you to explore and experiment, little to encourage replayability), has fewer features than some 4x indies released in the past years and the existing feature set is shallow. For example, it's very cool that we can control the fleet in combat, but you don't have much to do, you're mostly spectating. The same applies to everything the game does, they're there, they don't do much, but you still have to click them anyway - even though you rarely make meaningful decisions. And on top of that you have to pay for extra factions. The AI is very poorly designed, whatever they implied in the game description - but then again the map design is so simplistic that it won't matter. Obvious final verdict. However, it's not entirely bad, the nice polish on the UI and the voice-overs do make a difference, but they can't make you not care about all the things that are missing.			"

								Short Version : Had this been MOO3, We'd be playing MOO 5 by now...The creaters did a great job with this one. Everyone will have gripes about this portion or that portion, However overall, the pain of suffering through Independantly created MOO2 Clones is finally over!Rather than trying to make the game into something new, They did what MOO needed done. They have (successfully) recreated the feel of MOO and MOO2. The biggest complaint I've seen is in the combat system. And yes, It does feel a good bit simplistic at this stage, and Real Time Combat is a bit troublesome (Basically, its a nicely polished version of Sword of the Star's ShipVShip combat). Some have asked so I'll be sure to throw it in here, that combat IS pausable for a little bit of tactics, However I've not yet had a large enough fight between two fleets to need to use it often. On that note It still needs some polishing, but it IS an early release version. As an afterhought here, Having it real time does fix my biggest headache in MOO2, My fleet of 20 Heavy Ships VS the AI's 250 ship fleet and the 5 minute turns of combat....The voice acting is FANTASTIC. I'm very impressed with it so far. The audio there does seem a bit rough with my 5.1 Logitech headset, however I'm not 100% sure if its on my end or not (enabling Surround sound actually seemed to fix the issue). On the Planetary managment level, Its just slightly above the complexity of MOO2, But just as easy to understand after a short bit of play.Ground combat is MOO2 style (Marines fighting it out), and I'd like to see a bit of an increase in it before the final version... At least more to watch than two counters batteling it out. A lot of people have also commented on the use of Star Lanes... Personally I'm a fan, however I do see how that could be a headache for Diehard MOO2 Fans. It could be an option towards the final release, not sure how deeply encoded it is into the game...If I did have one complaint, Its actually in the research. (Research is VERY deep already in this game, Its not the system itself I'm mad at, Its almost right out of the MOO Handbook to be honest). Currently there doesn't seem to be a perk for being ""Creative"" over a standard race... Although a Few techs are Either-Or (Only played Human, Not sure if this holds true for the Psilons or not), Most techs are fully open. I'd love to see it go to the classic A-B-C style used in the previous games, as it adds a lot of strategic depth.... Deciding between titans/Battleoids and Starbases has always been one of my biggest dreads in MOO...So, To summarize, I'm proud to say I no longer have to say ""This is the best thing since MOO2"". Master of Orion is Back, and its just as good, if not better than ever!			"

Early Access Review
								Master of Orion (2016) is an excellent modernization of the classic space 4X game Master of Orion II. While fans of the MoO series will easily be able to adapt, there are a number of changes that have been implemented (such as star lanes) that impact the gameplay by making it more similar to some modern space 4X games. Whether or not this is a Good Thing (TM) probably depends upon how old you are.In its still unfinished state, most major features are implemented. Some features need some TLC: customizing star ship designs isn't as fun or friendly as it could be, switching between screens make an annoying sound, finding and selecting what to build in the selection menu is something of a chore, and pollution isn't the threat that it should be. I haven't experienced and thus don't review all races or spying in this review.I'd like to see pollution scale in severity to the planet type. Gaia worlds should be very sensitive to high levels of pollution and should provide a more clear benefit. There is little clarity as to what the planet ""specials"" do (Dark Quartz = ?) or why you want them and you don't get new tech for exploring or colonizing Artifacts planets. Tech research times are also much too rapid, you will find it difficult to keep your fleet up with your pace of technological development. Several of the techs have poor descriptions. I expect much of this to be cleaned up as the game moves towards production.Tactical combat is no longer turn based and is now real time (also similar to other modern space 4X games). You can now control the speed ships move at and control the rate of time. I would personally prefer to see a return (or option for) turn based tactical combat. Battles also don't last very long, taking some of the fun out of them. The planet screen needs some more work; I don't like the rather ""cartoonish"" icons for workers/researchers/farmers.Good: Return to classic gameplay, modernized interface. Nothing like the soul crushing nightmare that was MoO 3. Less micromanagement and more fun overall.Bad: Combat isn't as fun as it used to be, some adoptions of ""modern"" 4X games add questionable value to the game. Turn-based tactical combat was fun.Ugly: The end game on large maps gets laggy and crashes more often. A ""failed to create new game"" bug causes the game to crash every 50 or so turns for me.			"

								This game recaptures much of the spirit of the original Masters of Orion series that I enjoyed so much when I was young.  To be involved with this at Early Access is better than I could have hoped for.  Was the best birthday gift someone could have, given how many hours I played MOO2 and 3 (yes I even liked 3) as a child. The updated visuals is impressive, yet the little details that show they still pay homage to the originals is wonderful.  I enjoy the added voice acting as well, definitley a plud.To those skeptics, and curious about the negative reviews, keep in mind, this is early release, and if you'd prefer the finished product, then wait until its done before you buy.  The game has its bugs, and flaws, and i'm not going to lie on that, but so far the improvments I have seen show they are paying attention to those flaws as well.			"

Early Access Review
								I could go on and on at great length about this game so I'll try and keep this brief. I'm a massive fan of the original game and this IS the update to the franchise I dreamed we might see someday but never really though would happen.If you are a fan of the original games and aren't blinded by nostalgia you won't be dissapointed. The game isn't perfect but it's the best 4x game I've played since MOO2 or rather it WILL be.... I can see where it's headed in alot of places but it's not there yet.Don't let the naysayers put you off, nearly every negative review I see on here doesn't seem to grasp the concept of 'early access' and that this is not a finnished game nor is it supposed to be yet.However all the areas the game is currently unfinnished I can already see the seeds of greatness and reading the developers updates and posts about their plans and their response to feedback fills me with joy as they're not only paying attentention to the feedback from the fans but theyre actively working to make this the game we all want it to be.To sum up, this WILL be sequel MOO 2 always deserved but it ins't there yet, if you want to get in at the beginning and play it now, go for it but please don't do so then go crying to forums about how unfinnished it is.... If you don't understand how early access/alpha/beta testing works then you should probably hold off for the moment and wait for the finnished product! If you ARE able to undstand that this isn't that finnished product yet and it's currently missing some signifigant features and that alot of the content that IS in place will likely change in a big way before release.... then buy it now!

												Not liking it. I bought it at full price, rare for me, but Moo2 is one of my favorite games of all time.  Way back when I sold Moo2 as soon as Moo3 came out -- clearly a mistake in hindsight.I was more cautious with this one, but somewhat hopeful.  I played a game up until someone got to Orion, I'm uninstalling for now.  I may try it again later 'cause I'm stupidly hopeful.  Dealbreakers for me: 1) Real-time combat.  They gave some lame explanation of you cant do fun turn based in space.  I only had small battles, but they were completely on autopilot.  Galciv 3 space battles are more interesting.  Moo2 was one of the best TBS games of all time, this design point I knew would probably ruin it.  It did.  2) You can't rename planets.  A feature the series always had, and helped me remember which system was specialized in what.  Now it's the battle of Ceti Alpha 6 or whatever every time.  Kills the immersion.3) There are no heroes, like Moo2 had.  That added alot of flavor (though stupidly in Moo2 you couldn't rename the heroes, either).  They are missing.I mention these 3, because otherwise it is a revamped version of Moo2.  The overall production values are really nice... so close to breathing fresh life into the series.  I was hoping they would pull off what a revival like happened with Xcom.			"

												If i would sum up this product In one word it would be: unimaginative. Dont get me wrond, the game is not That bad. But it is just a worse version of MOO2 we all loved.  Very close but not better or new in any way. So why should you buy it? I dont know.Guys, why would you make a simpler version of a global turn base  strategy? The whole appeal of games like that is complexaty, amount of details and thinking involved. Why do you think people play that kind of games?  For the grafics?)  LOL  Making it primitive shows that you dont get the point of this kind of games! What would chess be with only pawns? That is exactly what you did here!!!As it is worse then MOO2 I dont understand for what did I pay my money for?!   Right now I dont recommend on buying this game. Its a poor ripoff classic game. Zero imagination involved.And it is also  an unfinished product!!! with tons of bugs! Facepalm. I regret on spending my money.			"

								I used to play MOO2 lots, and this game doesn't disappoint fans of the classic. I am SO VERY HAPPY with the revolutionised real-time battles and I'm sure this game is going to better and better. I expect to see more races added.I can currently beat this game on hardest setting with a custom race, in AI 1v1, or a full galaxy. Message me for the optimal race picksPros: True to origins. Love it. Wonderfully satisfying combat. Annoying voices can be turned off.Cons: Same old grind to get to the end win when it is obviously guranteed. Still some game balancing required and some minor bugs. If the AI was a bit smarter then it would be more dynamic and challenging. However, this will all likely change in upcoming updates... how exciting!Conclusion: Totes recommend.			"

Early Access Review
								Is this game worth the money? I think so.I would like to start with a little history. I have been a long time fan of the series. Master of Orion II is still my all time favorite game, and it's a large part of why I didn't like MOO3. I tell you this to set up exactly what I expect from Master of Orion. I was looking for a fun turn based 4X game (as a good 4X game is turn based, IMO), and I feel that Master of Orion: Conquer the Stars supplies that.The AI races are a bit on the cartoonish side, but I feel that this is a nod to the original MOO. There is a lot of micro-management, and this is a nod to MOO2. The population cells and star lanes? That's all MOO3. What I am saying here, is that just about every design decision can be traced back in some way to a previous game in the series.That said, the game isn't finished. The  AI  and  DIPLOMACY , especially, are rough, but then again these are the most dynamic of the features. If I had to guess, I would say that they're saving AI refiniements until last. You want to include all of your toys before you finalize how the AI will decide how to play with them. Right now, they're likely making sure that the components work, before getting them to work exactly how they want them to. ESPIONAGE , certainly, needs more work. I keep stealing technology that I've stolen before (how many different Cloning Centers does one need?), but they'll iron all that out, I'm sure. Likewise,  COMBAT  still has a way to go, but again, this is entirely AI based. The AI is very basic right now, but I'm sure it will be improved. RESEARCH  needs work, but I'll be honest and say I don't know what it needs. A greater flexibility, maybe.  CUSTOM RACES  need more options, but it's still a new feature, give it time. COLONY MANAGEMENT  is the biggest flaw right now. It's not broken by any means, but it could use work. There is no way to fine tune what your citizens prioritize without perosnally managing your populations. I'd like to see the ability to use sliders to control how my new citizens get assigned, and to save those presets as a custom set. But it's not a major negative at this point in time. FINAL VERDICT : if you're the type of person who likes beta projects, or can deal with a game in a yet-to-be-finished state, and you like 4X games (especially the MOO series), pick this up. If you are the type of person who thinks a turn based game is too slow, or you think an early-access game should be 100% playable and finished and just needing some polish, or you want a game you can beat in a few days and move on... this is not your game. I have individual games that last a dozen or more hours, but I like a game I can return to again and again. To this day I still open up MOO2 now and then... except I haven't felt the need since getting this.			"

								As someone who played MOO2 until the disk no longer worked, I was very sceptical about the reimagining of WG Labs of Master Of Orion. But the preview movies and the voice cast made me reconsider. Got this on day one of Early Access and I can say I am definitely not disappointed.If you're looking for a carbon copy of the original MOO/MOO2 then just play those instead (they're also included in the Collectors Edition BTW), but this game certainly nails the MOO concept perfectly. And the good thing about EA: it will only get better with time!Definitely worth the money, go get it if you're a 4X addict.			"

								It has some of the core parts of MOO2 and is promising but needs some work.1) Tactical Combat - Real time is total crap. It needs to be turn based and bring back different shield facings. All the strategy is gone out of this aspect of the game. This is a game breaking flaw for me. Maybe have turn based orders with simultaneous results. Similar to Combat Mission Afrika Corps.2) Need custom races options. This includes what ship set your fleet will look like. I love the Sakara but hate the look of their ships. I am sure this is in development.3) More options of things to do with ""dead"" systems. For example a system with only a gas giant. You should be able to build an orbital station of some time.4) Some sort of approval system for upgrades to designs based on tech. I really like the upgrade feature but it would be nice to have a pop up menu for the new ship design for a quick double check. I ended up upgrading all my ships without any ground bombardment capability without realizing it.5) Races don't really feel distinct in gameplay at the moment but I think this is under development.6) Where are the heroes/admirals?Overall very promising but still under development. Visually the game is amazing, sound is also very well done. A few tweaks to the tactical combat, a hero system, better ai, custom race feature and I will be having many many sleepless nights. Please support this game so that is can become a worthy successor to MOO2			"

Early Access Review
A great foundation of what promises to be a great gameTL;DR;  All in all a very nice 4x game that you can jump into and enjoy without having to spend a few days learning the controls.  It's fun and rewarding and the depth is there when you start playing multiplayer (as the AI isn't challenging atm, it's Early access after all).Early Early Access reviewI've played through the game about 6 times now, 2 of those were multiplayer: I loved most things.  Since this is an early access review I won't be mentioning things like balance or tech-tree progression as things like that can be changed at a drop of a hat and I'm sure would be a utter waste of development time right now.Things that are in place: Galaxy overview & planetary control, tactical battles, ship design and diplomacy.These are all in a very basic form apart from the galaxy overview.The galaxy controls are pretty robust, you can move your ships around and most things already have useful tooltips.  You can see how long a planet's production has left to finish it's next item and stuff like that.  Even trading between planets in the same system can happen (including production points with the right setup!!!).The planetary control gets a bit micro management heavy later in the game but I'm still processing turns in less than 30 seconds now I know what I'm doing even then.  Things like build order lists would be good for different types of planets but you can queue 5 things at once and if you don't mind thinking about which 5 to build when you first colonise then it's good.  It's fun to balance between growth, research and production.  It's easy to see where the points are coming from and to balance that one point of research/production to finish the next item.  Although when you don't have enough food and your planet's population starts dying, it can be confusing as to why the food from your empire isn't getting there.  Income and expenses can also be confusing.The tactical battles look great, but you can tell it's just not finished yet.  It plays ok and I'm able to sway battles in my favour if I use it and don't simulate (I reloaded a battle that lost on simulate, but won without loss on tactical).  This is the same with planetary defense... how strong are they?  We don't know but I'm sure it's just a work in progress and will improve later in the EA before release.Diplomacy: I don't really care much for AI diplomacy on any 4x game and just declare war on everybody, so I'm not the man to ask about that stuff.In conclusionSo if you don't mind playing a in-progress Early Access, then get it now and have fun!  If you want to wait until the complete experience is ready... well then wait.  I couldn't wait and I've already got my money's worth!			"

								As of this review, I have 29 hours on record on the game. It's not a lot, and I honestly haven't finished the game through, but I have played two complete games totalling these hours. I have to admit, it was more than what I was expecting. The shortcomings of the game can be summed mostly up as being in an constantly updated state. There's gonna be quirks, but the developers offer a nice way to extend your issues or problems to them: they included a ""Report Bug"" feature. I've used it plenty of times, and knowing this game is still be roughed out on its edges, I'm totally okay with that.The things I love are a-plenty! I thoroughly enjoy how strategic, detailed, and animated the battle scenes are. It makes me feel like I'm watching a movie taking place. Speaking of that, whenever you colonize, you get some of these wonderful scenes too. Matter of fact, I'm going to go ahead and say it: The entire game plays like a movie you're making.Point blank, the way I feel as a casual gamer, and as a person who has used games from wargaming, I know for a fact they're going to pay attention to the customer base. I further know that while these developers are a separate entity (sortof), they still have that same passion. You can see it in this game. From the voice-overs, to the way the game operates, every action and reaction feels like you're contributing to your own story. It's not entirely customizable, not yet, but as someone who enjoyes playing the Terran Kahnat (I recommend getting this addition while there's still time!), I am having one heck of a blast!Conclusion:While still in the stages of roughing out the edges, you can feel the passion here. I really enjoy being a part of that, playing it, and feeling it for myself. I'm addicted, and I really enjoy it.			"

								A great series of games, well, 1 and 2 were great games...3 not so much! This is a worthy successor to the first two games. Now, I want you to understand I don't make this claim lightly as MOO 1 and 2 are on my all time greatest game list and I STILL play them! I have been playing this since it's initial EARLY ACCESS release on Steam, (I did preorder) and I do not regret it in the slighest. This game has a high replay value and has alot to do in game from designing ships to assigning population tasks on a planet (think Civ in space) and alot more besides. A great cast of voice actors including Michael Dorn, Dwight Schultz and Robert Englund (google is you're friend ;D ) some beautiful graphics, a very in depth game and some damn cool looking ships! My only gripe is I would like to see more customisation in the ship design but I CAN do without it. I will update this as more content is released, but for now I definately reccommend it as a buy, if you've never played MOO before but like a good strategy game you won't be at a disadvantage it's very easy to pick up and everything is explained and pretty straight forward to be honest, if you have played MOO you're not reading this crap you already bought the game and are on turn 300 in a massive galaxy, just having colonised Orion and about to go to war with everyone...just to see if you can take em.

								I have to say that I actually like this game, but remember it is early access.Cons:*The tech tree is more like Civilization than a MOO game, that was disappointing to me. I liked the divided tree into different areas, etc. MOO2 is my fav tech tree.*Combat: defenses are pretty much useless against ships. The definition of tactical combat presently in the game is point, click, and they shoot, no real tactics to it. From what they say, this is a major work in progress.....I hope, otherwise it would be one of the most disappointing elements in the game.*No Elarians, one of my favs in MOO2*Diplomacy.....what diplomacy? I have found it better to ignore this aspect of the game until the computer acts more reasonably.*Ship design: I love that the ship design here is much like MOO and better than most of this game's piers, but I still find it too restrictive when compared to previous MOO games. Would love to have more choices about how many specials, etc to put on a ship. I should be able to have a titan dedicated to electronic warfare if I want to and have space available.*Tech comes too fast and ships too slowly, by the time they are built, they are obsolete.Pros:*In my opinion the flow of the galaxy, production ques, etc. resembles MOO2 very well and is one of the best out of any recent space tbs game. Some people do not like the auto group, but the same people love MOO2 (which had auto group). It is as simple as selecting the ones you do not want in the group and moving on. As far as the galaxy, fleet movement, etc. goes I think it does well with some minor issues on path finding.*The bones of a good game, with the glitches of an EA (early access) game.*All in all it plays like MoO4, bringing some of the best of the first 2 games, and missing many of the problems of MOO3 (while keeping star lanes, which I personally like).Overall while my cons are more detailed and specific than my pros, I think for people like myself, who are buying this to be a true MOO game, it can be at least mostly pleasing.There are issues but like I said, overall, it plays like a MOO game (with the exception of that darned tech tree....hate it).So I recommend getting it because it plays a lot like MOO to me....differences, the the spirit is there and that is something I found lacking in games like Endless Space, Horizon, etc. They are all decent games, but have never had the spirit or held a candle to MOO. I hope that many of those issues above are fixed and improved on, but I at least recommend this game based on the fact that the collectors edition includes the 3 previous games plus the new MOO!			"

MOO'moriesI don’ t think I’ve ever written a review of a space strategy game without mentioning Master of Orion, the granddaddy of the genre  and a title which it’s illegal to look back on without wearing rose tinted glasses.There’s a reason everyone has fond memories of MOO, it was a great game in its day and deserves all the rosy hued love it gets, of course if you played it now you’d struggle to get past its aging graphics and dated game play, but who’d want to risk tarnishing those memories by playing MOO again now anyway?It’s not like there aren’t plenty of more recent space 4x titles out there to scratch your galactic empire building itch.MOO'ving in CirclesElton John and the Lion King had it right, what goes around comes around, it's the circle of life.When you lived long enough you'll notice songs that you remember from years ago being re-released by ""modern artists"" who'll inevitably have fiddled with the track and aren't singing it properly.There'll be movie re-makes which just aren't the same and worse, movie re-inventions where they get it wrong on purpose!Clothes, hairstyles, the economy, war and peace, it's all cyclical.If you wait long enough, what's old will inevitably be new again and it seems we've waited long enough in the case of Master of Orion, because it's back!MOO'vellous AestheticsThe first thing you're going to notice when you fire up Master of Orion: Conquer the Stars (to give it it's full title) is just how glossy and polished everything looks.From the beautifully rendered opening cinematic to the animated menu backdrops , your initial moments with the game are so shiny you can't help but have high expectations of what's to come.MOO and ImprovedIf you're old enough to have played the original Master of Orion (but young enough to still be able to remember it!) you should recognise the ten races available to you when you set up your first game.The cat-like Mrrshan, the robotic Meklar and the insectoid Clackon. they're all back and all looking better than ever.It's a nostalgia kick and will bring a smile your old gamers face.Not MOO'siveAlthough when it's time to choose your galaxy size that smile may fade a little (depending on your expectations), even the largest option seems a little on the small side compared to other recent space strategy releases.Stellaris gives you a galaxy comprising of one thousand star systems, Galactic Civilization III can give you a maximum of around 1500 Stars (although I haven't counted, so that might be a bit off). So What's the largest playing area in new MOO?A measly 100 systems!Now don't get me wrong, if you're looking for a quick game (relatively speaking) then this is absolutely fine, but if you're the type who sets your research speed to slow before settling down for the long haul in a vast galaxy then you're likely to be disappointed with your options here.MOO'niture Star SystemsOnce you've set your galaxy size and starting options there are other issue which gamers looking for a sense of realism might find annoying.Star systems generally don't have enough orbital bodies, systems can only handle a maximum of 5 planets plus the odd moon or two if you're lucky, It's not a huge issue but unfortunately it's also not the only one.If you play a sandbox game as the humans,  you'd at least expect Sol to be a yellow type star right?Well don't get your hopes up,  you could just as likely end up with a red or blue sun as a yellow one, it seems to be a random element during galactic generation.There isn't even a nod towards any sense of realism in the generation of the planets either. You'll get a continental class planet, Earth, not that it'll be called that, orbiting in a random position around a randomly coloured Sun.As I said earlier, MOO can only handle a maximum of five planets around a star, so you'd think we'd at least  get Mercury through to Jupiter in the Sol system, but again no.There'll be a few random planets labelled Sol 1 through Sol 5 (if you're lucky enough to get 5 planets that is.)This isn't an issue if you're playing an alien race or the alternate Terrans available in the collector's edition of the game, but play as vanilla humans and this is very jarring.So after taking a deep breath and reminding yourself it's just a game and doesn't need to acknowledge realism,  it's time to actually play it.MOO're of the SameStarting out is pretty standard for any turn based Space 4x title, we all know the drill by now. You send out your scout ships to explore your neighbourhood, you build colony ships to grab any nearby planets worth having and send out your construction ships to build ""stuff"" to give you an edge, stations, mines, surveillance outposts etc.It's worth noting here that MOO takes the star lane approach to interstellar travel. Whilst it will occasionally let you head off into empty space with your survey ship to investigate the odd anomaly, for the most part you need to stick to the space roads provided.Planetary construction also follows a familiar vein. Click on a planet you control, Pick the building you want to construct and wait for it to finish building to get the relevant boost to food, research, production etc. then rinse and repeat.This isn't a critisism, this is how all these games play, and ""if it's not broke don't try to fix it""It's all generic  4X fun.Ship Design MOO'chanicsThe ship design mechanics are well presented with a polished interface which looks great.Each hull type has a maximum capacity which you can fill up with a variety of core systems (engines, shields etc), weapons systems(pew, pew) and specialised systems (magic gadgets which tinker with your weapon damage and shield strength, that sort of thing). It's all done through a simple, clean drag and drop mechanic, it's not revolutionary but it does the job well enough and as I said, it looks pretty good too.Of course you're going to need to research all these fancy gadgets before you get to play with them.MOO'ving through the Tech-TreeThe research interface is a glossy affair which also looks great. It's presented by a chatty advisor who (if you're playing as the human empire) peers at you over her glasses expectantly whilst you peruse the options available from the 70+ technological advancements you'll eventually unlock.There are some important decisions along the way too, research a technology and you may be given an choice regarding which benefit it unlocks, whichever one you don't choose could well be locked to you for the rest of your game, it's a nice touch and adds to the replayabilty.MOO'king Friends and Influencing PeopleThe diplomacy interface is highly polished and looks great (noticing a trend yet? ).From the diplomacy menu  all the races you've met appear as holograms with some basic information about their colonies and fleets if known.Click for an audience and you're welcomed into the aesthetic halls of your chosen races leader where you can negotiate trade deals, treaties or wars.It's worth noting that all the races (just like your own advisors) are superbly voiced.There are some big names behind the voices in Master of Orion. Worf son of Mogh, Luke son of Anakin and Lieutenant Barclay from Star Trek (or Murdock from the A-Team if you prefer) are but a few of the actors onboard, even John de Lancie has been let out of the Q Continuum to voice the human emperor.It adds a huge amount to the quality of the experience having genuinely talented actors lend their voices to the game and fits with the cinematic polish perfectly.I Spy with MOO Little EyeIt always pays to keep an eye on your neighbours too and that's where your spy network comes in.As you.......

												I would have given this a good review. But there are just to many inconsistencies. I was going to well with Sakkra, They had just given me a trade deal that involved me allying with them against the Psilon. Everything was going SO WELL in this game. Then I blocked off a boarder so I could build a colony like I always do, I like to protect the colony in the early stages until its built up and has a military force to protect it. But, because of the ever present stupid game mechanics, because I am defending my boarders, and the Sakkra wanted to get threw, they started combat with me? Without declaring war? I tried to retreat but they still destroyed all my ships, destroyers and all. Looked at the diplomacy screen, everything is all good with them. This really did screw the game up for me, it might be something small, but its really game destroying.			"

								After playing as every race in the game, I highly recomend this game. It is a lot of fun to play for a long time. However, the A.I. is not that great at diplomacy. At all. It really needs to be fixed. Trying to make a peace treaty after taking over a few of their planets and wiping out there fleet and they demand like they are winning the war. Also the galactic council would be a lot better if there were things you could vote on other than the winner. Combat needs to be tweaked more, the a.i. only goes for swarming rather than better ships. which is extremely annoying.			"

								I'm impressed by how polished the game feels and looks.""Worst"" example I found, was a spy building, where the description said ""Needs implementing"".Even though the research part has been moved to a tech tree, I think it works nice.Describing this game as ""CIV, but just in outer space"" is not that far off.Of course there are some things that could be better, but IMHO this game works better, than Heroes 7 did when it was released. Given that ""Master of Orion - Conquer the Stars"" is some way off from release, I am really looking forward to playing the game (again) , but on release.			"

Early Access Review
								This is my inital review for the Early Access of Master of Orion.Gametime: aprox 20 hours.As a long time fan of Moo2 i am pleased to see that this game is way more Moo2 than Moo3.It kind of reminds me of a crossover between Moo2 and Sins of a solar empire.This game has a lot of potential to become great with some tweaks and polishing.As it stand right now i think the game is unballanced in regards of research,and the opponents are not much of a challenge. Frankly they are quite push-over.Also combat is a little bit dull, its not engaging like the classic moo2 where you got to play your fleet.Here it is real time combat and you have little control over whats happening. You can activate modules manually.Also i miss being able to recruit ship officers and colony administrators for increased bonuses.Would like to see this implemented, and perhaps with an xp system for the officers and administrators.Some things that need adjusting and improving are Tool tips, Correct and updated stats on ship modules, Research,Difficulty level, Sorting out misc bugs and strangely enough.. savegame size. My savegame folder now almost takes up 1gb of space.. with the largest save being 150mb.There are also some bugs here and there, but nothing major, and a save and relog usualy resolves the issue.If this is only on my client i do not know, my friend who purchased the game at the same time does not experience the same bugs as i do.But i think the graphics looks great, races are pehaps a bit cartoony but i dont mind. Individual voice acting for each race, nice models and nice textures, nice cinematics. Engaging gameplay and it is easy to spend alot of time ingame.To sum it up, the game as it stands right now has its flaws.. but it is an early access so what did you expect ?Are the flaws game breaking ? no, not at all. The game is fully playable and quite enjoyable.But i expect the game to become even greater with polishing and the correct tweaks.Also i look forwards to more races and ingame content being implemented like higher difficulty and custom races.• Should you buy it ? If you are a fan of the series i would say this is a must have. And buying into it right now you can give the developers feedback and help influence the game into becoming something great. • Would i buy the game again ? Yes most deffinatly i would, even in early access. "

Early Access Review
								EA4 is looking a lot better, tactical combat still needs a lot of focus but the additional room in the tactical map made a suprising bit of difference -- there is now enough space, and heavy mount guns now do something, so you can force defending ships to come out from the missile range of the starbases. Nice touch. AI has gotten a lot more aggressive but still needs some work, tactically it tends to chase rabbits and is easy to kite. Diplomacy still needs some work, AIs get stuck in demanding colonies, which is just silly. No one is ever going to surrender colonies unless they're losing a multi-front war and need to close a front, so demanding them as peace terms when the AI is getting wrecked is just silly. Same with tech trades. No, I'm not going to trade a 25 pop gaia for fighter bays.Game is looking really good as of June.----As of the 2016-02-26 release this is a fairly early alpha release. With that in mind, most of the groundwork for a remake of Master of Orion 1+2 is there and given another 6-12 months of development this could be a real successor. A bunch of key MOO concepts are only in framework here, particularly most of the non-combat technologies, tactical controls and diplomatic options, but the concepts are at least there.Superficially it resembles MOO3 with the inter-star lanes bu the gameplay feels much more like Moo1. Good effort so far, cautiously optimistic. Any expectations should be tempered, still needs a lot of development.			"

								Just typed out a long review, hit ""Post Review"", post review button disappeared, review didn't post and 5 paragraphs vanished into the ether. So here's my 2nd, shorter, try.Game's great. Master of Orion 2 with improvements on everything and some new additions. Currently heavily limited in races/setup/ship design/multiplayer due to early access (at time of this review), but this doesn't ruin the gameplay experience in any significant way except for people who prefer to play on Impossible like me. Low knowledge barrier of entry, high knowledge and skill barrier for mastery, but right now there is only 1 (average) difficulty of AI available. In-game UI is intuitive and delivers complex information simply, the opposite of that abomination known as Master of Orion 3.This game is the sequel I have been wanting since 1998, or at least it is the Early Access version of that sequel. Buy it if you love 4e or want Moo2 but with it's time period's limitations and biggest flaws fixed.			"

								I am liking the feel of this right off the bat.. Gets me just the way the original games did. Needs a bit of polish yet, I had it hang three times when it was working the other races turns (I am 350 turns into a huge galaxy). I am running the psilons (always my favorite race) and things are working almost exactly the way it used to in MOO1 and MOO2, they start slow and weak and by the end of the game if you squeek by they are a power house.Still needs some polish in ship customization and updates, not as many choices here as there used to be. The races are a little bland compared to the old way and no way to customize them at startup, which was always cool. I have seen several reviews that claim alliances are impossible, I would not know, when they ask me for money I said no, they went to war with me and that was always my signal to turn from peaceful expansion to warmonger, I have not needed the other races for allies as I am simply crushing them.Combat is missing something from the old games, perhaps have not explored it enough, in the older versions I always controlled the ships early on and then gave up when the fleets got so massive it was just no use and let the AI take the battles from there, so far have simply let the  AI run the battles, the graphics are beautiful in battles, kudos to the game team there!On that note, graphics are very good thru the entire game, love the look of it! The voice overs are also fantastic! You can really tell they have some professionals for this.Its early on, but I do recomend this if your a MOO follower! I think its very solid start, and they have already said more to come, I will be playing this one for years to come, I can say that for sure right now!			"

Early Access Review
								This game is fun! If you are fan of the Civilization franchise, or even the original MOO games, this game is great. If you have any experience with 4x turn based games you'll have no learning curve and will be comfortable jumping right in. I only have a bit over 10 hours at the time of this review but I can see that there will be many 10s, maybe even hundreds of hours in a year or two. At the time of this review the game is EA with changes and content planned down the road. Also, at this time the game would seem to be a little bit simplified if you were to compare it to some of the other 4x games out there. I expect this may change a little bit as they exit out of the EA period which is only 3 short months anyway but I'd be okay if it didn't. I like that it doesn't require an encyclopedic knowledge base of the game components or mechancis or that it doesn't take 20 hours of trial and error to get your stuff together. It is fun the way it is. I see there are quite a few negative reviews, all of which are from fans of the old MOO games making comparisons. My experience with MOO was not fanatical, I liked them and played them a bit but nothing outrageous. And in playing this game I wasn't expecting or wanting an exact continuation of the franchise. Besides, most people remember the games of old with some glorious nostalgic glitter that makes them all seem great, and they were but they really weren't.The good thing is that with the Collector's Edition you get all the old MOO games that you can play again and compare with older eyes and a wiser mind.

Mac Version on Mac Book ProWell it happened...Background and TheoryMOO2 is in my top 4 favourite games. I took MOO3 as a personal slight against me... I know most of us did.The bar is high because of Two but low because of Three.It will suffer from being too much like MOO2/1 and, conversely, too different from MOO2/1. It also will suffer from where it pitches itself, to some degree it doesn't and I suspect won't offer  the complexity that is now consider normal for 4X games.ReviewishThis is a very playable game. It is very pretty (it's fantastic to get to see more of the original races, even the voice acting is well done), responsive and suitably addictive. I really like:The new ability to build space structuresStricter use of pathway moment Real time space battles with a pause button (I love the old battle system but feel that it would have aged the game). The 'diminished returns' system with worker placement.The wee movies.The fleshing out of races.Currently it's a bit overpriced by 33% - 66% I'd say. Though, worth supporting if you're a fan of the series and have spending money - why not? This is a worthy addition to the cannon - MOO3 was not, iMO. I'm really pleased to say we are in safe hands!Starting rating 7(This is in the top 2% of Early Access - it looks and feels great.)Bugs/Fixes:In 5 hours I had one freeze but the auto save meant that nothing was lost.The font size needs looked at.Give us Gnolams!!!

								Finally! A worthy heir to Moo2I feel like many of the negative reviews on here are totally failing to account for the pre-release nature of this game. Are some systmes missing? Yes. Are a few systems still incomplete? Yes. Is the game still one of the best Space 4x games ever? YES! The parts of this game that ARE done, show a ton of polish, and harken back to the glory days of Moo2. It offers a great balance of nostalgia with updated procedures. I think many of the more recent Space 4x titles have made things too ""complicated"" in a misguided effort at ""realism"" - Moo has wisely avoided that in favor of understandabilty. Because the choices are more clear, it's FAR easier to understand the consequences of your decisions... and therefore much more fun to play (Imho). The game still has some rough edges, of course, but it's already the most fun I've had playing a space 4x (or really any strategy game) since Civ5. Wait till it's done, if you like - but if you enjoyed Moo2, you'll LOVE this game.			"

								Despite what all the most helpful reviews say this game is fun. You get to fight your enemies and destroy their whole empire.the ship customization is a little confussing, but you get to add what ever type of weapon you want to the ship, if it has the space for it.Diplomacy is a little on the down side. When you say no to one of the races they hate you for the rest of the game no matter what.Whatching your ships in the battle simulator is quit fun. Whatching as your ships blow up all that comes between them and their target is thrilling.I would recommend this game to all those who are new to the series and not old vetreans of the series. (Mainly because most of them complain of it being real-time-battles and not turn-based-battles)			"

								Excellent Game, very well thought out with a stunning UI and great gameplay. If you've ever played Endless Space, you will love the latest installment of Master of Orion. Very similar 4X gameplay, but with more options in terms of ship designs, scales, weaponry and special modules, also more terraforming options. Unlike other 4X games like Endless Space and Civ V, when you start a battle, you go opt into a very quick real time combat, sort of like real time combat in total war games but so much shorter, battles that last maybe two or three minutes maximum. It makes for a more interseting time, as sometimes you can push through better in real time, not often, but I have noticed that units that have a lot of missiles and not much else don't tend to have a very high auto resolve rating, but can crush in real time. In terms of bugs, I have encountered one game ending bug, but that has only happened once and is to be expected when it comes to an early access game, but the auto save feature saves every turn, so I reset the game and pressed continue and I was maybe 30 seconds behind where it crashed, and it didn't occur again. Also the cool little landing cinematic that happens when you first colonise a planet are such a small touch, but it honestly makes the game that much more stunning, I just wish that they would have varying intros rather than just the same angle and landing intro every time you land on a barren planet. I would also love to see a cinemativ when you land troops on a planet and successfully conquer it, that would be cool. Overall I would say this game is definitely worth a buy, even in early access, although I would warn about the addictiveness that comes with games like this, definitely a great way to bring back a franchise.Tl;dr: Beautiful, fun to play, even in early access.

Early Access Review
								I grew up playing Master of Orion - and my favorite, Master of Orion 2 - and I was excited to see that the game was getting a reboot.My goal was not to win, which I did, but to take Orion. I accomplished both on my first and only (thus far) play through.Other than typos in the subtitles and some very basic gameplay bugs relating to things like memory and processing speed, the game was really well put together for not being a polished release. My family is a game industry family, so I have pretty high standards for a game in early access, and Master of Orion did not disappoint.I would like to suggest, however, that the devs consider a couple of things:1 - Make it more obvious when something negative is happening or about to happen. It was particularly difficult to keep track of the pollution levels of my dozen-plus colonies, for instance.2 - More fun random occurences. I only had a handful of interesting things happen (quake, population boom, etc) in nearly 600 turns! Those, plus GNN, were my favorite things about MoO2!3- PLEASE let there be a way to decline diplomatic messages from other races! They can refuse an audience with me - it's only fair I can choose to do the same!Overall, the game FEELS right. I enjoyed it, I LOVED the voice casting, and I was impressed by the stability and playability of the game so far.Questions for the devs:- Will you bring back some of the other races, like the Elerians? PLEASE. I LOVE THEM.- Are you going to do an Antares expansion-type thing at any point? That would be fun.- I assume you guys will be introducing more of the tactical elements (or similar elements) that were in MoO2. Will you be making this version of the game more tactically-oriented, or are you starting off slow so that new players to the franchise don't get caught up in a very steep learning curve? For example, I'd love to see the leader assignments return and more opportunities for diplomatic interaction.That's all. Thanks, guys! I loved it.			"

								This game is still in pre-release and so there are some problems but easy to fix. For example, you will see things like ""Cloning Centre INCREASES population growth by -25%"" MINUS 25%?!? Simple math errors and typos. There is little diffrence so far between the actual game play of MOO2 and this version. The focus has been on graphics and UI. I will admit that the graphics are better and more in line with the current decade... however, the designers are still dopey computer programming types and not Computer Information consultants like myself ... ok, what do I mean by that? Well, they made a great looking build screen that pops up when you want to build a new building on your planet... HOWEVER the window covers up all the information about your planet that you MAY want to look at before making your decision! Does your planet need more food production? Who knows... it is under the build window and impossible to see! Got to close the build window to see the planet production THEN re-open your build window to make your choice .... ANNOYING as HELL.Surprisingly, diplomacy has not been altered. I am disappointed by that. MOO2 had very rudimentary diplomacy and the game could be WAY more interesting if they at LEAST added in some changes to be on parity with Civilization IV.I love the game and will continue to play - sending in lots of bug reports and hoping that they listen to a few of my suggestions. For you all ... it is a copy of MOO2 with much better graphics but some annoyances in the interface. RECOMMENDATION: in present form would be better if price were reduced but still a buy.			"

								Well as someone who enjoyed Civ 5, i got to say i like this game. My friend at work suggested me playing the original MOO and well i thought those graphics are something i could not handle. So when i heard about this game and watched game play of it well i took the chance and bought it. I was not disappointed (Exept for the price). The game is fun to play and the voice acting (aside from a couple of advisors) is awesome. This is one Early access game that was pretty polished when it was released and playable with some things missing but nothing to keep me from enjoying the core game. If you enjoy turn based stratagy like CIv 5 this game is for you.			"

								While still very clearly a work in progress, MoO is providing an excellent, accessible entry into the grand space strategy genre.  There are definitely areas that need improvement, but as this is Early access and Alpha stage at that, some bugs are to be expected.  The game itself is remarkably stable and I've experienced no CTDs or BSODs, which is actually kind of amazing as my PC loves to crash on me.4/5 stars so far.  The look and feel of the game is incredible and the developers have shown a very keen interest in the feedback of their very dedicated fanbase.			"

								So even if I'm the umpteenth one here, I have to say this: I was a HUGE fan of the original Master of Orion 2. First one was a bit before my time, and I picked the second one a few years after it was out, and was absolutely hooked. So much so that I gave Master of Orion 3 more than its share of tries, alas all ending in utter defeat at the hands of bugs and bad gameplay decisions.And..I am absolutely thrilled its descendent through the years is shaping out to be follow in MoO 2's footsteps! I don't know how, but even with this as of yet incomplete version they got the mixture right to keep up you clicking through the night (erm).Now, what many of the reviewers seem to lose sight of is that this is its earliest iteration of early access yet! Many things are obviously not implemented yet - Spying, for instance. Or all 10 races, and race customization. I don't know that Pollution works either. Some placeholders here and there - such as Ground Combat. Etc etc.To my mind it's obvious that many of the things which are not really working right now - such as Diplomacy, or combat AI, or colony management AI - are still in their test phase and extremely likely to be improved upon.Why such optimism? Well, for one, remarkably, the game is polished to look and feel as if it were a finished product. I've not crashed once in about 20 hours of play, and I only ran into a few bugs, fewer of which were important in any way (antimissile rockets module doesn't seem to work, for instance, or maybe it just seemed so to me).And it's good! Everything that looks firmly in place is amazingly good. Such as:Colony management is perfect MoO. Classic, and superb. Research - Food - Production, and Credits. Small to Huge planets, Radiated to Gaia, Low to High gravity, Ultra poor to Abundant, and random resources (gold, fungus, etc) Space expansion, tried and true formula. Worm holes serve as bottlenecks, some of them are unmanageable until high end tech. It does allow you to treck further from the getgo than most 4X games, which I find to be a good thing. Space monsters. Pirate fleets (and bases). ""Anomalies"". RNG events (plagues, population booms etc). Orion and its Guardian! :)The Tech Tree is..wow. As an example, Beam weapons upgrades never go ""+1 dmg"", ""+2 dmg"" etc - each successive variant is different in some way making it a choice - do I go with higher dmg ye olde Neutron Blaster, or do I pack in newfangled lesser dmg overloading Ion Cannon (the Mass Driver does seem too obvious a choice though). Some techs don't yet work (all the Spying tech, for instance) but that's just upcoming :)Ship customization is sweet, and strikes a good balance between complexity and streamlining. Modules with all sorts of variants, various types of weapon mounts (6 types of Beams, 5 for Missiles).. it's good.The one and only thing that does have me worried is Combat. Mostly because I feel like it should already be further along than it is. I don't really have an issue with it not being TBS - in MoO 2 the side who attacked and had 1st turn had a HUGE advantage over the defender - but it's kind of lackluster. The modules and weapon mounts are mostly passive, the battlemap doesn't offer much (there are some formations, and asteroids which can shield from weapon fire) but it's far too little yet. It needs more. Waiting for more.It also tried for a few new ideas here and there, and I find no fault with any of them. Asteroid fields as a planet type, which can house Mine/Research Stations, and be made into planets. By a Worker unit a la the Civ Settler, which can do all sorts of things (mostly space lane turtling though :)) ). Choices between research results (from this researched tech do I take Fusion Beam or Fusion Bomb?) which also give Diplomacy more importance (since you can get the Tech you didn't choose via diplomatic swapping). Pollution which ruin your planet biome type. Etc.One thing I left for the end because it really isn't that important for a Master of Orion game - IT'S BEAUTIFUL! It really is! Diplomacy meetings, GNN, space, ships, combat, colony screen (which features the world on the right, all bustling with scifi activity and ever more sprawling urban complexes). The clips played when you colonize a world (one for each world type) are a balm to the soul :))Tl, dr: it truly is Master of Orion, and while it has some things to implement before getting all the way there, it's far on the path to greatness.

								MOO is one of the games I grew up on. I'm a huge fan and was very excited for this game. MOO2 was a good step up, and MOO3 was another fun step up - when it worked. Pretty much everything in this game is a throwback - in a good way - of the original game. Music, resources, tech trees, etc. They then added on some voice acting and replaced animations with better ones. So - same game, minor changes right?They have changed tech trees. At two hours in I'm not sure how I feel. Psilon was always my race and I liked that one of their perks is that they got everything. That's not so here. You do have to choose. Combat is fun. There's some reviews coming in talking about now liking the new version. Eh. It's not finished yet and they might make tweaks. It would be nice if there was a 'turn by turn only' option. It is nice that you can just skip combat now because previously it could take SO LONG.So far, day 1 of early access I'm shocked at how stable the game is. They have done a good job. We'll have to see how replayability is, but so far very impressed.			"

								The voice acting is nice, the animation of the different races is nice.  I'm looking forward to more races getting added, and also how they design the espionage system.The ships are neat, the buildings are neat.  The way you can block warp gates with military sations is really cool.My only complaint is the thing that MOO2 does better than any other similar game out there (including this one):   In MOO2 you could go to the settings and turn off the end of turn wait.  This way you could essentially fast forward your long construction times and research times.  You can't do that in any modern game because your system has to process enemy turns.  In modern games, the enemy turns take a few seconds to process.  This really slows the pace down...  This game combats that by shortening build times and research times.  (Research now usually takes between 4-8 turns).Also, I would much have preferred turn based ship combat...  All in all, though I won't put in the kind of hours on this game as I did MOO2, it's a solid buy (Though I would really put it's worth at $20 right now.  $49 is overpriced IMO).So, that's my opinion...  If you leave a question for me, I'll try to edit this review to answer that question.			"

								Master of Orion 3 was an abomination. It was not bad because of the features in the game, but because everything they tried to do was implemented absolutely horribly. It took fan patches and mods to even get it to playability. This game has a lot of the feel of Master of Orion 3 that was good, and some of its own that makes it even better. I am about 100 turns into my first game as humans vs 1 bulrathi opponent. So far, the game feels like everything good from both Master of Orion 2, and Master of Orion 3 in one great package.Its still early access, and if you havent played Master of Orion 2 or 3, lets just say that I think this will be worth my fifty dollars.

								I never played the origional MOO but MOO2 is my favorite game of all time. MOO3 on the otherhand, was the greatest dissapointment of a game I have ever played, so my expectations for this game were low.Alot of people on the internet have had their say. They praise the presentation, the voice acting, the little touches of nostalga throughout but they also point out the negatives, which at this point are substantial. Realtime instead of turnbased space combat, the cheesiness, the general lack of polish and the lack of depth compared to other games in the genre (Distant Worlds, Stellaris). That being said, the real question is and remains, is this game worth your time and money?You will have to decide that for yourself, but for me, sofar it is very promising. I got my code for the game from a third party at a discount, so like Charlie Sheen, I feel like I'm winning. The game itself ATM is pretty easy. The AI is hilarious in how glitched it is. It demands nearly every planet in my empire for peace while I'm ROFL stomping all over its fleets and bombing its planets into dust. It is clueless.You may be thinking, ""why would I spend my money for a glitched game that's still in development""? The answer, it's alot better now than MOO3 ever will be because they atleast got the mechanics right. I find it fun to play and am confident that it will get alot better in the coming months and I'am glad I purchased it. To me it's a diamond in the rough that needs to be cut and polished.			"

Early Access Review
								I would definitely recommend this game for a few reasons: 1. Master of Orion is one of my favorite games from back in the day2. This new remastering of the game has similar elements to the first game, but a more fluid movement to all game mechanics3. The mix of nostalgia and a game that could stand on its own is quiet apparent in this game, whether that be due to just game mechanics, such as the announcers, or the new diplomacy options/ more in depth solar systemsHowever, There are a few kinks in the armour, mostly just due to early access:1. The game feels slow;          By this I don't just mean that it is running slowly on my computer, I mean that the fluid movement of the ships, as well as the movement of your screen accross the galaxy can be a little too slow for my liking. On the other hand, zooming out and then back in on the desired position does the trick most of the time2. Some things are a little awkward          The diplomacy responses are too slow and awkward, especially when they say the exact same thing whether or not they like you or not. Another thing that bugs the heck out of me is that the galactic voting mechanism is really slow and almost painstakingly ridiculous if you stay and watch the entire voting process. The awkward silences and then feeling as though you are going to crash out of the game because of the silence just is a major turn off for me. 3. Diplomacy is iffy          If the diplomacy in this game was a little better, I would be completely and utterly in love with this game. However, when you are hostile with humans because you are colonizing too rapidly (Which I already hate that mechanic anyways) and then they agree to trade agreements and eventually alliances with you, it feels a little cheap. The other thing about diplomacy is what are the numeral configurations to why they are upset/happy with me? I get an up or down arrow telling me if i did something right/wrong, but it doesn't say how much each individual thing effects the relationshipAnyways, I hope you guys find this helpful; I don't mean to make it sound like I do no recommend the game, but there are some definate greviances that I have with the game, that will hopefully be fixed in the next few months as the actual game comes out. If you think it is worth the investment, you will spend a lot of time on it and definitely get back what you paid for it. If you wanna wait for the solo game to come out and not just the collector's edition, that will probably be a less problematic experience, that is if you are only in it for the new game. This constructive criticism isn't a knock at the producers, but just the fact of Early Access and that sometimes things just don't work like they are going to in the full game. Hope you guys enjoyed and found this useful. Would probably rate the game(s) as a whole around a 7/10, mostly just due to the bugs of an Early Access game and the above mentioned things. "

								Have been playing the Early Access versions of MoO and have been very satisfied with the game so far. Played the original two MoO's extensively so I would recommend this latest version of the namesake almost completely. The developers have clearly made significant efforts to address any issues that have arisen due to the game being EA(there were not many that I encountered). Actually I would like to offer that the people working on the game have really done a great job. Thanks for keeping all the things I personally enjoyed about the earlier games but keeping things fresh and new while doing so. Its a fun and attention grabbing game that has already had 100+ hours too many!I recommend it to anyone that is/was a Master of Orion fan.			"

												I'm 50/50 about the game, spent around 30 hours on it, and everything is alright, but bland, theres a definate limit with technology, and all races seem to do the same technological path, with only the all too frequent bugs and crashes giving the game variety, Orion is found in the same place every game I've played so far (x5), a star to the left or right, but always bottom left quadrant.     Generally an alright game, thats been let down by too little content. Some new tech that can only be found, not researched, a few more races, extinct civs cities and tech artifacts, more variety in the tech trees and a more intuitive ship building and design section and this would be a very different review, but as it stands? Very average, and in comparison to the other games in this area, such as Galactic Civ 3, overpriced and under finished. Shame, I had high hopes for this.			"

Early Access Review
								This early release is overall very promising, though has a few major issues it needs to iron out in order to be a truly great game. Hopefully the developers are bold enough to make those changes, so far it seems they are. Although it's a tad pricey it does give you the original three games, two of which have been rigged to run on new computers, some bonus features, an extra playable race and it allows you to troubleshoot bugs and make recommendations for alterations to gameplay or new features. So far the developers have kept their word and have tried, mostly successfully, to make changes the players desire. They even went so far as to make an overnight patch so that some players experiencing bugs on certain systems could play the game properly, which shows great promise and dedication. While they were at it they applied a few player-recommended patches and encouraged us to give both positive and negative feedback.As it is about thirty per cent of the game's features are disabled and about half of what is present seriously needs work. Nevertheless in the first update alone there were significant strides in this area, and it was all to a high standard of quality. Sometimes in updates they'll put in slightly whacky or unbalanced features, but it seems to be a deliberate move to guage how players respond and to find out what the majority of gamers strongly desire, as well as to find out what gamers -do not- desire.If you are passionate about the Master of Orion series and want to see Master of Orion 4 be a success, you should seriously consider buying this early release and helping to fund the polishing of this potentially great game, and be able to give feedback that will shape it into something awesome that will be played eagerly for years to come.

								Great game even on this stage of develpment. It is true sequel to MoO2. BTW I am a long time fan of MoO1 and 2 (3 sucks).I love the new system grid and warm holes. Great graphics for a strategy classic sequel.The diplomacy is still broken, hope they improve until the launch.What they fixed is that on MoO2 you were dependant on the luck to find a suitable planet at range to colonize, now it is easier to colonize barren, radiated and other kinds of planet. Plus, the military starts early. It is very good to know the fleet and mosnter strenght before combat. It should have a flee option on the simulate option on combat.I finished the game twice by diplomatic victory. The late game was not that fun, an MoO2 problem too.The AI should consider moving military ships to a system an hostile act and stop doing it unless it wants war, as it should ask if I want war when I do so.MoO2 had special characters, it would be good if they use this on this one too.Right now it is a great game, and every MoO1 and 2 should buy it.I hope they improve a lot this game, until it reaches a uncosntested position as the best 4x space game.At last, I didn't try the multyplayer, and I hope thay playtest it a lot to deliver an outstanding competitive experience.

								For a early access game it feels solid and the game runs smoothly. The Races are interesting and the voice acting and music are unique and enjoyable to listen to. The artwork is beatiful from the universe map to the colonizing video makes you have the extraterrestrial feel when colonizing a new planet (especially when you are the Psilons, I think that is how you spell them.)The one thing I think a lot of people need to understand is this isn't a MOO2 remake. Do not buy this game thinking that they are simply going to remake that game with new graphics. You are going to be disappointed. I do get annoyed when people make a lot of assumptions about games and then get all upset when they find out it isn't the clone of what they expected or they have this nostalgic viewpoint of a game, I call that the spoiled brat syndrome.However I will say the game is simplified in comparison to the older installments and currently there is only 6 races to choose from. I am hoping that the AI is improved quite a bit and the races become more unique in the way they play in the game. I am hoping for more universe based events in the game.Pros:- The game is stable I have not crashed once it plays really smoothly.- Great voice acting from famous Sci Fi actors.- Artwork music and general feel of the game is fantastic.- If you have played modern 4X games before you will easily be able to get right in and play this game.- Planets are unique, terraforming is a lot of fun especially making a gas giants into a huge livable terran world :)- The Tech tree is interesting and it is great that they have the option to auto upgrade your ship designs when new tech gets researched, allowing more casual players to enjoy the game.- I have never laughed so much in a space turn based game when the galactic news reported the end of my population growth event.Cons:- AI needs work, the different race need to work in a more racial way. For example the military races should not be more technologically advanced than the scientific races etc. - Diplomacy needs work, I played the space bears and the only race I could form an alliance with was the humans. No matter what I did the other races viewpoint of my race wouldnt go up. (I may have just not be doing something right)- I think the Tech tree and ship design needs to be more complicated to make it interesting to experienced MOO fans.- More events and havestable areas for your builders (they can only build very few things, hopefully more options become available.)- The battle map needs work, ships phasing through asteroids just breaks the immersion for me and a little bit of control during battle would be nice.- Diplomatic victory is way to easy, all you have to do is have the majority of votes which you can pay off the other races which for me costs 1500 per race. I was actually shocked when the game ended. I thought you would have certain powers to manipulate the galactic community. :-/In conclusion currently MOO is a very stable early access game! A great ground structure to build a interesting and modern installment to the MOO franchise. I can see a lot of place holders throughout the game and certain victory conditions have not been fully fleshed out. They do have a lot of work to do but even though the cost of the game is high I have enjoyed playing the game and supporting the developers. I have high hopes to see where they go with this one.			"

								The game is good.  No, it's not a clone of MOO2.  I have friends that enjoy this game that were MOO2 fanatics.  We all love the game and it's progressing nicely.  Tactical combat is getting better, you can always pause the game and issue orders as well.  Don't expect this game to be MOO2, it's an introduction for a wider audience with beautiful graphics, full voice overs and a pretty amazing amount of work already done.  I loathe reading the negative posts out here.  The game is STILL BEING DEVELOPED AND IS EVER CHANGING.  It's in an early enough stage for hundreds if not thousands of changes to happen.  The DEVS listen to their fan base!  The game is going to rock at some point, have no doubt.  It's already pretty damn good now.  You can scroll through all the other technical posts out there to your hearts content, so I'm just giving my impressions of the state and future of the game.  Most of the haters out there are MOO2 purists.  Nothing wrong with that, but this game isn't MOO2.  If you don't like it, don't bash it, attempt to appreciate the fact that it is a very good game and getting better all the time.  Take it for what it is.  Aside from that, check out Stellaris, launcing Monday May 9th.  It looks amazing, just in a more text driven and less polished way.  Galaxies have 1,000 stars to explore and it might just kill lesser computer systems (even though the engine is old and runs on DX9).  If it's not buggy as♥♥♥♥♥♥ I will pick that one up too.  Then I will have two amazing games in my library.Peace out people			"

								So this review is written with only just under 6 hours in, and 3 games played, so please take this into mind while reading this.The Master of Orion series is considered by most to be one of the first, if not  leaders in galactic 4x game series. There are many paths to victory in games like this, which include conquest, science, and diplomacy. I am not sure if Masters of Orion has wonder or quest victories as of yet, but I would not be surprised to see it patched in later into early access. So just a few things ot be said to have a proper review for you folks. The Positives  Beautiful, simple, and non intrusive graphics allow you to enjoy the game for some of its finer details. The races so far have history, they have culture, and they interact (albeit agressively] differently. Ship design is simple and to the point, something I actually enjoy and endorse. Decisions matter. Making infratructure instead of ships? Well good luck early in, and mid, and late game... xD The Negatives  Sometimes there are tooltips, and sometimes there are not. Little placeholders or blank text still exist but this is to be expected early access. The lack of game pacing options such slow, medium, or fast is kinda saddening. Science pacing would be a nice feaure as well. The lack of other game options such as minor races, galaxy markets, and anomaly quest is kinda saddening, but very bearable. Galaxy options! Give us more control with more sizes, more planets, more anomalies, more adventure. Make it a thing guys, you can do it!This is a con for now but soon to be fixed. Lack of custom races. God I cannot wait for that. Give it to us now! Please!? Ok I will wait *sniff*All things said this game is very enjoyable already, and very well polished. Iv played games that have been out more then a year that dont play as well as this (I am looking at you Galactic Civilizations and StarDrive). I also like the fact that the 50 dollar package is in fact 4 fricking games. The entire series. And people are complaigning about that? Holy crap. Some people huh.			"

								Was actually going to rate this as a thumbs down, but I found myself playing it and actually having some fun. As it stands, I don't think it is worth the price tag, however that is due to it missing a bunch of stuff that is being added like all the missing races. I would like a larger galaxy I think it is way too small, they should add a huge and insane size map where tech and builiding rates drop 2-4x. So in spite of my reservations I think this is fairly well done, some nostalgia and some changes but overall playable and enjoyable.There is a noticable lack of depth in the tech tree which hopefully will change as a tech victory is enabled later on. There is a lack investment in the ship design, in Gal Civ3 & Star Drive 2 you  can spend lots of time in ship design and then cannot wait to try them out against an enemy, not so in this game. Exploration suffers as there is no sense of exploring the final frontier, there are little to nothing yet to discover in exploration other than the occasional weak♥♥♥♥♥♥♥pirate or wierd space monster.

								Just finished my first game.  I played as the Mrrrshan and was able to dominate via technology building and generally staying out of the computer players way during expansion.  It was fun!  I liked the tech tree - I was able to get to titan level ships, class V shields, phasors, battle pods, plus all the supporting economic tools.  I found that my tech rate was outstripping my ability upgrade battleships - most of my cruisers (and smaller ships) were quite capable and easily maintained with every upgrade.  The battleships not so much and I didn't even get a single titan built - started several, but I won by having the votes due to my population being about 3-4x higher than the computer players.  I may have coerced all the other players to vote for me with a yearly annuity of 20 BC (except the #2 sized player).  It played well over steam link with the keyboard and mouse configuration for the steam controller.   I found that a 35"" TV made the text a bit small from across the room.  I eventually finished the game on my PC directly and enjoyed being able to read all the text quite clearly.			"

Instead you are reading a Manuel as thick as your leg trying to figure out how to play. Now it is early access and I won't lie to you it has bugs one that comes to mind is when you destroy a star base every time you go in to a battle seen you will see it blowing up every time. But I am sure that they will fix this in time. But if you hate bugs and don't like early access games then this is not for you.			"

								   Outside of the length of time it takes to load the beginning of a new game (which can be quite lengthy at times). I have found that the game play is smooth, although at times you do get a small lag-time. The game advisor can get a bit tidious an would like to be able to have the option to shut it off. Bravo on the tech tree in giving you options on some techs to learn over others to give you better tech trade options if another race has something you need. Overall I am very happy with the results so far, and look forward to many hours of play, plus can't wait to see what new things will be added to the Masters Of Orion line-up.			"

								Note: This is my first time playing a 4X game Pros:+Extremely easy to pick up and play+Plenty of unique races+Art style has it's own charm+Great way to burn a whole day+Currently in active development by WGCons-AI is terrible in declaring war/combat/diplomacy/colonization/ship design AI will sometimes declare war on you but never move thier massive fleet in until 30 turns later AI is terrible @ Diplomacy they make stupid demands (IE I want 4 of your colonies and 1/3 of your treasury for free) AI seems unable to terraform any of their planets at this time which is fortunate as they seem to ALWAYS spawn with amazing planets (I always play human) AI still seem to only colonize 1 planet at a time even when they obviously have more than enough resources to colonize multiple planets at once AI seems to stop colonizing after thier population reachs a certain threshold (I had a 2000+ turn game the AI Pop never went above 450) AI can't design ships to save thier empires worth a damn ... in the mid to end game I can litterally kill a AI super fleet (4 battle ships, 30+ cruisers,40+Destroyers,30+Frigates) with 2 to 4 titan class ships (ship auto design system is abysmal)Planet Spawning Issues/Management issues I haven't played multiplayer but it seems that when I play human I RARELY get any good planets spawned next to me yet when I share charts with the AI I can quite clearly see they get a polethera of class B planets near thier home planet PLEASE FIX THIS  The auto build function doesn't build colonies effeciently AT ALL it flat out sucks as it build litteraly everything in a horrible order choice Leaving your colonies on manual is a great way to loose allocation points as the game seems to keep throwing colonists on ONE particular resource and if it over flows those colonists some how disappear into the ether ... PLEASE FIXCOMBAT needs Optimizations I can't tell if it's just because the game runs on DX9 but this game seems to coke my computer to death when there are more than a couple dozen objects on the screen (Running on a I7 4710MQ w/ 970M) I have a gut feeling that this aspect with never change but any optimaztions would be nice Tech tree is meh- Everyone gets the same tech so in the end game everyone would have the same amount of firepower it would be nice to see some diversityWhile I've bled much of my free time into this game ... the more I've played it the more I realized there's alot more to be done to fix it.

								So i've had this game for a few days now and ive played through 4 games. I love this type of game and am very happy to have it. If you enjoyed Endless Space you will like this game. Just keep in mind that this game is in early access so not everything will be implemented correctly or fully. I will keep my review to things that arent affected by EA. The art style is very cool, and the tactical real time space battles are pretty awesome. would love to see real time land battles in an expansion pack eventually. The space lanes implementation is really fun and allows for strategic bottlenecking of enemies but I wouldn't be opposed to the possibiity to make them redundant with late or mid game tech research. I would most definately like to see an end to tutorial pop ups as they can get really annoying the more you play and learn the game. also i think a diplomatic feature that allows you to pressure another faction to make peace with a third party would be fantastic. Also alliances should have a similar feature so that you can make your allies, allies with each other. TLDNRoverall I would recommend you buy this game only if you are patient enough to make it through the EA, as there are still many things that either need implementation or correction.			"

												After receiving a 22% helpful rating based on my original review I've decided to attempt a proper review;As you're probably well aware the latest incarnation of Masters of Orion is what is commonly called a 4X game. eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate.When you start a new game there are a myriad of options when 'creating' a new galaxy within which to play. Be it a large galaxy, small, how many empires inhabitat said galaxy, which species they are, game speed and other options besides. Meaning you can setup an epoch spanning game that could easily lasts days or weeks (it seems) to games that perhaps take a mere afternoon. I'd have to spend some more time with the varying settings to give you more details on this.As your sweaty little fingers eagerly click your abused mouse button, with it's cursor hovering over the start game tab you'll find yourself transported to your galaxy and a single planet. From here you will manage your population putting them to work in the food industry, manufacturing plants and labs. Managing your output of food, construction of buildings and space ships and research into new technologies.You'll eventually send scoutships out to discover new systems full of juicy (or not so juicy) planets to explore and perhaps even colonize. When you colonize your new planets you'll have to carefully manage their early years, it helps to buy (automatically receive) automated construction factories, biomes and indoor farming to help your colonists thrive and build newer structures quicker, increasing your population size and therefore food construction and research speed, eventual increase in taxes with government buildings and tradeports and increasing your fleet size with starbases.Some planets have negative effects, such as high or low gravity, toxicity, barren, gas giant or asteroid. Eventually you will unlock techs to change all of the above into habital planets or at least more appealing to your average space colonist.Diplomacy seems to work well, in as far as I've experienced it on my singular game I'm still going through. I don't attack the marlocks, (or whatever the hell they are) and we trade technologies and set up trade between us increasing our monies.What does annoy me though is that when it comes to espionage in order to put an agent on an enemy planet you need to have visited it first whereas my friendly foe has no problems with this, having made sure their ships never entered my space in a couple of rather more violent forms of diplomacy. Yet they still have agents on all of my planets. Perhaps this is a racial perk as their faction is the espionage specialists. But still, it annoys me.The space battles themselves are a bit... Meh. Still, better than most space battles I've witnessed in other 4X games.Despite my lack of conversing with all of the races within the game, I rather like the characters I've seen so far and the 'Global News Network' droids that tell you everything you need to know about the galaxy in a fairly amusing manner and occasionally some helpful news too. Such as detailing the top three races in colonization, population, military etc. The most recents news story was several cips about a star about to go supernova. You'll be pleased to know that on the brink of disaster the weird turtle people managed to save themselves and stop the star going supernova.Overall, probably my favourite 4X game. It's relatively complex and yet VERY streamlined. Fans of the genre should enjoy this.If you don't find this review helpful go play with a chickens♥♥♥♥♥♥-My original review;I like it.			"

Early Access Review
								I am a big fan of oldschool games like MOO1 & 2, or like Masters of Magic. I have played them when i was a kid before i even heard about the Internet. Playing MOO2 in HotSeat with your friends had a certain feeling (old gamers know what i mean). Many of those games have had newer versions / remakes and many of them were bad.I read many reviews about this game and lots of players found this game to be a total catastrophe. So being a MOO fan i wanted to see it for myself. I bought the game, played it for a few days and i can tell you that it is a good game and it's far to being a catastrophic game. Now before you start yelling and throwing vegetables at me, let me explain why i find this game to be good rather than bad. Don't get me wrong, the game has its flaws and i will try to point the essential pros and cons.Pros+ The gameplay has that MOO2 feeling and you can play a single game for days without getting bored.+ Random map generator is good - it does exactly what is supposed to do. Many games fail at having a good RMG but not this one.+ Planet building and ship designs are good.+ Research - everything from the old game is here.+Space combat is good. I see the opinions are devided here if the game must have a turned based combat or not. Believe it or not, it will not matter in the end as it didn't in the old game neither. If your adversary has a better technology, he will beat the crap out of you either if it is turned based, real time or an Endless Space similar combat tactic. It's not a big deal, i myself prefer turned based combat but really i'm not that sad about it.Cons- Racial Perks.In my opinion this is by far the most important thing the developers should not have ""touched"". This is the bad side of the game and i want to clarify it in more detail. I will give some examples of the most important traits in the game that have been drastically altered:CreativeBefore - Researching a tree level gives you ALL the technology of that level!Now - it now gives 25% research bonus.Anyone thinking ""it's not that bad""? Let me tell you when you have to choose between Hyper Drive, Plasma Beam and Hyper-X Capacitators you will have the feeling you shot yourself in the head no matter the choice for leaving the other 2 behind. This is just an example and my first feeling was to uninstall the game - that's how bad i think this is!TolerantBefore- No pollution and zero maintenance for toxic, radiated and desert planets.Now - no penalty for LowG or HighG.Practically you can easily colonize and maintain any planet now. Guess what - so will the AI who will now try to colonize EVERY single planet on the map and will make this his main objective! It will even colonize planets in your home system if it's not defended.I played (and still do) only Custom Race. The combination i loved to play had Lithovore and Creative perks. Sometime i chose Tolerant instead of Creative. For those who don't know what Lithovore does - it eliminates your race's need to eat food (i think they eat rocks or something similar) therefore you can have you population go into scientits, workers or both. Lithovore has not been changed (thank you God).I don't know how many of you realize but these traits have been the absolute core of the old MOO. Developers please tell me why did you alter these traits so drastically? I did not mention but some of the old traits don't even exist anymore. Why is that? Does this have a logic behind it? Did you test the original traits and found out that the gameplay was bad? Can you please explain this to me as a gamer and a client who bought  ""what must be"" a superb game? Cause i cannot understand a bit. You created a great game and took away it's most beautiful thing. Leaving the original racial traits untouched felt like giving away something out of your wallet? Does it feel like donating one of your organs? Do you at least consider implementing them in the future? If not for the whole game, then at least for the single player mode?All that being said (except for some minor bugs) the game is good. If the developers will ""repair"" the racial traits then i recommend you to buy it. You can easily see that it was a tremendous work behind this game. I think it's very close to being one the best remakes anyone ever did with a classic game.Score 7/10Thank you!			"

								Yes, this is not MOO1 or MOO2 (i prefer MOO1, but understand, that classic is MOO2). But i strongly recommend this game, cause almost everything is done right with modern twist. Just a few ""-"" here:1. For my taste, graphics and overall art style is atrocious. Candy colored cartoonish models. At least at this MOO3 was way better.2. Real time combat is BAD. Zero tactics. MOO2 combat, imho, was great, why they choose to change it?3. Autobuild on planet is stupid. You have automated factories, this dumb AI start to build barracks.Don't get me wrong, even with some ""-"", this game is a breath of fresh air.			"

								A lot of the reviews have been focusing on aspects that have to do with the challenge of the game.  Frankly, what made MoO2 a great game, was never the challenge and balance of the game.  The game was always super easy when you made a custom race.  What made MoO2 fun was how the elments of the game were presented.  Having all the choices to make a custom race was great (even though there were a select few optimal traits).  It was just fun to learn the game mechanics and create a glorious space empire.  Sure, MoO2 had things that we not so fun, like the fact that the Gaurdians were so tough that colonizing that sweet sweet planet known as Orion was almost pointless.  (unfortunately the reboot still makes that mistake),  but this game has almost all the building blocks that made MoO2 so much fun and I expect to see a great product by the time they get done with it. To the developers I would recommend two things:  Please implement the governors and fleet captains from MoO2!  And don't overbalance the single player game too much, just implement a scoring system and ""balance"" that (giving bonuses to score for harder racial picks)I think the game was a little pricey at $50 (because it's not finished), but the $30 final price tag is definitely on target!  Pick it up early if you're a fan of the classic games and to have that MoO2 itch scratched right away :)			"

												The new Master of Orion fails to be as good as MOO II due to two critical failures. First, there is much time wasted in this version as you watch things you don't care about. MOO II, for the most part, never slowed the game down for pointless reasons. This incarnation has sector exploring, which really slows the game down without adding anything. Maneuvering in sectors, watching EM messages. Second, the game develops much slower than MOO II. In MOO II, you would start skirmishes in half an hour of play. Nothing interesting (except getting crushed by space monsters) happens in the 2017 version for much longer. Graphically, it looks nicer. But as with many other games, substance has given way to flash.			"

								When I found out the Collector's Edition was out, I instantly purchased it. As a long time fan of 4X strategy games, and Master of Orion veteran, I walked into this with high expectations. That being said, I also understand this is a work in progress. There is still plenty to be implemented, and I generally agree with the direction the game is going in. From its earliest version, to the current, Master of Orion delivers an unparallelled experience. One, that I may add, was what I was hoping to see in Galacitic Civilizations III. I did not.So I recommend Master of Orion to any experienced player, to those new to the series, as long as the individual in question understands that this is a work in progress. You may like it, you may not. However, we are at the stage where our input can help improve the game so that everyone may like it.			"

								Having read the reviews, and bearing in mind the awful third Master of Orion game, I decided to have a go at this one. Mixed reviews didn't bother me too much, I primarily purchased the package as the first two games were bundled in there as well as the third and latest one. I loaded up with a sense of cautious optimism - and I wasn't disappointed.For an early access game I personally think it's very good. OK, some areas are a bit bare bones but it's more than fleshed out enough to pass as a decent entry, but with the continued development I'm confident this will mark a return to form for the series.It is as addictive a game as I have played in ages - I still play MOO1 and MOO2 from time to time and get hooked, and I have a feeling this one will be no different. It harkens back to the early days, taking some of the best bits from the first two games particularly but with a much more updated feel.I won't go into too much detail on this review as I've only managed a few short hours with the game so far but I have to say it is progressing nicely, and with some of the new features we have been promised as well as all the creative ideas being put to the developers I've got a funny feeling this game could end up as fondly remembered as MOO2, if not potentially more so.

								After the disaster that was MoO3, this is a very welcome addition to the Master of Orion series.  It isn't a clone of MoO2, which will upset some people.  Things are altered, removed and added.  Don't let the idea that things are changed or removed make you think that depth has been diminished.  People's nostalgia for MoO2 will probably cause some negative feedback for this game, as they see any alteration as heresy.  However, this game is going in the right direction.  Things are being added, adjusted and reworked to get the correct balance of old and new.  There are numerous races, which are becoming increasingly distinct as the developers progress.  The tech tree is more akin to the Civilization series than the distinct and entirely seperate branches of pervious MoO games, but it works well.  The combat is real time, but the developers have been listening to the userbase and have added the ability to pause, and various options to make the game not feel like a click heavy rts.  The developers have been top notch, working with and listening to the community.  They clearly love the property and want to make a great game that will appeal to both the newcomer and to Master of Orion veterans.  That is not an easy line to walk when there is so much love (and for such a long time) for a previous entry to a series.  Definitely worth a try.  Definitely worthy of the acclaimed Master of Orion series.   But please go into the game without the blinkers of demanding a clone of MoO2.			"

Master of Orion Co-op Multiplayer Gameplay - EP1 
A Video of Master of Orion
By: IDED

			IDED and Mal try out Master of Orion Multiplayer Co-op gameplay on the new Master of Orion conquer the stars (2016). In this co-op gameplay video you will get to see this classic reboot of the 2nd Master of Orion game...		


As you can see from the above video the game looks very nice in 1080p with a easy to handle ui.There are a few elements that might not be obvious when starting out as fleet movement does happen automatically at the end of the turn but you can move it during the turn manually.The voice acting is great as you would imagine given the all star cast hired for this title.Gameplay seems quite addictive but that could just be that new game feeling we all get after downloading a game you just purchased but so far it seems worth the price put on it.Pros- Game is reasonably quick to pick up and play.- Looks good and plays well even on max settings.- The game has a lot of depth of gameplay and tech with enough species to play as to make it rewarding to play again and again.- Even with the depth a noob like me can still quite easily get their head around the mechanics and play and have a chance of winning but I guess this is also a con due to it meaning more experienced players will find the game a push over.- Customize your fleet the way you want it with tech you unlock as you play.- With no prior knowledge of the game you will come to it without hang ups thus accepting it for what it is rather than what it isn't.- No unskippable cut scenesCons- Walking away from a game and coming back to it can be daunting as trying to establish what you were up to even a day or so later is a hell of a thing to do.- The tactical battle simulations seem slow and hard to watch in or out of cinematic view.- Ai seems quite simple currently and does not offer a lot of challenge on its standard setting.- There is no woarning that making some choices with one race will automatically disable those same options with others even if you reverse them later.- People who played the game previously have told me its lacking in a few respects comparred to their nostalgic view of the second game.10/10 would jump into a series on the 4th installment again :P			"

								MoO conquer the stars - is a quite interesting successor of well known Master of Orion series. While other games allready tried to claim that title, wargaming bought the whole frenchise and hired some of the old programmers to get best results. First of all, I do not mind getting battles real-time in this version. Some other successors allready did...and did well with this decission. You may take a look on Star Drive 2 about that. I really guess it wasn't an easy decission for wargaming, but by targeting multiplayer for final challenge, there simply wasn't any other choice. Just think about a single battle lasting 20min while 4-6 other players just sit and watch empty screen...then you'd more likely accept RT battle system. Well, if they deliver a turn-based system exclusively for singleplayer later, it would be perfect. Game is well made, no greater bugs or broken mechanics so far. It is still Early Access, which means, game and content will certainly undertake massive changes till release. As for my personal rating, it is ok. It is fun to play and explore the game, while I rate 45€ for an EA quite ambitious. ^^ If you could get it on sale or could grab you a key from other store price should be more balanced. Something near half the current price I'd give it a go.Only thing I recognized to be a bit disturbing so far is steady ship-design upgrade after researching new tech. Quite nice automation, but that might switch your personal designs deeply, so be prepared to re-visit ship designer every now and then for control. Still not found all tech, but looking forward to get lot of fun till I reach my goal.**EA2 patch**New update brought 2+1 new empires. Klackons, Mekklars and another human (Terran) for early access buyers. Also you could design your very own custom version of given empires. Research is a bit delayed now, which is great as it was too easy to get through the whole research plan on the run. Single technical steps do get more weight and enhances gameplay. Some slight changes in options allows more customization...like starting battles on pause and else. AI seems to be enhanced...not yet tried on hard mode...looking forward. Best thing is plenty of written localizations, so everybody could play game in his favorite language. Advisors speaking still in english or russion of course.All in all stable and fun. Still early access, but all things point in promising direction.			"

After seeing the negativity, I was surprised to find out how much fun the game is!  The interface is slick and easy, and that's a big deal in a 4x game.  If you're going to spend hundreds of hours playing, the UX has to be good.  And it processes turns super fast.I'm glad I bought it and ignored the sourpuss reviews.  It's pretty funny to see people saying how horrible the game is, then you see that they have hundreds of hours playing!  Really?!?

												I am and always will be a huge fan of MOO and Moo2.      This is not either of those, although enjoyable in its own way, key aspects of the game are missing or not thought of at all.      Items such as, invade and conquer being a way to steal technologies.    One would think you would find the odd plasma rifle or personal shield laying around after you kill your enemy.     Secondly, the space combat has almost NO elements of the original game in it.    Yes its ""real time"" big deal.    The original and the original sequel were best because each ship could be controlled to an enth degree.      Also what ever happened to Ship to Ship marine fights?     One of the best aspects of MOO 2 was the ability to take over the enemies ship with transporters and scrap the ship later to get key tech.     Seriously????  Did these guys play the game at any length other than on the easy setting.    All in all an OK game, but it needs more refinment.			"

								Excellent spiritual successor to MOO2 but not very groundbreaking. Exactly what most people probably would have wanted if they loved MOO2Most of the tech from MOO2 is there, but the tree is a bit harder to understand. The interface is improved in some ways and worse in others, but not painfully so, just weird and needs some polish.The combat is in real time but it doesn't feel like that adds very much, or it's just me. I just kind of let the computer handle the fleet movement because at the start of each battle the ships are just placed based on some internal game logic, so you have little control there.The ships are beautiful though and the first time you field a titan feels pretty awesome.Needs  a little more variation in some of the dialogue or else it becomes annoying (The psilon guy's comment after EVERY SINGLE RESEARCH ITEM COMPLETION is the same annoying phrase, I stopped wanting to research new things!). But it's in early access so what are you gonna do?Seriously, it's every MOO game out there plus an early access beta that's decently playable for under $50. If you like 4x like at all what are you still reading for go buy it dummy.			"

												I'm somewhat new to the 4X genre, I don't play alot of these games and never played the previous Master of Orion games.  If you're looking for a polished and accessible 4X space strategy, this one fits the bill although the content of this game is somewhat limited for $30, it's more like a $20 game.  There's no campaign and no ship designer.  I will go ahead and recommend it because as I said it's polished and is accessible someone like me.  Also, you may want to check out Galactic Civilizations 3, which I recently purchased as well but I believe the learning curve on that one is a bit higher.  This is probably a good one to start with before moving onto more complex 4x space strategy games.			"

								I've been a  long time fan of Moo2 and 4x  games in general. I really think they hit the nail on the head with this one. Using star lanes  means you can actually set up a defensive perimeter around your area.  Ship design and  combat is good and the way it works has done away with the late game combat tedium that I used to dread. Tech tree is pretty good  and it does hearken back to MOO2 where you sometimes have to choose between techs. (there's no creative trait). The only doenside of the tech tree is that it is too finely granulated. I think they should combine some and just make cost more tech.The AI can use some work but it's still early release. I suspect they'll work on that. As it is I'm playing on the higest difficulty witht the largest galaxy with al the races  and, while it took me some time I've  managed to outpace every civilization pretty easily. I'm playing with a custom race so that might have something to do with it.Races are fairly well balanced and I can see all of them being useful (still waiting on spying mechaism and some of the missing races) and they , sort of , off set the custom race advantage by giving pre-built race a 10-20 point bonus. Still custom races are very powerful (This game I'm using +50% production, +25% research and -20% ship cost and an disadvantage of -25% ground combat. Last game I swapped production and research).The ship design is decent, you can't add or modify every flap or wing but you choose the load out (although there's no reason to not go for the best ""systems"" other than production time). Right now beams are at a high disadvantage, it's go missiles or go home (which also means that races with beam advantage aren't as  strong right now). Even at the later stages of the game there's a reason to build small frigates (I load them down with a couple of torpedoes and some engine mods  and they can basically take out strong opponents while keeping out of range). Best is to keep a mix of sizes...Also, you can only have one doomstarCombat is Real-Time-with-Pause (and speedup) which works beautifully. I know M002 purists will hate this but it really does work better. the turn base design of M002 worked for that game but was mostly a constraint of the systems it rain on. There's no more multiple hour slog through combat (literally the thing I remember most about moo2)There's a couple of galaxy offerings: Ring which is just a collection of stars with connections to nearby stars and spiral. Spiral is interesting in tha tyou start in the arms of the galaxy with mostly awful planets (That play through I went through with the klackons which start out with a poor planet- mistake)) You have to research enough tech to get into the center of the galaxy where nearly every planet is awesome. This makes tech more important because if you can get in there and colonize before your neighbors they can never catch up.It's still early release and it needs some polish and balancing. Also I'd like some abilities to set up some stuff automatically (e.g.when you reach max population build a civil transport and go do either pre-designated planet or the planet with the biggest need for population).

Early Access Review
								Review Reboot.  I like the general direction the game is taking.  The AI is not very challangeing yet but still fairly enjoyable early on.  I like the idea of NPC minor civs but they dont seem to do much yet other than to give me 40 to 70 credits upon killing nearby pirate ships and bases.  They are yet to offer any mission/quest other than to ask for a single tech early on.  Combat seems to be a little better other than the occasional freeze or CTD following the combat after action report during transition to main screen.  The ship build/refit changes took some getting use to.  They are not very smooth and the way systems are presented in the new drop down menu is muddy and a pain to work with.  The previouse version of ship fitting was more intuitive and smoother.  You should link the ship slot with the systems capable of inhabiting them so the process would go a little more smooth.  By the late game the dropdown menu is way too populated and there is no rhyme or reason to the order they are listed even after choosing a single class of system. There was little gained from the refit changes and in several respects it is less efficient.  First do no harm...then...  Non-gated travel, going off the beaten path, should be an option for later propultion techs.  I liked this ability in other MOO games. I agree with some others, Antarans should be brought back as slap-back ""regulators"" focusing on mega civs that progress too quickly.  Someone else mentioned the late game economy, and yes I have a game going where I can buy titans every oher turn, not realistic.  Maybe consider a cap on purchasable construction points on capitol ships.  I mean really, the parts still have to be fabricated and assembled.  Maybe cap capitol ship purchase to 75% of total.  I still dont see anything about fighters and bombers that make me want to include them in design.  They really seem to be useless at this point.  They add nothing to overall combat points in practice. I want to build a carrier variuent but dont see the point yet.  Anyway, keep up the good work.  So stoked that MOO is reborn.			"

												First of all I'd like to point out, that this review isn't meant to be completly negative. I think Wargame is on a good way to create a appropriate follower. I'll personaly change it to thumbs up, if Wargame consider some very simple changements.I played the old Microprose Game Title and I was addicted.Here my Pros and Contras for a Game which is really nearby Master of Orion 2, but which is not able to beat the old Masterpiece:+ Interface looks nice and polished, the most menus were kept.+ Game looking beautiful now+ Basic Diplomacy (except of little changements) were kept. I was so lucky about that!!!+ You are still playing on a Galaxy map which looks familiar to the good old one.+ You'll have the oppurtunity to cutomize your race!! Thumbs up for this.+ You are still able to design your ship and Equip it with special systems and Weapons.+ The most of the buidlings are quit the same as in MOO2, except of some new buildings. I cannot really give a good feedback to them yet.+ All old races have been considered+ Early Access works without any crashes, MP wasnt tested yet.+ You'll have now the oppurtunity to upgrade your ships (Blueprint and ships which are at colonies) immediately after absolving the research project. Nice!+ You are having now several Victory conditions (similar to Civ Games). Score, Conquest or be eleceted at the council of the galaxy.+ GNN are great!Now the Cons:- Colony Management changed a bit, not much. I still prefer the Management of MOO2 and the handling, which was much better and easier in 1990!!!!- I really tried to like the new ""tactictal"" combat. Instead of the old MOO2 it's not turn based anymore. It's now real time strategy, which looks and feels a bit too simple. On the one hand you'll save more time during the combats, which is basicly good for MP sessions. And you'll notice your special systems and weapons from you designs. On the other hand, you feel a bit helpless. Because even if you gave an order, the ships are going to attack automaticly, all ship categories are gathered to a group, you cant select a single ship. Then, you are not able to create real tacticts like in MOO2. Where you maybe activate or deactivate weapons and systems, because you was waiting for the right moment to use them. So, I'm still not sure, the only thing I know that it hasn't satisified me. Good thing: It looks beautiful and for a ""Wargame"" there is a lot of action, nice feature is the action cam ;))- Ground combat = sucks! Completly unspectacular, uggly without any action or sth. Wargame....are you serious? Hope you're going to improve this one.- The baddest thing is, that every game you are going to start is limited to 500 turns. Yeah, you are right WTF???? Why you guys are going to set a limit for the game? PLEASE WARGAME JUST SET THIS ONE OPTIONAL!!! WE SHOULD HAVE THE DECISION!!!- Okay, it's early access at the moment, but the game felt a bit too easy and a bit more to fast than MOO2. I played the Bulrathi empire and I've been very rich (very quickly I have to say) and I haven't less technologies than the Psilons had. And, I just had 3 colonies the Psilons had 8!!! Everybody who played the old MOO2, knows that this would quite impossible then =). Even If I fought against them, we had the same technology. They usually should be very strong when they having 8 colonies. Old players will know what I mean.However, I like the game anyway. But, as long if the cons will be exsists, I cannot give it a thumb up. Wargame, well done for now, you are almost nearby finish a very good follower! Please don't ♥♥♥♥ one of the best Gameplays ever been created in history of PC-Games.Hope that was helpful for all of ya out there in the stars =P.FINAL REVIEW: GAME =♥♥♥♥♥			"

								Keeping in mind that this is early access, I really like this game already. I never played the original games so I don't really care about the changes as long as this game is fun. It seems most of the negative reviews are coming from fans of the originals and I can understand, but I judge the game as is without the nostalgia baggage.  The game has a polished look and feel to it but it is also missing a lot of features and depth (AI should be better, diplomacy is not great and the game is way to easy). They really nailed the UI and design of the overall game. Some minor bugs with numbers and text, but that is to be expected. I really hope this game will be fully fleshed out and I hope it will be a great game. Normally I dislike EA and almost never participate, but after watching some youtubers play this game I was swayed and don't regret it.It already is fun, but it needs more work to become a great game. I am optimistic.			"

								The new Master of Orion is a good game. The graphics are excellent. The tech tree is well thought out. The interactions with the other alien species is very good. I enjoy plaing it. There are, however, some things I would like to see in the game. 1. The copy that I have does not have all the races in it. The last four ones are blocked for some reason. (I would also like to see the Elerians in it).  2. I cannot seem to access the racial improvement list - that is - the custom means of designing one's own race is not available. 3. The automatic design of ships when a new tech is discovered seems to change all of a ship's design, and not simply the improvement made. If I, for example, had an armor upgrade because of a newly discovered tech, then the upgrade would change my fusion beams to mass drivers, for example. 4. For some reason i can only play on the ""Average"" difficulty level. 5. Finally, the maps need to be more diverse. I have played the same map 3 or 4 times now, and it starts to get pedantic. Keep up the good work! Rob			"

Early Access Review
								Second Update EA Version 2:Short version:The game is shallow in its current state and doesn't even come close to MoO2. I can't recommend it as it is now. I hate how the starlanes system has been implemented.The longer version:I've completed one match through a council victory after about 8 hours. Now in the second EA phase I'm in an active campaign on hard as Terran. I've got to my breaking point in terms of frustration with the game.First of all let me say that visuals look nice and the performance is pretty good. The controls and UI work for the most part, but some things are still bugged (it's an early version),Research:From what I've seen the research system is not to bad. It's actually working pretty well even though it has been moved closer to what Civilzation does. A different approach would've been more interesting. Most technologies provide you with several unlocks to improve your empire. Sometimes however you have to make choices. This is always where it gets interesting. Do I take the faster ships or do I go for the better bombs for example? At the moment the spy system has not been implemented so your choices matter even more if you're not creative.Diplomacy:The diplomacy system is weak. I've made a few deals with the AI, but at a certain point when you start expanding and growing. Trade agreements are extremely weird. You first have to pay a pretty hefty sum only to have an increased income per turn for a limited number of turns. Due to the high initial sum I actually have my doubts that it brings in much profit. Why not have a penalty per turn in the beginning and the longer it runs the better it pays until the agreement is cancelled? It worked much better in MoO2. In addition the AI is just insanely arrogant. In my last game even on neutral ground every single race always demanded every BC I had plus 10-20 BC per turn and one of my best planets as compensation. It just doesn't make any sense. When in the beginning it was possible to do agreements after about 100 turns everything went completely nuts. I only had one race I had ""decent"" relations and with them I made an alliance. But even they demanded these stupid compensations for fair trades like technology exchanges. Oh and lets not forget the unreasonable demands like ""give us 512 BCs and your great planet that is extremely far away from our empire"". And they get angry when I refuse? Ship Design:The things I completely hate are the ship design system and the combat. I have no idea what they were thinking when they designed that. Every ship type has a predefined number of slots. The engine, armor, shields and targeting computer is almost the same as in the old games. However the weapons and special systems are a pain to handle. When you implement a new weapon system the numbers are extremely confusing. Sometimes the dps is lower but the overall attack is higher. Changing a weapon to heavy doesn't even change the dps and usually lowers the overall attack value compared to standard weapons. In the end I've only used standard weapons and ignored the upgrades and my ships where always superior to any AI ship. Btw. whenever you research new technology for ships the game always tries to upgrade all of you existing designs. But it doesn't really tell you what exactly the change does. It increases or lowers the building price and provides some icons on what appears to be upgrades, but the auto upgrade usually made the ships worse and I always had to fix the setup afterwards.Tactical Combat:The combat system is just there. You have barely any influence on what happens during the combat. You see your ships flying in. You then start in Pause mode in which you can assign a target. However you can't specify what weapons you'll use or how specials are used. You can change the formation, but even that system is implemented poorly. In addition I can't control single ships to pull the damaged ships back. If I select one ship and issue a command, the others do the same. Also the AI does an awfull job with firing and targeting. Hey look my ships have frontal assault weapons. What do we do? Park the ships in a way so they can't fire. So in short the combat system is complete c*** even with the most recent upgrades. Also it's funny how a fleet with a much higher military rating (120.000 vs enemy 80.000) gets completely obliterated. The best thing at the moment pretty much is to simply simulate the combat and just wait for the result. It's more likely to have a good result compared to the so called ""tactical combat"" anyway.Travel:Let's talk about the most controversal topic => starlanes. In general I don't really like the idea behind starlanes but I could get behind it if was implemented in a good way. Well, it isn't! The current travel system makes travel sloooooooooow. Let's say you want to go from system a to system b and you have 2 systems in between. Even with the best engines in this case travel time will be at least 5 turns. Why? Well let me explain the route your ship will take:1. Turn => Move from start point to jump point2. Turn => move to next system3. Turn => move to next jump point4. Turn => Move to next system5. Turn => Move to target locationThis is only with two systems in between. The bigger your empire gets the more systems you have in between and even with the best engines it's possible to have 2-3 turns when traveling between two connected systems. The Stargates help a bit, but you have to consider where you place them because they are pretty expensive (5BC per turn/gate on hard).A much better implementation would have been if your ships have a certain distance they can travel each turn and it doesn't matter whether you enter a system or move between jump points.Other Stuff:Planet leaders / ship captains are gone. Your ships do not gain any XP neither. So it doesn't matter how many battles your fleet does, the crews do not get better at their job. It's all narrowed down to technology. Whenever you get something new and shiny you should have enough credits available. Upgrading ships has been moved closer to civilization. All upgrades are instantanious and are just costing money.What else is there? Well GNN is annoying. The news themselves are giving you a bit of information around how you are doing, but holy **** the talking of the robots is awful. The voice over has to be redone for this or remove it. It's neither funny nor entertaining. It just makes my eyes roll whenever I hear it. I haven't seen anything from the Antarans or other ancient aliens yet. There was some hint to it in the GNN news, but it's probably not in the game yet if it is there at all.Btw. we now also have barbarians....I mean pirates in the game. They are just there to annoy you. They can have their own little pirate outposts that provide you with money/population upon destruction. Again it's very similar to Civilization which seems to be the overall problem this game has. It tries to be Civ in space.I just don't understand why it seems to be so difficult to take games like MoO or MoO2, look at what both games had and then build on it. Why reinvent the wheel when it was working fine 20 years ago? There is still time to improve aspects of this new MoO, but as it is now I can't recommend it. The EA phase 2 update hasn't changed my opinion one bit.			"

Early Access Review
I have played several hours, 4 complete play throughs, each with a different race and a different EA phase. Many of the Negative reviews below are quite accurate. The Tech tree is lacklust and has you choose between a temporary boost which will become useless in a few turns or a long term one. One that won't even be used anyway because the benefits don't really show up in combat. Combat is a hit or miss, most of the time. I have just seen the AI smash me with frigates (early/mid game) and Destroyers (mid/late game). I copied the AI and discovered the trick to fleet management. 1 or 2 large ships for show and brute force, and have them follow with dozens of destroyers to take the damage while the big ships crank out damage. Replace the destroyers in a few turns and get them back in the fight. A super fleet with only big ships will be worn out and will take way too long to replace. Unless you have cash to just buy it out. The best weapon is the missle and anything else really is a waste of time. The games PD does not seem to work very well. All of the PD weapons are stacked and thus fire as one, essentially firing on one missle, allowing missles that could have been fired on to hit your ship. This may have been fixed in EA3 but I keep getting bugs that rendered the game unenjoyable for me. The AI lacks any real flare and is quite boring and really just stands as a speed bump to Victory.The game does not have a feel for an epic space tale. It feels more like a game for competition/tournaments. The only thing that makes the game hours long is that it is turn based which it does not even need to be.			"

												tl tr: Won't recommend this game in its current state.After playing 80+ hours in this game I'm changing my review from positive to negative. Since many people are complaining about DLC is not given for free, game not that ""good"" as original MOO1 or 2, or some minor things most players are do not care about... to those I just want to say: You guys making things even worse. By killing game with worthless negative reviews you won't do any good except stop or slowdown development process. No one in the right mind will continue to invest money in development of the game that continuously rated negative by gamers community. Any game is a product and any product created to get a profit. However, despite my attempt to shield the game from negative reviews I have to give negative rating to this game myself. Unfortunately 80 hours of in-game experience reveled overwhelmed number of issues. I just can not recommend something that simply does not work and annoy me instead of helping relax and enjoy spent time. From top of my memory:  After 500+ turns game simply becomes unplayable. There is untold rule that most players seems to be aware of: more time spent slower game becomes. In my experience after 650 turns game starting crashing every next dozen turns.  On macOS there is no way to switch back to the Desktop without quitting game first. This leads to another problem: If game becomes non responsive (happens quite often) user has only one option - hard reboot of the system.  I personally see no difference of enemy AI behaviour between Normal and Hard game difficulty levels. But generally everything what AI controls is source of annoyance. Your scouts on auto-explore will fly right to the system with pirate/enemy ships. While your empire has negative income auto-build on your planets will build structures that requires maintenance fee instead of concentrating on producing income or build structures that generates income, so you just go and manually change production on every planet you control. I think everything that ""auto-"" do something should be designed in the way to help user avoid repeatable actions and let concentrate on the fun part only correcting ""autopilot"" in rare cases. For those who likes to tune everything manually ""autopilot"" is not needed at all.  Game mechanics very similar to game called Civilization specially in parts where you deal with other races. But if you copy other's game mechanics why not get everything right? There is no option to counteroffer proposal. You or accept nonsense offer AI proposing, or decline and worsen your relations. You can trade with AI while being in war through contacting race by offering to exchange captured spy. Why you actually can't trade all the captured enemy spies from same race at once?   Oh, and most annoying thing: In some cases your ships just being attacked by AI without declaring war to you before and after the attack. You can also do the same thing and sometimes it work sometimes it doesn't, but if this is by design why not to sent some explanation to the player in form of notification e.g. ""Your ship just being destroyed because you're on other race territory, relations with race just gotten worse"". Being Engineer myself I can give advice: if something needs additional explanation it's not that good.  There is so much more and so much more to come, probably due to game releases not being properly tested or wrong priories are set....and give one or two DLCs for free for those who paid for this game 60 bucks or something, you can send them redemption code to settle everything right.

Early Access Review
								So, like a lot of you, I never played MoO2 when it was crowned the golden 4x game of a generation.  In 96' I was focused on school and well, being a seven year old.  I came in with little knowledge of the game that has inspired so many.  After two near-complete games (and several restarts) in MoO: CTS, I had to boot up MoO2.  Then Endless Space, then buy Starbase Orion for moblie, then go against my own better judgement and pick up StarDrive 2 with its new DLC.Sadly, Master of Orion has been recreated by two other studios, in my opinion, than what the holders of a beloved IP have created.  While I understand the game is Early Access, it is missing several features found in games like I've mentioned above, with a much heftier buy in price.  With the release of Stellaris announced for May, and Endless Space 2 on the horizon, I just don't see this game being released with the amount of depth I want from a 4x strategy game.While starlanes are not a terrible way to go, Endless Space just does it better, especially with things like arp technology.  Compared to a free movement games like SD2 or Orion (MoO2 as well), it is a stark difference.  Never figured out why I couldn't get past a few hours with most space 4x games until playing the games I have mentioned.  I much prefer the Civ styled movement of anywhere you want to go you can go (with technology) and enjoy it a lot more in space 4x games.Combat currently is a glorified, pretty, cinematic viewer.  Currently your ship designs don't matter much as a lot of weapon systems are non-fuctioning, and A.I. fleet loadouts are rather unbalanced (scout and cruiser spam).  As per their feedback page, this is something they are hoping to expand upon.For a reinvisioning of the MoO2 technological system, other games do it much better.  The choices of which technology to use are few and far between, and further are pigeon-holed into pretty obvious decisions.  Compared to Civ styled research systems, games like Endless Space, Endless Legend, or Civ 5 do it far better.  Their are more choices to be made while filling out the tech tree (Masonry vs Calendar etc), providing a more rewarding progression system, even if they don't follow the system provided by MoO2 and SD2 (locking out techs to be stolen/trade for/conquered).There is currently no leader system or unit leveling.  While many might consider this as so what?  It really kills replaybility.  In Civ 5 having one of your main military units through the ages is a huge boon.  They have several upgrades that drastically change the unit, and create a connection to the game.  You will do what you can to use, and save, your beloved high level units.  There is no attatchment here.  Unlike MoO2, SD2, Endless Space, or Endless Legend (also having unit leveling), there is no leader system.  Nor is there an abstracted one like Civ 5 (great persons).Colonial depth is pretty barebones for a game like this.  There are no luxury resources or strategic resources currently in the game, and I feel that is something that will not be added.  In Civ 5 you have all sorts of different resources that affect your empire (just as SD2, Endless Space, and Endless Legend have) and can also drastically change gameplay.  In ES, if I don't have say anti-matter, I can't even build certain powerful ship systems.  It will require trading or war to advance my ideas.  In Civ 5, it is basically the same.  I want to build nukes but hold no uranium.  Either I'm trading or conquering my way to them.  It creates a believeable universe, for me, as it akins back to real world geo-politics.  Wars are fought over resources.To expand Galaxy (and colonial) depth, it is missing several events found in games like Gal Civ 3, SD2, and ES.  While some are there, they are miniscule and few compared to the games above.  Further, their only resource(s) called Artifacts don't add much to the game.  Each one is a flat bonus to science, industry, food, or credit generation.  Take for example the relic system provided by Endless Space which leaves a plethora of 'wonders' that enhance planets left behind by the Forgotten (Masters in MoO).  Or SD2 which had things like habitats pre-built, or angry beings already on the planet that will require wiping out or dealing with the negative consequences.  In MoO: CTS, it is really hard to care about system X or colony Y.Races are aesthetically different but don't add much variation to the game.  Endless Space, and especially MoO2 and Endless Legend have very different races that can alter a gameplay in several small ways or in a few drastic ways.  For example, not being able to research but instead using currency to move up the tech tree, or not being allowed to grow at all beyond your initial city.Presentation is where the game shines, and for at least me, it doesn't equate to an amazing game.  The voice-over work is pretty good, but can also become annoying after a while.  The GNN is a good example of this, it has several cringe worthy moments not helped by lackluster voice editing.  The graphics are decent for a 4x game, nothing amazing but good.  Better in some ways and worse than others.  Some GUI things need to be cleaned up, current planet management is pretty ridiculous when trying to demolish an old building no longer needed.  Currently, buildings are randomly plopped on a globe and you get to wade through them one by one.  A list of what is built on the planet would help a lot.I won't say much about the A.I. as it is a known problem, but it really can't be said enough: it can barely play the game and won't challenge even a newcomer.  Hopefully this can be ramped up drastically in the coming months.All in all, I don't think I would have bothered with this if it wasn't for its IP.  I can't suggest this game to a newcomer to the space 4x genre as currently, I think Endless Space is far more appoachable.  Teaching a lot of intricate systems in an easy to use GUI, allowing you to expand in the genre if you want more complexity and depth without hitting another huge brick wall of a learning curve.  For veterans of the genre that date back to Civ 4 and 5, or even further with games like MoO2, Distand World Universe, and Gal Civ 2:  the first playthrough will be enjoyable but the 'itch' to play a 4x game will be inflamed as you scour through suggested games to scratch it.

												This game looks great. However the gameplay lacks any sort of depth. The A.I players just focus on the human players and quickly becomes a you versus 5 of them situation. Developers usually fall back on this when they can't finish a game. Which is surprising - a game this old should have an acutal balanced, repeatable gameplay - plays as unfinished.			"

								1.) The graphics are sick!2.) Research tree is extensive, but not overly complex3.) Ship design is stremlined but all options are customizable.4.) Race Relations are very important.  Your actions have a visable impact on the moods of the other races.5.) Voice Acting is very well done.6.) Star Lane travel like many recent 4X games. The game moves away from star lanes as tech is researched.-1.) Combat is alittle glitchy.-2.) Beta - so not all features are available.-3.) Turn time gets really long on larger maps with many races.-4.) GNN needs more Material.  Its all the same stuff.-5.) Diplomacy needs to be upgraded, its always the same stuff,, give us money or war....			"

Early Access Review
								Longtime fan of MOO and MOO2, this feels better than MOO3 (even after patches), and better than the alternatives. For an EA game, it feels very good so far.  I can't wait for the features to be complete, and the actual game release.  I know people are upset over the combat (in some ways rightfully so, as it currently feels a bit hollow), but this still has the feel of MOO and MOO2 more than any other game in my library at the moment.  Devs - please do take the time to listen to the community.  You have the start of a very good game, but the community suggestions will make it better.  There are some issues with the base game at the moment as far as balance, Tech trees, AI, and Combat, but these are all things that can easily be worked out over the EA period.9/10 for an EA release - the only real negative thing is that I wish a few more of the mechanics were complete, and I think the combat system and shipbuilder needs work to make it feel truly ""tactical"" when fighting - even if it stays real time (pausable).  That was a huge part of MOO/MOO2.			"

Compared with a number of 4x titles, this is one of the best in terms of UI and and presentation. The mechanics here are being worked on by the devs constantly, and the depth of the game is only increasing. If you have ever enjoyed a 4x game, I would pretty much pick this up.			"

								As a fan of Master of Orion, I would totally recommend this game for what it has delivered already as a solid platform in the Early Access it currently is. There are some features and civilizations still missing and it's a bit bland in certain areas, such as combat and diplomacy. As is espionage completely missing(?). But for the feeling of creating a narration of your own spin on your historic empire, I believe they are right on track. Just with a bunch of additional features and indepth gameplay elements I believe this game is surely worth your money. 8.2/10			"

Early Access Review
								Full disclosure: I never played any of the original MOOs. I came into this one blind wrt to its lineage, just looking for a decent space 4x and for me, it ticks all the boxes. The asthetics and sound are superb, really catches that old style soft-SF theme without seeming out-of-date. The game play is simple but solid. If you're into micromanagement this might not be the game for you, it doesn't take much effort to manage an empire with twenty or so planets, although there is enough micro to make you have to think about how you're going to develop and use those planets.I've read some crticism and debate over the star lane FTL system: you can't travel anywhere but can only jump to nearby systems making the map a network. I find the system quite refreshing. It creates some good tactical scenarios like grabbing systems, even if they have bad planets, because they are choke points for travel. It can make it difficult to send ships out in the later game without open border treaties but overall I think it works.The game is still in Early Access but it seems nearly finished. Could do with a little polish on the bugs side (mostly graphical) and there's still some fleshing out that needs to be done but even in its current state its a lot of fun. Fingers crossed it will continue to improve.			"

Early Access Review
								This was written while the game was still in early access, some features may be changed in that time.First off; this is not an MOO HD remake, leave your expectations in the 90's. This is an entirely new game and should be approached as such.Honestly even though i would have preferred the new MOO to make a complete break with the old core turn-based mechanics, barring some minor hickups, the core gameplay is fairly stable and has a fairly good flow, though honestly there is nothing that could not have been done real-time at present.The best addition has to be the very cinematic feeling Real-time battles though, the AI (when this review was written) was fairly simple and could use considerable improvement to provide some true tactical challenges, that being said there is plenty of room for tactical master all the same.With optimization and time this will shape up to be a great 4X title when all the wrinkles get ironed out.  Worth a look.			"

								Very stable for an early access title. As a veteran Master of Orion player (especially MOO2) I think so far the game looks and feels like an Orion title, however there are still several WIP areas as normal for an early access in the middle of development which makes it hard to rate it. So far enjoying it and the 1st major update brought several improvements into the right direction. Looking forward to future updates.			"

Early Access Review
								Like many others, I grew up with Master of Orion 1 and 2 and (after the dissapointing MoO 3) waited for a very long time for a worthy sequel.So far, Master of Orion looks that it might be that sequel, though given that its early access, it is too early to tell for sure.Right from the start, the game feels very familiar to a veteran MoO 2 player. You can tell that this game was made by people who know and love the MoO franchise. Most changes made to gameplay (like starlanes) are minor in nature and, at least in my opinion, make sense. The ship designer in particular is still there and not too different from MoO 2  (You can still outfit you ships with tons of different weapons and specials, as well as modify the weapons themselves - missles, beam weapons, point defense, firing arcs, ecm jammers, fighter / bomber bays, you name it).The only real big change is the - much discussed - replacement of the turn based space combat with a (pauseable) real time version. While I am not to stoked about this myself, I do not think this is the end world, and - if done right - might even a good thing. Unfortunately, given that the A.I. is very limted so far in Early Access (the A.I.  difficulty is set to average for now), I have not been able to experience any battle involving two large fleets so far, where you could truly test the depth of the real time combat system. Just to be clear (because I have seen wrong information about this), the combat is not merely a interactive movie, like (unfortuantely) in games like Endless Space. You have full control over the ships, i.e. you can designate targets, maneuver the ships and manually activate specials on the ships.Anyhow, whether you think that MoO is a worthy sequel or not, it at the very least looks to have the potential to be an excellent 4X game,			"

Early Access Review
								A very good reboot on a classic game. The devs have taken some liberties and changed some of the core features of MoO 1/2, such as replacing the turn based combat with real-time. At first, I was a bit shocked with the change, but I have learned to like it. Short sum up of pros and cons:+ gfx are gorgeous and game is really smooth and good looking + space lanes are welcome in MoO+ real time combat proves to be more interesting than the attacker-wins-all-battles advantage from turn based combat from MoO 1/2.+ holds to the best of MoO- some screens and fonts lack finishing - real combat is a step the right direction, but still lacks control to have some tactical meaning. Besides using asteroids as cover for beam/missile barrages, you can't do much. Also, combat should offer the choice to retreat.- colony management could be more intelligent- diplomacy is lackluster. I would like to see something closer to Civ4/5, with stronger alliances forming between races. As it is now, it looks every race is out there for themselves, just contacting you to demand stuff. - still missing features such as ship boarding or the Antareans. Conclusion : all in all, happy to pay $50 to prove there is space in modern gaming for gems such as MoO. Great start as early access, and just hope the devs don't drop the ball and keep pushing the game in the right direction.			"

								they didnt try to make something new out of the master of orion game series and i am totally okay with it. it feels somewhat like master of orion II, with better graphics and very nice voice acting and good music. it's still in early access, but has most of its functionality already present. what i dont like about it is the realtime spaceship battles and there could be a lot more customization options in ship design. it needs the exact or even more depth in this area as master of orion II had and a round based combat system. the AI is currently also pretty bad.in all it seems to be a decent sequel, but with a few bugs and things that need to be adressed and changed during this development phase. i hope they'll make it as good as MOO2 was, in my eyes still the best 4X space game in existence yet.+ nice graphics+ good voice acting+ good overall remake of the MOO genre+ mobile space factory for special construction tasks in a system- no round-based space combat option- not enough ship customization options- not enough ship designs to choose from- weak combat AI- some of the classic weapons are missing(for example: tri-focus plasma, ion- and neutronstreamprojector, pulse-phaser)- the deathray, mauler-device and stellar converter have a bad damage to size ratio in the late game. for example a full complement of plasma cannons or disruptors is far more powerful then an array of deathrays, mauler devices or a stellar converter. MOO2 had the same issue with this weapons. "

												I love 4x.  But I have to say that I am disappointed with this title.  It was too cinematic, too flashy.  Too lovie dovie, cutsie wootsie, and dumbed down for my taste.  I did like the combat when it got fixed, however.  More money was spent on voice actors, presentation, and marketing, than core game content.  The original MOO kept me up all night, hell, I didn't sleep for days because I had to finish one more turn.  I guess I am just old now, and this take on the same old doesn't have that gravitas to reel me in.  Stick with the GalCiv franchise.  It's far superior in every way.			"

								This game is a nice update from older versions.  However, I'm not sure why they decided to place real time combat into a turn based game.  The strategy in combat is very limited.   The ships don't always follow orders exactly.   In the old game you could do stuff like turn your ship to the side which has more shields.  No such strategies to be found here.			"

												Very fun game for people who like 4X games. Maybe not too deep however if you played other similar games like Stellaris, Aurora and GalCiv. This, however, plays a lot more fluidly than others and is a pretty enjoyable experience.			"

								I bought this on the first day(Friday Feb 26, 2016), got home from work and played until 3 in the morning. I will say in no uncertain terms, that I absolutely love the game and am going to be spending the whole weekend playing this game. There are no or very few bugs that I have noticed. It's already one of my favourite 4x games, I hope to play it for a very long time. And on a side note the voices of Michael Dorn and John de Lancie really add a lot for me as I am a huge Star Trek fan.The only issue that I have with this game is that the A.I. is not effective at building a large empire or even exploring the galaxy(I'm currently playing a large spiral galaxy), all AI species only have contact with 1 other race, and myself. Also the AI let me build a massive Empire and no one even declared war on me, they all despise me but are so afraid of me that they aren't willing to fight me. I don't really mind that the AI doesn't want to fight me though I just wish that they were large enough to pose a challenge to me when I decide to invade.It is early access and I hope that there are many improvements still like:-Improved AI Empire management-More control in space battles-Customiseable racial traits-The ability to easily import a potrait for a custom race-More ship classes and/or styles			"

												Love the idea here, but the execution falls down.  Generally improved visuals can't make up for the fact that the text in nearly unreadable on smaller screens (even retina displays) due to poor choices in fonts and that pacing that is glacial compared to other 4x titles.  (Civ, Offworld Trading, Galactic Civ, etc)   The biggest issue for me is that nothing really changes - 100 turns and you home planet pretty much looks the same as it did at the beginning of the game and you are still grinding out basically the same units (having moved to Frigate IVs doesn't really count in my book as a new unit.) i never played the original MoOs, so maybe it's true to the original in some interesting ways, but honestly, I can't recommend it on the basis of the competition.

Early Access Review
								As a MoO2-Vet, I was rather sceptical about this reboot. But in the end, it seems to turn out pretty good. Even in its current state, I could smoothly play through my first match, without any crashes (minor bugs and glitches are still present, of course), and I have to say: This is fun! The interface is a lot more comfortable than in MoO2 (made possible by borrowing heavily from CiV). Starlanes change the progression of warfare alot, compared to the original, but I like the ""move around inside the systems"" aspect going along with them, and they have their own advantages gameplay-wise. Tactical combat is a lot more fun to watch (naturally) and a lot less tedious than in MoO2 (many combat options back then were pretty unnecessary in SP and bogged a somewhat slow combat routine only down more). Of course, combat AI needs some improvement.The only thing I really don't like is ship editing and upgrading. The slot-system (compared to MoO2's free distribution of space) is okay and feasible, but the numbers during blueprint editing do not seem to add up correctly all the time. Often I also miss a little bit more information about how (or rather: how much) a certain weapon or subsystem effects the actual combat.And upgrading ships like in CiV does not really seem to work in a MoO. Sure, in MoO2 it could be tedious to upgrade all ships in a large fleet through production, but maybe you could add an ""upgrade all""-button?).			"

												Mods to fix the gross errors in pollution and money have made the game so unstable its nearly impossible to finish the game. Huge isn't big enough to enjoy the game and star lanes are what made MOO3 so bad. Kill the star lanes fix up later race comms and fix the changes to the lesser races, it was better before.So sad this had the posibility to be as good as MOO2, but you've failed again!			"

												As another big fan of the original MOO games, 1&2, I've been struggling whether to recommend this remake. It was in pretty rough shape when the first Early Access edition was released (realeased too soon, if you ask me.)  However, since then the developers have really listened to the playerss feedback, and they have dramatically improved the game experience. Overall, I am very happy with the game. It perfectly captures the Master of Orion experience. The graphics, sound design, and control architecture are flawless. The most important feature - the AI has significantly improved. Diplomacy has significantly improved. Ultimately, I find the game to be just as addictive as the original title.I do have a few caveats. I'm not a fan of the mostly linear tech tree. I wish combat were a little more interactive. (I don't mind that it's not turn-based.)  I wish the game had a little more depth, with more developed trade, economy, governors, heros, land assults, greater depth with Orion technology and the missing Antarans. However, minor races will eventually be added, and the developers are planning to open the game for mods. Yay!!!Ultimately, I have to say the game is exactly what I wanted it to be - an addictive, streamlined, intergalactic MOO chess game with a modern face-lift. Cheers to the developers for resurrecting one of my all-time favorite games!			"

								Good gameHope the developers give the option to change the UI size.I play on a 1080p TV, but I sit a fair way from the screen 3 meters or so, can be a little hard to read some of the smaller text.This is something developers frequently don't take into consideration.Also when a civilistation approaches you to bargain, you can not offer a counter offer. This can be annoying if they are trying to buy tech', they offer you less than they would want if they were selling, so as you can't counter you say no and they get upset with you?! ...stupid.When you are in negotiations it would be good to know how the other party stands with the over races, again you can upset another race because you didnt know they were at war with them.Would be good if while bargaining you got info pop up from one of your four advisors as to why it may or may not be good for you to do something ...bit like when you are choosing which tech to choose.Needs a bit more work, but it is a good 4X game. Would recommend, but would like to see some sensible inprovements. "

												I have to admit I was a skeptic when following the development of this game. As a fan of the classics I was worried about the direction this project was heading in, but after picking it up and playing it for a few hours I have to admit I am pleasantly surprised and enjoying myself quite a bit.I enjoy all kinds of space 4x games, from MOO2 to Stellaris to Endless Space to Distant Worlds to Stardrive to... you get the idea. This game may not be as ""complex"" as some of those I mentioned, but what it focuses on it does quite well. Incredibly strong presentation and a smooth UI make the game feel easy to grasp and fun to play. Late game colony management can be a drag, but I find I have plenty of fun playing on smaller maps. The AI seems quite competent too, which isn't always the case in most space 4x games. I can see myself coming back to this game over and over to have some fun and get a taste of that ""just one more time"" feeling I love about this genre so much. If you are looking for a good entry point to space 4x games, or you just want to have some fun, I say pick this game up.*Note that I actually like star lanes, at least the way they are implemented here, and the real-time combat offers enough control for me to enjoy it as well, but I understand those things can be show stoppers for some people.

												I was worried it might be a repeat of what happened with Master of Orion 3, but it does feel like the classic, which is great!A better description would be to say it plays like MoO 1 & 2, with the control scheme of Civilization. That's not a bad thing actually. Just keep in mind that the ""Space Factory"" is a new thing. I went half the game wondering how the enemy was building outposts while I couldn't.			"

								Aside from the lanes, this is a faithful yet constructive sequel to the older games. I can't wait to see the other races come through. AI at this stage is very touchy - refuse their ""trade"" (You give me everything right now, I give you nothing) and they immediately choose to declare war on you. I had 3 AI players declare war on me in 3 turns, and from what I could tell they all had no interest in each other. I managed to out-colonise, out-build, out-research them for a very long time, until I wiped one of them out without breaking a sweat. Then as I was about to crush the 2nd one, it came to galactic vote, I voted to crown myself head honcho and instantly won the game.			"

								First off let me say, that in the hours i've played this game ive not had a crash or bug at all, its already very well polished if not lacking the full features and content of a final game. Im a big Civ 5 fan as well as 4x such as Sins of a Solar Empire, this game has elements of both. I played MOO when it first came out years ago, was never a fan boy so look as myself as unbiast in this review.This game is VERY good already and if you like games such as Civ 4 and Sins then you should definately consider this, it is early stages but is already very playable and very well done. I would highly recommend anyway who is a fan of turn based or 4x to get this now, theres plenty of hours of play in it.  If you are more casual then keep an eye on  this game and I would highly recommend buying once complete.			"

You have to expect the game to take many turns to resolve, yet after 350 (I played to about 500) I was spending more time waiting for AI to complete turns than I was spending on my own turns. I have an I7 8 core chip and 16GB of RAM, this looks to me like unoptimzed code. So, yes, fun, but needs a patch.			"

												I don't know wny there are so many bad reviews for this game.  I think it's great.  Yes, I was and still am a big fan of MOO2, which I happen to think is the first and best 4X turned based strategy game of all time.  And does this version have all of the features of MOO2, almost, but no.  It is a very fun game in it's own right, with of course better graphics, an excellent cast of character voices, detailed art work, and features of its own.  So does MOO2 have all the features of this MOO, no.  One thing is for sure, I'll be playing this one for probably the rest of my life, as I will MOO2.  I don't think you can go wrong with this game, and I do recomment it.  Hats off to the development team bringing the 4X platform back to a very misguided industry.  My opinion, this is a great game!			"

I mean...why should I give up gold for a tech only to you to lose favor with me?  Or I give into your offer but I get no reputation for it at all?I am partial to space games, and when you have a big fleet and choose 'Tactical' and you see you smaller ships warp in followed by a Titan..it bring a smile to my face.I have also read some of the 'Not reccomend' posts and some are very hypocritical in that..they give ALOT of postives..with equal Negatives.

								MOO has always been a stake holder for gaming for me since the original.  This is no different.  Being an early release, there are sure for things to be improved upon but overall it is fun and enjoyable to play.  Seems like the Devs are taking suggestions seriously and upcoming improvements are highly anticipated.  If you like 4X games I suggest you try this (get the collectors addition to see the leaps from the original to now-and plus they are all fun!).  Don't be discouraged though, this is an early release and changes are going to be made.  I look forward to many more hours of gameplay even while in the inital release.  This is going to be really awesome.			"

 Review for People New to this Fanchise (Like me) If you're not a 'long time fan' of theses games like me and you just want a soild 4x stratergy game to play then this is a good choice. I will mention the fact that you must remember this is an early access title because there are features missing however the base game they've laid out here is very well done and interresting to play. I can see where they're going to build on this game and, when complete, it could be fantastic.I am a huge fan of the Civilization fanchise and you can definitely where this game has pulled from the design of games like Civ 5 which in my experience gave me a good starting point to understanding what to do to play. In conclusion This game still needs a lot of work still but it's fun to play and an exciting start.			"

								There are a lot of reviews giving the pros and cons, so read them if you're looking for an in depth review.All I would say is:1. It's MoO in name only: name of the game, the techs, the buildings, the races and so on. But there are a lot of differences, so you won't necessarily like this just because you liked original MoO or MoO2.2. For me, it's a thumbs up because this is the first game in ages that has really given me that 'just one more turn' feeling. In that respect it's pure MoO, and I love it. What's more, it's pretty good in its present form, so I expect it to be great when complete.			"

								Gameplay + First Impressions


YouTube™ Video: Master Of Orion: Join The Hive 

			Views: 356		

			Today I'm playing Master Of Orion by NGD Studios. This game is currently in Early Access but it's shaping up pretty quickly to becoming on of my favourite 4X games.		

Master of Orion has really scratched that 4x itch for me recently. Even though there is still much work to be done on the game I love starting a fresh campaign and seeing how it turns out. I've completed serveral of the victory types now and it's got so much potential if they keep the work up on the project. My only negative on this game is that theres no one aspect I look at and think this is 100% finished. Diplomacy for example it seems solid and it's a hell of a lot better than recent Civ games. But still feels like its unifinished. Currently I beleive its impossible to offer counter deals to other races when they offer you a deal but they can counter yours? Either I'm blind and missed how you edit deals or thats missing. Combat only seems like its worth simulating as taking control myself didnt really feel like it was worth the time. Now I sound down on this game but actually I'm in love with it. I just keep wanting to play more but I'm also holding myself back a little cause I want to really dive in when its fully finished. I still drop in for a quick match every now and then to see whats changed. I think once this is fully developed it will be one of the best 4x games around.			"

Early Access Review
								The game has got the look and feel of the original Master of Orion. Apparently, Wargamining has tried to be true to the original, while modernizing the looks and the interface and such (btw, interface is really almost perfect)And it is fun to play. That is the thing that matters most! The same old- building a death star and wiping off one planet after another is precious. That feeling alone makes the game worthwhile. Of course, there is still plenty of other things as well. Now, there is still plenty of things wrong with the game, but this is Early Access after all. So don't get too worried. I hope.  But to be fair, if this game was out now, i'd give it a thumbs down. The issues:- Enemy AI is... well, calling it stupid would be insult to stupid everywhere. No use of terraforming, declaring wars and then not attacking, i've yet to see war between AI races end and so on and so on. - Tactical Battles is not. It's fancy cinematic watching your ships beat the crap out of enemy ships, space monsters and bases. And yes, beating the crap out of things is the usual result. Cause the AI is damn stupid. At least, it's satisfying. - Reseach is too fast.- The races are not different enough. Some bonuses, but otherwize, they all play the same. And humans are most pointless race ever. - Tech tree is a copy-pase from Civilization. Meaning, booring. - After achieving military victory and destroying half of the planets in the galaxy in the process (thank you very much, death stars), all you get is ""Congratulations, you have won, click ok to continue"" popup. I truly hope this is a placeholder. Overall, if you're not afraid of Early Access and love Master of Orion like your dog loves your leg,  i'd recommend it. Otherwise, wait for release.			"

												With all the effort that was obviously put into making the game look good and run well, I am rather amazed that they didn't put forth the needed effort to make the game fun.  A lack of compelling, or even interesting, combat kills the experience and quite frankly the AI belongs in a third rate 4x not in a game carrying the greatest 4x title in gaming.			"

								Early access...  The game has nice graphics and after several games there hasn't been a single crash.  The game is entirely playable, though some features are still missing (at this point).  The game resembles MOO2 more than MOO1.  It is entirely likable.  Even so, MOO1 would have been, IMO, a better game to reboot as the game flow in MOO1 was simply brilliant.			"

												3/6It is already a good game.  With the addition of harder AI, spies, and custom races (and the 4 missing ones), this game will be 10/10.Update 4/25They made the AI harder, added spies, and added custom races.  They also improved random events and improved the news reports.  It really is a good game at this point.  They are rapidly improving it.  This should be a buy for any fan of 4x.Update 7/4The latest update inproved the AI further but they removed food and science production from startup colonies so they mostly start in a starving state.  This slows down the game tremendously and will need to be reversed.Update 8/13 EA7I do not understand why they made some very poor decisions on changes.  Planets now grow very slowly and the AI (on normal difficulty) has 20 planets and a 2000 point fleet when I have 10 planets and a 58 point fleet.  You read that right, 58 to 2000 on normal difficulty.  I have over 130 hours played now and over 1000 hours in moo2.  I am not a neophite.  The game has taken a major step backward in fun.   I'm hoping they reverse course and are still balancing the game.Update 8/31 Retail releaseWell they fixed the colony growth problems, rebalanced the AI so it is a fair fight, added several animations and an intro and a ton of other fixes.  It isn't perfect yet but it is a good game and a definite buy at this point if you want a 4x.  They have promised to add independent colonies and other upgrades for free.  Antarians will probably be a DLC.			"

								I'll preface this little review, I've played a fair bit now but I am a die hard Moo II fan this new reinvention doesn't quiet live up to the legacy, although the game looks and sounds great.Fair to say it is in Early Access and it''s definitely not finished yet, if you're after a polished experience wait a little while longer. I've not had EA2 get stuck or prevent me from playing though. and just two CTD. The dev's seem to be touching thing's up nicely, I'll still give it more time.I've enjoyed what I've played but unfortunately I don't think it has the depth Moo II has.			"

								This game has all the elements and the potential to be a classic. The game retains the addictive feel of the previous games while most of the changes are an improvement over the previous games. Even things like the wrap points that some people are complaining for in my opinion provide more depth in the game.  Currently the only aspect of the game that is kind of underwhelming are the tactical battles. I still have not managed to understand how you can actually have a meaningful contribution to the battle that will change the result compared to that of the simulation. More control over what every ship is doing and how the weapons are used, is needed in my opinion.   "

Early Access Review
								ok to start off i loved Moo 2, Moo 3.... well it was ok. Moo 3 had some good ideas but it failed on refinement... horribly.this game so far needs more refinement aswell but thats why its in early access but i also dont care for some of the changes from moo 2 to here... star lanes for instance, aswell as ""unstable star lanes"" that box you in untill you get half way through the tech tree, i for one liked the fact that you had could bypass an empires outer planets and attack their inner worlds it added a chance to bypass the enemy fleet if they didnt pay close enough attention and now we have no ship distance restrictions as long as you can get through those red star lanesnow the combat system..... combat..... personally i think its terrible as of current buildall fleets have a combat strength rating which is visible to all.... so you can see exactly what your opponents have which boils engadgments down to a very basic if you have a higher number than the enemy you attack, if not retreat and build up/upgrade your ships, repeat untill you win... even the guardian of orion you can see its combat raiting plain as day.... of all the ships which should have their strength hidden it should be the guardianfor those who claim theres a stratagy element to it because its real time combat.... no there really isnt other than keep your small ships back for a bit because they move alot faster than the larger ones and will die like the cannon fodder they are too early... but then they refuse to sit still so you end up having to micro manage your smaller ships moving back and forth untill the right time to bring them up closer to your larger ships for the attack to startshurly the races are being done well? ..... nopegranted i havent played matches with them all yet but so far its a definate nope. the psylons i remember being an awesome race.... so what did they do to them in this game?  in the animations they made their advisor into the stereotypical highschool geek whos afraid to speak. and with that in mind in the game play they have a tendancy to rule their corner of the galaxy with ease, crushing any race unlucky enough to be stuck in the same boxed in star lane segment as themthe diplomacy.... needs to be implemented still... aside from the ai making demands of you and then declairing war when you refuse, there is none but they have announced that its going to be worked on (thank god, if i hear the murshan hiss at me for refusing to give them money ill snap and declare war on them first)so long story short i prefered playing moo 3 to this stage of its progress... wait until its out of early access to buy and keep an eye on it because it does have potential to be great..... great flop or great success is yet to be seen***Update*** so after a couple of patches the game is comming together nicely and im changing my recommendation to a yes you do need to understand its still a work in progress, like the diplomacy while it has been worked on, still needs more work done such as: it would be nice to throw out a counter offer (within reason) to avoid the ""refused to trade with us"" penalty to rep because an offer of 60 credits/bc/gc/whatever they call the currency is too low for technology that requires multiple turns to researchthe only other part of the game i dislike is their choice for voice actors for some of the leaders/advisors such as the silicoid advisor.... for those who dont know, the silicoids are a race of rock people (essentally) and their advisor is a soft voiced person it just dosnt seem to fit, but i gotta say they did a good job on most of the leaders voicesnow you may be noticing im only saying what i dont like about the game... thats mainly because the rest is either in the awesome catagory or at least the acceptable because its early accessand i guess now that ive said that i should give some examples.... this game is the most stable early access ive seen and i have gotten into several... a few that i regret too... not this one thoughthe real time ship combat has been greatly improved you can set individual ships engadgement distances so you can customise your ships to have specializations such as long range missile support or a close range brawler. you can also set all ships movement speeds so your frigates and destroyers no longer rush way ahead of the titans that they are cannon fodder for.i cant confirm it but the unstable star lanes seem to be less frequent than beforeTLDR: was ok, got better, getting better with each patch..... EDIT: except the diplomacy..... that team needs to get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together**Update #2**latest patch increased the ai's value of starcharts.... mix this with the screwed up diplomacy and i have just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off another race because they think that their starcharts and 3 credits a turn is worth an entire planet.... thats right they wanted me to give them one of my first planets for their star charts			"

								After last updates I changed my mind. The game is not ideal , but far better and comes much closser to prediscessors. I still lucks some UI tooltips explanations and the combat engine is far frm perfect, but it's not started to ""produce"" this undefinable substance called ""fun"".I leave the original review bellow for comperason:-----------------------------------------------------------------------Really disapointing.Can't pinpoint on exact reason, the game have ""all the right elements"" , but this is small things, the game is just ""too flat"" , no depth , no real interest. All too simple .And , yes, I aware that the game is not finished yet, I am sure a lot of content will be added later on, but my problem is with descissions already taken by the game designers, the game just does not have any ""taste"", any ""spice"".As from UI point of view I miss the tooltips thet were everywhere in original MoOs , even on disabled buttons.Tech tree is doll, GNN videos annoying but you better not skip them as they have usefull infrmation. The advisers, especially Alkari and Psilon are really annoying... voices... their lines...Battles are boring, personally I preffered turn based, but the RTS could be ok if done properly, here they are not.In general - looks better then failed MoO 3, but this is not a game I wanted, just another mediocre 4X game, not MoO successor.

												This game is really fun!Its very immersive with insane production values compared to any other 4x spacegame! =)Space battles are very pretty with you able to controll some of it! (not pure cinematic as in other 4x games) You can blow up astroids and if hostile ships are in proximity they will be damaged or destroyed. That said, it is not a deep combat system by any stretch of the imagination.So far the Ai seems decent enough. They defend access points into their territory and so forth. I havent gotten to deep into the game yet, so cant say how well the ai holds up in the lategame.Thus far im having a blast :)Ps, it is not a clasic moo clone! If thats what you are hoping for you will be dissapointed. Personally i like this game more. But then i never really played the original games that much ;p			"

Early Access Review
								Okay, I have played this game long enough to tell you, even being Early Access.THIS IS NOT MOO.  This is just another game dev company that lied about being fans of the IP and then said... lets redo the game to appeal to a broader and dumber audience.  Sort of a smack in the face to the hard core fans, but welcoming to others not that into the IP.But this is a fun game anyways, well in my opinion.  You are not likely to play this game as long as MOO2 because all of the depth that Microprose put into their games have been removed in favor of an easier development cycle.  Dumbing games down is just short for cheaping out by the devs in my opinion and after playing this game for this long it really shows.The only difference between a Human or a Psilon is that Psilon research faster, and that is just about it other than skins.  There is no quantafiable uniqueness to the races other than some basic race traits.  The tech tree is dumbed down.  Spying has yet to be implimented but to be honest I will have had my time with this game before it will be here.  I have played as Humans, Meklar, Psilon, Bulrathi and a custom race.  I can honestly say... they all feel the same during play through, and I crushed the living crap out of the AI on its most difficult setting easily.It's a fun game for those that can appreciate a simple Turn based Sins of a Solar Empire in Space that does not require much thought.  Some of the old plaques of the Turn based 4x games is still there... management headache once you have 40 planets to manage getting nagged every turn that something happend.  The auto builder is pretty stupid and goes a wrote path that does not do very well explaining why the AI's are so darn weak most of the time.If you are a die hard fan of MOO, you might want to skip this or wait till a good discount happens along to see if you can get comfy in its shoes.   Do not expect this game to knock your socks off by any stretch, but it at least looks good in 4k!			"

Early Access Review
								People are dismissing this as shallow, but it seems to be a misplaced judgement.  Even as an early access game, this 4X has far more depth than many recent games had at launch (cough GalCiv3).  For example:-Multiple ways of invading/destroying planets.  Drown them in chemical weapons to kill off the population while leaving the infrastructure intact (but taking a big diplo hit).  Spend years nuking them from orbit until the planet is a polluted, irraddiated mess, then move in to clean up and terraform things back to habitabal.  Launch a good old fashioned infantry invasion, involving marines of different levels, tanks and mechs.  Or for the galactic conquerer on the go, simply erase the planet from existence with late-game planet-exploding tech.-Customize your ships with more than just weapons and armour.  The biggest range of options comes not from the weapons, but from the utility/support modules that can be researched and fitted.  From active black-hole generators, SC2 Stalker-like blinks, missile retargetting and all kinds of countermeasures, your ship designs are just as much about your style of fighting as they are about how hard you hit.-Think the starlanes are lame?  You don't even need to get half way through the tech tree to unlock warpgates, allowing you to make your own starlanes between colonies.  Combined with late-game engine tech, and the appearance of wormholes in the galaxy, mobilizing your fleets really isn't the painful process some people think after a brief early-game play.- Someone complained that you can't transport food between planets?  Wrong.  Just need the tech unlocked (again, pre-mid game).  It'll also let you transport production, letting you focus late-game production at key planets (for when you want to start spamming those Titans or Death Stars).  Oh, and you can send population around from turn 1.  Did I mention population is tracked by race, and different races can be assimilated into your planets, complete with their racial perks?  What casual unfaithful nonsense!On top of the depth that's already here, there's more promised to land before launch - and based on how much of this promised content is already heavily referred to across the game (such as in the tech tree), it seems pretty likely that these guys are on it.Another thing I've seen people slate the game for: no ship bording.  Lemme quote an item off the tech tree called ""Marine Pods"" (under Advanced Tactics):""Marine Pods house additional detachments of space marines, increasing the number of Marines on board a ship.  The additional marines both defend the ship and can board enemy ships.""dumbed down / 10			"

Early Access Review
								Having played countless hours of MOO2  and being extremely dissapointed by MOO3 I had very high hopes for this game.It did not let me down.Every negative review I have read for this game is based  on the content not yet implamented or minor game balancing issues due to the fact this game is still in early access.Having finished my first playthrough I have to say that the UI is the best I have seen in any 4x game. It is very streamlined and intuitive. All the strategy and empire management elements from MOO2 are still in place. The tech tree has many familiar technologies that function essentially the same, but the order in which techs unlock is different. You still have to prioritize carefully and try to balance Infrastructure and military technologies.The main fundamental gameplay difference is on the galaxy map with the addition of starlanes. This is a point of contention for some. I didnt like the idea at first but it is not too much of a travel hindrance as most systems have 3 or 4 warp points. It helps with empire planning. It enables you to shelter your research and economic inner systems by having systems with heavy military instillations on  your  outer borders.Though there are still some minor balance issues but the game devs have been active reading feedback and responding. Rest assured even in its current early access state this is the best 4x space game available.			"

RebootingMaster of Orion is in fact a reboot of the original game, with very fancy graphics and a lot of surprises, most of them are either on the Ohhhh or Ahhhhh side of surprise, but once or twice you might call out Eeeek!What first catches your sight is the immense upgrade of the interface, well actually that is no wonder - given the time between MOOI and now... but the graphical interface offers a lot to players who love the old Master of Orion series. Then your ears might flap, really... voiceactors, good ones and quite through the whole game. Also nice addition is that the old games are included into the collectors Edition.I was astounded as I created my first colony and saw... for each planettype a new in game movie... nicely done, it really makes the game worthwhile - especially since the worlds look so different (I am hoping even for more planettypes - we now know that there are some ridiculous planets out there...) Oh, and the advisors... I played two races (only trying them... not fully playing) and Stego really made me laugh a lot, even if he's repetitive... Things...I have to say, that I am a fan of the original games - and this remake caught me totally on a soft spot.Pros:Some beautiful graphics.Great Voiceacts, you have to hear them to believe it.Marvelous remake of an all time classic.The original games are bundled into the collectors edition plus some additional content!Cons:Governors make this game literally a run through.I still remember how hard it was to beat the space monsters... not so in this version.RecommendedAs I said, I am a total fan for this series, so my verdict might be... a bit overwhelming. Yes the game is great, really... but it's also a bit too casual in some spots. Since the game still is in early access this might change. A nice addition would be racial tech specialities (technologies that can only developed by the race) but I migh also have overlooked them. And of course some additional planetary types... oh, and maybe trying to make some additional races ;-)Never mind I am just rambling. Great Game, if you like 4X games, you might as well try to get some money for this one.			"

								I wanted to love this game, as MOO2 was one of may favourite games of all time.Sadly, while the game is pretty and stable for early access, the actual game play and strategy elements are...bland. It's a pretty bad sign when a new game is outdone by its 20 year old predecessor on several key fronts: race customization, ship customization, tactical combat, heroes, tech tree etc. Hopefully the developers take note of the very consistent comments on this thread and make some significant changes to the game before full release. At present, it just doesn't feel like a true strategy game - it's lacking in the kinds of key choices that absolutely underpin good games of this genre.			"

								First the game is really hard, but once you learn the mechanics, its too easy, You simply avoid early combat by ignoring the AI, tech up, than make huge money, fast mass death ball and sterilise the galaxy.Well its early access, and it feels incomplete and bugged. The game have potencial, hope devs hearing the community and make it something awesome.			"

Early Access Review
								Blowing up the home planets of my most hated arch enemies, that bullied me during the entire game, with a Stellar Converter sold this game for me.If you played Master of Orion II you'll most likely miss the good ol' roundbased tactical combat which is completely gone in this MoO incarnation. Instead you're fighting in realtime on an arena like battlefield.Whereas you could diretly shoot at the enemy planet in MoO II you can't here anymore. Every defense structure is now an orbital plattform that floats direclty on the battlefield rather then firing from the surface of your planet.MoO II veterans may claim the current way battles are handled in MoO feel completely bland and shallow, lacking the diversity of the legendary MoO II battles.Anterans are currently missing too in the game but may be subject for an Addon in the future.Yet the game kind of brings back the typical Master of Orion One more turn feeling, which is a good sign. If the devs release some more content whether as classical Addons and/or DLC I'd totally recommend this game if its on sale since the current price of about 40 bucks is abit hefty for my taste.			"

								When I was in 7th grade a friend gave me a copy of MoO2. I played it religiously, as did my brother. I always picked the Trilarians, and he picked Mrrshan. Good memories, and in recent years I managed to get some of my friends playing. That was, in fact, too ♥♥♥♥ing legit.This reboot is not MoO2. It doesn't try to be. It has big budget graphics and audio, and Mark Hamill is a voice actor. Non of this really matters, though. 2 kicked♥♥♥♥♥ and continues too, and it runs in DosBox. By modern standards, it's dull as hell aesthically speaking. But that doesn't matter either. Masters of Orion has a distinct essence to it. And this modern take captures the spirit pretty damn well. It's not perfect, and it's not exactly like MoO2, but it doesn't and shouldn't have to be either of those. It stands on it's own, and I think that makes it worthy.I whole heartedly recommened the modern Masters of Orion. It's EA, but the developers are active and listening. It's been out for a month as of this writing, and they just released a major update that has addressed a lot of folks concerns. Still no spies, however. Which blows. You should probably expect some DLC down the line, too.			"

								Master of Orion is a fun game but has good and negative things:Good:-stable-online and sigle player-good ship designs(mostly the first one)-the tactical simulator works good-...Bad:-it is too easy, even my first try i was dominating)-you can just vote for yourself in the council and win if you have enough population-the AI was one time destroying my planets but stopped when i produced one ship although they had like 5 ships and were stronger-the diplomacy is ♥♥♥♥ed up, you are winning, you ask for peace and they don't want that and ask you so much money-random events only happen on your planets and a disaster is easily solved-there are no people playing online, can't find a match-too few ship designs and only the first designs are niceBut this game is still in development, if they keep updating this game and improve some little things I am sure it will be a quallity game and a lot more people will buy it and that should solve the playing online problem			"

								If you are worried about its Early Access state, don't. Its completely playable and feels polished. If you are looking for a deep 4x experience however, you won't find it here. Not now or when it's released. Yes, people climb over each other to shout about how its EA and therefore will only get better, but the thing is: its basically feature complete.

Why does that matter? because the game, as pretty as it is, is extremely shallow. Iy you are a fan of the series, and absolutely must experience it, get it on a sale (at the time of writing, the steam summer sale is active and its 30% off). It really does pull on a few of those nostalgia strings the first time you have a colony ship land, or meet a race, etc., and perhaps that is enough to be worth it; But for me that novelty quickly wore off.I do have many pet peeves with the game, many are style choices, immersion-breaking voice acting, clunky interface, and poor AI, but those ARE things that may be fixed as the EA moves on. What is unlikely to be fixed is that there's not really a game there in the first place to bring you back for a second playthrough. That said, if you are a fan of lightweight strategy like, say, mobile games, then this might be a very enjoyable stepping stone into the world of real strategy. It's just not a very big step.			"

												I actually didn't hate it. I played the original and MOO 2 when I was a kid and was so terribly disappointed with MOO 3 that I didn't have a lot of hope for this. I've only played through one campaign so far and the difficulty was way too easy, but I'll know to set it higher next round. The one thing I'm not a fan of is how far down your relationship goes with other races when you don't agree to a deal with them. I know the originals weren't just great with the diplomacy AI, but I really think that could be strengthened and maybe each individual action make less of a difference in overall relationship. Definitely not a deal breaker though, and I would rather destroy my enemies than talk to them anyway!			"

Early Access Review
								The are many who complain about the new MoO, but I really don't get, what they expect from an Early Access.Yes, it's true that the AI is as intelligent as a slice of bread. The game is too easy to challenge a 4x veteran. It's also true, that some features are still missing and the game is far from being finished and polished. But any point of complain I read so far is allready addressed by the Devs, that they are going to work on it eventually. And I believe them. This isn't an unknown independed Developer working on this project in his free time, it's an established company whos reputation might be depending on this game.But what the Devs allready have achieved is a great atmosphere, something most other MoO-like games are missing. The game felt like good old MoO2 from the first minute and soon after I felt into this ""Just one more turn..."" state of mind, that will cause you to loose some precious hours of sleep. That's impressive in this early state the game is in.Even though I belong to those people who would have prefered a turn based combat system, I can tell that the system the Devs have chosen isn't dumb. You can loose a battle against a weaker enemy because you have been careless or you can win against a much stronger enemy if you use the right technology and tactics (and maybe a bit of luck). If they continue to work on the combat as they promised allready it might be pretty decent.The only complain I have are the star lanes. I'm still not a fan of it, allthough I have seen games where star lanes have been implemented worse.Again, the atmosphere of the game is great, it's allready a incredible fun and you can allready see where additional features are planed. I think this game looks very promising and I don't regret buying it. Instead I am excited for every comming patch.			"

Early Access Review
								Pros-Excellent updated Graphics.Real time strategy unlike turn based combat. Starlanes provide a tactical choke point if u plan your space factory military outposts accordingly. Background to races and racial traits make game interesting.Nostalgic feeling whilst playing like MOO2.Fleet control is excellent.custom ship building has an excellent layout and is understandable.Colony screen and other information tabs are in good nick.Still in Early access development phase, game looks promising. Some features such as spying is missing.Cons-No spying window or agents yet. Will be implemmented. The game as stated prior is still in early access but this is what I found.Each race should have a different government system like in MOO2. Like how in MOO2 the Sakraa had feudalism and Klackon Unification. Colony leaders and ship captains would be an added bonus.The AI needs to be worked on I understand its still being worked on.In the colony screen it would be nice to be able to select more than one citizen. And more than one building in the production queue. A gigantic map size would be good, some notable races like the trillarians MOO2 and others from MOO3 would be an added bonus. The freighter system in MOO2 was excellent, unlike every time now u must create a transport nodule and wait over 8 turns to transport 1 population to a distant planet. Overall- 8/10 just a few tweaks needed, even in Early access stage well worth paying the price. It will become better :)			"

												If you're on the fence about getting this game maybe this will help:The Good+ The space battles are a lot of fun to watch. Build big fleets and watch them wreak havoc.+ Has that ""just one more turn"" feeling that's hard to ignore.+ Has several races to choose from to suit your play style, or make your own custome race.+ Surprisingly strong cast (that doesn't get enough use). Seriously, check out the IMDb for this game: Mark Hamill, Alan Tudyk, Troy Baker, Michael Dorn...The Bad- There's no campaign or story mode.- It doesn't reward exploration very much. It would be fun if you could make more discoveries as you go from system to system.- You don't get a lot of options to customize the look of your fleet. You get some, but not a lot.- Diplomacy can be more annoying than fun. Your allies can be very fickle unless you give them everything they want. It's like 'I just saved you from extinction, be a little greatful!'- I wish there was a way to request assistance from your allies in battles.- You can't set custom teams from the start. It always begins free for all.- It's a long game. Be prepared to invest several hours into a singal match. This wouldn't be bad if there wasn't a chance that the match unexpectedly ends. (Check those victory conditions!)Overall= This game is surprisingly addicting, but it's a huge time investment. = Every game feels very similar. It's like Risk, build big armies and smash. Don't expect much more. There are other victory conditions, but they're not nearly as entertaining to pursue.= A similar, but better game in my opinion is Sins of a Solar Empire.			"

								New content coming out for this quite regularly, really captures the feel of the old game. It's great but beware - it's being sold as a full price game and it isn't quite there yet. There are a few bugs, for example - spying, a new mechanic they recently implemented. It used to be one of my favourite mechanics about the Darlok race but it just doesn't really work at the moment (the game keeps saying I stole a Class I Shield, this has happened about 20 times .. yet I still didn't even get it - kinda defeated the point of the race xD).That said, it is early access as it states above. This kind of stuff is to be expected and the game is still really fun even at this early kinda buggy stage - so long as you can work around the bugs ( No Darlok race for me just yet :( )			"

												Re-evaIuating this title after some key gameplay changes and additions as well as some new DLC.I still recommend this to new fans of the series as well as fans of the classics.  If I had to rank them, 1st place goes to MOO2, 2nd - MOO1, 3rd, MOO (this title) and lastly MOO3.  No shame in coming in 3rd to 2 titles that made PC Gamer's Hall of Fame ages ago. After a few updates, MOO has heroes, as well as Gnolam, Elerian, and Trilarian (sp?...I've been playing the series for more than 20 years and I can't spell for beans).  It's beginning to remind me of MOO2, which is one of my all time favorite games, period (Where have you gone, Steve Barcia?!  Any chance Agents of Justice will ever get done?)I played MOO1 back around....94?  And loved MOO2.  This is neither, but, still very fun!I got this early access, and have played through the present build and liked the character that has been added to the game, but, the repetition wears a little thin.  A little.  There is still something very gratifying about amassing a huge fleet and wiping the Galaxy clean of your enemies.Ship design was much simpler and intuitive in the original titles, and I think it could use some more polish as the auto-updating gets a little cross-eyed when you get a new tech.  The auto-design doesn't know how to use specials, particular the space-saving ones that can really make for a powerful, albeit slightly longer to produce, ship.So, you'll want to get in the habit of micromanaging this.Tactical combat is simple...not bad.  I tend not to interfere with auto-combat too often except when it's an advantage to take out harder hitting/high value targets first. That being said, graphics are decent, and gameplay is fun.I think a little more polish with the UI and UX.  Here's what I liked:-Graphics aren't world-renowned, nor is the voice acting, but....they're good!  There are a finite amount of lines of spoken dialogue so that does kinda wear thin after a while (see 'What I didn't like').-The races really have a lot of personallity.  I am going to do a bad job describing this, but it's a jes ne se qua.  Every game I play I always seem to step on the toes of a different race, but become very close allies with other races; this has kept it very interesting for me!-Ship Design (I'll put this one in both categories for different reasons).  It's easy, it's intuitive, it can and probably should be time-consuming and full of micromanagement.  It can make a difference depending on which race, or which space monster, or what *type* of warfare you are conducting (swarms of lots of little ships, massive machines of war, or, my favorite, Interdictor type ""Hunter-Killers"" geared at chasing my prey like Hounds of Hell throughout the galaxy.)Here's what I didn't like so much:-Things do get repetative.  The dialogue from your advisor and AI races.  The gameplay.  The colony micromanagement.  You learn to tune some of it out.  And, I might be deranged, but I actually enjoy micromanaging my colonies, but I'm aware that others probably will not enjoy this.-Ship Design.  As mentioned above, the simplest solution would be to let the game mechanism add new tech automatically, auto-upgrade your fleet, Upgrade, or Scrap-and-rebuild to newer designs.  That's fine and dandy, but the auto-upgrade skips some very important Special Techs.That's all I've got.  I hope you enjoy the game as much as I do, and you'll have an opportunity to pick this title up during one of Steams many sales and deals!			"

Posted: February 20
												I thought I'd recommend this game in spite of its problems. It does have some, but it's worth getting anyway. If it were 60 dollars, no, but at its current price, it's good value. I'll spend this review going over what's wrong with the game (IMO), and in some cases, how to get around those problems.Firstly, one issue is how the pollution system works. It IS a problem. Pollution is tied to both production AND population. Larger planets can handle larger populations. But larger planets dont seem to handle higher levels of pollution. The pollution problem doesn't scale with the planet, but the population does. As a result, larger planets become utterly useless for production. Some of my 20 pop planets could only handle 2 pop units on production. The rest had to be placed on research or food. Counter-intuitively, this means that having LESS than max population on a planet actually makes it BETTER for production in some cases.There are a few solutions to this problem the devs should consider, and one solution already in game. Firstly, one of two things should happen. First, the devs could make pollution not tied to population. Second, and something I like the most, is they could actually make putting pop units on food production REDUCE pollution levels. If your planet is producing pollution because you've maxed out production, you could put some of your research pop units on food to compensate.I struggled for a long time to get any meaningful ship production out of my empire, particularly because i was researching new buildings faster than I could build them. But with the pollution system the way it was, my bigger planets, which rightfully should be the production powerhouses, couldn't produce much. I made the mistake of choosing the core drill research when I came to it in the tech tree. This made a lot of pollution, and limited me to just 2 pop units on production on most of my fully populated planets, even with all pollution countermeasures built. I later made a trade for the core dump research with another empire... This was a god send. CHOOSE THAT INSTEAD. Even with all the production buildings researched (core drill included), and even with maximum population on production, so long as you build a core dump and the other pollution reducing structures, it ELIMINATES pollution from being a problem. I was pumping out fleets at incredible rate end-game.Secondly, I'm not a huge fan of the way end-game works. Basically, when you fulfill a certain criteria, the game ends. You can keep playing if you want, but then it feels like there's no point. You can't continue to win in another area (with the exception of domination, where you eradicate all other species). I won my first game on the galactic counsel. I was looking forward to moving on to fighting the Antarens, but once you win in one area (such as the counsel), the antarens dissappear.This is a missed opprotunity. The counsel president is just an empty title. I was hoping that being elected would give some sort of special power in the galaxy, such as influencing the actions of other empires. I was hoping to use it as a weapon against the Antarens, by unifying the 5 other species against this greater common threat. THAT would've been an epic way to end the game.I get that the ""criteria"" method is how most games like these judge who ""wins""... But honestly, I think that should be changed, particularly in Master Of Orion's case.Thirdly, the AI has issues. I discovered one of these issues when I made the mistake of destabilizing an enemy with espionage. I destabalized them a few times, and then asked my ally to go to war with them. A few turns later, after I'd gotten rid of their colonies in my territory (my end goal there), they offered peace, which I took... My ally continued to fight them because they had been so destabilized.This was at the beginning of the game... By the end, they were STILL FIGHTING. My ally was bent on exterminating an entire species just because I destabilized them over a few colonies. A third species started fighting them too for NO REASON, simply because I had made the mistake of lowering their galactic standing with espionage several hundred turns before that. It made relations and alliances really difficult. My relations with that ally kept dropping because they'd give me an offer to go to war with that species, and I'd refuse. It also hurt my alliance every time I had diplomacy with the species they were at war with... Which was unavoidable since I was trying to get enough votes for the galactic counsel.By the end of the game, that species was nearly extinct, unintentionally, over a spat about colonies at the very beginning of the game. I was left dumbfounded. There really needs to be a way in the game to broker peace between 2 species. I basically used espionage to break the game, and it made diplomacy a pain all the way till the end. This is just one example of how the AI needs work (though to be fair, this is true of a lot of games like this. Gandhi, anyone?)Fourthly, I've read that multiplayer doesn't allow tactical combat... Why? I would love for nothing more than to try out the tactical interface against a human opponent. I'd vastly prefer doing that than using auto resolve vs human opponents. That's when tactics could actually matter in the game. In fact, I think the whole tactical interface needs love. There should be more ways in the game, using cunning tactics to defeat bigger opponents.There's also a method of simultaneous turn taking in multiplayer, which is cool (and would be perfect for the tactical interface). What's uncool about it though is that, if any single player clicks ""next turn"", all other players get a 60 second timer to finish what they're doing before the game finishes their turn.It seems like a lot of their decisions about multiplayer are driven by wanting to move the game as long as fast as possible... I think wargaming fails to realize that unlike with WOT, strategy players LIKE to take their time, and manage their empire... Or at least, I do. I don't like pressing ""next turn"" without knowing that I've done everything I possibly can in that turn. There should at least be the option to turn on tactical interface (rather than auto resolve), and turn off the 60 second timer in game options.Fifthly, there's an issue with performance. AI players take a while to take turns, and I've noticed my character desyncing with their audio a lot when talking, because the animation gets stuck. I have a good computer, so I doubt the issue is my end. I hope they work on optimization in future updates.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I know that sounds like a lot of negatives. The reason I recommend it anyway is because despite all of that, I found it very enjoyable. Furthermore, this game supports mods... And if you can name a problem, odds are, someone's made a mod to fix it. Steam workshop does a lot to massively improve the games on steam, and I fully support any game that takes part in that program. It's vital to beta testing and inspiring potential changes, allows players to customize their experience, fix things they see as problems, and makes it easy for the community to interact with a game through mods.If it weren't for Master of Orion being a part of the workshop, Id hesitate to recommend the game, because of it's problems... But where the price is at, and with the game being extremely customizable with the workshop, it's WELL worth the 30-40 dollars. I never played the original games, so bare that in mind. My review is purely from the standpoint of this as a standalone game... And as a standalone game, it's pretty good.			"

												This would have been an amazing game back in 1995.  Pro: It is really pretty kudos to their artist(s).   Con:  It is an unoriginal, un-inspiring, cookie cutter 4x that is just plain borring.       If your looking for a retro 4x space game with better graphics, then I guess I could recommend this.   For everyone else just about every other new 4x space game on the market does it better. "

												Imagine Master of Orion 2 remade in an extremely sleek interface, good voice actors that completely resemble the appearances of Civilisation 5 and Civ: Beyond Earth.The only downside is the unbelievably SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW traveling speed and fixed warp points allowing bottlenecks. Otherwise good.75/100 , would grade more if slow traveling and diplomacy could be improved.tl;dr, looks like a (super mod) of Civ5 of Master of Orion scenario.			"

								I wouldn't normally leave a review this early in a games development but I really feel I should, just to counter some of the negative reviews it's already getting. I will start by saying that if you want a full featured MoO2 remake right this second, don't buy this early access MoO reboot. If you've already made that mistake, play the original MoO2 that comes with this release until this game is finished before you start pointing out what's missing.-Tactical battles have already improved (they are now bigger) and will continue to do so. -Turn limits have been turned off unless you're in a score based win scenario where they're relevant-Jump Gates mean you can ignore the warp gates, you just have to have an armada ready and send a colony ship to rout your enemy.-There are buildings not yet implemented that “give troops experience”.A lot of the systems that people are saying have been “dumbed down” probably haven't been written yet...I could go on.I wish people would stop giving this game thumbs down for things that could be requested via the development community. This game has months of development left. Leave your feedback on the forums.This game is very well polished for a beta. As it stands it is by no means the worst 4x game out there and I've sunk over 25hrs in to it. By the time it is finished I have no doubt it'll be worth every penny of £30. I'm glad I chose to support this project by buying the early access game but I can understand if you want to hold off until it's a little more finished.			"

								At the moment of this writing, this game is still a work in progress, but as it is, it is a remarkably well balanced and (major) bug free game.  Most of the glitches are with the UI, at the moment, but they are few and minor.  The graphics are stunning, esp if you've played MOO1-3 lately.This, so far, is almost a straight remake of MOO2.  I really don't remember much of MOO3 as it was so bugged I didn't play it long.  The galaxy map is a little different with warp points connecting star systems, and the only way to travel between them at first.  You can research technologies later that help you travel quickly between star systems you own.  Espionage is different as there are only a limited amount of spies you can create, but the system you use when infiltrating other colonies is much better.  Diplomacy is pretty standard compared to most 4X games of today, but still needs some tweaks and balancing.  Tactical combat is in fully 3D space and is fun to watch but I rarely issue orders myself and just hit Auto and watch the fun.As this is early access, there are a few things from MOO2 that are missing that I hope they add.  The Antarans are sorely missed, as there is no real late game threat once you have out-researched the other races and build a formidable fleet.  Also, I'd like to see the Captains and Colony Advisors from MOO2 added as they gave the game a little more flavor and their bonuses were cool.Overall, the devs are doing a great job and I can't wait to see the finished product.

												AI needs work, they are too all knowing, no point in having them explore or even limit their research, they always know where to hit even if they cannot see it. Intercepted a colony ship going to a remote system on a 4 turn lane, 10 turns away with no means to have known the colony ship was there. This happens every time so this is no mere coincidence. There isn't even a reason for them to do this as there is a fleet patrolling near their system, why would they leave their home base exposed just to intercept a colony ship? I am bombing their home planet free of conflict now...???Update after latest update v54.6:Religiously fork out cash for the DLC for content that is already in MOO2, yet this game doesn't even run. This game should still be early access, this surely can't be a full release.			"

								Its in early development and its seeing changes and serious ones over the last month, so let me say something about the game.First the races and customization options now are interesting, and favors picking one area to push and less so in the others, so for example one can do a Merchant focus and outspend the AI enemies or focus on ship size and quality or work on better colonization to expand better and play along those. Now I agree some special technologies need to be added along the species specialty technology and that should not be for custom options so they stand out.Other things I like as a disabled player its very playable for me and with new easy settings can be something you can work on as you learn the game from very easy to much more difficult settings.Pet peevs though they took out minor races for now, I liked them, and sometimes if you pick certain world options they shove you on a starting planets who gravity is to low or high so your penalized I'm of the opinion if you spent points on a super rich and large world you should not be penalized for it since its supposed to help you. And small spiral galaxies would be nice. But they are working on it yet so one must accept some issues with the game. On the plus side the Deluxe Edition does include earlier MoO games free.			"

												 I could not write a review until played the game a few long hrs...  But I'm happy that didn't bit into the hype of the game and waited a few months to get it, Hoping that most of the bugs may be ironed out.  The Cons:    Diplomacy: Look like they ALL love the Humans and the leaders are out of their bipolar pills. Unless you are looking to be ally with all 7 at the same time for Steam Achievements , DON'T do it. Your ""ALLIES"" will be stealing/hacking,  contaminating, striking and revolting your planets no stop. You can't counterdemand any request the AI made.   Espionage: The AI have a lot better chance than you even wit a security level 5 or getting your spies cought even when their security level is ZERO.    Buildings: Some building just don't work ""Space Academy"", ""advance Spy center"" and others. Or don't really give the bonus as the info box said.   Ships: Some look cool, others look like a sex toy. Only 2 choices and 3 Skin paints.  Pros:    Look nice. Like some games lately coming out is just a lot of hype, unfinish and full of bugs. I didn't got the Collector edition and at the moment at the state of the game, never will. I still got the disks of MOO1-MOO2 and MOO3 so paying a extra $19.99 for 1 race is not on my book. I should wait a few more months or get it when the ""Complete"" game is at $20.			"

								CAVEAT: Early Access.This iteration of MOO has the feel. It has the lore. Some of the animations and voice acting (particular the Psilon) is a little cartoony, but nothing too annoying. The mechanics are solid, the graphics are great, and the AI is very wimpy and needs serious work. Combat is good although I warn you it is not turn based, which presents both new opportunities but also requires you to rethink how you do combat. Ship design is a bit less robust in someways -- since you fight in RT trick ships with teleporting boarding shuttle loads are not as effective. The stellar converter is still there. So are doom stars. Right now, I give it a 6/10. I think there's room for improvement, but I also think based on what I see that improvements will happen. Most importantly, no crashes and no bugs encountered (by me at least, I can't speak for others.) "

								The thing to understand before you buy is that this is not a finished game or beta test. The game is currently in Alpha, the phase of development where the prototype is fuctional but major features are not compleate or even notationaly in the software yet. This means that, as it stands, the game can be played start to finish but major parts are missing (spying, several races, ect)Other parts are implemented, but unfinished. Combat is currently playable, but has the hallmarks of a placeholder that will be barely recongizable at release. Many planet discriptions and technologies are likewise placeholders that are likely to be changed. The basic turn-based empire management, planet mangment and map are the closest to done and are beaitful, with high production values in what is finished and a lot of fun. If you are in this just for fun.. Play MOO2? Playing this game now is a lot of fun, but buying now is for people that just can't wait or enjoy being part of the development process.			"

								Feels like a good return to a classic to me. The bones feel right and assuming that there is more fleshing out to be done I have a good feeling on this one. Good:- It feels like MOO.... the look and feel, the layout, the menus all have the right flavor- It has the one more turn feeling- The tech tree and buildings feel like the originalAreas for improvement- Combat. Personally I liked the chess game format of MOO2 and designing ships with this in mind. Not as fond of this combat format as I don't feel I have as much influence on the outcome.- Ship designs. Related to above I am not sure if I can see how my designs can effect the outcome apart from maximising stats. Feels alot like GalCiv as a result.I'm happy I'm on board and look forward to where it ends up.			"

Early Access Review
								It has much promise, but it has issues (gameplay and aesthetic) that I hope the devs are aware of:-When a new tech is earned, and ship blueprints update, the player has to go back in and re-customize the weapon and option layouts that weren't even effected by the new tech. This is unnecessary, time-consuming, and potentially damaging to the game experience if the player isn't diligent and doesn't correct the issue before more units are built.-On the bombing screen, the only bomb name shown is ""nuclear"" even if the ships contain ""fusion"" bombs. Is that aesthetic or a bug?-Diplomacy has (so far) been non-existent from the AI. The only time they contacted me was to threaten. MoO2 wasn't really any better, but I would presume game AI processing has improved significantly since then.-Tactical space combat isn't. I like the idea of more real-time combat, but the tactical combat is more like trying to guide balls of varying size and speed while they are rolling downhill. I can select ships, right-click to set priority targets, (sort of) set a formation, and alter course...but ultimately the ships just turn right back toward the enemy and go full-frontal attack.And speaking of full-frontal attack, the enemy ships just sit there until your ships get close...then they just head toward your ships without the slightest deviation. The obstacles are no more useful than as eye candy, which is really unfortunate.If the devs can make the space combat into an actual real-time, flowing, tactical experience, this game would be amazing. It could garner YouTube videos galore.-Not sure why only so many slots are allocated for production or food, while research appears to have unlimited slots. In MoO2 I liked how one could specialize ultra-rich planets to crank out the ships by putting everything in production.Also, the technology, separate building, and separate (mandatory) ongoing order to share resources intra-planatarily makes little sense. Think how the fictional conversation would go in the game:Planet 1: Hey, do you have extra food sitting around?Planet 2: Yup.Planet 1: Think you could send that to us?Planet 2: Yeah...let me just put *everything* we're building *on hold* and have *all* our production workers fly that extra food of ours over to you.I could accept the tech requirement, and the building (that requires 5BC maintenance), but a production-halting order is unnecessary and just plain dumb.-Not sure why the game has an arbitrary cutoff at 500 turns. Building a decked out titan-class ship can easily take 30 or more of those turns on some of the better planets thanks to the aformentioned limited slots for production.I'll leave it at that, for now.Thank you for reading.

								Never played the older MOO games, but this one seems pretty decent. A very polished EA game that, from my understanding, is going to be fully released by the end of the year or early next year. That being said there are still some things that need to be worked on, but overall I think this game is pretty solid. Pros: +Minimal UI that doesn't omit important info+Decent graphics that are very pleasing to the eye+Ship design isn't overwhelming like most other space 4x games+AI isn't completely 'braindead' as in most 4x games+Tech tree that has 'choices' within most of the mid-late game techsNeutral:Diplomacy is pretty standard for your 4x game.Ship combat is in RTS form, but isn't very strategic. Usually boils down quantity and power. Exploration is also standard for a 4x game.Negative:- Several graphical glitches, but nothing too major- Lack of options when setting up a game- Lack of races (but that's going to be remedied soon)- Silly map creations. Had a couple maps where the only wormholes on the map were bordering systems...Overall the game is fun and is only going to get better with further development.			"

												I must say i was a big sceptic about this MOO reboot, but  in a spur of the moment decision i bought it.And i must say im having  a lot of fun. Its a classic 4x but very well made and balanced. Your every turn decisions feel important, and each aspect of the game seems fleshed out and polished.So in points:+Great long tech tree with balanced techs and giving you a feeling of prgoression and achievemnt.+ Your every turn decisions feel important.+ The AI seems good so far.+ The tactical combats are fun.Ship designing is simple, but very important with meaningful decisions.+ Teh galaxy has enough planets/anomalies/monsters to be interesting and make you expolre to find the bestest planet for your next colony.+ The  defense stations/modules are well balanced and allow you to organise a defense. I noticed many strategy games nowadays have problems with it.+ There is a lot of winks towards old MOO which is nice for old farts like me:)- I dont like the art  direction . I cant say it isnt well done in the style they choose, but for me it got that fantasy pastel  a bit childish vibe that annoys me. Cartoon is fine but you can go Ghost in the Shell cartoon or Gummi Bears cartoon. Assuming  a 4x strategy is aimed at a bit more mature audience , the style baffles me.So for me its a very good game and im glad i bought it.It just all the parts mesh together to create a really fun and relaxing experience.You might have problems with it tough if:1- The very strong art style annoys you even more then me.2- You hate starlanes3- A very well executed 4x standard mechanics doesnt sound good for you, you want something revolutionary.

								I enjoyed this game a lot. It definitely has a few minor bugs. On the major side I see AI needing a lot of work as well as the consistency and various benefits/consequences of the political system. You’ve gone all in on the voice-overs compared to most games. Great job. Now go equally all-in on the graphical side of the game, especially with cut-scenes. IE…*More, better, diverse cut scenes for both current milestones and add epic cut scenes for critical achievements. *Epic fail cut-scenes would have a nice touch as well.*A nice victory video would be sweet. Go even further and embed several victory-videos but only viewable under certain victory conditions.  Regardless of my suggestions this game is very fun, playable and I look forward to the final product. *Played max map on normal, 5 races plus myself, as human and completed the game in 350 turns.

And no, it is not a copy of MOO2, it's a title on it's own, so if you want MOO2 you better don't touch this one and fire up good old DosBox...			"

												I love a good space strategy game but this didn't reel me in like I thought it would. It's very Sid Meier-esk with its tech tree and diplomacy, and I found dealing with other races to be quite rigid and predictable. It's a bit of a slogh with keeping up food, production and tech, unfortunately there's no innovation with how that played out. I tried to play very tech and diplomacy heavy (i'm a lover, not a fighter) but had to fight out a few unwarrented battles which wasn't that exciting.Overall, it's okay. Smooth graphics, soundtrack was nice, a few quirky tidbits but nothing really keeping me there. I'd wait for a sale to get this one, it's a good time waster.			"

												High hopes disappointed.  This is essentially a rehash of MOO-2 with better graphics but a clunkier user interface.  The tech tree is annoying and non-intuitive (plus the race-based tech buffs don't seem to work), system automation doesn't work well, characters are gone and combat--despite being far more difficult to manage--is much less interesting.  Worst of all, the game is simply dull.  A shame.			"

												Master of Orion- The once was king of 4X strategy gaming. After the poor showing of Master of Orion 3 the torch was eventually passed on to the Galactic Civilisations games to keep up the popularity of the space based 4X genre. The question is- does this new version live up to the lofty expectations  formed thanks to the old games? Can it dethrone the now-king 4X of Galactic Civilisations? What does this do right and wrong? Pros: The look and feel:The game really does capture the alien nature of the Master of Orion universe- there is colour, humour and a lot to explore and do. Planets feel alive with their live preview, the ship artwork is unique and defined, while the Aliens seem just as alien as ever. It just works.Music, Sound and Voice Acting: From the moment you open up the game you are met with a powerful score which harks back well to the older games. But honestly where this game shines the most is the voice acting. Don't let the poor voice acting of the launch trailer push you away, there is a star studded vocal cast which really makes you want to vary up who you play and who you are versing. People who normally prefer to always play the human may find themselves rethinking when they hear that the leader is Q from Star Trek and that by playing Humans yourself you are dooming yourself to never hear more of him. Overall everything you do seems to be greeted with more great voice acting, be it reaching a certain ending- participating in diplomacy- or beating the game through one of the victory conditions. The GNN has also got an overhaul, one I assumed would get annoying over time... it did not. I really enjoyed the live commentary of the universe and it really made me wish there was more interesting random events out there.Living Universe: Thanks to their accurate recreation and inclusion of the Space Monsters and Pirates the universe always seemed alive. There was a reason to build a fleet even if you were aiming for a more passive victory type. It felt good to lock down a warp point with a super powerful starbase- defeat a space monster and claim its planet or track down and claim the elusive Orion itself. As you grow in technology as do your systems- you may turn a gas giant or asteroid belt into a planet, upgrade your passive defenses or upgrade your planets into a series of different kinds of ""Uber"" worlds. This is one area where MoO Crushes the current state of the Galactic Civilisations games- and it is likely the best reason to buy this title. The combat cinematics:These are second to none- really spectacular esspecially when you are going up against a large space monster or the guardian of orion... However, the actual gameplay doesn't keep up. Cons:Everything feels- Shallow.: The concept of ""Jack of all trades, master of none"" shines brightly during this game. For every positive point there is another system that just seems laughably tedious and ill-thought out. Sure there are a LOT of systems in this version of MoO- but most if not all of them feel as if they were half baked. Like they would have done better as a dedicated expansion later down the line. A lot of these issues will be outlined below.Espionage:Espionage is a major annoyance and acts as more of a penalty againse large empires instead of a functioning system. It also seems like it is heavily weighted in favor of the AI. It basically just involves the user training spies and sending them out to either their own planets or the planets of your enemies. Spies do not seem to gain experience or get better in any way beyond the points they must earn to do increasingly more annoying missions. You send a spy to the enemy? Chances are it will be caught and you will be asked to stop sending them. They send a spy to you? You MAY catch it and send it back, or your best planet with all the security upgrades may be thrown into revolt. Moreover, the weighting of the diplomacy behind it is just screwed up. You ask them to stop spying? They don't, you get spies from them again right away. They ask YOU to stop spying? Counts as a treaty that if you break basically they hate you for life. The whole system just seems incredibly tedious and gets only more and more problematic as you get a larger and larger empire.Ship Design:This is one area that Galactic Civilisations really just ran with once they started to take the crown. In Master of Orion there seems to be very little reason to ever create a new ship. Not only do they look exactly the same as the auto-upgrading counterparts that you get built for you.. but the amount of choice and freedom on offer is laughable. While I appreciate anything that lets me customise my units, as it stands this system just felt boring now. Not even worth using unless you really wanted to min/max. While in GalCiv 3 you can clearly see and work out what your enemy is focusing on and design a ship to counter it, this one seems very basic. Research:This is not to say that the actual things you unlock are cons- certainly not. I love the variety this game offers as you level up... You learn to build and perfect planets, blow them up and everything in between. No, what I mean is the actual system of research. Most things you research have a correct answer for ""which is better"" but sometimes it is even worse to consider that they don't. While some games lock insignificant percentages behind research walls, this game offers actual tangible things which if you miss out on may just make your game more tedious. Sure, the fact that you can trade for them later is a nice touch... however when one of your traits allows a race to get BOTH of these choices for EVERY CHOICE- things get out of hand. So either you are forced to choose and trade for the rest or you just get given everything on a platter and get to use that to make yourself reign supreme. Either way the entire thing just seems... off. Not enough interesting events:Events are delivered by a really interesting medium thanks to GNN- however they still manage to feel half baked. While sometimes there are cool ones- like the idea of a star going Super Nova- most of the events seem to just be ""Someone gets some cash"" or ""The resource level of x falls"". For a universe that manages to feel so alive in some ways, to feel so dead in this way is more than a little disappointing. Now I am not advocating for a morality and choice system like the awesome one in GalCiv- I just feel as if that if you want to shake the world up- do it in a more fun way. Actually doing combat:The turned based strategic almost ""heroes of might and magic"" style combat found in MoO previously is gone- replaced by a much simpler real time combat system. While it does still offer more control then its nearest competitor- it does not come close to being as good as what people were expecting from this title. For that reason this is listen as a con. Overall:Overall the new Master of Orion is a highly polished, beautiful and interesting game. This however seems highly marred by the fact that so many systems are half baked. What is there seems polished for sure, but what is there still seems often very tedious. Master of Orion feels like a casual and beautiful version of Galactic Civilisations. A first dip in a pool before you go on to play the more complex Galactic Civilisations. Despite this appraisal, I still feel that people will have a lot of fun exploring and playing in this world, so I must recommend it. I just feel as if needs a little more depth. Did it reclaim its crown? No. But it did certainly reclaim a much higher title then I was expecting, and damn does it look shiny.			"

												My impression of this game is, overall, good. Not great, not bad, just good. If you like Space 4X games and enjoy keeping things simple, this is a respectable game to get, and 30 bucks is exactly the price it should be at.The game has a good deal of polish, and it looks and sounds absolutely great. The gameplay is stuff you've already seen before, nothing really stands out about it, standard 4X fare. However, I will say that my major complaint against the game is how simple it is, AND the complete lack of any strategy in regards to planetary building.When I say simple I mean simple. The tech tree is simple, your ""choices"" are pretty easy to make, economy is really easy to get going, things like that. What bothers me the most, though, is that there is no planet space you need to worry about as far as building things, so there is no strategy involved. Usually in games like Stellaris and Endless Space and the like, the planets you colonize have spaces to build improvements on, many times with a certain property to them, that forces you to make choices on what to build, when, and where to put them. The planets in this game have infinite space, and thus the determination of whether to build them comes directly down to 1) whether you really need/want that building on that planet and 2) whether you want to take the hit to your upkeep (don't worry you get tons of money anyway). There is no restriction to any of the buildings except having a few that need certain planetary properties (you can't build X unless the planet is mineral poor, for example).Finally there is a good bit of the combat that needs to be adjusted (why can enemy scouts just ignore my blockades? why are space amoebas so freaking ridiculous in combat? why can't i see my ship health in battles anymore? WHY ARE MY BLUEPRINTS LIMITED TO 5? Blueprints should have no number restriction), but as I said, overall it's a respectable game. If you enjoy 4X games that aren't terribly deep, this is a good one to get for 30 bucks.			"

								First and foremost, this is an early access to the game. Many other reviews seem to forget this or unaware of the definition.You are buying into a testing phase of the game. It is not finished. It is not polished. It is filled with bugs and placeholder art.But the gameplay is good. Really good. It brings me back to the old games. They changed up the gameplay from the originals to have star lanes. These limit the direction you can travel to reach star systems, which means you can create choke-points for your territory. This adds an interesting element to it.I'm looking at this game to have pretty good multiplayer games. I'm also excited for each update of the game before release to see how it progresses. Overall, the game as it is now, is worth checking out, as long as you remember you're buying into the game before it's done and filled with problems that are obviously going to be corrected.			"

Early Access Review
								WARNING: This game is obviously in EA so take my excitement and points with a grain of salt as they represent a changing game. I have always seen Early Access as a horrendous excuse for scam artists to put any shovelware onto Steam. Then Nuclear Throne, Dankest Dungeon, and Master of Orion showed up. Master of Orion is so far a playable game yet what is there is really sublime and demands to be expanded upon throughout its ongoing development.Pros: (As of right now)1. Nicely streamlined for newcomers and has the potential to become deeper.2. The style of the graphics is really appealing.3.Ship designer is cool.Cons: (As of right now)1. Not all the features such as races, victory conditions, espionage, and tactcal battles have been implemented yet.2. Bugs that could potentially hamper the experience. 3. The price tag  for the Collector's Edition. (It really is somewhat pricey).As of right now, i would recommend MOO to any 4X fanatic or a fan of the original 2 games (there was never a third game X3 ).  However, due take in account that it is EA and things could change drastically. #SPACECATS!!!			"

												Bought this game as soon as it hit early access, gave feedback during its developement, read the forums constantly for the last year or more.... hugely disappointed.To be fair, I think the theming is excellent.  I like the stupid robot news anchors.  I love the voice acting.  The graphics are wonderful.  The space combat LOOKS really interesting and fun (gameplay wise it is atrocious though).  The music fits really well.  Each of the alien races have a leader and an advisor, all of which are very interesting and fun (though don't play the bird people, because the advisor is unbearable).  Every race has a set of spies and leaders you can recruit which give you that XCOM feeling of attachment.  I love that each race has its own feel to it, sadly the GAMEPLAY of each race plays almost identical.The first wrong step for the game was not doing Turn Based combat, every other decision from then on was totally botched.  Trying to fit a real time combat system into a game that was ENTIRELY designed around having turn based combat just didnt work.  Every tech upgrade you could get just felt like getting a +1 to the end of the last technology (or a -1 if you don't pick missles, which are the only worthwhile weapon).  Nothing that you research/trade/steal signficantly changes the way you play the game.  Nothing that your opponents do significantly changes the way you play your game.  Essentially, once you have defeated your first neighbor, the game is over, as its just a repeat of defeating each neighbor until they are all dead.Another huge misstep was going away from an open universe design with fuel restrictions to limit your ship travel distance.  In this game you are able to map out nearly the entire universe with your very first scout.  There wasn't any mystery as to where something important might be hiding, or what interesting thing you might find on the other side of that alien territory once you defeated them.  After about turn 100 you've seen everything (in a 500ish turn game, depending on universe size).If only they had hired someone who knows how to make actual turn based games.  Perhaps even hiring someone from the board game industry to iron out some of these obvious problems.  The GAME part of this game is bad.  They tried, they really did - but they either didn't have enough time, or simply didn't have the talent to pull it off.I would give this game a 3/10.  Wouldn't recommend anyone buy it, even on sale.  I think, if you can stand the oldschool graphics, just buy MOO2 - you won't regret it.			"

												I'm an old fan of MoO2. This remake is one of the most decent turn-based 4X strategies. Yet, it does not fulfill MoO title contract to me. I definately hope that WG will keep tuning the game, but for now I have to vote a NO.Problems:1. The most glaring - lack of tactical combat. Half of MoO is the combat. I do not care for glamorous graphics if I can't properly control the combat. In it's current form only AI combat can be used. Fook the camera, fook the graphics. Make it 2D even, but make it a proper tactical combat.2. Badly inefficient economics - always lacking income even with just the basic buildings built.3. Lack of freighters and general food abundance makes all races feel the same. Rock-eating silicoids are not too  different from any other race. Just spam colony ships and get each and every planet you can get. Races just don't feel unique.4. Minor, but annoying - combat evaluation vs monsters - it's just missing. I've built a fleet of 10 ships to attack amoeba - combat evaluation tells me I have 100% chances to win. Attack! Not a scratch on the amoeba, my fleet is annihilated. 100 turns later with quite significant tech updates - same fleet, same result. 100 more turns later - yet again. I'm voting for strong monsters, it makes it more interesting, but evaluator should be fixed, particularly to account for shield damage reduction.5. Many additional modules is nearly impossible to evaluate (like modules, disrupting rockets) - they do not change stats of the ship, take up precious space, increase cost, and without tactical combat - I can't see their result. Either make a tactical combat, or make modules change ship stats, or remove them. 6. Same as #5 but towards point defense / antimissiles.7. Overally, gameplay feels sluggish and slow. Like a simple thing - population management - it cannot be done from colonies overview (empire). Like too many notifications (dangerous fleet for every move of enemy factory, population rised for every colony of 100+ colonies empire, etc), like showing every move of a monster in nearby star system. It all takes precious seconds, that build up into wasted hours.8. Tech tree feels soo civ-like that it's annoying.			"

Early Access Review
								At least in early access, this game doesn't offer anything that other 4x games don't offer. All the familiar features are there; tech trees, colony ships, alien races, etc. However, what it does offer is streamlined play: everything that is implemented works smoothly, and a lot of the tedium of other 4X's seems swept away.  I actually liked it better than I liked GalCiv for the sheer scale of things it didn't make me manage. If you've got a friend you're trying to introduce gently to 4x's, this is the one: it's stable, brightly animated, and not as complex as most.Things I'm hoping they'll fix before taking it out of early access are:Diplomacy. Despite having spend full on effort in my second game trying to keep my diplomatic relationships positive (making treaties, giving in to demands, conducting myself in ways game lore might suggest would placate this species) my relationships with the AI's always ended up extremely negative. Also, once they went negative but I became mighty, there was no diplomatic option to bully them for specific planets or technologies as they had bullied me. Perhaps it's not implemented yet, but my one option to gain a concession from my enemies was to declare war and start stomping their worlds.Pollution warnings. I kept getting these for the first world I colonized that got heavily polluted, even though that world wasn't polluted any longer. It was another world, but apparently because the pollution warning had locked on to the first polluted world, any pollution warnings anywhere got me a dialogue box that dragged me back to the first world. Annoying.Coherent AI response to overwhelming force. I had such a technological edge by the end of the game that I could steamroll any of the other races. But nonetheless, two of them declared war on me, one when I outmatched her 5:1 and another when I outmatched him 8:1. They also never formed alliances against me, possibly because relationships default to bad so quickly they all hated each other.Diverse voice messages. They hired good voice talent for the game, but unfortunately the diplomatic speeches don't vary much. They differ based on your relationship (usually very negative) but within a relationship level they repeat exactly over and over. If you're going to go the distance and hire voice, have them, you know, spice it up a bit. "

A reimagined retake on a cherished legend of 4x brought to the modern day, with all the whimsical charm masking an aged, arguably now outdated 4x formula that delivers the chops where needed, but feels lacking in parts.+ A bright, preppy and pretty revamp of a legend, carrying forth the art direction into a new era.+ High profile talent carries forth excellent voice-acting production, giving more character to each race.+ Familiar, solid mechanics from the originals mixed in with some more modern conveniences solidify the foundation this game stands on.+ Highly-refined UI features (partly thanks to a period of Early Access testing and feedback) make this the easiest-to-approach 4x in recent memory.- The new fresh re-take on familiar art direction from the originals may not jive well with fans of the original.- As highly talented and iconic the cast of V/A, this does not save it from odd quality mismatch issues present  in recording, or less-than-stellar writing.- The old MOO 1-2 formula in this day and age (even adding into the mix of more modern concepts such as a tech tree and revamped espionage) does show its age in today's world, especially against direct competition, relegating the game to more of an entry-level 4x.- The more restricted approach of the game makes it less of a personal game and instead more about it being a game of MOO. Things such as renaming systems or planets partially supported in v49.3, same tech tree for all, only one form of FTL, and iconic races make games very formulaic, unlike more modern recent offerings allowing for personalization and variability.

Early Access Review
								Keep in mind, at the time of this writing it is still in early access and a lot of finished features aren't complete. Initial impressions: I like how this beta felt pretty polished from the beginning. They have a great base game the feels like the old masters of orion. The system is easy to follow, A lot of the old research technologies were there. I would have liked to see some more tech however. I felt it was a good start of a tech tree, however playing different races didn't feel different. Asside from the ships looking different, that was about it.  As of this writing I have only played psilon and humans. What I would like to see improve: Ship combat in this game is kinda weak. I didn't feel there was much strategy to it other than ship priority. The real time combat system made it feel like picking priority targets was pretty much all you could do. I miss the turn based combat myself. The models look amazing though!I haven't read what the developers are going to do yet, and what hasn't been implemented. Some things I never found like spying for example. I felt the diplomacy section was a bit lacking as I couldn't select some colonies or techs.This game has great potential and I am looking forward to seeing what they do to improve it. However as it is right now its little more than a remake of the origional Master of Orion and little else.			"

												Overall I won't say it was a waste of money (it was good for a play thruogh) but I was greatly dissapointed. The game has little replay value and the graphics are ho hum. Cut scenes are not memorable and basically feel to be a waste. Voice acting is nice but quickly gets ignored. Tactics? Still looking. Tech tree was poorly thought out. Ship/class design was more or less non-existent. System development the same. I'm left with the impression that the game is a threadbare frame that will never be fleshed out.Bluntly an old tired game called Space Empire 5 beats this one hands down. In fact I'm playing another scenario on it after deleting Master of Orion from my HD. I would recommend that whatever company attempts another try at this genre they first look at SE5 for inspiration or preferrably buy out the rights from (I've been led to believe) the garage coders that created the space empire series.

								First off I recommend this game based on the potential it clearly has to be a classic turn based strategy / 4x space game. If the developers put some manhours into this thing it can be great, right now it's just good - and in alpha of course.The gameplay right now is fine and I haven't noticed any bugs - This is a pleasant surprise. The galaxy map is set up to pen you in and make you wait for technologies or fight your way out, Read starlanes, dead ends, unstable / unusable starlanes and space bases that block passage unless you have open borders. Conversely you can use these features of the game to quickly pen an opponent in to a small area and keep them weak.  The tech tree and planetary screens are easy to understand and use, although there is a weird quirk in the tech tree: Some technologies you research have two different upgrades on them but by reasearching the tech you only get to pick one of the upgrades, the other is forever excluded from you. Perhaps they intend you to get them through espionage or maybe it's just supposed to make everybody's tech a little different. Either way it's weird but interesting and I'll have to see how I like it after a while.  Upgrading ships is easy, a single click upgrades the design with the latest goodies and a single click upgrades existing ships that are in orbit of a planet you own.By far my biggest complaint is just the visual appeal of the game. It's absolutely awful. Everything is black and dark and two dimensional. Yes space is black but space is also amazingly colorful and beutiful. For god's sake wargaming, choose the colorful and beautiful, not the black; for example you can click on your planet to get an overall view of what it's doing, guess what, 4/5ths of your planet is covered in night (facepalm). And get rid of the two dimensional feel! For example, you can click on buildings on your planet, like a marine barracks and all that happens is a small tooltip comes up with a crappy two dimensional image of the barracks and a paragraph about what it does. How about bringing me to a 3 dimensional barracks with soldiers and tanks running around and letting me look inside multiple buildings and talk to advisors in those buildings? This game has too much potential to be so visually and auditorilly boring that people may not be able to sit through 100 turns.I still recommend the game but beware of the boredom if you like your games to give you a feast for your eyes and ears.

								I never played the original Master of Orion games so I don't know if I'm missing out on some nostalgia value, but this is a fairly average 4X. It's polished, pretty, well presented (and would be even if it was a final release) but there's not much that sets it apart from others in the same genre. It's good but hard to recommend if you already have a few games like this. Hope to see a few features implemented that make it really stand out.			"

												If you have nothing but time on your hands and you want a slow game, this is the game for you.  The AI is weak due to being extremely predictable.  In fact, no matter what race you select, the AI will still act in the same predictable manner which is really annoying.  I tried and tried to like the game, and sadly I am past the point of a refund.  Unless you can get this game for under $5 or free, you'll be throwing your money away.			"

												Ask yourself one question.  If this game was called something other than ""Master of Orion,"" would you buy it then?  The hate towards this game because it wasn't some kind of modern, HD remake of MOO is crazy.  This game is solid 4X fun.  The graphics are great and it has a solid interface.  The combat is real time in a similar vein as Endless Space.  The game is otherwise turn-based as you'd expect.One more complaint I want to address is day 1 DLC.  I do not understand why people think every ounce of content a developer creates should be a free update.  Really?  If I pay you to do a job, should I continue to expect free work from you for eternity?  Day 1 DLC that puts some players at a significant advantage in a competitive environment or that substantially alters the game is pretty crappy but adding another faction for example?  Come on.  Buy it or don't buy it but don't downvote the game over something like that.Anyway, the game is solid and fun and you should buy it.  If you want to play classic MOO, that's available on the store, too.			"

								I'm really liking this game so far.  I've played MOO and MOO2 over the years (and MOO3 for 5 minutes before quitting because it was awful) and have been pleasantly surprised by how faithful the devs are staying to what made this a great game from the beginning.I have a few complaints as of v43.6 that will hopefully be invalid as development proceeds.  Currently each game seems far too short, I'd love to be able to choose a short game or a weekend-long space empire building fest.  I'd rather have turn based combat, but I won't cry about it.  Designing ships still seems unintuitive and I usually skip it and let the AI do the upgrades for me.All in all, as a long time MOOer, you're doing a great job guys!			"

												Rather dull game with not much content (but a load of DLCs, already four and probably more coming). I a very big fan of MoO1 and MoO2. And I'm deeply disappointed by the realtime battle system, which was the worst thing in MoO3 and of course it HAD to be copied into the ""remake"". The ship design system is also rather unsatisfactory. If you need a real good space 4x game, go for ""Distant Worlds"" or ""Stellaris"".			"

												I was a big fan of the first 2 games of the series.  Although my memory has faded a bit, but I feel this MoO has succeeded in capturing the overall look and feel but with a nice new coat of paint.  I felt the design of space is much better than the original 2 games with the ability to create your own warp gates through research and this allows you to build them how you please.  MoO: Conquer the Stars has great voice acting from a spectacular crew.  The UX was amazingly well done, fluid design. the Empire screen is incredibly helpful in managing all your planets from a single window without having to go to each planet. The normal length of a game is maxed at 500 turns, I was able to complete the research victory within 425 turns with Psilon on my first game.  I had a nice mix of industrial type planets and good research type planets.  Plus I was able to terraform a couple of the highly rich planets into Terran and Gaia type planets as well.MoO3's major short coming for me was the overall length of a game and the incredibly large amount of things to research that were added on top of what I thought was already quite large before. I remember going 250 turns into a game on MoO3 and barely making headway into a single game.  I can't remember what the max turns were if there were any at all, because I never finished my first game.  I uninstalled and went back to MoO2.  it was so bad to me.I really enjoyed this game and will be playing it quite a lot, It runs really great on Linux by the way. "

								I barely played 2 hours, but here is what I got from the game:It's very fun, It's a very interesting game, especially for a fan of the Civilization games. It has that feel to it of managing resources, income and maintenance that feels like a galactic based Civ game. And just like in Civ, I suck at this game aswell.Battles are fun, even while being Real-Time. The whole universe looks very cool and engaging. The game really makes you want to explore the universe.It runs good, not excelent, not bad. Although for some reason, the graphics seem to be kinda lackluster and there is no real difference between the 3 best options, plus there isn't a custom graphic configuration.The things I didn't like: The fact that I'm restricted until well into the game to really explore the universe. I'm limited by those warp thingies that can't be crossed until a fairly advanced tech is researched.AI is SH¡T overly agressive, I colonized a planet that another race didn't even explore yet, they are mad and they declared war already. Minutes after starting the game.It should be clear from the get go how does the planet's characteristics affect your race and your colonies, which makes for bad mistakes that can ruin a game.Plus, some VERY important info, such as a planet's gravity, can't be seen in uncolonized planets unless you close the overview and go to the full list of planets you discovered. Inconvinient at best.I guess my biggest issue with this game is the BLATANT LACK OF EXPLANATION. Nothing is clearly stated, which can mess up real bad a game. Just because you have to go the extra mile just to know something so basic as to how to establish a trading rout. Ships automatically jump straight to the enemy's face unless you're really quick and prevent them from doing. It kinda takes away my strategic skills if on RTS the ships automatically jump to their deaths.Land invations are♥♥♥♥♥♥ no further question. That should need a MASSIVE rework.Despite all these issues, the game is really fun. I highly recommend this game. But it is true that the game is still kinda ""green"". There is a lot that needs to be implemented. But I have faith it will be very good as a final product.			"

												pros:+charming art style+starlanes help focus the action+tactical combat is fun+just one more turn....Cons:-split tech choice descisions can be vague- some vague UI annoyances-very limited ship designs-somewhat limited # of anomoly/eventsThis is a more straightfoward 4x compared to most 4x games, but i like it because its not overwelmingly complex. I unfortunately missed the original MOO 1-3, but i like the base game enough to get the collectors edition upgrade so i can enjoy the orignals. the only thing im not too impressed about the CE is the Terrans ships are just reskinned red of the human faction ship models.  Tactical combat is fun, but at first it feels way too fast but there are speed options and pause if needed. I really wish there was more than 2 variations of ship models per frigate, destroyer, etc. as there isnt a actual ship builder like GalCiv 3, but mods can fill the lack of variations. there are some tactical options in combat, such as dodging enemy missiles/fire by hidding behind asteroids, but for the most part fleet engagements are really determined by the quality of your weapos/defenses and a combination of ship numbers or higher quality ships. Starllanes are cool in that they help funnel fleet engaements, which can be very helpful for the AI because there is only a few directions where they can attack you, which in turn forces head on battles and really cuts out the cat and mouse other unrestricted 4x games have.Empire/colony management is very easy, and so is the pollution and gravity mechanics; you can leave it on autopilot, but you really should manage all pop assignments and production choices to get the most out of it. There are some UI annoyances, like when adding a modification to a weapon, such as making your missiles hardened to resist point defense. The tooltip says the weapon will take 50% more of its base space on your hull, but the weapon card will only show the base vanilla space cost; forcing you to do the calculations your self. Some tech descriptions on the tech tree were cut off on the top of my screen, its little UI stuff like that that can be annoying, but its all minor.I definety recommend this as a rts and a 4x fan. Especially If you can get it during a sale, keep in mind that unlike alot of other games with dlc factions, this game doesnt allow you to face off againist them as AI unless you own the dlc, same goes for terrans if you dont own the CE.

Having played through EA1 to EA5 I must say that the game is steadily improving and through a series of tweaks the game has gone from rough and cold to fun and engaging. I want to play just another turn to try out new tactics, ship designs and to see what will happen next.The revamped food and colonization plus an extreme difficulty has really improved my play experience.Watching 50 ships go at it with missiles, guns and shields in one epic battle is just plain awesome. It is not turn-based but still allows some controls and it is both quick and cool.I look forward to the next updates and I know that the developers will keep listening to relevant input and keep tweaking the game through EA until it is just right.

								Taking into account that this game is still in its alpha phase, I am loving it. I spend most of my time playing Space games and the few that truly keep my interest over the ages have been Endless Space and Master of Orion 2. The flaws that made Master of Orion 3 boring, dull, and overly time consuming effort spent in the micro managing department are gone. I was skeptical over the introduction of space lanes but after playing the game for a bit I feel that the space lanes do nothing to hamper the gameplay and the ability to construct Military stations at the entrance of these lanes that you control give me a feeling of security. No longer can random races travel my territory if I do not have an Open border policy with them. The space battles are solid and for what it is( Alpha ) I am overly pleased.

								Is this game Master of Orion 2 with updated graphics? No.Is this game *better* than Master of Orion 2? Better is subjective, I very much doubt it will be as iconic as MoO2 was.Is this a promising 4X game? Yes.There are a lot of people on the forum slamming this game because it isn't a carbon copy of MoO2, MoO2 was a great game but if people just want MoO2 they should probably just play MoO2. The developers have made if very clear that this is a re-imagined MoO, if you like your MoO as it is and don't want it to be re-imagined then this isn't the game for you and it was never going to be the game for you.The game is presented very well, it is easy to get in to, the UI is intuitive, the mechanics are clear, management is easy. The AI needs work, the different races don't feel that different and there are a real lack of victory conditions right now but all of these things are listed by the devs of things they are working on.There is still a lot of work to be done on the game before it is at the level it should be which is why it is in Early Access but the game right now works and looks good which is something you can't say about a lot of Early Access games.

								It isn't very difficult at the moment but this game has a lot of potential. My first game ended in a diplomatic victory after about 2 hours. The mechanics are solid but there is alot to be added. I'm looking forward for what is to come. Hopefully they don't ♥♥♥♥ it up.			"

One of those         = ""as soon as you go OVER HERE, you get attacked THERE"" or         = ""as soon as you start to build a starbase, it will get attacked"".

								I've been playing MOO, looks pretty good, however it's missing some stuff (not because it's EA, but basic stuff like): + Battles look nice+ The game overall looks very polished+ production / food / research system looks very cool, if you assign people, your overall productivity / worker decreases. Very logical and new, a like it a lot+ Research tree is pretty long and nice. I also Like the fact that at somepoint you have to choose between 2 or 3 of the real applications of a certain theory. Much better designed than choosing from two fields imho. + Colony screen looks good, I would however like to have the pollution shown in the empire screen. There are couple of bugs there with the notifications of pollution, it tells you you have a polluted planed and it jumps to another planet, I guess it will be fixed. +espionage... nice concept+ trade treaties... good way to make some extra money if you have the capital- I would like to have a trade concept where you can transport food. There is an export / import system but It's minimalistic- Something that a lot of 4xgames do not understand. Food is not the main driver of reproduction in a colony. Food is only a show stopper (law of the minimum), if you don't have it, but lots of food does not mean more people. Look at Europe... lots of food, but stagnation. - Ground battles suck, building ground military sucks, I want to be able to control the pace of building my ground forces- Cannot transport people from the empire screen... hello? MACRO much? - AI may still need some improvement, but they already did a big step			"

												I was going to make a full review of this game. Recommending it. Till I found out that there is no tactical combat, and only auto-resolve for battles in multiplayer. Until that changes I can't possibly recommend this game. If you want to play a MOO with autoresolve, just play FreeOrion, which is, yes, a free game. You'll be better off than playing this game in the current state. Or simply play one of the classics.Again, there is plenty of good things in this MOO, and it's ok to play a few times in single. But with a multi without tactical combat, or at least the ability to watch the battles in spectator way. The game just isn't worth the price tag. It's a good start. A base of a game to start from and add to it, perhaps in an expansion. BUT, the fact that there is autoresolve only in multiplayer makes it targeting a much narrower group of players who have many other titles to choose from if they wanted an autoresolve driven experience.So I have to sadly add MOO to the list of failed space 4X games that didn't live up to their full potential. If you want an actual 4X in space done right. Check out:Sword of the StarsEndless SpaceMOO 3 (Strawberry/Vanilla/Tropical modded), MOO 2(Galciv 3 could be a great choice too, but since I haven’t played it yet I can’t really recommend it)Otherwise today's 4X games, keep being released either with no multiplayer at all, or with this kind of crippling decisions to make it autoresolve only. This niche of players, who want to enjoy what was a standard 20 years ago - space 4X games with multiplayer and tactical combat. Before this “less is more” ideology came about and ruined franchises like Command and Conquer. Must just bite the bullet, and realize that today making games like Sims is more profitable than actually making good space 4X games. Or so it seems. This is not just the problem of this MOO. It's the problem of whole industry as you can list all good space 4X games on the fingers of both hands if not just one hand on Steam. Sadly.EDIT:In addition to the above. This MOO's community is very toxic. Filled with 12yos and trolls. People on the LoL and CS level. Yes, it's that bad. You post a review, or you write a suggestion on forums and get trolls attacking you ad hominem, insulting you, saying f you. Maybe it's because it's done by Wargaming, and people from World of Tanks are here? Or is it because all the adults and actual MOO franchise fans left this failure long time ago after the end of EA? I don't know. But this new Orion's community is nothing I'd recommend anyone getting into. Best avoid it and go to places where you can actually spend quality time with adults instead.EDIT2:Some UI related things also make you cringe. There is no sitrep. Instead we get icons above end turn button. That you can't filter with the priority of important and less important stuff, they are all displayed in line. And you then ""dismiss"" each one of these. And since there's no sitrep list, you can't bring them up again, unless you reload the game.GNN news can't be paused and when skipped they don't give any summary of what they were about. You can turn them off completely. But that's all you can do about it. So if you happen to be busy or get a phone calll at the time the GNN news plays... well, there's no DVR option to repeat it and no summary, no sitrep. Which again is an example of lazy design of the UI that might be ok for a mobile game but not really for a PC game.EDIT3:Might be because I'm playing not on the highest difficulty setting at this point. But so far the AI is very dumb (so some people keep saying this is a single player oriented game... well, then it sux even more because AI is very dumb). Example that you can always replicate. Fly with your fleet to the enemy system. What will the AI do? Instead of putting their fleet in a stronger position, say, to defend the homeworld. The AI will move ALL the forces from the homeworld, to meet you at the warp point. Where you can first take out the fleet, then move on to the homeworld and take out the space station and other defenses without their fleet around. Yes, it's that bad. I also remember in previous MOOs, especially MOO3 AI was pretty aggressive from the get go. While here AI is camping, sitting idly and attacking you only if they randomly get a cue for it. So the game feels way too easy and with no pressure put on you.EDIT4:Found more balance issues today. So turns out that when you get a truce with an AI faction, you guys can't have any battles for the duration, right? So how about all the fleets and outposts blocking the warp points during the truce? Simple it's very one sided favoring the dumb AI. During the truce:AI can pass your blockades (outposts, fleets stationed and guarding the warp point). BUT you can NOT pass the said AI's blockades yourself. Making a ""truce"" with AI simply ""Give AI some space"" deal. Ridiculous.			"

												I recently purchased this on sale. I've also been a fan of MOO since the first, a fan of the 4x genre since forever.I do enjoy this game but why did I not recommend this game you wonder?Because for all the things they did to improve, the designers left out quite a bit that made this game unique and a loving title.The new Master of Orion title is clearly built for a more ""theatrical"" experience. Plenty of cutscenes, camera angles in fighting (much like the much maligned MOO 3, but improved honestly), and a plentiful voice cast list.However for all that multimedia spectacle, the game itself is rather shallow compared to earlier MOO titles and even 4x games that came after (i.e. Stellaris).The Terran Khanate, a new faction, is only available if you purchase the Collectors Edition. Other races that were in the second title won't be in game until DLCs. These can be forgiven if they're recreating the first, but the game's ability to play should have been updated. The games ability to keep track of ships is rather clunky, so is the ability to track colonies. Though you CAN rename systems that's pretty much it for customization.Customizing races consists of picking a ""gene"" (one of the player template names) and picking your traits. So less creating your own race and more just tweaking an existing one.Despite all of this I could see someone new to the 4x genre cutting their teeth on this, but then either putting it down later or picking up more polished games (i.e. Stellaris).This game is no means a travesty like Master of Orion 3, but it clearly is built more for the cutscenes and presentation more than gameplay. Which is why, though I might enjoy it in small spurts, I cannot recommend for players.Truth be told this revamp of the original title, complete with setbacks the original had, only highlight how things evolved after it (the original) was released. This title had the chance to take some of the original components and bring them into a design fit for the modern 4x experience, but rather adhered to both the old charm and limitations of the original. I cannot support fully such an ideal.			"

												After the latest patch I can't really recommend this game. They changed the pollution system, which was actually pretty clever and a nice change from MoO 2, and turned it into something that just doesn't work as well as the previous system. Combine that with the changes they made to creating custom races and I'm just not interested in this game anymore. The custom race generation was already a bit tepid and the changes they made exacerbate this issue rather than resolve it. There is hope through mod support, though I would stay away from this one until the mod community grows a bit more.			"

												I'm rewriting my review. Originally I had given this game a resounding no for its lack of adherence to the moo formula but I have to hand it to the devs for listening to their community. They fixed the racial traits, random race picker, tech tree issues and many other things. This game is now far closer to the MOO formula we all know and love. And while I'm still not a huge fan of the RTS ship combat I understand that this is a new entry in the game and they have to mix things up somewhere. If they just carbon copy moo2 with updated graphics then its not a new entry its an update. I do really like what they have done with the pollution system on this version though. In other MOOs a portion of your production was lost to pollution clean up. In this version you have to burn turns of production to clean up your pollution. You have to ballance between production and clean up. The one major thing that I think is still missing is the ship refit feature, in previous moos you could take an outdated ship park it at one of your planets and spend production to refit it with more modern tech. The only way to do that in this version is to spend mass amounts of BC which makes it almost not worth it. I'd rather sacrifice my old ship to the guardian and build a new one in 20 turns then spend 2800bc on an upgrade. Would be nice if i could spend production on that instead of money. Other than the RTS combat and that flaw if you like MOO give this bad boy a shot.			"

								Here are some things that im sure alot of people are concerned about:- a larger map size- make the tech tree similar to MoO 2 - more ''choose only one'' techs- make the player races more unique like in MoO 2- more options in the game setup similar too MoO 2- more cutscenes like an opening cutscene for the game and a stellar converter cutscene and a cutscene or actual tactical combat for ground combat- more ship design options- i reeally dont like how you are able to scout the whole galaxy from the beginning of the game without even having to research anything- tactical battles are terrible, bring back the classic turn-based battles or have an option for real time or turn based battles- replayabilty lacks because of non-unique races and the terrible tactical combat and planets- star lanes are one of my most hated things in this game, they force you to explore only in some directions and sometimes in only one direction, at least have an option to turn those off- more random events that make the game more interesting- ai improvements- freighters were a great part in MoO 2- the story line is pretty much gone without any antarans etcRight now i am not recommending this game until they make some serious changes that make MoO 4 feel like what we wanted MoO 3 to be like!

								I played Master of Orion since I was a kid. I liked of the Master of Orion 2 the quite dark atmosfphere. Here in the new version of the game, this atmosfphere has been a bit lost. However, I like the decision of removing the turn based combat with the more real time combats. I think also that the game is in the right path and I am sure the developers will do their best to improve it before the release date. There are only a couple of things that really disappointed me. 1- The star system really contains few planets. I would have liked more planets in each star systems and a larger variety of events.2 - I think the developer should make their best to make the universe more kind of living (e.g. Antarans, autoctones civilazations... in summary  more events  and maybe a story line about the Antarans). I will update my review in the future.			"

								This is a very promising early, yet polished, version of a sequel/fan-service game for the Master of Orion series.  If you like old school 4X, you will enjoy this title, although remember that it isn't quite finished yet.  What we have is a very polished early access game that is very playable and fun.The most controversial point is the way that the combat is handled, which is similar to, say, Sword of the Stars, rather than MOO2.  Some like, some dislike, but be aware that this is how it is, and know thyself, in terms of whether this is a gamebreaking issue for you.I am enjoying the game, and so I am recommending it.  It's a fun reiteration of the franchise, and a nice addition to the 4x genre.  Thumbs up.			"

No matter how many computer players there are I always loose; I really believe the engine needs tweaking. Another problem I have is that the game dosen't let you play on even though another race in the game has won; this was one of the main problems I always had with the earlier versions of ""Master of Orion"".  On a positive note the game no longer crashes.Program crashes very regularly, and in serious need of patching. May want to hold off in purchasing until fixed. The game itself is a great version of a stragity exploration game and will be an excellant way spend hours of time playing once fixed.			"

												I would not recommend this game for the price because it far too basic. There no really diffence between the races. Sure there are diffences like the spiders make more and the science guys get all the tech when the choice of tech come up, but they don't change one play style. Take Endless Legend and throw out the cult(one city only) and Nerco(only war) since they far out. The rest still have major traits that will effect one's playstyle like the valter have a huge boost to science, but they need science to get that extra science so they will hunt out snow areas because they have the best science or reserch tech that allow science to be gotten on areas that don't already have science. Meanwhile Master of Orion's science guys get extra reseach and bonus tech. There no drive to get one planet over another beyond what another race would look for because they are the same. The rock guys are the only race which has anything near this quailty because a lava planet is good for them while very poor for everyone else. Also the tech trees are the same for everyone. Not really an issue, but when the races are so alike in mechicals, I needed something.The tech tree had no game changer. No moment of 'I can now make use of this.' or 'Now I have a counter to that race's ships.'. It all just numbers. That would be fine, but once again, MoO needed something good and the tech tree fails.Planets are boring. They have low, normal or high graivty and maybe a +2 resoure that can't be improved. There also size(how many people), Bio(food) and ore(making). It doesn't matter, just build the same order of building.Spying never been good in any 4X game I've played and MoO has not changed that. Moving on.Fighting...................................there it no strategy here, just keep all your ships in one or two fleets, throw them at anyone weaker in numbers then you. Run away from the stronger till they have to chase you into a spacestation then fight.So, not worth £23. Far too basic in mechical and the art not much better.			"

This is by far the best feature of the game.The game is playable, there are still some balance issues, texture issues, issue issues. But nothing that really breaks the game (except the occasional crash xD).

												I was very disappointed in the racial traits menu.  I designed a lithovore, tolerant, lava breathing, pollution immune race.  You would think they would thrive practically anywhere.  You would be wrong.  I had a large colony on a swamp planet.  I thought pollution immunity meant, well, pollution immunity.  However, after a while the biome degraded and now the planet had a smaller max population.  Doesn't seem like they are very immune to pollution to me.  Also, why should a jungle planet yield a higher population maximum for this race than their preferred 'inferno' it makes no sense.  I wanted to like it.  I really did.  I have played every master of orion game.  2 is the best.  This one is lack-luster at best.			"

I can't recommend it as it is over too quickly. The game feels short and with so few races and differences, it has little replayability. The universe feels cold and empty of things to do. It's so limited by start lanes, unstable wormholes that artificially divide the game until a certain tech is reached, and planets you can basically colonize regardless of species only limited by resources and food. It's a shame, it has had a legendary run as a franchise. Maybe I'll try it again with more content/DLC and workshop add-ons. Right now it's a yawn, start to finish.			"

								MOO2, Star wars: Empire at War, and Civ 5, are 3 of my top 5 favourite games I've ever played.This game is like a love child of all 3. It has the classic MOO2 feel, with the modern day mechanics that the other 2 have brought us.This is the game that MOO3 should have been all those years ago (still to this day the only game I've ever returned).The voice acting is top notch (and if you take a look at the cast, you'll see why!).The graphics are crisp, the interface is intuitive.The tactical battle introductions are amazing, however the battles themselves are pretty much pre-calculated (IE, it's pretty obvious who will win). One feature from SWEOW they carry over is the cinematic view of the space battles, love it!For an early access game, it is incredibly bug free. There are some very minor bugs I've hit, but they're not game crashing by any means and easy to get around.The only other complaint I have is that there aren't more leaders, and one of the key features (custom race) is not yet available. Once the game fills out more, this will be right up there with Civ 5 as one of the best games I've ever played.I would highly recommend this game, I've already completed 1 game, and keen to start playing the other races.

My big complaint is that they do not have any sort of cinematic for the resolving of Ground combat that we had in Moo2. Sure ground combat is still sort of auto-resolved with the user viewing while ticks of losses occur to player army and enemy army, but i enjoyed seeing a visual que which Moo2 gave us so we can see our troops die.

								I have not played long enough to warrant a solid review. However, I believe with enough input, this revamped MOO could be better than the original. I'm one of those MOO guys who loved MOO2. That said, I believe a fusion of both the new MOO and MOO2 would be worth playing.			"

Early Access Review
								They marked this game as Early Access so I'm assuming they will add many of the features I feel is lacking from this game in it's current state.As for the main gripe I read about the 500 turn limit, I suspect this will go away since this release of the game (as of Feb 27th 2016) is the earliest release.I recommend this game, not highly, but just plain recommend it.  I do see how they were trying to stay true to some aspects of Master of Orion 2 (MOO2) but other parts of it feel lacking.  Considering all they have to do is take MOO2, update the graphics and sounds, and CHANGE NOTHING ELSE to get an amazing game, I'm surprised nobody has done this...After the crap that was given to us as MOO3 I had wrote off the Master of Orion series, thinking that MOO2 would just be a legendary game that other 4x titles would aspire to reach.Pros:- Graphics are impressive- Voice Acting is very very impressive- Races have personality- UI is efficient and unobtrusive while still providing everything you need- Mrrshan's never looked and sounded so... good!Cons:- Diplomacy is... dumb... No point in actually doing it now except to hear some of the excellent Voice Acting!- No custom races... yet?- Racial traits feel very underpowered, traits provide such a small bonus that it doesn't really matter who you pick- Ship design is extremely limited (See suggestions below)- Taxes are problematic in large empires pick +1BC per citizen and you don't make enough, but everyone is happy, pick +2 and make WAY to much, but some population goes on strike.  Needs more tweaking.- Tech tree feels small compared to MOO2- What happened to fleet and colony leaders?- Space Monsters are borked... I took down the Space Eel with one Destroyer and one Frigate with about a fifth of it's Offensive rating.Suggestions:I am sure most of these have been suggested by others and I will be posting about these in other forums on the MOO website in hopes of being heard or at least considered.Custom Races with meaningful racial traits- This isn't a suggestion, this is a requirement.Fleet and/or Planetary Leaders- In M002, were they very powerful? Yes.  Too powerful?  Maybe.  Still, they added something more to the gameShip design choices- Why can't I put more than 2 specials or 2 weapons on a frigate?  Why can I put 4 Augmented engines on one ship?  How come I can't put on the Point Defense mod with autofire and continuous Fire?  Various other weird decisions were made regarding this, but I suspect this will change since it is still Early Access.Miniaturization- I miss this, it is what made using some of those old technologies over new ones actually preferable in many situations.  Maybe I want to fit 3000 Plasma cannons onto a Doom Star to blow out my old Sound Blaster 16 card like I used to.Weapons are bland- Some weapon choices are odd, but I don't like it that I can replace 10 Lasers with 10 Neutron Blasters for the exact same size cost.Combat needs a huge overhaul- MOO2 was turn based, we want turn-based at least as an option.  I kind of understand why many games don't do turn-based combat because it is very very easy to exploit AI weaknesses.  Also, why can't I retreat?Space lanes?- Seriously... wtf...  you used to be limited based on the range of your fuel cells, but now you can go EVERYWHERE from turn 1.  M002 didn't have space lanes, you could go from any system to any other system in range, seriously, this has to go...Overall, I give this game many more negatives than positives, but I see where they are putting effort into it and seem to be trying to stay true to classic MOO elements so I'm excited to see where they will take this game in the future.

												A fun and accesible 4X space game, similiar to Sid Meier's Civilization V in terms of mechanics (аnd yes, it evokes that just-one-more-turn addiction :). Despite a couple of missing features (as of 27/08), the devs have done a great job with Early Access and the game has improved immensely since its EA release. This is the kind of studio I'm willing to support!			"

												Decent enough I guess? I think with the AI being not so interactive and weak with the inclusion of the laughable (100x worse than any faction) space pirates + random event creatures that don't even notice u  that pop up can make you laugh. I can't really disregard the game, I think it's cool you could costumize some ships, but content should be added no doubt. You'll be able to spend hours on this game so I can't say its toooooo bad.

Early Access Review
								I like this game quite a bit. It reminds me a great deal of MoO 2, which was a phenomenal game that I played a lot. It has a lot of things going for it. The tech trees are interesting, the races are fun, and the voice acting is good. There are obviously problems. I'm not a fan of the way you have to move between systems, for one thing. The tactical combat is also not as much fun as it was in Master of Orion 2. I'm hoping that more racial customization and better tactical combat are on the way. I also hope that travel between systems gets changed a bit so that there's multiple options for how to do it. Honestly what the game is missing is more options for things.For an Early Access version of the game, I am thrilled. I am incredibly happy that I purchased this game and do not regret it at all. If it does not get any better than it is now, I will be a little sad but I will still be happy with my purchase. Hopefully they will add more customization. Giving more racial customization as an option, better tactical combat, and allowing to choose how your game will allow you to move between systems.I have very high hopes for this game, and I do not think I will be disappointed.

Early Access Review
								The game currently is a glass half full. There is a lot of missing content and many needed fixes. But it is early access and the developers are lissening to the gamers that want to see the game succeed. I have seen in recent chat with developers that they are making HUGE upgrades to the game in the near future, from balancing to much needed content so stand by for that. I would wait on buying the game if you cant handle the missing content, though the game is good now it just seems to get boring after getting into late game. I would recommend looking at what the community is talking to the develpers about and see if you like what is coming down the line for the game and all the suggestions being made.			"

												Updated review for release of this gameOpen up with.. this is a redo of an old game to modern standards with its own vision.Basically  this game feels like a spiritual successor to Moo2/moo1 not a reskin of moo1 or moo2.I would even go as far as to say its Civ5 in space.. but done better in some aspects.The building system,  ship design, research and races all feel reminiscent of Moo2 but with improvements, older players can just pick up the game with a small learning curve.It takes the real time combat and star lanes from Moo3 and to me makes them work better, judge that as you will some like starlanes, some don’t, the debate over that will not be solved here as everyone has their own view. I do think it could use some form of off road with a large turn penalty The real time combat seems ok.. just ok. It could use more depth, more control over the ships, more detail in what is going on.. and a larger battlefield to begin with.. thankfully this is just a meta portion of the game and though it can be improved.. it can be overlooked.The game adds some of its own twists, voice acting and a few other things like actually having to watch your finances to avoid going broke.The AI is getting better at building and expanding.. but again its combat tactics and ship designs seem silly still.. but vastly improved over the earlier builds.Diplomacy is ok, but could be better.. not enough options it feels and the AI's really seem to not work together leading to it feeling like a cluster of 1v1v1v1 with no cooperation between non player sides. That being said that has been an issue with many 4x games.Really enjoying the games take on Spying so far.. id like more options here or more effect from existing options.. stealing tech really seems to be the only decent option... would like to see some form of optional automated spy option.. or some way to reduce the micro for those who dont want the micro.Pollution control i rather like.. if you do not clean up your polution your planet devolves to a different biome. Some dislike this as they feel its too micro heavy.. I personally enjoy it.Colony management still needs work (moving population in the Civ window is still not present)More Tech is needed with a few more building options in terms of ships. Though that is a minor issue.. it just would improve the overall experience.The game is stable, has had some performance fixes all in all improved with each patch.However it still has work to be done and a ways to go before it becomes gold.I still really am enjoying the game and still get that ""next turn"" feeling.. it still feels like a nice comfy chair that I am returning to after a long break.  I still am quite comfortable recommending this game to new and old fans.. I will just say however.. this is not moo1 or moo2..  if you expect moo1 or moo2.. you will be disappointed.. this is its own game :)			"

												+Great production values (great leader voicing and event narration, design, animations, art style and music)+Runs smoother (and gets through AI turns faster) than any other contemporary 4x+Has that Master of Orion je ne sais quoi+Core mechanics are well-balanced and solidly built-Some mechanics are obtuse (""+6 damage reduction""? ""+4 city tiles""?), and there's no in-game encylopedia or help system-The advisors are all great at first, but they mostly recite the exact same two lines every time you unlock a new tech (and those same two lines will be ~90% of all the spoken dialogue you'll hear in a given game)-AI is terrible, especially around diplomatic deal weighting and colony capturing (I've yet to even see one build a troop transport - they always just bomb colonies to death), and indistinguishable between civs-Manual battle mechanics are kludgy and unresponsive at best-General severe lack of variety in the experience (galaxies mostly look the same, AI races mostly behave the same, everyone says the same 2-3 lines dozens of times, colony micromanagement gets more and more repetive the later you get in the game, etc.)Overall it's a solid-to-good successor to the previous MoOs, it's beautifully polished on the design level, and the framework is all in place... but it's also a highly repetitive experience without a lot of extra muscle on that framework. Providing mod support and better customization options (especially colony renaming and starting condition options) would resolve most of the issues I have, though, and move this up from a hesitant recommendation to an enthusiastic one.

												Fun 4X game. Keeps things simple and has great production values (beautiful galaxy map). I understand there are many MOO vets that are turned off by the simplicity, but I appreciate it. I can sit down for 30 minute stints and feel satisfied with my progress. My appreciation for this game might be a byproduct of me not having time to invest in more complex games like Stellaris.Hope even more features are added to the game as time goes on.			"

Early Access Review
								Pretty but Dull.Because of the fixed and predictable tech tree each game tends to unfolds the same way.Your opponets don't have any unique and destinctive tech, they have what you have, or will have or use to have. Hardly makes it woth spying on them.Combat is dull:You start over here, they start over there and you charge one another. As there is very little input from the player you end up being a spectator in your own game. yayYou don't decide what to shoot or who to shoot at, the AI does that for you. You select a squad and the AI makes the fire decisions, usually badly.eg A cruiser shooting at a group of frigates, it will shoot up one, take a bit off it shields then switch targets to an undamaged frigate. Nothing ever gets killed, meanwhile the frigates eventually wear you down. You will find yourself muttering ""Just pick one and KILL IT"" eg Battleship with multiple weapon batteries vs frigates. Each battery can easily vaporise a single frigate but the AI will shoot ALL batteries at one frigate vapourizing it multiple times over while the other frigates keep comming. (That when it isnt shooting up asteroids) (and I thought these gunners ere supose to bew professional.Missiles no longer have ammo restaints so become just another damage X weapon.Weapons are dull:In Moo2 you had shield piercing weapons, armour piercing weapons, weapons which did extra crew damage and other which did extra structural damage. Different capabilities made things interesting. Thats mostly all goneEvery weapon tend to be like every other weapon, just different damage levels Laser Dmg 5, Rng 50Neutron Blaster Dmg 9, Rng 50Gravaton Cannons Dmg 25, Rng 50same special effect, same ranges, dullGround combat:Not even sure if its implemented. You can have Neutronium armour, barrier shields and plasma guns and the cave men with spears and animal skins will kill you dead. Invading planets is such a pain 4 men at a time.Planetary governors are idiots. You tell them to focus on research. Yep they will do that to such an extent everyone will starve to death. When a planet maxes out population they wont scale back food production. The excess just gets dumped, Its not like you can even send it to other worlds to help them grow as every polanet is essentially independant. Your not an empire, you just a bunch of independant worlds sharing the same flag.Even moving people between planets is such a pain as it now requires you to build one man non-reusable ship to move a single person.Planetary growth Planetary growth depends on food production and not on population.Does this mean that your people are canabels? How else to you explain why population growth depends on surpluss food.Fleet overview: You will have ships and you will have no idea what there armed with as the only time it lets you inspect your ships is when you're in combat. The Fleet Screen is somewhat useless. Need to find out where your lost ship is, you have to go through every ship one at a time, they use unique symbols which don't mean a lot and even when you find your ship you don't know what there armed with. You can't even find out what the ship your currently building is armed with.Diplomacy:Remember when you could always rely on the Psilons accepting research treaties or Gnomorions  accepting trade treaties, not any more. Each race now has the same diplomatic personality and that personality is 'jerk' The AI offers you 62 credits for your star maps and gets progressivly hostile if you refuse them.You offer them 1000 credits for their maps and they feel insulted.Trade and research treaties now require cash and lots of it but since all the AI's tend to be broke you can never entice one into a treaty. Your ally will progressivly become less happy with you each time you refuse to accept a tech exchange with them.Ally: Give us Stellar Converters we will give you Atmospheric Renewers.You: No thanks we already have Core Waste Dumps and don't need your backward tech.Ally: Your a meanie, -1 to approval rating. Ally: Give us Stellar Converters we will give you Atmospheric Renewers.You: No thanks we already have Core Waste Dumps and don't need your backward tech.Ally: Your a meanie, -1 to approval rating. You: Shut up and go away I will give you Core Waste Dumps if you give me your #$%^ Atmospherics Renewers.Ally: Don't insult us with your pathetic trade offers.You: Argh, please let me demonstrate the fully functional Stellar Converter on your homeworld.Exploration:There are worlds out there with different biomes, desert, volcanic, swamp, toxic, radioactive, etcSo what, you can settle them all, you don't need any special tech to cope with hostile conditionsthey just give you less food. Espionage; I actually think the new espionage system is quite good.You can choose different types of missions you wish to undertake.The only downside if so can the AI. One moment your world is happy, next moment their rioting in the streets and have left the empire. No warning, no build up, pow it just is.Game play:I start on my own little subsector with one AI opponent and dont get to interact with the rest of the universe untill I develop a special tech which lets me travel unstable starlanes .It's awefully contrived. What about starlanes that can only accomodate small ships, that way I can explore and meet new races but my ability to wage war on them is limited untill some future tech advance.Or what about giving me the option to have unstable starelanes at all.The AI has no clue how strategically valuable  the Multyistate Insulator or Jump gates are and often get left behind to die slowly.Empire screenWhen your sort the not so compact spreadsheet it would be nice if it remembered your sort and actually moved your scroll bar to the top of the new list.As for sorting via production I have no idea what there actually sorting, its not alphbetical, its not production time remaining, its not buyout cost, its not planet name, I have no idea but just trying to findout when the next battle ship is due to roll off the production line and save you in your hour of need takes Sherlock Holmes to work out.Planet screen:Need to be able to set a Range limit when seaching for new planets to colonize. ie sort by Biomes all planets within 10 turns of travel.It would also be nice to know that a prospective planet is actually reachable or if another faction already has claims to the solar system by colonizing another planet in that system.Fuel:There is none. Another piece of strategic play taken from me.Crew XP:Doesnt exist. It may be on its way but not yet.Reverse engineering capture ships:Not implemented Hell, you can't even capture ships anymore.Finding tech on captured worlds Not implemented Research:When picking between technologies it would be nice to be able to review the tech tree to see when a similar tech is available in the future.ProductionWhen I finish building something it would be nice to know what I was building before asking me what new item I want to build, especially when terraforming. Upgrades:It would be nice to know what the AI has in mind before I select upgrade.Bases:It would be nice to be allowed to design your own bases.Do I get to play this game or just observe?Upgrading Ships is too easy, you can do it literally anywhere, build a listening post and you can magically reconfigure your ships instantly just prior to a battle with no down time. Customisen your ship at the last momement.Why plan when you can instantly turn a defeat into victory?It just feels so dumbed down as so many options and choices have been taken away from me.I sincerly hope the developers reflect on what there doing.I am just so glad that there activly trying to improve the game.

												*WARNING* Possible spoilers ahead'I have only played this reboot of the ""Master of Orion"" series for about 4 hours, but already I see the immense detail, time and care put into the game. Firstly, they hired top notch voice actors *cough cough* Mark Hamil *cough cough* . They paid these actors probably hundreds if even thousands of $$$ in order to have this game in top quality standard before release. Secondly, the actual structure of the game and lack of glitches and bugs are absolutely fantastic. The way that they designed the ship paths around stars and the way that everything was animated really made me feel like I was commanding a galactic empire. Good ol' M.O.O.1, the legendary M.O.O.2 and ESPECIALLY the godawful M.O.O.3 do not live up to this new competitor. And dont get me started on the AAA graphics.Lastly, the way that they structured the gameplay is fan-f***ing-tastic. The A.I is so well developed that top players from Stellaris, M.O.O.2 and other strategy games lose so often to the A.I. The A.I will do the most seemingly random things sometimes, such as blowing up your space-factory when they are on the verge of defeat in order to distract/annoy you, they might give you technology and befriend you even though they are more advanced and they may even destroy you before you have researched Xeno Relations. They are just that good! In Conclusion, we can see based on my experience that this new iteration of the ""Master of Orion"" franchise lives up to the legends of old and then some. I Highly recommend this game to all those that are looking for a fantastic, humorous 4X strategy game.			"

												After reading the 100,000 reviews saying this game game sucks for the sole reason it does not play like MOO2, I had still very little insight on if this game was any good or not. I never thought Master of Orion was that good anyways. I am more of a Master of Magic guy :)But after putting some hours into it, I discovered this game is the very definition of bland and non-innovative. Like imagine using the elements found in every 4x space game out there and....thats  it! I kept playing through several campaigns and several races and discovered this game offered nothing new to the genre.To be fair this game is pretty bug free and is ideal for new comers to the space 4x genre. But that caveat does not negate how depressed I feel playing this game.But I feel guilty about purchasing this game and I think it sold kind of well too. It just promotes more bad game designs and pursuades developers to make more un-original games.			"

												At 450+ hours played and counting I have to say I am really enjoying this latest release of Master of Orion.  Now if you were looking for a clone of MOO II then you are going to be disappointed.  This is its own game but it does continue the tradition of the MOO series.  Most of the races you remember from MOO II return for this latest installment though some are not exactly as you might remember.  The same goes for technology.  A lot of it looks the same but don't assume any of it is an exact copy.  For me it is a nice blend of nostalgia and new features.  One feature that has some people irked is the inclusion of starlanes.  Personaly I don't see the problem but I also enjoyed Space Empires and they used starlanes too.  Once you get jump gates you will hardly notice starlanes anyway.  Another issue to keep in mind is that tatical combat is real time as opposed to turn based as it was in MOO II.  In smaller battles you still have a lot of control though in the larger fights there are just too many ships to effectively control in that environment.  The mouse controls are still a little clunky in that regard too.  There is a pause button so you can stop the battle as much as you like to give orders for movement and firing.  Finally I have to mention the UI.  This is one of the best designed UI's I've used in recent memory.   "

Early Access Review
								In a nuttshell this is a fun game.    There are plenty of reviews from folks giving this a thumbs down and I've read through most of them.   Nearly every negative comment is due to the game not being finished yet, I still don't understand the folks who buy an ""Early Access"" game and expect it to not have some issues with it......c'mon people you are basicaly play testing for them so they can have TONS of input on what to fix before the full launch!Things the Devs are working on that most have commented about.  The AI is crap, yup it's extremely easy right now and they did that for a reason.  If you make it too difficult, and we all have seen that, then folks will simply throw up their hands because it's frustrating playing against an AI that is basically getting inside information or has built it cheats that allow it to progress faster.  Having a true balanced AI is extremely difficult, but they are working on it.Combat can be improved upon but many of the comments I've seen are bunk.  You can control your ships to a degree, you can select which targets they shoot at, you can change formations, you can send them anywhere on the map you want (in groups or individual ships).  You cannot choose which weapons to shoot and you cannot target specific things on the enemy ships.  It's very simplistic combat that you can actually effect the outcome of the battle.....I know, I've tested it many times and have watched my fleet lose battels they would normally easily win by me making bold and too aggressive actions.  I've also won fights that I probably would have lost if I had not manipulated my ships properly around the map.Deplomacy is something that the Devs have said is a work in progress.  Not sure what these people are talking about that the AI players are forcing them to give up tech or they ""get mad at you"".  Um, yeah, that's kinda the way the world works presently so it's only fitting.   The AI will get upset if you don't share but it doesn't attack you, it doesnt do anything other then pout.   No matter what you do though it really doesnt matter, the AI is so easy to beat you can share all you want and you will still win.  Again, it's something they will ramp up later and then we'll hear all the crying about it being too difficult.The game feels very old school, is a lot of fun to play, and will get better as they add more races and tweak the AI.   Any game that I can sit down and start playing and by the next time I look at the clock it's 5hrs later is a thumbs up!			"

Early Access Review
								Loving it so far, definately feels like a modern version of Moo2.edit:  After finishing my first game I can finally say that even though this game is still in early access, I have a game worthy of putting Moo2 to bed for good.  I had a whole lot of fun, it felt a lot like Moo2, and I am excited for the updates it will get in the future.  I will say however that I am the type of 4x gamer that only likes to manually design ships and only likes to micro-manage when I know the AI is supbar for the current strategy I am employing.  And for my first playthrough the game perfectly catered to my playstyle.			"

												This is an excellent 4x game that has all of the spirit of the original MOO2 and more! Easy to learn, hard to master. The only thing I would ask for is to further polish and refine the game. It was just released, so I think they could put some more time in it to make it even better. I like the fact that they tweaked the tech tree and combat so that it gives the game a more balanced feeling, especially if you are playing multiplayer. Choosing the right ""technology item"" from the tech tree you unlocked makes the game much more interesting to play. My recommendations to the devs are make it so the ships icons match the look you choose for the ship instead of generic icons, give the user more control and the ability to view more stats during and after the real time combat battles. Finally, continue to tweak the A.I.			"

												When I first played this, I hated it. I opened it up, and it ignored my settings, starting on my left monitor. Switching to window mode glitched the game out and I had to kill the process. I have to disable my second monitor to play, which is annoying to say the least. I don't know if this is only on Linux, but multi-monitor setups are almost common now days, and it should work correctly. Window mode not working is attrocious.I then loaded up the tutorial, to familiarize myself with any changes. The tutorial is extremely poorly designed. In one of the first steps it tells you that you can click a fleet and select individual ships to split them off into their own fleets. You can't. The ship window doesn't show in this part of the tutorial. Next it will have you explore planets in the system (a change from previous MOO games). Then the advisor will recommend that you not place a colony on the planet, except that you have to place a colony there for the tutorial to continue. At this point, trying everything but what I was supposed to, I thought the game had frozen, and I killed the process. It hadn't. All clicking is disabled, including the menus, so you can't even enter the settings, or start a new game, or even exit. You actually can't start a new game at all once you start one. Huge design flaw.The entire time I was TRYING to play through the tutorial, and getting extremely agravated, the voice of the tip advisor kept going off, saying things like ""Excuse me, Mr President."" There are even more of these alerts, due to it being a tutorial. If it was not possible to turn off voices, I may not have continued to play. I have not become so agravated with a game for as long as I can remember. Frustrated, sure, but not agravated like I was due to the tutorial.A few seem to want to forgive quite a bit for letting fans of the previous games down. I think that's a mistake. Many people bought this, and will buy it, due to the previous games. If they can make money off fans, they can face their ire. It kind of does fulfill that nastalgia feeling at least, with better graphics. I think there are enough negative design decisions that many may hate it whether or not they played the original games though.I myself was a big fan of Master of Orion 2, and MoO 3 to lesser degree. I didn't dislike Master of Orion 3 because it didn't live up to the previous game. There were things in both games I disliked, but there were a few things I liked better about 2. This game not only doesn't live up to the previous installments, but it's buggy, and makes a few changes that make the game less enjoyable.Pros:Master of OrionAwesome graphicsCool voiceoversResearch suggestionsResearch targets combine multipleYou can turn off the voicesCons:Tutorial sucksVoices get annoying fastGNN is extremely kiddish and dumbMany characters seem cartoonishRaces too heavily influenced by animalsNot complex enoughAI extremely basicMost time is spent micro-managingCan't see or adjust population from Empire pageBattle UI sucksPoorly designed status updatesColony Base doesn't settle planetsNo research queueNot easy to start a new gameBuggyThis game is not all bad. If you have a kid that likes sci-fi and you want to introduce him to 4X games, this might be a good choice. The graphics are remarkable, and they have an all star cast of voice-overs. Because the gameplay is a bit lacking though, all the fancy graphics and voices just felt like shine to me. I honestly don't think the game was ready to come out of Early Access. They have a very fancy start to a good game, with a few poor choices that nearly cripple it.Most of your time will be spent choosing the next thing to build. The auto-build also disables itself any time you add something to the queue. You can definately start to feel like you are simply micro-managing through much of the game. There's no colony page to manage multiple colonies at once, so you're constantly going through them all. Much can be accomplished from  The research suggestions at least speed up that portion of the game.The auto-turn is also very poorly designed, and it can blaze past important things, including hostile forces. It only stops when you NEED to do something, so you have to keep your mouse hovered over the button.The ship combat AI is a pain. Trying to control a fleet with a mouse sucks, so you'll likely just click to auto resolve it most times. It is nice that they have multiple ways to resolve a battle though. I would like to see it further developed.One of the things that is very subjective that I disliked is the races. They're a bit too heavily modeled after real animals. Some of the choices seem straight out of a kids movie.There's also DLC races available. I think their presentation was a mistake. I would have prefered a button to get additional races. The way they did it makes it look like the game is incomplete, when not everyone will even want those additional races. The GNN news updates are just plain stupid. In previous games they were a little silly, but nowhere near as bad as they are now. At one point, when talking about a population boom, the male robot actually asks ""You do know where babies come from, don't you?"" Seriously? WHO thought that was a good idea? Who thought that was funny? The whole game has a very cartooney and kiddish feel to it.The research tiers are almost exactly the same as from previous games. It is likely that they took the exact tiers and simply made some minor alterations. Some of the alterations are nice, others not so much. I would have liked more.This game is not production ready. Fancy, but it shouldn't have left Early Access yet.			"

Early Access Review
								I've been a long time fan of the series. But in the face of recent games like Endless Space and Star Drive 2 I don't see how this really contributes to the genre outside of ""production values."" There are significant aspects of the design and art direction that appear heavily cribbed from Stardrive 2 (which in turn cribbed from MOO2).I do find the game enjoyable, but considering the overall design decisions I'd recommend Star Drive 2 or Endless Space over this for a modern space strategy game.There's a few interesting ideas (fortifying starlanes), but these are harmed by many of the streamlining issues. For instance not having fleet range like in many other space games turns it into ""whack-a-mole"" with the AI (and even worse with a human player).The biggest faults which I do not see being handled with the planned features are tied to the end game. The effort to avoid steamrolling at the end game are very heavy handed with enforced turn limits and a 1 ship limit to Doomstars. These heavy handed approaches to ending the game at a set point don't work well when the AI and overall game mechanics lead to scattered empires that drag out conquest victories. (which is ""fixed"" by the hard turn limit)Tactical combat is another area that could use some refinement. Although there are ship firing arcs the AI tends to circle and there's no fine control for focus fire on individual ships, the AI targets an entire group. Stardrive 2's combat seems to provide more benefit for not using autoresolve or the cinematic camera.Some of these issues might be resolved with early access feedback. But some of these issues are simply fundamental flaws with the way that game mechanics have been streamlined.So to make it clear, the game is fun, the game is pretty. I'm honestly not a huge fan of the cartoony art style and voice overs of this and Stardrive and prefer Amplitude's more grounded approach, but that is a matter of taste and not quality.But overall, for a modern 4x game I'd recommend Endless Space over this title.

Early Access Review
								I have played (and won) two campagins so far I played the Humans and the Mrrshan and here is what I think of the game, keeping in mind it is still in early accessPluses -The graphics are really goodthe voice acting is excellent, they went out and got some real actors from some of your favorite Sci-Fi classics.The cut scenes are well done.Remarkably few glitches, nice and stable, at least on my machine.UI is intutive and easy to learn.Minuses-Diplomacy needs work, I had a great deal of difficulty dealing with the alien races. Your Allies are quick to go sour on you, they don't make reasonable demands, For example you can be hammering an opponet in a war, be bombing their homeworld and they still will not accept a peace treaty, or even ask for one. If you turn them down for a bad treaty they propose you lose any headway you have made with them. The current system won't allow you counter an offer made by an AI Race. They all want the same thing if you are trying to deal with more than one AI race, and it is never a good deal for the player.Ease of the game, at no time was I ever in danger of losing a game. There are no difficulty settings to challenge veteran players.Don't like the GNN robots.The aliens will never surrender, you must kill them all, have a population large enough to win the vote or go the full 500 turns. I know that other victory conditions are on the way, so I will revise this part as the developers impleament the changes			"

Early Access Review
								This is an interesting and rather good reboot of the original Master of Orion. This was one of the first 4X games I ever played and enjoyed, and this reboot lives up to the original feel. The game play can be a little buggy at times, but it’s still in development.All the original races are brought to life, they interact better with the new advances that AIs have made since the original MOO came out and it makes the game enjoyable by actually having challenges between the races.+The voice acting is an added benefit, not a something at I would say is the reason to play but a nice bonus.+The HUD is simple, yet detailed enough to understand and find the data you need.+Technology is broken down into trees that you have to make some choices to advance, and it allows a deeper level of strategy planning into the sciences.+Graphics are definitely better, and are still based on the core of the original game. The ships are better designed for racial visuals and they also allow for a more customized look at each race compared to original MOO.-Diplomacy is a little buggy, and could use work to balance it out.-The News is more annoying than in past games.Other than a few bugs here and there, the game is awesome. I would highly recommend that you buy and play if you are a fan of the original. This is a good re-boot of the original Master of Orion from nearly 20 years ago.			"

								Not a bad game at all, and if you have a lot of nostalgia for the original MOO, this game should be right up your alley. There is nothing wrong with it.That said, this game cleaves very closely to its 1990's roots and ignores the advances in 4X games that have occured since then. If you're frugal with your gaming dollar, you would be better off buying Endless Space, Stellaris, or one of the Galactic Civilizations. In fact, if your appetite for 4X goes past sci-fi, there are number of other products awaiting your purchase over this MOO instead, such as Warlock 2.I feel like this is a hard criticism to levy at a group of folks who are lovingly trying to reintroduce an old game to a new generation, but the simple fact is that this genre has advanced, and this MOO reboot ignores those advancements in favor of nostalgia. MOO:CTS is simple, old-fashioned, and sweet. Don't expect any more than what you see labeled on the tin.			"

								It might be a little simple for you uber-micro-managers, but I found it not only kept me awake, and that is hard for a 4X game to do, but kept engrossed all day long; I ended up having to turn it off for sleep.The voice acting is top notch, as well as all the visuals. You cannot directly control the ships while in combat mode, but it's EA and anything could change. The world building is simple, but not tedious; they need to fix the production function, you should be about to ""idle"" your production if you need to for whatever reason.Shipbuilding is pretty basic right now, but I love the ability to upgrade new weapons and parts for the ships to make them better.There is a good variety of buildings to populate your new worlds, science, entertainment, weapons, troops, etcI would recommend this game as long as you understand it's EA and it's just the tip of the iceberg to come			"

												1 November 2016. 1443 MST.I purchased this game roughly two weeks ago, and loved it. There were some frustrating moments, like AI opponents all being warlike and wanting to invade my territory within ten turns of first contact unless my military capability was larger than theirs. But today's update has changed this dramatically. The update removed the ability to actively remove pollution from a world. It also increased the amount of pollution that buildings and people produce, while the buildings that are supposed to passively remove pollution haven't changed. The net effect is that developed/developing colonies WILL destroy their ecosystems with pollution and there is now nothing you can do to change that. You will be stuck periodically re-terraforming every world you inhabit.To make matters worse, today's ""update"" has changed the gravity tolerances of all races that have a gravity tolerance that isn't total. It used to be that all races in the game could handle normal gravity. One race could handle low, one could handle high, and one could handle all gravity conditions. Now, if your race has a gravity tolerance other than normal that's the ONLY gravity level your race can handle. To make matters worse, normal gravity worlds seem to be roughly half the worlds in any map seed. Low gravity SEEM to be 25%, and high gravity SEEMS to be the other 25%. The nail in the coffin is that  the one and only building in the whole game that can change a world's gravity level will ONLY change the gravity level to normal. Net effect here? Two races in this game have been rendered essentially unplayable. There is no possible that you can ever be competitive playing either.It grieves me to say that I can no longer recommend this game. I find myself in the position where I have to apologize to two people that I bought the game for as a gift, as well as the others I've recommended it to. DO NOT buy this game. Run. Run and hide.			"

IntroductionMaster Of Orion (MoO) is a 4x turn-based strategy game by NGD Studios. In this game, you can play against bots and with people you know (your friends or family members) or with the people you do not know. If you are playing with your friend and if you are bored, you can save the multiplayer game and continue playing later with your friend. Singleplayer saves and multiplayer saves are seperate so you can not use your singleplayer save on multiplayer.Performance I play this game on ultra low graphics and i have got intel i7 2640M Cpu, 8GB Ram and Intel HD Graphics 3000 as Integrated GPU. I play with 18-40 fps which is good (usually have 30 fps) and the resolution is 1920x1080p (i am using my 1080p samsung monitor). When i have a better computer, i will play this game on highest settings which will look amazing.Diplomacy Feature I like the diplomacy feature of this game but it is a little bit annoying. When you have got better technology than the other races, they usually ask you to give your technology and they offer you to give one of theirs. If you do not accept their offer, your relationship bar goes down a little bit. They also ask you to not colonize near their planets which is good (because of security) and bad (because even if i colonize near their planets, they can attack whenever they want and try to take it from player). If you do not accept their offer then your relationship bar goes down a little bit. When they ask you to vote for them (galactic council vote thing) if you do not accept, your relationship bar goes down a little bit. Shortly, when you do not accept their offer  your relationship bar will go down.Spies You can train your spies and send them to other races in order to learn more information from them or you can steal their technology and you can also sabotage their colonies. Just like in some of the other strategy games. To be honest, i don't want to talk about this feature too much because i did not use spies too much. Sometimes, other races tries to send their spy to you but they fail. When that happens, 3 options appear which are: Capture, Deport and Kill. What ""capture"" option does is, you capture the guy and send him to your jail. Deport is, you send the spy back and i am sure you guys know what does killing option do. Sometimes killing their spies is good because they deserve it but sometimes it is bad because it affects your relationship with the race who sent the spy.Blueprints After you discover more guns and other stuff, you can open the blueprints and change guns etc of your ships or you can just create your own ship which is good. But you should be careful when you are creating your own ships because there is a space limit. If you add lot of things, you will see that the limit's colour will change the red which means you must remove some of the guns or devices you added or reduce some of the guns and you can change how the ship looks like.Galactic Council I talked a little bit about this up there (i wrote that some races ask you to vote them and when you do not accept their offer then your relationship bar goes down). You guys might think ""What is galactic council?"" The answer is, you and other races make your galactic council and vote the nominees. Who gets highest vote becomes the leader of the galaxy and the game ends. I recommend you to abstain instead of voting for another race.Colonizing Planets There are some planets which you can not colonize at the beginning of the game, there are planets which you can colonize but race who will live but will have problems due to gravity. You can solve these problems at the future by discovering gravity generator and planetology which will give you the ability to create your own planet by using space rocks (yes, i call them space rocks) and it will give you ability to colonize the planets which has got lot of gas. There are some planets which has got space monsters near them so you have to kill them first and then you can colonize. I also want to talk about Orion which is the best planet in the game. It has got a guardian so if you want to colonize orion then you have to destroy the guardian's ship.Workshop feature & The DLC To be honest i never tried to download something from workshop so not going to talk about it but good to see that this game has got workshop so people can do something. I did not buy Revenge Of The Antares DLC which adds 3 races from Master Of Orion 2 but thinking about buying it. My friend bought the DLC and refunded it because he said that it gives you 3 races and nothing else and he is right because it does not change anything. You just get 3 races from the second game. Do not get me wrong, i am not saying ""Do not buy the DLC"". But it does not change the game. Just different perks and ships.Bug / ProblemWhen i was playing against bots, had no problem but when i was playing multiplayer with my cousin, we were unable to skip the turn. It might be a bug or problem due to connection problem so wanted to add it to my review. Other than that, had no problem and i do not understand why people are complaining.ConclusionI think Master Of Orion is a good 4X Turn-Based Space Strategy game. I think developers should keep updating the game (I know that they said they will release an update soon.) I do not like playing games like this alone so i would recommend you to buy if you have got a friend to play with. If you do not have a friend to play with then still buy it. You might enjoy playing against bots or maybe you will find people to play with.Pros1- Soundtrack is good.2- Good game to play against bots, with people and with your friends.3- Has got lot of planets to discover.4- You can play up to 10 people or bots.5- You can choose advanced technology before you start the game. Which is good because when  you start, you see that you already discovered some stuff.6- Has got space pirates which is good.7- Has got space monsters on some planets.8- You can rename your planets and ships.Cons1- Should have a little bit more battleships.2- Should have more races.3- Should have a little bit more things to discover. (Research)4- You can't take control of marines you have got on the planet. What i mean by that is you can take control when you are fighting against other race's ships. But you can not do that when your marines are fighting on the ground which is a little bit disappointing.5- You can not create your federation with other races in order to attack your common enemies. I really would like to see this feature added in the game like the second one.6- There should be an option to deport people who protest on the planet.7- When it comes to diplomacy, other races are like kids. When you don't want to accept their offer your relationship bar goes down a little bit.Score: 7/10Notes Which You Should ReadNote: I was going to talk about Antares race but decided to write here as a note. There is a race called Antares in the game which randomly attacks races (they live in another dimension and they open a portal near your planet and come to attack) and there are antaran rocks around the galaxy which you can send your space factory and build a space laboratory to search them. If you search them like 3 times, you discover Antares Portal which you can use it to go to their dimension. I do not recommend you to go to their dimension because if you try, you will have to fight.Note #2: Forgot to say that if you choose to get more credit from your people, they will stop working so do not do that. They will also stop working if the planet is under attack. Also forgot to say that if you want to build ships and structures faster, pay the credit instead of adding more people who will produce. If you do that, your planet will have pollution problem which will affect everyone on the planet.			"

Early Access Review
								(reveiw will change when game is finished)Uptaded review:since last update on march 4th, the AI has become more reasanable to a playable level without everyone just hating you all the time.This game is going in the right direction but still needs some serious work to be a good/great 4x strategy game. I don't recommend this game in its current state over AI issues. In my short time all factions went to war with me for not giving on faction a planet, another some credits, and the rest for being at war with thos 2 factions even tho one was at war with them. The only way to win as of right now it to destroy all other factions before you get obliterated by the 5 current factions. Other than the AI the game is good. I would recommend for multiplayer but was unable to find a game to play with someone to try out.Pros:+options menu is on point in current state.+looks amazing with good little cut scenes with skip options+UI and managment tab are great+Voice acting is excelent+combat is somewhat enjoyable(needs work)+research tree above average+random events are well varied from my playtimeCons:-Diplomacy is broken. AI demands for tech, credits, and planets even on the brink of being wiped out by the player. If a single AI goes to war with player all other AIs become hostile with you in 1 or 2 turns which soon leads to all factions against you.(if fixed will make huge difference in game)-Pirate faction too weak and only seem to target player currently-combat mode is real time with vary little tactics currently even though there is options for formations and designing your ships with directional weapons(currently has no effect in directional combat). If your fleet is stronger just by a small margin you win with almost no losses(sometime with none), if the AI is slightly stronger than your fleet its always wiped out.-needs more universe types other than circle or spiral-needs more ship classes(but do like that there is 2 models per class of ship)			"

												tl;dr - unoriginal, repetitive gameplay that will bore all but the newest 4X gamer.I wanted so badly for the MOO reboot to be good. What they released was a nice clean foundation for a 4X strategy game that looks and sounds great, but gameplay comes first, and in gameplay it barely competes with 4X games from the 90s, much less games from today.I'm not complaining because I have nostalgia blinders for MOO2. I kinda like the introduction of starlanes, for example. But here's where this game falls short, starting with the worst flaws:1. shallow gameplay mechanics -- actually fewer mechanics than MOO2. Races are nearly uniform. Planets are nearly uniform. Ships and weapons are nearly uniform. There's no government or empire policies to choose, no dampening effect to make forming new colonies a tradeoff. The only innovative mechanic I can think of is pollution from production requiring periods of cleanup, which requires thoughtful tradeoffs. (To my surprise, of this writing, a patch JUST came out that revamped pollution! This feels like ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it!"")2. Tedious, repetitive management of colonies, spies, and population transports.3. Overstuffed, bland tech tree -- the same old tech tree mechanic straight out of 1991's Civilization. And the tech tree is WAY TOO LONG considering how few interesting techs there are. The ""choose X or Y"" tech mechanic is reminiscent of MOO2, and sounds good in theory, but it doesn't play out as interestingly as you'd hope. The choices are often super lame, like, ""Choose between a free global +15% growth -OR- a structure you can build that gives +25% growth."" Whoop dee doo. It's a step back from MOO2, which had some gut-wrenching tech choices, such as a much better targeting computer or a building that gave a huge bonus to research.4. Too many flat, bland bonuses. Most of the buildings are just +1/+2/+3 to some yield. Building structures on asteroids and gas giants should be exciting, but again they're just +2 to some yield. The resources on planets are just +1/+2 to some yield. (A typical small colony of 3 population already produces about 9 credits per turn; am I supposed to be excited that this planet has ""gold"" which adds 1 credit per turn?!) It's like the worst aspect of Civilization: Beyond Earth, which also had boring buildings giving + flat yields.5. Combat is fun to watch, but it's built around a realtime, cinematic view with illegible small damage numbers popping up at unpredictable intervals. I can't connect what I'm seeing to the weapons and systems of the ships, so I feel no motivation to design my ships. This is a FATAL FLAW in a game all about decking out big bad warships with lasers and shields and running your design through the gauntlet of combat.6. It makes my MacBook Pro overheat and drain battery like crazy, which is surprising for a game that doesn't look like it should need such performance.I've started 3 games of MOO:CTS and I've quit due to boredom long before finishing any of them. The game is still under active development and patching, so there is hope yet that the game might get somewhere eventually.			"

												I'm a huge fan of the Master of Orion 1 and 2. I've buyed this game altrough I read the reviews. After playing one game I'm very disapointed about the way it feels, there is no dynamic in this game.I suggest the producers to start playing the first two games to understand what is all about and change it radicaly. It think all how are playing this game will be happy. At some point in time during the game I was not even bother to control the fleet battles. How can it be in the MoO to control the fleet in real time mode, I think this is one of biggest disapointments. All you are doing during the game it's to select the next thing to be built on different colonies and to do some research. I end up playng the Master of Orion 2, far more interesting than this one.

												According to Steam I have now played this game for a 153 hours. Here is my impression to date: When the game works this is a noble and fantastic remake of Master of Orion 2. Unfortunately,  the problems I have experienced have occurred many, many hours into the game. The problems have  made completing any game I start impossible so far. From reading the forums the game appears to have other bugs that appear at unpredictable times. In my first game, after 400+ turns, I still could not travel through unstable star lanes. This after researching the technology to traverse the lanes. I did report this is a bug but I did not have the time to keep following up with tech support on the issue. In my second game I installed a mod that did not have unstable star lanes. That game was going well although  some turns were taking half an hour to complete. My laptop would also sometimes overheat and freeze between turns. However, my desktop did not lock up. Unfortunately, the mod creator updated the mod this week and now I receive an error trying to load my save games. I manually loaded the old version of the mod and unsubscribed to the newest version of the mod. However, I still cannot load my save games. After 153 hours of play time I have been unable to finish a game due to bugs.  I see that many others are not having these problems. Maybe I received a bad copy or something else is buggy or not configured on my end. I hope that is the case because the creators did a really great job of modernizing MOO2. However, again, just browsing through the comments there appear to be many bugs that pop up. Bugs aside, I stress this is a MOO2 remake. I spent probably over a year of my life playing MOO1 and I have conceded that no one will ever make true remake.  MOO1 had a simple interface using sliders from the main screen that controlled almost everything.  I found that interface much easier for controlling an empire than having to open up each planet individually. This remake does help in that regard by allowing the user to click through planet to planet without going back to the main screen. That is a time saver but I still wish the planets could be controlled in a way similar to Moo1. I can nitpick a small book for everything I want to see in the game but I think they did a good job overall recreating MOO2 minus the bugs.  Unfortunately, I do not have the time in my life right now to keep trouble shooting my games.  The really frustrating part is spending two weeks, dozens of hours with several hundred turns getting into the game I cannot complete. Feels like a huge waste of time. I am going to wait a few months and to see if any of the upcoming updates solve these issues. My recommendation is not to buy this right now unless you enjoy the possibility of becoming a beta tester.  "

												Finally, the Legend is back - done everything right!I must admitt, everything and more i expected from a relaunch, has come to live.One would expect a MOO2 relaunch to keep everything the way it was to grant the same feeling - but only change cosemtics and graphics. But there needs of course to be more. So dont expect to see a Clone of Moo2.However, the Graphic is great but more important it did not change the way you PLAY a MOO. Which is great. You find everything there, where you would expect it from the past. Races, Custom Race choices and Tech Tree is exactly as it was with little tweaks and some new features, that exatly solve the problem of a remake...giving you all you enjoyed in the past and that is familiar, with some changes to mechanics, that make it a new game to explore and start all over.Of course the Antarans are for now replaced by pirates, but i am sure there will be some changes in the future. So, playing MOO since over 20 years, this new release is definetly it! Great Job!			"

												So I was trying to decide if I should make this the most postive negative review ever, or the most negative positive review ever...Some people complain that this is just MoO 2 with better graphics, to which I say, ""Um... that sounds like a feature, not a bug.""This is a fun game.  As someone who has been playing Master of Orion for 22 years (I mostly bought into this just to get a steam copy of the original series), let me tell you, this game is a lot of fun, and a true successor to the original series.  The art is great, the game play is exactly what the extraordinarily high standards of nostalgia demand...That said, even after the game was ""released"" it feels unfinished.  And after paying a *really high price* for a game while it was in beta (I never do that) I'm disappointed that they immediately turn to paid DLC to add races.If you're a fan of MoO, buy this.  It's fun, and you won't be disappointed by the game... You will, however, be disappointed at the naked cash-grab that is the development cycle.			"

												Surprisingly boring and bland in a sea of amazing games. There is no reason to pick this title up with all of the other 4x games out there. If you'd like a suggestion, I'd say go for Galactic civilizations, the endless series, or Civilization V, VI, or Beyond Earth. The game is hampered by a lacking diplomacy system, a forgettable sound track, short vocal recording, and generic characters.

												Despite its problems, it is the most fun I 've had in a Space 4x game in years. Summary Pros:-Great UI design-Interesting and memorable race design and graphics with top voice acting-Great soundtrack and sound effects-Warp Lanes allow for strategic gameplay-Impessive tactical combat, especially once larger ships are unlocked-Low price-Accessibility & Workshop supportCons:-Some bugs -No Scoreboard/Hall of Fame-Somewhat uninteresting mid-game -Mediocre AI  Let's get into the details...I used to play Master of Orion 2 when I was 15 years old as it was my favourite game at that time. However, like most Master of Orion fans, I was very disappointed by Master of Orion 3 and I was quite skeptical about this. Thankfuly it has turned out to be a very good game despite its flaws.  UI: The UI in my opinion is where this game excels compared to the competition. Even a screenshot comparison between master of orion, galactic civilizations and stellaris shows that master of orion has the superior UI. There is clarity, everything fits nicely and it really feels like a game instead of a spreadsheet (a drawback of many other 4x games). Races: Top voice acting by many famous Sci-fi characters, including Star Trek's Mr Worf and Q and Star Wars' Luke Skywalker. Nicely designed animations, vibrant graphics bring the races to life. The only drawback is that the number of races is relatively limited, however, it is being expanded with DLCs.Tactical combat: There was a big debate whether this should have been realtime or turn-based. In the end the developers went for realtime and I have to say it works surprisingly well. Don't be fooled, it is not just a pretty cut scene where you sit back and watch ships destroy each other. Your actions really matter. I have tested this thoroughly. Even in battles where the auto-resolve feature or the AI control had me lose severely, I managed to win but it wasn't easy. Even tiny changes in ship trajectories can make a difference in battle. So, save, experiment and reload! No Hall of Fame: Given that each game lasts dozens of hours to complete it is a shame to see that once you win and you return to the main menu it is over. There is no way to see a list of past game scores or victory types. I can't see how they didn't think of implementing this given that it is very basic for 4x games (master of orion 2, civilization and galactic civilizations have it). Tedious mid-game: There are no rally points. There are no governors. ""Autobuild"" builds almost everything, even buildings you don't really need. There are not many exciting events happening in mid-game to keep your interest. Perhaps more random events or encounters should be added to address this. (Update: After the Antares patch, things have been far more interesting.)AI: The AI is not bad, but it is not good either. At normal difficulty I don't feel that the AI poses a challenge. You can always outsmart it and sometimes it makes odd decisions, like moving huge powerful fleets away from the point where they need it the most. I believe the AI should be more aggressive in pursuing victory conditions. Bugs: There are some minor, not game-breaking bugs in the game. Also some important tooltips (e.g. those about victory conditions details) are not working from time to time. Hopefuly bugs, AI and omissions will be corrected or improved in future patches as the developers seem devoted to making this game a success. Despite its flaws, at its current low price Master of Orion is a bargain, it is fun and it is hard not to suggest this to any space strategy fan.			"

												Developers of Master of Orion! Develop game, fix bugs, please.Pros:1. Nice graphic, map.2. Good tech tree. Choose 1 from 2 - is good. Look also Tech cost progression like in Endless Space 2.3. Nice idea with space engineer, gas stations e.t.c.4. Good pollution mechanic.5. Ship designer is OK.6. Tax system and morale - is OK.7. Engine mostly stable and good.8. Decreasing efficiency per pop of production and food - nice idea.9. Good turn events system.10. It's mostly working and OK, but very unfinished (see What to fix).What to fix:1. Planets inside systems. It's difficult to manage so many of them. There is no cheap colony ships without warp drive. No transports.2. Battles are buggy. Torpedoes sometimes fire in back direction from target and possible arc! Buttons not working properly.3. Cannot alt tab on MacOS X4. Cannot attack pirates colony with troop ship.5. I'm not sure, but probably there is overflow in production. For example if you have 20 production per turn on planet and build ship costing 42 production, it will take 3 turns and you loose 18 production for air!6. AI is very stupid. Also AI cheating7. Races are not so interesting like in Endless Space / Legend. Only cyborgs (need 1/2 food per pop), psyonics, stones (race without food, but also bugs - build new colony and get building +1 food with 2 coins maintance. cannot sell it). What about unique techs, buildngs, actions?8. Heroes are primitive. 1-2 basic abilities. And you can only increase them.9. Resources are primitive. No strategic and luxury resources. +2 science. Not even +2 science per pop.10. Planets are very similiar. No unique effects.11. Exploration is boring. No events. Looks also on Probes in Ednless Space 2.12. Morale of pop don't depend of planet quality13. Building when colonize new system (gives +1 food). Why I cannot build it? Sell it? For cyborgs it's important building very.14. What about altternative ship moves?15. Culture and influence?16. Minor civs. +3 to science on planet in their system. It's very nice, especialy when in their system there is only 1 planet: tiny lava.17. Quests?v54.1116.04.2017I cannot recomend this game for gaming and fun. It's can be just interesting for who like see new games, mechenics e.t.c.			"

												Did anyone tell you it's like CIV? It's completely CIV. But many of the ""micromanagement"" things that make CIV so painful are streamlined, such as ""paths"" to territories being clear and allowing for geographical protection. Then there's the highly customizable combat system that really makes this game shine. It's not nearly as bloated as CIV, but does suffer from the same end-game tedium as your empire contains so very many planets to manage. It's weird to say it's better than CIV, seeing how much work has gone into CIV, but MOO keeps it simple, and I do think it's better, except that everything is abstract, at least with CIV you get real-world technology, not just abstract sci-fi stuff.

								The new Master of Orion is a great entry point into a complex genre.Make no mistake, it lacks the complexity of many other titles in the 4X and as a result is much quicker and simpler to play.This is, in my opinion, a strength rather than a weakness though as the complexity of other entries in the genre at the moment (Endless Space, Endless Legend, Stellaris, etc) is more than enough to scare away potential players.As such this game will hopefully prove to be the perfect gateway drug into the 4X space for new players.

								AWESOME!This game i really fun.  Does an excellent job of taking you back to those glory days of playing MoO, i'm loving it!    The game is only in alpha but its already a blast to play. After 50 hrs i still can't get enough of it, really just getting started.  Very stable.   I highly recommend this to anyone who liked the original MoO, it is that and so much more.  And its only in Alpha so there is much more to come.  This game is well done and hits the mark!			"

								I notice most of the negative reviews have very little time played. Way to give it a fair shake. I love it, in its current state it is playable and enjoyable. One of the most complete EA titles I have, but I can see where the improvements need to come in. Can't wait to see what updates you have in store for us before release.			"

								Liking the game so far..as a MOO2 fan there are great many similarities that anyone who played the the original and MOO2 will be able to ""dive-right-in"" and play, the graphics are exceptional and the interface is very easy to navigate.  the only ""issues"" i have are:1.  There is no ""hall of fame"" for single player-whether you've won or lost, there's no score.2.  There are no leaders for planets or ships-for me the leaders were important part of my strategy-depending on one's adversaries your colony leaders could mean the difference between winning or losing.other than those 2 items the game has been a love of fun to play, looking forward to the complete version.

												This game keeps close ties to MAster of Orion 2.Many buildings/technologies and game elements have been copied and brought into the 21 century.If you like master of Orion 2 you will probably like this game.I would also recommend this game for any new player who wants to dip into the 4X genre.Negative points:- Some performance issues in huge galaxies in the late game (turns take long)- Master of orion 2 has been streamlined further and so this game has reduced races, no leaders, no ground combat animations, no tech stealing when conquering planets, no stealing/commanding enemy ships and stealing their technologyMaster of orion 2 was very streamlined and this reduces the complexity even further. I hope they might bring some additional features for free or add them as a dlc. The rest of the game feels very smooth and nice and brings you the ""one more turn"" experience.			"

												I just bought this today and have played a couple of hours.I have to say that 99% of this game is really enjoyable. I like everything that made the original MOO 2 such a fantastic game, that I still play today. The updated game mechanics, from exploration to research to diplomcay to construction, and graphics are very good and I applaued the developers for that. The new build options for planets and spaceships enhances the game in my opinion.The only part of this game that I am disappointed with is the space combat (I haven't tried planetary combat yet). I am not a fan at all of RTS so this element of it does not appeal to me in the slightest and doing the Auto version is not using the strategy element of the game to its fullest. Would there be any chance of coding in a Turn-Based version of this part at some point? The RTS space combat aside (I don't even like it with the 'Pause' feature) this game is really good and I look forward to spending many hours playing it.			"

												This game, while not quite MOO3 disaster, is still deeply flawed and because of that I can't recommend it.Major balance issues:- Espionage is seriously broken, where there is no practical way to defend against constant sabotage and even your 90% happiness home world could be incited to revolt. - Fleet combat is broken, where missiles are about twice as powerfull as anything else and there is no point in building anything but cheapest missile spam ships.- Star travel is 'hyperlane'-only systemEven if balance issues are fixed, the game is rather limited by lack of imagination.

												**UPDATED**Picked up the game and immediately lost 12 hours of my life to it... if that's not reason for a 'Thumbs Up' I don't know what is! Ok now for more seriousness.... Does it look and feel like Master of Orion, modernized? Hell yes! It nails the tricky act of taking old, familiar, game mechanics and updating them to work a little better. The developers did a masterful job of jamming the nostalgia buttons but giving the old game new life at the same time. Now its not perfect, there are missing races, and there are some annoying facets, but overall this is a great addition to the IP francise. What are some of the down sides? Well you get zero say in what victory conditions are active, or not, for your game for starters. It seems I, like many other reviewers managed to miss the big button labelled 'Show Advanced Options' under which you can choose which victory options to turn on/off and how many turns the 'time out' victory lasts.  The lack of any Antaran plot or endgame is disappointing in the extreme. Even MOO3 had an attempt at a meta-plot, even if that game was about as fun as self-sodomizing with a spiked morningstar. GNN can get a bit annoying, and the auto-zoom gets tired pretty fast. The worst irritation I found tho was that event icons that would show on the side of your screen for important happenings for the turn would not take you to that even if you clicked it, but would only dismiss the icon. The upcoming DLC and free expansion look to be addressing many of the areas this game needs improvement on.Pro: Gorgeous visualsNostalgia button nailed hardAddictive Gameplay Solid tactical control of battlesAI designed ships and upgrades do not suckFANTASTIC voice workDevelopers are actively working on the game stillCon:No retreat option or even chance for non-combat shipsSome few game assets are not really well explained if you aren't familiar with 4x space strategy gamesLack of Antaran plot/endgame threatLack of ANY form of plotRaces could use some tweaks to feel more appreciably different from each otherMissing Races.Meh:This looks and feels like exactly what it is, an updated MOO2, it doesn't really innovate at all.Needs a bit more work to be really grand, but there is time for plenty of DLC			"

												I'm going to have to go ahead and say I don't recommend the game at its current price. While it is an honorable start to being a glorious 4x space stategy game, and it does feel a lot more like MOO to me than MOO 3 did.... overall the experience just kind of peeters out after an unsatisfactory amount of time.Pros :- Most of the UI functions smoothly- A good deal of MOO lore is included- FPS is good and stable on a mid-range machine, even with all graphics options turned up- The graphics are acceptable, but nothing special- MUCH less buggy than 1 year agoCons :- I think ""terrible"" is actually a poor word to use to describe the AI. The right word is ""ridiculous."" Nothing they do makes sense- AI uses cheats instead of tactics at higher difficulty levels to become harder- The opening video seems to lag for me, not sure what that's all about- Turn length increases far too quickly- Workshop community, as always, is trying its best... but the game has design limitations currently which are severely limiting the depth, functionability, and compatibility of the mods.- Community agrees that game is only about 1/2 done, at most, but updates have screeched to a halt in the last few months. Furthermore the devs have been in much less communication with the community than they had been.- The pirates function way too shallow fo my taste. They essentially just attack as soon as their ships are spawned. They do not at all feel like their own hybrid civilization. No way to form diplomacy with them either. I know this is uncommon in 4x games anyway, but it really is a feature that would add depth... if you could have a back-door way of getting on the good side of pirates, but bad side of everyone else in doing so.- Random pauses between screens at time, especially when entering a battle.- Tech tree is too short, too shallow, too streamlined, too everything that makes a tech tree unexciting- Very limited customization options for galaxies. Even with mods.- The largest galaxy type that comes with the game would be considered medium in most 4x games.- Can't rename planets/star systems- Quite possibly some of the most underwhelming paid DLC I've ever seen for this genre of game- They made all the leaders/species look way too cartoony in most instances. I think using these graphics but sticking to MOO 1 and 2 lore (it seemed like a rather rustic, raw, and Babylon 5-ish universe did it not? Now it feels like Shrek in Space)The game felt like it was progressing quickly until the fall so perhaps the devs are just working on something big, let's hope so. But until then, thumbs down.Also, I have quite a bit more experience than the 8.5 hours recorded on steam.			"

												Do I recommend this game ? Oh yes, wholeheartedly and unreservedly. This is *especially true* if, like me, you loved MOO II and were more than a little disappointed with the follow-up releases and found yourself wishing they'd ""go back to when they got it right!"" - And they have done so in spades, with this one. Similar gameplay to what we all remembered and loved, but with much, much better graphics, beautiful animations and some truly well done voice acting, though some of it does get quite repetitive (every time you make a scientific discovery, your advisor says the *same thing* each and every time)Just like MOO II, the game is played very differently, depending on the race you select. No two games work out the same, even with identical starting conditions and selected race. Just like MOO II, this one will stay on my hard drive for many, many years to come. (And $30 ? Good lord - you could not ask for a fairer price - talk about ""giving back"" to the gaming community!)			"

												Okay I loved all the others and this looks great, voice acting is the best, but that is probably  the best of it. I have to say  it is boring even the battles  and the striking workers  when your moral is at 90% is just wrong. I have a number of these games but this has no longevity ( I will not buy the additional races) I am therefore unlikely to put a lot of hours into it unlike the others as it is so uneventful , it is turn after turn trying to finish the tech tree. Normally the turn cap is something that you hope never happens but in this  game it cannot come fast enough, please put me out of my misery.If it's cheap ( I got it in the sale) go for it, otherwise just remember how you liked the other versions and reminisce.Voice actors are still great though   5/10			"

												This is a Good game; as many down-votes say that it lacks what master of orion was but in all honesty that's because this is a reboot for a different generation sure some of the past title players will pick this up and some might enjoy it and others say it's a lack luster game with a false title on it, however it's not it is what i said previously that this is a REBOOT title not an expansion pack of a past title and if you refuse the reboot title then it is a modernization of a game that was past it's time back in the day. However this does not by any means mean that this is a perfect reboot or title it lacks depth to a certain point such as customization of ships, since you only get a max plan of 8 different ships, and that the game gets repetitive sometimes but in the end it's a worthy title. it's not a step back from the title it's just not a leap forward that many previous fans would of liked. In the end it is a reboot for a newer time and deserves some respect and praise so I beleive it shoud be at least an 8.75/10 if not a 9/10			"

								Short:This game passes my ""just one more turn"" test.Long:I've been playing Master of Orion II since I was 9. Man, what a game. I've played it recently as well, and it really is a very good game. Sure, it would be great if you could just get a high res texture pack, larger galaxies, etc, but the game really is well thought out.Master of Orion, the new one, is not the same game. I think balancing and mechanics are closer to Civ than MOO. There is nothing wrong with that, however. This is a different game, and if you treat it that way, it can be thoroughly enjoyable. I've had a couple of ""just one more turn"" evenings, which is detrimental to my job performance.This doesn't replace MOO II, this can be played as an alternative. We must stop treating MOO II as the be-all and end-all of games, and start appreciating alternatives. This game is fun, and I appreciate that.There are a couple of bugs, but I'm still busy with my game, hasn't broken yet, so if GNN can't pronounce my empire, that is okay.			"

												In short: Plays like a 7, looks like a 10 but, despite its shortcomings when it comes to depth, it's an 8/10 for me and one of my favourite games in recent years, but it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea. It doesn't set out to innovate in the genre but to pay homage to the original.ProsThe graphics are gorgeous and a shining example of what a 4x game should look like.I keep playing it (over 330 hours so far), so ""just one more turn"" has become a thing with it.The UI is an absolute treat to use. Other 4x devs take note, this is how it's done. No diving into sub-pages and menus to find what you want. Everything is a click and one screen away and clearly presented.Price: this is a good deal at the normal non-sale price. I think NGD studios deserve some kudos for getting this just right and not cashing in on the legacy by asking for more.Enough options to set up gameplay to your liking.The ship designer is fun to play with, though not particularly necesssary.Crushing your enemy and hearing the lamentations of their... wait, they're all dead.ConsAs of March 2017 the devs have gone quiet and there have been no patches since December 2016.The AI isn't terribly challenging.Tactical combat isn't all that interesting, then again, I just use the auto battle result the vast majority of the time unless the odds are against me.There's been a lack of bug fixes for the really blindingly obvious bugs.I suspect large numbers of the development team have been abducted by the Antarans and gone missing.Graphically, too many races have spacehips that look like flying bricks when more sleek, sexy SR71 type ships are needed as well as completely bizarre looking ones.Despite the UI being silky smooth, there's a lack of explanation within the game for some of its mechanics.The tech tree is linear and the same for all races, bar some options not being available. I'd much prefer differing research trees and also having the meta game of being able to allocate research between shield tech, missile tech, beam tech, ecology etc.Lack of a ship battle simulator so you can test various designs.There's still the odd but rare crash. Not enough to take away from the enjoyment however and not game ending (Keep calm, reload and carry on).It was released from early access 6 months too soon, though the DLC has helped make up some of the deficit in depth.MehThe sound is average. It's not bad but it's not Mass Effect either.The manual. It covers the basics but doesn't really explain the mechanics behind some of the game systems.If you're a fan of micromanaging massive empires with extreme depth and games that last many days, then look elswhere. This game is a 4/10 in terms of difficulty compared to others in the genre. But if you like being able to jump into a game with an easy learning curve and knocking a game out over a night or two, then take a look at MOO:CTS.Side note: I've put 1113 hours into Civilization V and loved it, but dropped plaving Civ VI completely to play this instead. I'll put most of that that down to MOO:CTS looking gorgeous and also delivering just enough gameplay to satisfy versus Civ VI throwing too many options at me at once and looking like a kids cartoon. MOO:CTS reminds me of Civ V at release, incomplete but you could sense there was a great game there that with patches and DLC evolved over time into something special.For Master of Orion series fans, here's where I'm coming from: The original MOO is one of my favourite games of all time, along with Panzer General and X-Com: Enemy Unknown. I did not like MOO2 or 3. I prefered the original due to the ease of gameplay, and while that game was probably only an objective 7, it was a 10 for what I like in a game. Easy to use, fun to play, just enough depth to keep it interesting. MOO:CTS respects the heritage of the original. Don't come into this one hoping for the depth and micromanagement of the sequels. It just doesn't have it. If, though, you liked the original but games like Stellaris seem a little too time consuming with too much of a learning curve for the time you have available, then I recommend this instead.Summary: this is another 4x space game that aimed for the stars but hit the moon. It's still better than the vast majority that exploded on the launch pad though and fun enough to play to warrant a look. Consult your Magic 8 Ball before buying.			"

												First of all: I loved Master of Orion 2. So I was really excited seeing a new MoO. The first rush is now gone after roundabout 8 hours of more or less fun (I had to start several times again because there was nearly no introduction, and the advisors suggestions were not really useful) and the errors became more and more substantial arguments to stop playing. It's a pitty that the greatest part of the original game (the tactical two-dimensonal round based battle action) is now totally missing.The idea that this battle goes in real time and in three-dimensonalty doesn't work in the way it was designed here:The control is silly/buggy, the KI too (another player explained it very good): shooting not the target you advised but all ships on this way. And the auto solve is not clever - cause of the bad control I let the PC solve the battle. Nevertheless even with overwhelming forces I lose ships- and the whole rest was unharmed.... not very realistic.Even if you are attacking an planet with your troops: there isn't any possibility to give commands or even have a animation about the attack. You just see on your or the opponents side how the soldiers disappear.... -Really? Is that all you are able to?!? In the old original game I saw at least little pixle soldiers and tanks running from the left to the right, shooting little projectiles and fighting against the defenders.Furthermore it isn't possible anymore to transport food from a fertile planet to a mining planet. So if I want to get fast enough some population there, I have to build  population carrier in turn. But the turns are getting slower and slower... and my hardware a 1 year old high end gaming laptop, so I was really surprised.Regarding the price I'm really disappointed.			"

												--- There is no turning autosave on/off. Its still on and it cause big lags and waiting time after turn 500+. Bigger galaxy longer waiting time and its not fun at all. always to be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off to waiting for stupid autosave.--- You can forget about playing with high productivity on planet no no.--- uncreative is predefined from begining, so you have imaginary chance of getting some tech, but on the end when you load your game to hope it will change tech when you reasearch it again you will get always same stuff always and thats no fun.--- UI of PC in single player and multiplayer is realy bad. Every nation act same way. When you choose to ally with someone guess what. He swarms you with spyes and trying to harm you and thats not fun as well.--- UI in combat is still stupid. for example pirates on start of game, you will just get fast close to them and then just follow them and they will be almost no threat to you.--- there is not mutch technology to get. Even if you are uncreative you can outrun everyone with population. I would like to see bigger reaserch tree and more posibilities.+ graphic is not that bad.--- Just few races and custom race is now disaster. "

												Out of two linux based systems this will not run on either of them.  On the generic AMD based desktop, Nvidia GTX 950, it simply dumps shortly after the 'Loading Master of Orion' message pops up.  On the Alienware 14 laptop, Nvidia 7xx series (exactly which one I  don't recall at the moment) the game seems to load but the mouse is mostly unuseable and it seems to want to default to a much higher resolution - I am guessing 1920x1080 - even though my native resolution - 1366x768 shows up on the options page when I can get to it.  Sad, as I was really looking forward to this game.			"

												I had really high hopes for this game, having played its predecessors for a substantial amount of time. And in a way it delivers, however a lot of the mechanics feel... unfinished I guess, and the UI at times feels clunky, uncomfortable. For example, let's talk starbases. The UI issue was that I had no idea what the attack/defense scores of my starbase was, I had no way to check it until I made it in a battle that the starbase participated in. The mechanics related issue of the starbase was that it was not getting upgraded with my latest (or any for that matter) weaponry that my research had made available to me. Finally, it would also be nice to be able to customize it the way one can customize the (combat only, this is another issue imo) ships.It kind of fees like it never really left the early access stage. Dont get me wrong, it's a nice game and undeneath all that is a potential classic, but at this moment, it needs work.			"

												This game really doesn't gel with my playstyle. I love building up a medium-small ~15 planet high-tech empire, then crushing everyone else. Can't do that in this game.If you have 6 population on a planet, you damn better send 2-3 of them off to colonize immediately. If you have any available command points, take 10 turns out immediately to build some ships to fill those in. Have fun micro-managing your now 30 planet empire with ships needing upgrades constantly.I can play like that. I understand that style. I don't want to play like that. It's not fun.			"

												A very good game, worth playing often.  The only downside is the lack of a campaign feel.   You effectively get an intro and that's it.  Theres no direction for you to follow or a reason why you would aim to dominate the galaxy.  Theres no end game as such or anything interesting at the end.Still, good quality game, graphics, sound, plenty of races to choose from, very good voice acting and even has a multiplayer.  If you enjoy this type of game then it's a winner.			"

												I would love to write a good review, I really would... And first minutes with the game gave me so much nostalgia and good memories that I almost imediatelly wanted to shout ""MOO is back!"". And then - the BUG. The bug that stucks the game in ""processing turn"" mode, killing whole game. The beauty of graphics, maybe not up-to-date but definetely MMO-like, the old feelings gone, because I simply cant go further. According to all-knowing internet, the bug is well-known to developers.When (or If) the Devs fix it, I'll gladly change my review. For now I can only say ""dont buy untill they path it"". I am sorry.			"

												Frequently crashes, even though I meet or exceed the system requirements, have an Nvidia 1060 GPU with the latest stable driver and put the game on the low graphics setting.  Processing time at the end of turns after around 200 turns while playing a huge galaxy (space is supposed to be vast and a 'large' galaxy doesn't feel that large when it contains so few star systems) slows to a crawl and the game freezes up.  That is also when most of the crashes occur and after a few hundred turns, the game seems to crash every few turns when playing a huge galaxy.  There hasn't been any updates since December of 2016, so, trying another game may be a smart move as opposed to putting up with the continued aggravation of playing an unstable game which may never be patched for bugs.  The game contains voice acting by Robert Englund, Mark Hamill, Michael Dorn, Kari Wahlgren, John de Lancie and others.  The ships look better than others I've seen in various video games which had a washed-out look to them.  The game could have used a Ringworld such as the one featured in Larry Niven's Known Space series of science-fiction books.  The title book from the series won the Hugo Award, Nebula Award and Locus Award, and was based on an artificially-created structure which completely circled a star at about one A.U. (the distance from the sun to Earth in what is frequently referred to as the Goldilocks zone), was one million miles wide and 600 million miles in circumference (all the way around) and spun up so the centrifugal force would serve the same function as gravity would on a normal world, i.e. keeping you from drifting off into space and keeping your beer in your glass and your change in your pockets.

												MASTER OF ORION a return to form in the classic addictive style of the earlier games. Once again i find myself immersed in the world of MOO with its haunting lonely vast expanses of space where home is onboard a huge colony ship or other space faring vessel. Exploration and discovery abound in joyful moments of finding a planet that can be colonised in all its mysterious beauty waiting to reveal its naked reality to you. Then there are asteroid fields which can be mined as well as strange signals in distant places where advanced technology or some anamoly which may or may not be a threat could be waiting to be discovered.You will encounter other races alien and inhuman looking who may or may not become your ally depending on ones skill at universal politics. Of course there could be some who because of their tempermental and competitive nature will turn on an ally just for the fun of battle such as the flirtatious and easily offended Mrrshan ruled by the feline Empress Marupa.Then there are the space pirates who are a constant threat but with a bit of exploration and bomb capable space ships you can discover their bases of operation and blast them to stinking fragmented bits of charred flesh.Taxing your empire for much needed coin to run it is a necessity to be able to afford the research and development to create the habitats, weapons, ships, electronics, population motivating items etc etc needed to grow and florish across the universe as well as be more attractive to other races as an ally when making many types of agreements, trading tech, paying tribute, giving gifts etc. Just make sure not to tax your people too much at the wrong time or you may find them rebelling as they unleash their displeasure until you act one way or the other.Graphics bring the infinity of space along with the bliss and horror of new worlds. Alien races are a sight to behold capturing a 1990s science fiction quality as if from an episode of BABYLON 5 and STAR TREK. Battles are violent and catastrophic as scenes of ships charging full speed ahead with ballistic and energy weapons blazing across monitor screens create exciting encounters which are played depending on whether you auto resolve, give partial control to the ai or take complete command of the battle controlling your ships in battle which is wonderfully executed.Music captures a mix of classical and 1990s science fiction ambience relaxing yet full of suspense and the wonder of discovering a universe. Hearing the insane amounts of voice acting by an all star cast who create characters who are very diverse, full of depth and unique is an incredible experience to go through which motivates me to keep diplomatic contact with them.MASTER OF ORION a true successor and success of a time past which has risen to claim its place once more in the annals of gaming history.MASTER OF ORION, BUY IT! PLAY IT! and become SUPREME RULER OF THE UNIVERSE!!!			"

												Awesome game. Best 4x game I've seen seen, and defintely one of the best strategy games. If you like space and strategy, you'll like it a lot. The game was easy to learn...although I can see some having a learning curve. The tutorial is actually very useful in this game (one of the only times I have ever even had this thought for a 4x game). Video is great, voice acting is great, and with all the different racial traits, there is a ton of replay-ability. Lots o fun.On a side note, the selling point for me on this was the voice acting. Am I the only one that feels this is a lost art for dev's? You can have a great game, but if the audio puts me to sleep, people will not like it. Period. That is not the case here. The dev's invested (a lot by my calculation) on their voice over, and sparing no expense paid off. I was actually surprised in how good the game was. I just wanted to hear Robert England talk smack in a 4x space game			"

												I really wanted to give this a good review.  But I cannot.  I am a big, no HUGE fan of the Strategic Space Sim.  Capital S for Strategic and as some would say ""slow"".  MOO has always been less about ""action"" and more about long-term empire strategy.  This game IMHO is a direct decendant of MOO2, a fantastic game.It lacks in several areas, balance, etc...  They are coverd quite well in most reviews but, again IMHO, they can all be forgiven for this game is an ""entire package"".  I have only owned this for a few days.  I have over 50 hours.  It is doubtful I will get much more however.If you love deep, VERY long-term empire space games that you can get lost into for days...maybe have a few balance issues....oh well....then...WHAM your save file is garbage, all your backups are the same and your game in which you are TWO HUNDERED AND SIXTY THREE TURNS INTO will not run at all, then get this now.  Frustration, galore!  No, really, it works like a charm for 250 turns...then gets flaky...and worse until you are f'ed.  And it is only $30!  What a bargin!			"

Number values and the math behind decisions is not available, like I want it to be. But it's still a good time waster, which is why I like 4x games, that take 1-4 gaming sessions to win.

Early Access Review
								Seems to follow mostly MOO3 most closely with MOO1 and MOO2 races. I like the fact that they did scale down the galaxy size a bit from MOO3. Those games were way to long for anyone that works for a living. The one thing I would recommend is make the build queue longer. When planets are starting out you end up with a long list of things to get the planet up and productive. Only having 5 items does not cut it. I really miss the build queue from MOO2 for starting up new planets.			"

												The game is supposed to be the spiritual successor to Master of Orion 2.  In some instances it succeeds.  In others, it falls flat on it's face.  The main problems with this game are, cheating AI bonuses and terrible weapon balance (specifically the ""attack power"" of weapons).1.  The AI most definitely receives bonuses based on difficulty.  Even on Normal they receive bonuses.  It just shows how poor AI developmen for games have become.2.  Terrible weapon balance.  Beams and cannons are completely inferior to missiles.  Or, at least they are when it comes to the weapon attack power.  However, they can actually be as deadly if not more so than missiles.  So, it's a complete crapshoot who is stronger when comparing the attack power of multiple race's fleets.			"

												Garbage and not recommended unless you are a long time die-hard of the series.I will not be going into a long review this time because there is no need.Multiplayer? sure, but no tactical combat, that gets turned off in MP games. So just so you get this part right, it is a wargame about combat which you cannot do except auto-resolve in MP!!So in short in MP you really just manage planets.MP Settings are not persistent. So if you save a game and load it up again races gets jumbled and private games become open with no recourse to lock them down. Say hello people!There is a lot more controversy about the game I could go into but after the shell shock of convincing my friend to get it and finding out we both got screwed on MP combat I am too dissapointed to go in-depth.Nice graphics if not a little childish.

Some game mechanics seems to be nice at the start, but useless in a later game as they add lot's of unnecessary micromanagement at star system level. Overall nice try, but after turn no. 200 when the game started freezing because of closing Antaran attack, I just fired up DosBox and enjoyed amazing party in MOO 2.			"

There are some things that have changed (warp lanes create bottlenecks, spies have more options), and some that were left out (plasma cannons beats all and no heroes), but fundamentally it is pretty much the same.Except that Alan Tudyk voices the Psilons.Rating: Firefly/10 would research the crap out of everything.

												I bought and played during Early Access and like where I thought the game was going.  Unfortunately, that isn't where the game went.PROS:*The game looks pretty*Voice acting is top notchCONS:*The games good graphics largely go to waste.  Other entertaining features (e.g. the GNN) are under-utilized*Combat has zero tactical depth.  Similar to MoO 3 with pixels shooting at pixels (i.e. boring)*Good ideas like biome diversity wasted by not actually making them diverse*Certain mechanics (e.g. Pollution) dominate gameplay requiring constant micromanagment of workers on every planet (a larger issue on larger galaxy sizes) which, in turn, requires inordinate amounts of game time compared to other fatures*AI is rock stupid even on highst difficulty settings.  Game seems to have no knowledge of the pros and cons of the race(s) it's controlling*Devs not listening to community.  Ignoring features that have existed since early access while inserting features that no one asked forThis could still be a great game but would require a big shift in dev strategy to make it happen.  Ultimately, certain mechanics (like Pollution) make you spend too much time managing it.  Managing pollution should not be half of my gameplay time.  It's 2016 - space battles should be more interesting than multi-colored Pong.  Those pictures of space battles on the store page?  That's not how it goes.			"

												Nice game, good graphics, nice interface,captivating,however there is one problem?It is impossible to win the AI of this game,no matter what you do. It seems your enemy Ai has infinite resources to build ships, more more and more,I believe it is not well balanced. Other gamers like the way it is. But for me this game is finish.It is not Fun anymore when you realized that no mateer what you do, you will always lose.			"

												Tl;dr Version: Thumbs UpThe best thing I can say and the worst thing I can say about this new version of Master of Orion are one and the same - the game does nothing particuarly wrong. That's also known as damning with faint praise.The Essay Version:The Positive:The MOO series is a venerable, beloved (except for #3) gaming franchise that still remains the peak of the genre in MOO2. I remember buying the first one. I remember sinking many hours into the second one. I remember cursing the third one. Naming any game as ""Master of Orion"" is going to instantly invoke comparisions and criticism. I'm not going to compare this version, feature for feature, versus a 20 year old game made when gaming was different. That is counterproductive. If I wanted to play the original I am sure I have the disks around here somewhere. So how does this one play?Well, MOO does a lot of things right. The first thing any player will notice are the production values. Voices by Mark Hamill, Michael Dorn, Dwight Schultz, John de Lancie, Alan Tudyk and more give the game a lot of flavor. There are some that are annoying (the Alkari scientific advisor comes to mind) but the overall effect is wonderful. The interface is crisp and sharp. Any 4x player can jump right into this game without a major challenge because the UI is spot-on. Many modern 4x games create cumbersome interfaces that interfere with the game. For instance, I'm a Distant Worlds fan (a couple hundred of hours played before it was ever released on Steam) but the interface is terrible. Master of Orion handles things wonderfully and there's no guessing required.The graphics are beautiful. Everything from the art of the various races to the look of the planets has been done in top-notch style. There's probably not a better looking 4x space game out there (note I said space because I love the art style of Endless Legend). It's kind of cool to just look at the spaceships flying around your planets in the planetary screen. The little touches are nice too, like if you drag population from one production to science you can shake the little icon. But the real meat is in the gameplay. Distant Worlds overcomes it's cumbersome UI and less-than-stellar graphics to present a complex, challenging gaming experience. The strength in MOO is not in its complexity but in it's simplicity. It's a throwback to 4x games in the 90s where extraneous features weren't added. There's a lot to be said for the design of MOO in that it presents a straightforward but challenging 4x experience. I feel that in MOO my decisions count and I'm not overwhelmed by so many choices that any single choice feels trivial. The choices here have weight and that lends itself to giving MOO that all-important ""one more turn"" feel that so many other games do not capture.A couple of other positives are the pacing and a lack of bugs. Pacing is important in a 4x game and many of them drag on for too long (Civ V, I'm looking at you) where a player must spend 5-10 hours in ""mop up"" mode. MOO's pacing is quite nice in that once you know you are in a strong position it's quite easy to then wrap up the game and start another. As for bugs, YMMV but in 30 hours I've not encountered a single bug. Not a crash, not a sound glitch. My hat is off to the devs for creating a solid game.The Negative:With that said, everying in MOO-Land is not perfect. As I said before the game doesn't do anything particularly wrong. And while simplicity is nice, this is game that needs more meat on its bones. In almost every area there are obvious design decisions that could and should be taken to add a little more complexity and a little more strategy to the game. This is a game that could really, really benefit from enhancements by the devs and/or a very open modding community.For instance, diplomacy is done OK but so much more could and should be added. Not to mention that there needs to be tweaks to how opponents react. Each reacts to things very much the same way and thus it takes away from the AI races' personalaties. Not to mention that severe hits for turning down a war declaration need to be smoothed out.Furthermore, there needs to be some effort made for players to specialize. Right now your planets all end up building much the same things. There should be unique buildings for different biomes, more specialization in ship design, more specialization in the races, more specialization in esponiage (which is a particularly under-baked system)...as it is there isn't enough ""strategy"" in this strategy title. Give me some unique buildings, unique planets, unique races, unique wonders and then let me create a unique strategy to conquer the universe. MOO doesn't do this and it's probably the biggest failing of the game.Another area that demands improvment is the combat. The battlefields are too small, too sterile, too limiting to be of any use. While I'd love a return to turn-based combat, that's not happening and I can deal with that. But give me some good options in this real-time world to create a unique attack pattern, the ability to play cat-and-mouse around a planet, use an asteroid belt to shield myself from incoming missiles, etc. Combat in MOO is an afterthought and right now is just best autoplayed when it could and should be a key component in the game.Finally, this universe could use a little more life. Exploration is dull and should be a far more engaging process. I am not speaking of an artifical limiter like more pirates but some way to slow expansion, more goodie huts and simply a more interesting exploration phase. It's a big universe out there and exploring it should feel more ""star trek"" where every planet has a story to tell.There also needs to be more events and minor civilizations (which were removed). I want to trade with minor civs and use them as pawns in this large chess game. I want to have to prepare for a pirate invasion (once I've had time to build up my military) or perhaps uncover a race of homicidal androids who are hell-bent on making the universe their own. A player should be faced with difficult decisions and events that they need to react to outside of their grand scheme. MOO does not do this and it really hurts the game.The Overall:As I started off, the best and worst thing I can say about MOO is that it does nothing particularly wrong. That ""just one more turn"" feeling is the ultimate arbiter in a 4x game and MOO has it but it could and should  be so much more. I've rarely, if ever, encountered such a solid 4x design that cries out - SCREAMS OUT - for some new, well thought-out features to take the game from a status of merely competent to be considered a wonderful classic. MOO has the potential to do that but it's up to the developers to make that happen.			"

												Why do I like this game?The most common argument against the new Master of Orion is the simplicity of the gameplay, but actually I see it as a huge advantage compared to other 4x games. I play sci-fi programs to experience the joy of mere exploration, to meet unique alien races, to participate in galactic parley or to conquer and crush ""lesser"" beings - withouth the burden of endless micromanagement. I like sci-fi games for the athmosphere, but too much detail can kill the fun, at least for me.And this is why MoO caught my attention, as it does not want to burden me with details in every corner, instead it offers a smooth ride across the galaxy every time I play it. Do I want I oversee and control each of my colonies, or do I want just to gather a fleet and wage war against others? It is totally up to me, as the game can offer pretty much support in every aspect, including colony management, ship design, research etc. Even if we wish to go without the help of the game, the mechanics are still easy to understand and master, and for me this is a pro and not a con.So if you seek a 4x game with serious micromanagement and weeks-long gameplay for every single run, in which you can put the pants on every single colonist by yourself, than you will probably find MoO a bit simple for your taste. However MoO can and will give you unique races, fancy-looking fleets, detailed galaxies and huge space battles, not to mention the athmosphere I really like in this game - this is where MoO truly excels.Of course this game also has some drawbacks: the rather basic spy system, sometimes inbalanced racial traits and the simplicity of the AI, but if we look the big picture, the final verdict is definitely positive.But enough talk, I must get back to my Sakkra fleet to crush the weasel Darlok scum once and for all...

												I picked up MoO-2016 at 50% Christmas sale.  MoO-2016 is a well stream-lined game with a good interface.  However, it is more or less the same game as its predecessors with updated graphics.  It could make for a fun multipler 4x skirmish game, because it is light on micromanagement and the play is fast.I have to give this a BIG THUMBS DOWN.  (1) The game includes nothing new or promising for the series.  The ship to ship combat could introduce a heavy layer of tactics into the game, instead it plays like Homeworld I. (2) Without mods, the game mechanics are absolutely broken.  The Antares are too powerful, and you feel like you have to use an exploit to just sruvive (on normal).  PRO- Streamlined interface- Excellent AI opponents; Civ series should take some pointers here. *COUGH*- Pretty graphics, except in fleet combat.- Good longevity with the tech tree.CONS- It's like the developers did not play their own game: major mechanics problems.- Nothing new.  (I suppose if you are traditional, then maybe that's good.)- DLC is new playable races, which basically is a graphics/sound pack.   "

												After seeing trailers and previews for this title, I knew I had to have it. It satisfied my need of nostalgia, and made me want to play a galactic dictator (or monetary star baron) all the time. The initial rush was great, and I enjoyed playing this title.Until the release of the Antarans.Sure, give us races that we played with in Master of Orion 2, that was great. Sure, give us the Antarans, they could be annoying but controllable. But with this? I have one planet, with a star base and a missile battery. And what happens?Defeated. Repeatedly. Doesn't matter if I try to rush with colony ships, they get blasted to bits by this overpowered race of roaches. And they always pick on me, even with three other races out there to butt heads with. And it doesn't help that I only have one colony while everyone else cranks out colonies like there's no tomorrow. Even on Very Easy, I get stomped with no relief. Best case scenario is that I ally with a race like the Humans; instead, I end up with races like the Silicoid or Bulrathi, both expansionist and warlike, and not keen on sharing space.Oh, and let's not forget random events that seem to severely hamper me when least expected. Even though the previous Master of Orion titles had those annoying mishaps occur, I could reload a save game before all that happened, and I'd manage to breeze through that turn with no harm done. Here, it seems like the events are already fixed, and WILL happen to you no matter what you do. Even choosing the Lucky trait didn't give me breathing room from, you guessed it, the ANTARANS!Frankly, I'm disappointed with how this game has turned out in the long run. Sure, I can turn off the random events and Antarans, but what fun is that if I did? I enjoy the game, but these new updates are killing off my joy for it.So until then, I'm just going to let it gather dust until they either reduce how OP'd the Antarans are, or at least beef up my defense.

												A good turn based strategy game for players new to the 4x genre.   A good mix of alien races to start out as, and gets more interesting if you focus your research to amplify your alien race starting bonuses.  On that note I feel there should be more frequency of choices with permanent consequences when choosing between technologies after researching a catagory in the research tree.   So a person can continue to build on there races bonuses to create a distictive playstyle but still have the option to veer off that path and onto something else.  Also more technologies to choose from instead of going with A or B.  I think it would add to the appeal of trading technologies as well, if this were done.  First game in a long time that I keep returning too to get the achievements, which by the way, some are hilarious.  Try playing as a Psylon to spy on the Humans.  Classic.			"

												If you get the game for free then by all means give it a go. This is another good game ruined by an update. Probably more balanced for multi-player, at the expence of the single player. It no longer stays true to the original sourse content for me. Is it unplayable? No! Not at all! just your saved games. A potentially great game damaged by a developers ego. The whole power trip attitude of: ""you are going to do what we tell you to do whether you like it or not."" Too bad I really had high hopes for this one. Time for me to shelve this one and move on. If they ever make the original release version available for download I would recomend that one over this current one.			"

												Rating is 2.5/5And I just bought the game...it was on sale by steam two weeks ago. Last ditch effort to make some $. Game has potential, a few annoying bugs need to be fixed. A few options need to be added also; e.g. planatary filtering, colonist reshuffling in Empire management screen, individual ship tactical detail in fleet managment window, updated weapon stats when changing weapons around in blueprint screen. I haven't even gotten into major battles yet. I am not sold on the tacticle screen yet; in MoO2 I like the fact that i could spin ships around for shield/weapon management, and could turn weapons off/on as i targeted each ship. I have a feeling this is going to have to be saved by modders. I might even jump in to see what i can add.			"

												Sadly I cannot recommend this game, though it has many pros.It is surprisingly complex for it's price-point, and has a reasonable amount of depth to really go for many different playstyles and strategies.  The tech-tree is pretty deep, and the micromanagement of planets definitely makes large impacts.  It is also simple and easy enough to jump in and start playing after watching a 15 minute youtube gameplay video, unlike games like EUIV where you have to basically watch 8 hours of tutorial to know how to do everything.There are a variety of races, good graphics, and the combat/battle system seems fairly complex with different weapon types, armor categories, engine and speed differences, as well as weapon facings.So why don't I recommend it?  It's unnecessarily long and poorly designed for conquering enemies.  I like to play all grand strategy games as a warlord who defeats and conquers my opponents through military force.  This game allows you to easily destroy all of their fleets, but you can almost never destroy or annex your opponent's planets.  There are limited ways in which you can even harm their planets, infrastructure or population.  You need specific technologies and specific ships with specific weapons, and even then you cannot take over their planet as your own.  You need further research of a specific far-teched military troop invasion, and must spend dozen[s] of turns getting an army from one of your worlds to one of theirs.  I played my first game on a cluster based galaxy, this was probably a mistake because the ONLY way to travel between distant star points is again a very specific technology far down the tech tree.  I rushed this, as was able to invade multiple enemy cluster areas, and none of my enemies researched this technology so I never had to defend or worry about being invaded or counter attacked.  It also took several turns to send reinforcing fleets, and is a poorly thought-out travel mechanic imo.So after dominating my opponents' armies and fleets, and attempting to conquer the galaxy, I realized how slow and tedious the process was.  I searched for a youtube video of someone end-game to see how many turns it would take, and someone who fully conquered almost every single available solar system in the entire galaxy on a super large map, still had EVERY SINGLE AI opponent left alive on random planets scattered throughout the galaxy.  Eliminating opponents, and taking over their planets seems to take way too long, and not be a possible playstyle.  For those who don't want to conquer their enemies, I guess this game deserves a look, but imo it's too tedious and tech-specific just to invade single planets, let alone entire enemy races scattered across many solar systems, let alone multiple opponents and enemy races.Also I've never played any of the other Master of Orion games, nor do I have any nostalgia or past experience with this series.

Instead this game ignores balance and has created a Civilization 5 in space.I had high hopes for a renewal of the franchise back to the original roots after MOO3 was a disaster, but this game is only MOO is looks and not gameplay.

												The game is almost a true sequel to Moo2. here are the problems: 1. real time combat just doesn't feel right. You never really know what is going on or if you're going to win.2. The game gets REALLY slow late game. I'm talking, hit the 'next turn' button and go get a coffee slow. Games literally take  tens of hours where really nothing is happening. It's hard to understand why this is so bad, except that it has to be a complete lack of optimization by the devs. I actually like playing moo2 over this simply because you can play a game in a few hours intead of days. (I have a core i7 with SSD and fast GPU). 3. Slightly watered down gameplay. Moo2 had a level of randomness that made games really play out differently. This version has some of that but not enough. Pirates are a weak mechanic and not very interesting.4. The AI. The scourge of modern gaming. It's not good. It can't fight, it has no strategy in terms of fleet positions, it doesn't even seem optimized much on the planet dev side, which is where you'd think some math and perfect knowledge would help. :\It's really a shame too, so many things in this effort done right. The art direction is a massive leap forward over what's been done on MOO before now. The sounds and vocalizations are enteraining. I'd be willing to overlook all the other problems if it just played faster.At this point get this game on sale if you're a fan. Don't expect to enjoy the end game unless you like to watch your life pass before your eyes with nothing to show for it. "

												This game is pretty middle of the road.  If all you're looking for is a mediocre 4X space game, this is the game for you.  For me, it was a bunch of annoying little things that really brought down the whole experience.  First of all, there's not a lot of information on how the mechanics work.  I guess I'm just used to civ games spoiling me with the civilopedia.  There is nothing like that in this game.  Confused about how pollution works?  Too bad, figure it out yourself.  Want to know what a leader's Disposition skill affects?  Time to Google it!  There is also no way to broker a peace agreement between two other warring races.  Basically, once they're at war, they will always be at war.  And therefore if you're trying to be nice to everybody, you'll keep getting diplomacy penalties with each of them for deals with the other.  That's not the only problem with diplomacy.  To trade multiple technologies, you have to use the dropdown menu multiple times to select them.  And it doesn't tell you anything about those technologies, like what they do or how much they cost to research (and therefore how valuable they are).  So you either have to do it blind; or write down what they have and you have on a piece of paper so you can exit out of diplomacy, go consult the tech tree, calculate what you need and what you think is a fair trade, go back to diplomacy, talk to the other leader again and try to work out a deal.  Far too much work and screen switching.  A similar problem arises with espionage.  Not enough information about the empire you're trying to spy on.  You can try to steal a technology, but why bother if the target race doesn't have a technology you don't have?  How do you find out?  Back to the diplomacy screen again to go through the several steps to reach the trade screen to see if they have any technologies listed for trade.  There's also only a few options available for spies to take.  You can't steal money, only technology.  I found most of my spies to be pretty useless.  I either let them sit at home doing counterepsionage, or sent them off to another race and just let them sit there and hide.  Also, when you detect a foreign spy, you have the options of capture, deport, or kill.  Why would you deport them when you can capture them?  I don't know, there doesn't seem to be any negative diplomatic consequences for one over the other.  Another case where having an in-game lookup for information would have been helpful.  I personally had a problem with pop-up tooltips.  As in, they wouldn't always show up and I'd have to keep moving my mouse back and forth hoping that they would pop. Even if you get them to pop-up, there are places where there is no information that there should be.  Like over the size/biome/resources for a planet.  What are they, how do they affect things?  Can I at least click on them to learn more?  No?  Well, I guess I'm flying blind again.I didn't really play a military-type game, so I can't comment on the combat.  I tried it out and it seemed stupid and boring, (and, again, suffered from lack of information) so I just used Auto-Resolve for any other battles.  Planetary management was mildly interesting, but it mostly just involved choosing whether citizens worked on research, food or production; and what the colony was going to build.  And how about a timer that lets you know when the galactic council is going to meet again?  Don't they schedule these things in advance?  So to sum up, this game would be a lot better if the developers had spent more time on making sure the player had easy access to the information they need at any given time on any given screen.  The bones of a great game are here, but that's about it.  I was just never able to find the fun.Edit: Oh, I almost forgot how annoying and unfunny GNN is.  The news scroll at the bottom seems like it might be funny but it scrolls by too fast to read so I have no way to tell.  And most of the time it just pops up to give you useless ""State of the Galaxy"" reports, which show which three races are leading in a particular victory option.  Why is that useless?  Because there is a management page that lists all of the victory conditions and all of the civilizations progress in them all the time.  So...  yeah.  Annoying AND useless.			"

												If you liked the old Master of Orion games and wanted a proper third entry into the series this is it. There are some serious issues though. Later into the game you start running into performance issues. Turns take forever to process after hitting the end turn button. Space battles start getting really choppy and bad FPS. Diplo screens start to get choppy and bad FPS, which is bizzare since its just talking heads. Playing in a larger galaxy with many alien races just hurries up the performance problems. There is a rumor going around that the Dev team has walk away from the project leaving any bug/balance fixing for modders to sort out. I put in for a refund because of the performance issues, but because they only showed up late in my playtime my refund didn't go through. So beware buyers, you may have a poor performing product on your hands that, potentially, wont be fixed.My specs:i5-3570KGTX10708GB RAM Win7 64bit "

												It is a great example of the adage about adding features and complexity does not make a product better.   It just doesnt move fast enough.  If you want to take over an enemy planet it requires you to;1) find one2) Research troop ships3) build a fleet able to defeat any nominal defenses erected4) Build troop ships5) invade6) If there is more than one planet in a system then rinse and repeat...Boring.  And forget about rushing your opponent.   Do you want to out-tech their ground units?  Good luck.   The tech tree is horrendously complex and not very transparent.It just takes too long to do anything.   I don't want to spend two hours before I can attack even one system.   If I am playing multi and I fall behind in the early game it is just a long drown-out defeat with no hope of turnaround.  yay.			"

												They have totally screwed with the player experience with patches that seem unnecessary for gameplay.  Most recent patch changed the entire ""Planet Pollution"" dynamic to the point that it destroyed many players' games and starved all their colonies.  It literally was like one day you had 45 planets all flourishing and the next time you loaded the game they were all dying quick horrible deaths and there was little you could do to stop them....oh and you were a total of 490 turns into an epic game at the time that was literally destroyed over night.  I wont waste time on this game, and frankly I am going to request a refund after this last S^%T show patch.			"

												One would expect Master of Orion (4), to take best elements of 1, 2 and 3 (yes there were plenty of good mechanics in MOO3) and put them together to create the best 4X space game ever. Unfortunately, anyone who expected so, overestimated the goals that apparently developers and publishers had. The game is pretty much a copy-paste of mechanics from MOO2 (and MOO1 by inference) with pretty graphics (which is undisputably good). The issue I see is that superior mechanics from MOO3 were not even partially implemented here. Don't get me wrong - MOO3 was far from being perfect, but it contained some of the very novelty and complex mechanics that improved the immerssion of empire management and gave feeling that you must explore the game also allowing one to use new features quite intuitively. The only poorly executed part of MOO3 - real time combat was in fact introduced to MOO(4), but so far it is as plain and boring as it was in the infamous precedessor (although with correct 3D field and perspective this time).It amazes me that having access to all code and IP for all 3 MOOs, developers decided to create Master of Orion 2.5 all over again. Instead of taking on the vision of an ultimate 4X game that this game could be, they apparently decided to lower the ceiling and gave us same old stuff that everyone knows and which cannot possibly fail...Hey Devs - are you going to do a proper Master of Orion 4? If you cannot - get someone who will.At least they had decency to skip 4 from the name...			"

												Sorry, but after more than an hour messing around, I've been trying evertything to not have the sound crackle and echo to a point where it's unplayable. It just ruins everything.Yes, I've checked drivers, etc. My workstation is just fine, I'm running video editing (and hence audio too) without any single issue. Whatever the resolution and USB sound cards I could use, the issues were the same.Only other game I've ever see do that wa sthe previous MOO. My guess is that they could learn some programming skills from quite a few indies over here instead of trying to leverage crappy old code.I am happy playing games which are a LOT more demanding than that without a single issue. My refund requests are on their way (I had taken the DLCs too).Avoid this bug-ridden crap (at least for the sound). There are plenty of nicely working 4X around on steam.			"

												I really enjoyed MOO games playing these back in the 90's when we use to load up on DOS.Unfotunately for this game it isn't finished and clearly wasn't finished when it was released and there has been MAJOR patches but even then still seeing huge issues and it is primarly optimization.Turns take too long to calculate - optimization problem.Beam weapons are trash.  You might as well take them all out of the game as missles are always going to be better.  If you play, look for the ""MIRV"" adjustment on your missle and add that to any missle you're shooting and add the Dauntless missle system + fast Missle Racks to your system adjustments.  It makes for easy conquests.The game randomly crashes for me.  Not sure why - but it is either on the boot up of the movie if I don't hit ""ESC"" fast enough or it randomly crashes as I start the match.  No idea what is causing that.Battles begin to take too long as ship sizes increase.  Optimzation problem.Steam achievements appear to be broken.  You'll notice the 1% global achievement process on all the ""master of orion"" win ""victory types"" - this isn't because people aren't acquiring each version of win.  Why the disconnect?Antaran homeworld battle is vastly more difficult to acheive a win with than conquest, economic, technology, turns, and diplomacy.  Is that how it is suppose to be?What does ""Disposition"" do for leader status?  I can't find it anywhere.  There should be a drop down explaining each of the things that leaders offer as to why you want to hire them. Leaders need more traits - why only one?  Everyone should have a minimum of two except maybe Klackon (heehee). [ It is because they are uncreative -.-; ]I think I am done for now playing this.  I'll maybe come back in a half a year and re-review but for now - I'd recommend on ""sale"" for 10 dollars or less but not full price.  Plenty of other games that aren't as silly-frustating as this.			"

												Very boring game. If you are a fan of in depth 4X strategy games I would skip this one. Everything is very simplified on one end and then overly tedious on the other. I tried to refund but I really gave this one a chance and spent 4 hours on it :(Pros:Graphics are niceVoice acting is good(spent too much money here)Cool ship designCons:Boring gameplay. There just isn't much going on beyond the random super annoying pirate attacks and the random invasions from fleets that 2 shot your ships. Place the game on harder difficulties and your simply faced with more overwhelming fleets earlier.Pollution is a silly mechanic that attempts to slow down planet development but is very tedious to deal with at random points in the game. All it does is force you to stop producing something useul to make these buildings to reduce pollution. Do that and you move on until the next ""Tier"" is hit where you have to research and/or produce more of these buildings. So many other things could have been done for pollution.(I.E Pollution is something that all planets will have much like it is now based off population/type of buildings/type of planet. Pollution is a process that has different effects that a player can choose to reduce/increase/manipulate in different ways using research and buildings. The goal would then not to build X to reduce pollution level but rather X research combined with X building may take 25% of said pollution effect and apply it in a positive way to the planet. This way you have an interactive in depth element for the player to manage that isn't about making more buildings to make more buildings when this meter gets too high. Fleet travel is overly tedious and has a very fake feel too it. You take space travel and have chunked it down into these tiny little movements. Huge spans of space are taken up with these knee jerk movements of your ships ""traveling at warp"". I would rather your ship have a wind up time at the one end of the space lane and then Warp all the way through to the other end then what you have now.Fleet combat is just bad. The entire setting feels very fake and the look of the ship models as they glide across the map like it isn't even there gives your battle this weird ""I'm playing a board game"" thing which is just weird. The way ships turn during combat is very unnatural. I would rather have a simulated battle scene like Endless Space than what we have here.Very much dislike how the galaxy is split up, again it gives the whole game that ""board game"" feel. This has a lot to do with the ""choke point"" feel that the universe has been given. So closed off and a poor simulation of the real thing. I know I've played a space strategy board game in my far past that this reminds me of so much. Wish I could remember the name.Diplomacy is pointless? I don't really understand the point of it. There are a few diplomacy options that have any meaningful effect for the AI. Most of it they shrug off or horribly abuse.Espionage also has little effect on the AI but can be very annoying when done to you. IF the AI even bothers to use it at all.Leaders are a very expensive investment for not a huge return. This is especially true early on when you are constantly harrased by these leaders to hire them. If you don't know any better you will quickly find yourself in a positon where you have 3+ leaders and no income but they arn't really doing anything for you. Later in the game you come across leaders that can make you income. These are nice and useful.Overall: 4/10 Buy this on sale for 10 bucks. Pass on the DLCs, they are a money grab that should have been released with the main game and don't add anything but new races.			"

												If you are a casual gamer with little time and you are looking to get your feet wet in the 4x niche but with very little commitment on your part, then I recommend this game.If you are looking for that old MOO feel, then just move right along to something else.Pros:1.) Nice voice acting2.) Nostalgic races3.) You can customize your own race like in MOO24.) It's not MOO3, or anything like MOO35.) It's pretty.Cons: 1.) Horrible combat mechanics - not even worthwhile to control the battle or even watch it. Just let the dice roll...2.) Tech trees feel like I'm playing a Sid Meyer game - half the time it's near impossible to tell what the tech means...3.) Space lanes.  I am limited by space lanes.  I get the idea they are trying to push.. making it feel like there are borders.  But in space, there are not any borders and no walls except for the vastness of space itself.4.) No sense of exploration. It feel more like I'm walking through a building than flying through space.5.) Advanced tech doesn't matter.  By the time I get the advancted tech I've already won.6.) Very few ships in my fleet. Call me crazy but I miss MOO1 where you could have 32,000 per class, and very easily do it on scout size ships.7.) Orion seems like an afterthought.8.) Winning is just a little popup window.....			"

												This game seemed to have so much potential but left much to be desired.  There is minimal information available on the mechanics of the game and this limits the ability of the player to make a proper plan.  The limited number of turns is also unsatisfactory as a correctly made 4X has no time limit on it.  This more contemporary trend of putting turn limits on games is becoming very discouraging.			"

												Before this I'd never played Master Of Orion but I'd certainly heard of it. People speak of the original MOO like it was some kind of videogame Messiah and many game mechanics that 4X games take for granted these days can supposedly be traced back to this series in some way. So does this remake hold up?The gameplay is your usual space 4X. You start off with a single planet and a few ships and from those humble beginnings you must forge an empire and then decide how you want to conquer the galaxy. This can be through peaceful means like science and diplomacy or you can just decide to blow everyone up with space lasers. The presentation is great with the stars, planets and fleets all beautiful and shiny. The alien leaders look great too with some well known voice actors. Ever wanted to be shouted at by a birdman voiced by Mark Hamill? Your wish is granted.Many have criticised the game for oversimplified mechanics and they're not entirely wrong. The game seems to lack depth compared to other games like Civilization and never quite pulls off the 'Oh crap it's 3am' kind of immersion you usually get with a 4X. It's still entertaining however and I'll play it when I want a more relaxed strategy game, and it could be perfect for introducing someone to the genre. Not the videogame Messiah I was promised but still fun. Any game where you can build a Death Star(ok Doom Star but screw copyright) is gonna keep me entertained.			"

												As a bit of background before the actual review. I started with this series back in '96, sitting on my father's lap as he played on our old Aptiva. Master of Orion 2 was one of the first games I owned myself and I got hundreds of hours on that in my childhood. So I am a bit biased towards the series. However in regards to this product I can say that I am quite happy with how it feels. It has much of the same feel as the older members of the series, with exploration and fleet development being a major part of it's overall appeal. The graphics are lovely and so far I've had no framerate issues to note. The game runs very well and crashes have been non-existant, even though I've only had it around a day. The characters all feel nicely animated and as though they have a personality profile that helps to flesh them out. The voice acting probably helps a great deal with that (John De Lancie, Mark Hamil, Michael Dorne and other big names) to the point where when the humans deciede they don't like my expansion and roflstomp me I find myself yelling a definitive ""Damnit Q!"". Now for the cons of this piece. One of the commonly noted issues with this instalment is the lack of certain features that the previous games had. I can understand that, Heros were a useful feature that I do miss somewhat. As well as missing a few races if memory serves me. However in both cases I am willing to overlook them due to one simple fact. This is a reboot, it isn't Master of Orion 4. So when looking over everything one must keep that in mind. Things tend to be a little different in a reboot if a series. In all I can safely say I've enjoyed my purchase and happily recommend this title to those who are both returning fans as well as new buyers. Now if anyone needs me, I'll be dropping mad production with my sphess-bugs, Peace.			"

												I was really hot for this game when I heard about it, having played the original 2 games on release (and bought and tried the 3rd game which turned out to be a screensaver at best).  I bought the super deluxe collectors edition with the original series of games, the digital artbook, the soundtrack, etc..  There were some vid problems at first, probably caused by my machine being 7 years old at the time of the games release.  But they did regular updates and this problem was greatly alleviated, though not eliminated.  In fact, I was playing it pretty steady from about early September, 2016 to mid-December, 2016.  At that point they had an update, and they made the last three races and the Antarans available as DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT.  I wouldn't have minded this, but they wanted me to pay for it.  WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥?  I paid for the full deluxe edition of the game in pre-release and I have to pay MORE to get the finished version of the game?  No, I will NOT!!!!  So at this time, I have not played this excrement for probably 2 weeks or so.  I will not play it again until the DLC becomes free.  I recommend everyone stay away until this issue is resolved.  I'm not the only one complaining about this.  I'm sure they know of our displeasure by now.			"

It's  gorgeous, it's respectful of the MoO franchise's history, and most importantly, it's willing to update or jettison elements that don't work without trying to reinvent the wheel. After the impenetrable nonsense of MoO 3, this reboot captures what made me waste hours of my childhood playing the first two games in the series.Most of the complaints that I see here have to do with some of the playable races being parceled out as DLC. I can't honestly say I'm bothered by that, but if you are, the races included in the standard game should still give you plenty to chew on without shelling out extra cash.			"

												Greets readers.I have played this game for a bit now and I can honostly say, I got bored quite quick.. I love 4x games, from CiV to Sins of a Solar Empire to Gal 3  and of course Stellaris.When I play this game I am waiting more then I am doing things, exploring, the fun of it goes away quite quick because there is barely any random events going, you just go by planet to planet, checking if a nice one is in there to settle on and then move on to the next.The AI, I don't know if it is good or bad, I honostly dont have much interraction with them, the trading and stuff is okay, they dont demand insane things, but hey arent very intersting either, dont seem to have much of a personallity going.While the races all have perks, they still dont really change the way I play them, I can't really put my finger on it but it seems like its just very lineair, one dimensional ? The music, voice over and UI are good though, for sure. Overall, for 4x, with depth and challenge and random generated events, this is not the 4x game to choose from, there are a lot better ones out there.Thank  you for reading and I hope this helped you somehow.

Here are my list of complaints,1) Races that were included in previous versions of MOO are sold as a $10 DLC.  You also only get a few for that $102) The number of opponents are set too low, so that you cannot play all of the opponents.3) Modding is too restricted.  Ideally, we would be able to mod out the design mistakes but they restrict what is moddable.			"

												My take on Master of Orion... the new one.As a space-based 4X, it's pretty cool.As a Master of Orion... it falls short in a number of places.Let's compare it first to Master of Orion 2.  The... after much debate... champion of MoO.  The one that everyone, for generations, continued to look back at as the ""Legendary"" game when it came to space 4X.Master of Orion 2 not only made sense in what it did, but it had a tactical combat system that was unparralelled at the time, and often attempted, but never matched to.  When Master of Orion 3 came out, one of the major complaints was that the tactical combat was no longer available.This tactical combat system is part of what made MoO and MoO2 so legendary, and what broke the series when MoO3 came out and disappointed people, (I know... I was there when it came out.  Installed it and tried it and went back to MoO2.)The fact that the new MoO has decided to leave all tactical combat to real time strategy combat makes it no different than... say... Sins of a Solar Empire.  It has, instead of embracing Master of Orion's winning module, embraced today's game expectations.  Instead, the level of tactical combat that is available has put your combat control just a step above Endless Space, (I play a lot of these kinds of games,) but at about the level of Sword of the Stars.  Making it... just another space 4X game.In MoO2, your planets grew at a believable rate.  To have adequite food meant that nobody was starving.  The planet thrived, and about every 5 turns you'd get another population.  To have less than adequite food, the growth would be lowered, and with enough negative, would become starvation.  In new MoO, it takes after games like Civilization, Endless Space, and such, where now the excess food suddenly means more people reproduce.  Does gluttany = sex?  It does not.  This makes sense, perhaps, in a single city setting, where on the level of food means that just enough people are adequitely fed, but still not everyone.  Yet, planetary?  This food format does not makes sense.  Yes, it is a game, and this is a game mechanic, but this is a space (sci-fi) game, and much of it should be based off of science.In MoO2, (and even in games like Endless Space,) the more your ships fight, the more experience they gain, and they gain bonuses to attack and defense.  You can also recruit leaders for your planets and your ships.  NewMoO?  Not so much.  In fact, there is no such thing as ship experience, uniquely upgrading single ships, or, in fact, leaders.In MoO2, and this is sort of a tactical combat thing, you could disable your enemy ships.  Take out their engines, their systems... and then raid them with your crew and capture the ships.  This happens all the time in sci-fi movies, and is probably one of my favorite features from MoO2 that just about every other game is missing out on... including every other Master of Orion.I don't think I need to go on as to how NewMoO is not living up to the ideal of Master of Orion.All that being said, it is a good game.  It's worth checking out.  It has upsides and downsides in comparison to the other 4Xs of todays generation.  I have played this, Endless Space, Sword of the Stars, Sins of a Solar Empire, and many other space 4X games.  Today's space 4Xs all feel very similar.  This and Endless Space are both currently at the top of my list for MoO2 replacements.Oh, but I don't have to replace it anymore.  It's now playable through Steam!  So I no longer need any of them... do I?Ah, but alas, MoO2's difficulty is at the high end of the bell curve.  So you'd all better be wary of it, if you intend to try it for the first time.  When I was a young teen, I would play it non-stop for weeks.  My own personal empire dominating the galaxy, or falling before those damn Psilons taking over the council.			"

It is just a simplified Unity remake of MoO 2, and a not very good one at that.			"

												Less of everything you find in MOO2, plus a focus on collecting additional money with DLC's for features. AI is pretty awful to boot, and multipayer is a min-max fest with players familair with the nuances able to handily defeat anybody who isn't. Maybe 6/10 . If you didn't grow up with a good 4x you would think this was great - if you grew up with the classics this is yet another failed attempt to remake them.			"

												I have thousands of hours on Master of Orion 1, hundreds on Master of Orion 2 and thousands more on Master of Orion 3. This one is a disappointment. The human and khanate voices are parodies, and GNN a once nice part of the game, is so horrid, I disable it before every game.The tech trade is messed up. You can research some things, but anything you steal won't actually speed up your own research, a major point in the earlier versions. The fights ... have potential, but it's horribly wasted with such poor angles that i'd rather watch the battle from top to judge weapon efficiency instead of just enjoying it.The AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, as is the planetary governor (although in it's defense there are loads of useless buldings). Had one game where I'd receive a bribe to start, get a bribe to make peace, then repeat the cycle 4-5 times without damaging my relations.Since population growth is so slow, you can actually camp pirates, bomb them, then wait for them to respawn over and over.Wars are irritating since the AI sends massive fleets to your border, and just before it blasts your planet or outpost to bits, it declares war. To top it off, you don't get a ""Threatening fleet detected"" (as you did in MOO 1, when any fleet heading for your systems would show up in bright red!), but you do get it for those irritating space whale dragons things.I hated XCom when it came out because it changed the brand so much, but on it's own it still was a good game and it's sequel proved it, but this ... this brand is just dead.

												First off: this is a great game, ignore all the naysayers.This game maintains the ambience and feel of the old Master of Orion series whilst still providing a much improved and modernized UI.A lot of people criticise the choice to use star lanes from MOO3 instead of the fly anywhere  within range ability from MOO1&2.  Since most people skipped MOO3 this is a departure from what they remembered from MOo2.It's neither a superior or inferior solution but presents a different set of strategies.  With star lanes you can set up choke points, you can build military outposts and more physically define your species borders.  It's not ""realistic"" but neither are space bears, it's a game and it adds an interesting strategic layer.The graphics, the voice acting, the humour is all there; although seeing the same joke for the 3rd or 4th or 100th time loses the eventual appeal.The AI isn't the smartest, but there are multiple difficult levels and for anyone wanting a real challenge they can create a custom race and give themselves any handicap they like.For those coming from MOO2, the AI is no worse than in that game.  It is a lot more trusting than the AI in Civilization and a lot less likely to act in bizarre random ways.   Unlike civ if you've got a good relationship and a non aggression pact, trading and research agreements in MOO you're not likely to be declared war on by that species. I've not encountered any bugs in two play throughs.Very good game can't wait for the sequel now the current team have experience.  In the original series MOO2 improved dramatically over MOO1 and this one is already good and will keep me occupied for many many hours.  I have a feeling this will be one of the games I keep replaying over the upcoming years, always on rotation.  Ignore the people who complain this isn't identical to the game from their childhood, you see them on every reboot, it doesn't mean the game isn't good.			"

												If you played Civ 5 and MOO 2 then you will find the new MOO to be a complete mix of these two. Diplomacy is mostly copied from Civ 5 (earlier Civs had different diplomacy), the rest is pure MOO2 in almost every sense. This makes the gameplay very familiar straight from the get go.The diplomacy, contrary to Civ 5 actually makes sense (AI don´t backstab you 3 turns after they propose a declaration of friendship). Although you can read the AI´s intentions pretty easily in Civ5 after 20+ games.This, together with excellent voice casting and lines, makes for a very good game 8/10 because there could be more races available.Also the depth is not THAT deep, but for a player with limited time this game is just right.

												TL;DR: This is the first actual MoO2 remake that's both faithful and modern.I'm an old-school MoO fan, having played hundreds of hours of both MoO and MoO2. No 4X since MoO2 has captured me like that game did, because they all made fundamental mistakes or oversights.I did not have high hopes for this game, because the previews looked bad, but I was very, very pleasantly surprised. This game actually does have the MoO2 spirit, and almost all of the important stuff is there. The radical race differences, the simple yet effective economy, the ship design, the battles - it's all there. Some of it is streamlined, in particular the battles, but for the most part the important bits are intact.If I had to complain, it would be that they went slightly too far in the streamlining of the tactical battles. Realtime is fine, there's a wide variety of weapons and modules, and taking control of the battle does make a difference (particularly whenever torpedoes are involved), but I just wish they would have kept the shield quadrants, the subsystem damage and the ability to board ships.Other than that minor complaint, this game is great. Aggressive AI, a big and interesting tech tree with almost all the old MoO2 techs, hugely different races (telepathic and tolerant is out, but lithovore and creative is still in!), all in a very polished and neat package. Definitely recommended.			"

												This game is not perfect, it has some warts.  But, I really like this game and do recommend it.It is about 75% perfect, which is not bad.  The remaining 25% is not horrid, just not ideal.  The ""off-putting"" bits are some features from the old game which I wish it had not changed with so much of a nod towards a civilization type game.If you want the old Moo II game you can get it as part of the bundle.  It is a masterful work and so I recommend this bundle above all.The game plays quickly and smoothly.  No load issues, no performance issues, and much better than typical crash issues (Civ 6 crashes more often, for comparison).There is no scream out at you ""wrong"" item.  Just some that have room for improvement, which while less than perfect is far from a ""don't buy this"" flaw.Top wished for feature is that it remembers your last settings.  It doesn't.  So create your favorite custom race over and over.Next I would love some sort of hero system (would even pay for a DLC to add this).I like the ship design tool.  I like the option to auto upgrade.  I would like it extended to custom ships (just apply the same logic to them).I dislike the fact that the ships have unlimited range.   So I typically play on ""spiral universe"" which puts red jump lanes in which can not by used until mid to late game.There are about 1/2 dozen ""nearly identical"" games to this out now.  Sadly I own them all.  This one despite the flaws is the most fun to play.I read several of the negative reviews (and a few of the positive ones) before I wrote this.  Many of them raised as problems what I thought of as quibbles.  Meaning that while I typically agreed with them the issues raised did not detract  enough to move this space 4x down the list as best of breed for me.			"

												This game has got some serious flaws that make it completely not worth  the money. Gameplay elements from MOO2 were not included like capture of enemy ships.  The combat AI is at time comepletly non-functioning as it bee lines across map then stops when it could totaly win the fight if it would just give chase. Rockets fire distance is by default set for half range while enemy is set for full range. Setting the missle fire range frequently resets itself in combat.... super annoying as you have to recheck over and over the fire circle. Map is not 3d but flat as board.. MOO3 was 3D, another step back in game function. Random events can fire over and over on same faction... poor klackons and their sun going nova. Pirates in some cases are just down right evil when they can kill off 4 to 5 factions  in an 8 player game. Interface is dull as Moo3 if not more so. The spy functions mirror moo 3 and that should have been a hint to not do it that way but.... some hotshot program thought it was a good system. NOT. Ship customization in 1 2 and 3 is better (yes even 3). Do yourself a favor and stay away from this game. Get Solarus or Sword of the stars 1.			"

												I bought this game early Access, because I wanted a MoO in modern Tech. I very much disliked the ""Realtime""- Fights, that eliminate a lot of the tactical depth I loved in MoO 2, but well, i coped with it, because thats just the Times (I never ever found a RTS thats not dumped down compared to TBS, because otherwise it would be just to hard to beat a fast reacting machine). On the other hand I loved the atmosphere, the voiceacting and the music are great, graphics are nice, so overall, it was a nice game and I played for the sake of my memories of the good old games of my young adulthood.Then I saw three new races and wanted to give this another go - maybe the game would be ""ready"" now and the combat would feel like I have an actual impact on the outcome? And maybe I could play with the Elerians, my number two race of MoO2 (first was a slighltly adjusted Klackon without the uncreativ feat and less production-bonus).But NO! I Have to pay for it! I already payed 40 Euros for an unfinished game, because I loved the old Games, but I wont support this stupid milking policies the gaming industries are constantly doing any more. And I recommed You and every other customer out there should do the same.I realy, realy hope this review helps dropping selling numbers for this title, at least as long as they dont change their policies. I wont pay 50 Bugs or more for a simple reboot, no matter how good the voiceacting is.DO NOT SUPOORT THIS!(plz notice English is NOT my natural Language, mistakes will happen) "

Early Access Review
								I payed only an arm for this game, I still have my leg. If you are a fan of Moo 2 don't buy this game. The devs want to make this a carbon copy of the first Moo game with some minor extras but have no plans of implementing the things that set Moo2 apart and made it one of the greatest 4x games of all time. They have incorporated aspects of less successful modern games (for instance limiting travel to fixed waypoints to bottleneck and lengthen space travel LAME). They stole some concepts from other games like civ which probably add to the game in a good way but this definitely does not feel like Moo. No turn based combat, they stated in forums that it is hard to do it in 3D, as if thats even relevant......just do a 3D rendering on a 2d plain and don't ruin a great concept. I waited 20 years to be disappointed. They have limited race customization over concerns of balance to a point where it defeats the purpose. Don't get me started on the tech tree, shoulda built on the Moo2 platform for that instead of stealing the boring linear concept from the Civ genre. I waited 4 patches before writing this review to give them a chance to improve the game but it just keeps getting worse. My perception of the situation at this point is that the devs here are your typical ""I want to make my mark"" type of people and as a result they are a detrement to themselves. You know the thing about the wheel is that it does not need to be reinvented. As soon as they start incorporating features from Moo2 this review will change. Until then im going to move forward with the belief that I was tricked into buying a game that had no intention of ever being true to form. BAH HUMBUG!A quick update. The way they just changed how food works is awful. Just awful. cant produce anything because my 1 colonist on new settlements HAS to produce food or they will starve? Are you Sh***ing me? An advanced space fairing race that can literally travel between stars has to fully commit to farming to survive? Really? Are you trying to make the game even more cumbersome?			"

												Quick&Dirty:Got this game a few days ago at a christmas discount and had good fun with it, making my own little space empires but in the end the AI can't put up a fight, which ultimately gives the game little challenge. My playthroughs:I first went into the tutorial and got the game explained to me, but the game was so easy I thought it must be set to a low difficulty setting for the tutorial. I restarted on normal difficulty, but after easily bumrushing my nearest neighbour I restarted on the very hard difficulty and downloaded a balance mod (yay modding!). While the other races put up a bit of a fight in the opening moves of the game, by the mid-game I had a fleet that could crush anything thrown against it, mostly because I had super-large ships, while the enemy was still toying around with flea-sized ships. By then I realised that the game is wonderfully worked out and a good fun space empire sim, but the AI is simply too weak to keep up with an intelligent human player, even if the difficulty setting gives them a resource advantage. This is a pity and ultimately what turns me away from the game, but before I got there I spent a decent amount of hours playing. Looking back, I got value for my money, so this game gets a thumbs up from me.The good:Good voiceacting (they really went all-in on the famous actors).Distinct races.Lots of empire-building fun.Active devs (so there's hope for the future!)The bad:Poor AI: This is what cripples the game currently for me. The AI can't put up a decent fight, spitting out little ships and measly fleets mid-endgame while my fleet has multiple titans, each of which is capable of wiping out the enemy single-handedly. But it also extends into diplomacy (really bad trades), ship customization and empire expansion. The AI is just not up to the task.Verdict:I enjoyed my little space-empire building frenzy. Sure, the AI couldn't put up much of a fight, but I had fun exploring and empire-building and fighting huge space-monsters. I got value for my money (game was discounted) and if you have run out of games to play and nothing new is on the horizon, you can pick up this game to fill the gap. It's not the best, but it's good fun for a while.Tip:The Space Amoeba stats are a lie.			"

												As one of the many long time fans of the MOO franchise I have to say this is the single best version I have ever played.This is not a clone of any of the previous titles, rather its done in the same style and foundation with many more optimizations and fun additions.  Not every singleplayer game has to take a dozen hours, with the wide array of customization options you can engineer a campaign that lasts one gaming session or one that can last days.  Your choice.Like most of the MOO title technology trumps all so the Psylon are still the goto race for most players, but if you don't choose that race you can still do well in a singleplayer campaign provided you stick to your racial strongpoints.There is still alot of work that can be done and optimization to come (lithovores come to mind, nothing in the game is designed to accept a player race with lithovore trait yet) however the game is READY TO PLAY at this time.So if you like space turn-based strategy and tons of empire customisation options this is a no brainer of a buy.

												If you want to know why you should not waste money on this game, look no further than the pirates.They don't pirate. I know the pirates in earlier games weren't amazing, either, but by now the pirates should have some function other than ""screw up the early game"".That's all they do, literally. And this is the design philosophy for this game: add something to slow down progression, otherwise the game is too easy.The pirates never pirate. They don't take anything. They destroy everything they can, and otherwise just provide fodder for no reason. There's no diplomatic interaction with the pirates, even tho it seems an obvious idea to be able to buy them off or pay them to attack an enemy, etc. Nope. They are just randomly spawning units that fly directly to their death over and over until they've sufficiently weakened your defender to kill it.It's so damned *boring* and predictable and not fun. Anti-fun, if you will.If you're not convinced by that, then consider the pollution mechanic. It's literally just a time waster. You must micro-manage pollution on your planets, even planets with next to nothing in the way of industry.I mean JESUS people, I get it, you want some internet karma for caring about the environment - that's great. I am really impressed that the devs are SJWs out to clean up the lakes and rivers, but this is a game set in a technologically advanced universe. Why can't we use alternate forms of energy? Why can't we use clean production processes? Why must you beat me over the head with your tired politics?Just. No.Just save your money - the bad design choices and political nonsense just aren't worth the price of admission.			"

												As someone who played a lot more MoO 1 than MoO 2 (And basically no MoO 3), this game was a perfect recreation of everything I hoped and wanted. The game is beautiful and faithful, down to the little details like the musical numbers when colonizing a planet or researching a tech. It's a bit simple compared to modern space 4X games, but if they added more stuff to it, it just wouldn't feel like MoO to me. Highly recommended if you played and enjoyed the original.			"

												This would be a fine introduction to the 4X genre if you have a friend you'd like to get into the hobby.That said,  some of my finest gaming memories are playing the original MOO and MOO2 back in my misspent youth, so I'm a bit more of a grizzled stellar emperor, and my standards are demanding.We've had a bit of an abundance of riches after a decade long drought-- one thinks immediately of Stellaris-- which layers on substantially more complexity and depth.   There's also the absolutely amazing Endless Space series, which is crafted amazingly well.  So MOO has some rather stiff competition these days.By those standards, is this title a success?   Well-- yes, and no.   The production values are absolutely first rate.   The game looks gorgerous.   The sound design and voice acting is also first rate.   Which is something you normally do not associate with a 4X title.The no comes from the depth of gameplay-- I won a 10 hour campaign on Hard with basically one hand tied behind my back.   There were no surprises-- which was very disappointing-- the Klackon did not, for example-- seem to prefer smaller swarm strategies, as before-- and the Bulrathi did not lean towards larger, Battleship-type fleets.   Every race basically was super nice to me until I wiped the galactic floor with them.The tech tree is almost unchanged from earlier games.   The antareans show up-- but their AI seems weird.   They sometimes start to bomb your colonies, but then change their mind and leave.   This makes them vastly less of a horrifying threat.Taken holistically, this is a satisfying nostalgia purchase at its price point.  I'm happy another generation will get to enjoy some MOOOOOOOOO addiction.    "

												It might be a decent game but in the 2.8 hours I played, I noticed it rather lacked in polish. A lot of it feels 'dumbed down'. The feel is like mostly MOO2 with a handful of MOO3 dashed in for supposed good measure. Considering that the game supposedly released as a full game in February, I'd have expected not to encounter two graphical glitches in my 3 hours of play.Maybe buy Galactic Civilizations 3 or Endless Space, both are better examples of modern space 4X. This one is just cashing in on nostalgia.			"

												I am a huge fan of this series.  I fist played Master of Orion back in the mid 90's.  Later I was a huge fan of the sequel MOO2.  I don't need to say anything about the 3rd.I want to play this game very much, but it consistently crashes while I am playing it.  It is very disappointing because what I have played seems enjoyable.  I do not own the latest and greatest computer, but this is not a graphics driven kind of game (and previous titles never were) so I assumed that my aging machine ought to be able to run it.  I accept that I can't play all the latest and greatest until I un♥♥♥♥♥enough money to buy a new computer.  But I have run more graphics intensive games without fail on my machine, and I am unhappy that this will not work.  As a result, I cannot recomend it.			"

												This game is not MOO2. It is trying to be but just falls to short off. I will recommend the game but there are some things that I miss from the old game. What I miss the most is that the custom race option only has 10 points and the other already made races have more points and access to more custom options. This destroys what I thougt was so good and fun in the old game and gave it so much replayability. Now you must choose one of the prefab races or accept to have worse(fever points) race then the rest of the galaxy. They even make it worse by limiting what you can put togheter(if you are creative you get 25% research and access to all the technology, but cant chose 50% research to go with it...), I also think that the ekstra resources are in % instead of a whole one(+1 research or +2 production) a bad decision. The main thing by chosing these bonuses is so you will get at edge quickly, something the total resourch times some procent delivers late game.But what I have playd then the game is so far solid in my opinion(whice is why I am recommending it) but I doubt I will clock inn as much playtime as I did in MOO2.

												Better than the reviews would have you believe. Not as complex as a game like Stellaris, but well polished, and confident game that leans on a good foundation. At this point the game seems largely complete, (Dec 31 2016). The combat is good and the game has some great roleplay capacity, as the races are fairly well fleshed out. Additionally, the game has soul, with planet destroying superweapons, an interesting espionage system, col looking ships, and nifty ground battles. The diplomacy system functions, though on normal difficulty no one seems particularly aggressive. I'd recommend it for anyone who enjoys 4x, and as an introductory 4x game this is probably the title for you. I look forward to playing more.  "

They locked out 2 standard races with dlc, which is BS, and the race customization isn't as comprehensive as it was, but they streamlined the gameplay and smoothed out some of the more tedious features of the series. Overall, this is a super fun remake that does justice to the series. I'll be playing this for years to come.			"

												They try so hard and yet fail.As a huge fan of this game series I was very hopful about a new look and take of one of my favorites.I bought the game and played in beta which went as most beta's do bugs and all (but what does one expect it was beta) then came launch and I was excited! Surely they had polished the game and it was ready to play right? Wrong. The game falls flat. Though their endless attempts to please every fanboy out there this looks (sorta) like MOO, the names are familier, the idea is familier, but it is not. The AI is buggy, diplomacy is still a false pretence, and unless you want to do nothing but build endless colony ships to settle every planet possible you will enevitibly start to falter as things just go south for no reason in the mid game. Coupled with a strange problem where reguardless of permission settings the game crashed every 50 turns or so becuase it couldn't write to the saved game file randomly booting you out of the game completely post launch games because frustrating. So I uninstalled and let it be.A few days ago I noticed there were new DLCs and I decded maybe just maybe things had changed. So I bought the DLC pack (races that should have been in the game from the get go), and was excited once again to dive in to the MOO Univers and play out some galactic conquests.  Yet as I approched the mid game it was just as stale as before and the random crashes persisted. The developer has commented on other disscussions about this same issue and their response is basically ""Send us a screen shot or there is no problem"" / ""Well it is windows 10 not us, sorry"". Save your money, and just down load the Original MOO & MOO II and play them in DOSBOX much better experience.			"

												Awesome game, feels very nostalgic from my younger years playing Master of Orion 1.Only played a couple games so far, but I've been pretty hooked.I like how the game kept the rounds nice and streamlined like MOO1. (MOO2 and 3 was too much mirco management imo).Love the voice acting, and the graphics ^^I would have to say that the combat isn't very intuitive. I spent the first game thinking the combat was always automatic. Getting into manual tactical view isn't very intuitive but its there if you want to use tactics in your battles. While the cinematic view looks ok, the combat was much easier to understand in the overhead tactical view.Would very much recommend to anyone who enjoyed MOO1 or turn-based sci-fi!			"

												Extremely buggy game, not recommended.After first buying the game it wouldn't run for me.. everytime, after like 20 turns the game would freeze for good, same with a loaded save game. A month later, this has been fixed. I can now play the game overall, but it remains glitchy:- ships in combat don't react to commands- combat map view jumps eratic and randomly (flickers)- combat freezes and is impossible to continue- tactical combat freezes and own ships turn invulnerable (nice but... uhm...a bit boring?)- CPU overheats, coolers run at 100%, PC shuts down (never got above 30% even current top 3D games like Star Citizen)- random crashes to desktop.- autosave failingalso i don't like some very basic usability choices such as not being able to save a custom race and having to redo it, or not being able to select your race color. Ships looks not being reflected in build menu is a bit irritating. I won't go much into the good aspects that are there, as I've been a fan of the original MOO - and while a lot of that spirit is still here, I fail to see great new ideas. I'm afraid the original is actually better than this one. This too might be an enjoyable game eventually - but it feels simplified as compared to the original and there's a lot of work on stability yet to be done.  "

												MOO4 is a nice return to the franchise.  It really plays very similar to MOO2, without the Antarians attacking randomly.The micromanaging of your colonies is made fairly easy via the way events are presented each turn.MOO4, which by the way, I really wish the folks behind the game just called it MOO4 to avoid confusion.  It's ok to have lots of sequels, look at Final Fantasy!  Anyway, MOO4 swaps out the MOO2-turn based space combat engine to a RTS style engine found in any other game of this genre.  The cinematic camera in the space combat is annoyingly bad, with no way to control camera, or battle.  Top down seems the best way to watch space battles and naturally it never ceases to entertain to watch large fleets unleash death upon each other.Overall MOO4 feels and plays a lot like MOO2 in my opinion.  It doesn't really bring much new to the table in terms of comparison to MOO2, but at least it's copying from a proven game.  All the familiar races and elements, right down to the types of random events feels taken straight from MOO2.It gets my thumbs up, because it's just as fun as MOO2, but I gotta say, I hope this series evolves if they plan to offer addons or another game (MOO5.)  If you liked MOO2, it's almost certain you'll like this, it's nearly the same game.			"

												I've loved every Master of Orion game, including Master of Orion 3 (a game I feel gets a worse rap than it deserves) and this one. But I cannot recommend it to anyone else.If you're a fan of prior Master oF Orion games, playing this raises a lot of fun little nods to them. Everything from the reprised races from old games to the fact that the colonization music is the same tune as its MS-DOS ancestor. The people that made this game definitely knew the Master of Orion series.Other reviewers here have brought up very valid points, however, regarding how this doesn't embody the spirit of Master of Orion. No free range travel, making various drives and fuels boring and inconsequential, overall simpler. Star lanes make things very isolated, and present a very different, in a much simpler way. Technology tree is very straight forward, even if you've got the illusion of choice, you're very likely to just be picking the same tech everyone else is, and unlike the prior games you eventually can just research everything (outside of very VERY few technology categories where you pick what effect it has and have to trade with another empire that picked the other), overall the science track is much simpler. Combat is very straight forward, with none of the dynamics of missile counter measuring, and all the jazz with boarding ships with tractor beams or assault shuttles, making for a simpler tactical battle altogether.You'll notice a common theme, here... Everything's simple. Very... Easy to grasp and just click through without much thought or care.That's when I realized the real issue I have with this Master of Orion reboot. And why I also still enjoy it. It's simple. Easy. And really is just a lot of playful references to the older games.Presently, I just play the game when I'm on downtime at work, or need to break the monotony of studying. But if I want to truly sit down and enjoy a game? I'd sooner just go for Master of Orion 2. This game sooner belongs on a tablet or cell phone, with how simple it is, and I'm seriously wondering if that's the idea they had at the start.Overall, I enjoy the game. But if you want a real TBS experience, I'll much sooner recommend ANY other Master of Orion game. I'd only recommend this if you've got a laptop and barely have an hour or two to kill in a very simple 4x Strategy game that probably should've been made a tablet game.			"

												Master of Orion is both a massive hit and miss depending on your perspective. The game has clearly been lovingly crafted to be faithful to the original trilogy games but where it falls off is in the level of simplicity that has been incorporated into the game. This isn't necessarily a bad thing though. So what is the bad? Well when your game is sequel to another you usually expect some kind of innovation to the game's mechanics to make it new and exciting, not just a reskin. Master of Orion is at it's bare bones a reskin of Master of Orion 2 and doesn't seem to try anything new mechanically. The good though is that this game has clearly been a labour of love, from the effort put into getting iconic sci-fi voice voice actors to the universe itself constantly and enthusiastically encouraging you to expand and explore this game is very much, a good game. Unfortunately though it may fall short of your expectations of a 4x grand strategy or of a sequel.With all that said though Master of Orion is truly made for new players and makes for a great introductory point to 4x strategy. The user interface is easy to understand, doesn't clog up the display and is very elegant, the galaxy and worlds look amazing, colourful and alive, and there is exceptional voice acting to help make even the most mundane tasks enjoyable.This game is worth trying out, if you find it's too simple you can easily just ask for a Steam refund but if you do end up liking it you will find yourself engrossed in this game for hours at a time. 9/10			"

												I gotta say the negative reviews have me at a loss... the game is everything Moo3 should have been.  I think most of the angst spawns from the developer stopping patches.. I guess as a old gamer this is not as big an issue to me as in the day or yore we bought a CD and dealt with w/e ending up installing.  The current mindset that a game is dead just because the developers dont constantly fiddle with it is silly.  They made the game they set out to make, and now they are done. Simple as that.  Now that out of the way lets review some pro/consProsGraphicsUIGameplayease of play (you don't need a degree and 6manuals to sort what your doing)spirit of Moo firmly in placeConsSometime the AI seems so braindead its almost comicalthe thematic attempts of some of the voice actors can be a bit tiresome on a long gamemultiplayer (its turn based.. if you and your friends aren't planning a weeklong gaming session look elsewhere)Ship based combat... this is not a issue that is unique to MoO... it seems more and more that RTS and TBS games are dumming down the combat to sit back and watch the rock paper scissors simulation... tbh I hate it but thats the new norm.To summarizeis it worth 30usd?  well thats up to you but I found it so yes.  Is the game dead? not hardly just finished.  Would I recomend it?  Yes I would... its not the MoO it might have been, but you will get your moneys worth in game time and in the end thats what really matters. "

												It is coming together now. :)When i played a while back, it was to casual for me. Stellares is to ""nerdy"" for me, but IOS stuff is to easy. So i really liked MoO2 because it sits right in the middle. Don't get me wrong Stellares is a great game in its own rights, but you have to love micromanagement to play it. This Game (after a casual start) moves with big steps toward this sweet spot MoO2 and Civ Games are in. So what you do really matters and changes stuff, but you don't need to make a degree in it first to be able to play. ;)So for me it is now getting in this:"" just one more round""-territory. Better then in MoO2 is that the races, news people, scientists,... now really have character and voices.The combat was one of my biggest problems (to casual) but now i can move my ships around from top view (like i should in a MoO).But you must play one difficulty lvl above what you think you should because medium is casual, hard is normal, ... and so on.It really gets a handle on bringing along what was good in the old games, and make it nice to control with new UI techniques and better looks.I play on Linux Mint 17.3 and have not encountered any bugs so far.

												This started out as a stable, boring game. After months of patchs and changes, it is now an unstable, boring game, and kind of a mess. The developers never had a vision, they just tried to copy MOO2. The voice acting is repetitive and was a waste of talent. In some places where there should be a cut scene, an actor reads a text box about what happened. I started escaping these fairly quickly as it is just boring to hear the same thing over and over. The two things that annoy me most are: (1) the polution effect and (2) the characters representing assistants. The polution effect adds nothing positive to gameplay and is just plain aggravating. Some of the assistant characters have annoying voices, and why are they all female? The silicoid are male and female? They were neither in MOO2. None of the aliens seems all that alien. The unforgivable sin is the space combat. I want it to be turn based so I can take my time to plan tactical attacks. Space combat is supposed to be the funnest part of this game. Boring space combat is completely unacceptable. This is another area that was handled better in MOO2. This game is a paint by numbers attempt at MOO2 that fails on every level and with the changes and patches it seems to be getting worse.			"

Early Access Review
								MoO is really a love or hate type of game. Do you want a full graphical & UI update for MoO2? Then leave it. Better yet: pretend it does not exist. Here are the main reasons:Combat:It lacks turn-based combat, the arena is very small, the AI of your ships is horrible in the realtime one, the AI OFF button is bugged, and you can't always select single units, only ""fleets"" of ships.Unit design:Now you have fixed slots (e.g.: 4 weapons, 1 propulsion, 1 computer, 1 shield, 6 special...) you can fill up to the capacity of the ship. Again, this lessens the combinations you can come up with.Research:Instead of completely separate research branches, MoO has a Civ-like tree. You can leave a few techs out, but not much. You can't specialize in one branch and then trade or steal the remainder. There are some techs that present you with a choice of a technology duo, but those are nowhere near the choices you could burden yourself with in MoO2 using the uncreative perk.AI:They all appear utterly insane so far, with absolutely zero sense of reality. I've seen better sense of it from Civilization enemies at launch date.Leaders:Completely missing functionality.Space travel:Space lanes and infinite fuel instead of fixed max distance before needing a refuel. I don't dislike this most of the time, but some might. It does make cutting off a segment of space harder and easier at the same time....I could go on with smaller nuances. Development:The main problem is, the devs stated they will not be adding turn-based combat or rewamp the research. They will add custom races, espionage, but not much else that is missing now. They created a ""more accessible"" game, not a successor. One without much of a character.Plus side:There are positive changes as well, for instance, I love that at the end of the game, you can reload the game from any given turn. There are voiced characters, although your advisors get annoying really, really fast. And the UI responds to the now-standardized way, although there are many, many shortcuts that are missing for a power gamer. And there is a catgirl with cleavage, if you're into that.ConclusionSo if you are a fan of old Master of Orion and want at least that complexity, go to GoG.com, buy MoO2 again, and forget this ever existed. It's way cheaper and way better.If you are new to the world of 4X space strategy games, this might be a good watered-down tutorial. Kinda like how American beers compare to European ones.			"

												This game is CRAP.  About the only things it has going for it are a well designed UI and a few lines of voice recordings from famous people.  Beyond that, EVERYTHING falls far short.  Graphics are cartoonish and dated.  Much info is missing from places you actually need it, such as weapon range/damage/effect/fire rate info in ship designer, or tooltips explaining what custom race picks actually do.  Pretty much everything in this game is a direct rip off of ""sword of the stars"", right down to the phase lanes (sorry, star lanes) and the completely useless ""real time"" tactical combat that actually gives you almost zero control over your fleet.  The AI is totally worthless, either you have a fleet and it does nothing, or you dont have a fleet and it declares war on you for no reason, even if you were friends.  There is nothing interesting about the galaxy at all...no minor races, no exterior threat like the dreaded hyperspace beast, no antarans....absolutely NOTHING but the dimwitted one-dimensional AI to offer you any challenge or something to do other than declare war on other races.  The tech tree is extremely limited and very few technologies are present that actually have any measurable effect on your empire.  Other reviews have gone into more detail about how this game is completely lacking in almost every area, so I won't.This game is completely unworthy of the ""master of orion"" name.  DO NOT spend money on this game...like me, you will regret it.  Sword of the stars is almost exactly the same game, but manages to do something that this game does not: it's actually, at times, enjoyable.			"

												(Edit after playing more hours.)Very disappointing.TLDR: game is oversimplified and bland.          (  the poor ship combat and loss of real weapon differnces from MOO3 is what kills it for me.)          ( Saddly in this MOO beam and mass driver weapons funcition almost identical,  Fighters bombers and missle almost identical.  Where as in MOO3 each weapon had its own unique flavor among mass driver, laser , plasma, missle, fighter, bombers intercepters.)(PROS: easy to lean and play since its so simplified.)... This game turned into an oversimplified version of master of orion 3.  I feel like this is what MOO3 would look like if you wanted to make it into a mobile app.Ship combat is stale, the battlefield is so tiny ships weapons cover a quarter of it.  Making maneuvering and scouting pointless.In MOO3 you would design ships to fit rolls in fleets including specialized point defense ships, bombers carriers, scout fleets (since the battle field was large enough that you would have to scout out enemy ships.)   The tech tree was interesting in MOO3 because each play through you would get different techs you wouldn’t get auto fire, enveloping, miniaturization,  on every weapon you would work with what you had and strategically trade for what you wanted.MOO3 had a real economic, population growth simulator not little guys you drop around 3 choices.  ( MOO has some differnce in techs with each playthrough just not the extend of MOO3 and not in weapon mods.)I don’t find the great voice acting adds to the game, the click of the klakons or beeps of the meklar conveyed just as much and gave them real personality instead of everyone speaking English. MOO3 had horrible game breaking bugs, but its scope was amazing, the creativity you could use with ship and fleet design.  The real difference in weapon functions including ranges optimal damage range accuracy fire rate for point defense was so much more interesting.In this MOO I have had the enemy ship AI go straight across the battlefield tell they hit the “wall” and just stop they didn’t even rotate to aim their front facing weapons at me multiple times. ( I have also had a couple combat freezes and large fleet battle lags)all and all MOO3 with vanilla or strawberry mod >= MOO.			"

												This game feels a bit like MOO for console.  Everything has been ""dumbed down"" The game is resonable well polished, looks good, few bugs and It would probably stand up 10 years ago.  It stands up well on its own if you have never played a 4x and don't compare it to anything.but the 4x genre has moved on, other games leave this feeling dated and incomplete.Its sad to see a game that defined the 4x for years get released like this.I find myself watching TV while playing this game.IssuesThe tech tree is very repetative with no real innovation, just 25% more +1 dmg and you don't really decide what to research you just work along the tree.   Often attepting to pickup just production and planet techs, researches everything; guns, shields etc there is no way to focus a ""tree"" like other games.All races share the same tech tree and have very little variation in racial traists outside 25% bonus in X to make them unique.  The one race that doesn't consume food (like every 4x these days) is the only Unique trait.The AI is hideously dumb and not very agressive, You have to try to provoke combat in most situations and then its simply a matter of defeating 2-3 fleets and GG you won. now you spend 50+ turns playing Whack-a-Mole on planets that spawn a single frigate.  The game ""ends"" in 1-2 turns of combat.Increasing AI difficulty simply makes them cheat and build faster.There is no real tactical depth, the Combat is very simple, the area you fight in is too small to play ranged tactics and ships respond poorly to commands, about the only tactics involved is making sure missile vollys don't overkill small ships.The ""ship builder"" is the most simplistic thing I have seen in almost any 4x that basically boils down to, do you want direct fire weapons or missiles and upgrade your ships armor/shields x% every tech level.Unlike most games where a well built design can outclass multiple designs of the same production value this game feels like you simply pick what colour the lines seen in combat will be.Govening is poor, when you get a large amount of planets its quickly annoying to spam production, the game stops after a build queue of 4 as if we are saving memory space for consoles? Autobuild seems to randomly pick somthing, there is no large scale tools and managing fleets is just annoying.I feel like the developers of this game need to play some ""MOO clones"" and implement all the innovation and amazing features that have been developed over the past 10 years.It feels more like a High rez texture pack for an old gamePros +Well polished+Simplistic for new players with good tutorial+MultiplayerCons-Simple-Dated-DullEndless spaceSpace empires VAlpha CentauriSword of the stars 1,2Gal civ  2,3PredestinationStardrive 1,2StelarisStarpoint GeminiStar Rular 2All offer much moreIf you have never played a 4x ""moo clone"" before this is a good tutorial introduction to the genre.if you want a better game and don't care for online multiplayer, get Stardrive 2 its superior in almost every way.

Of course this has economy, but it is not overly difficult to understand the consequences of your actions.  I've never liked diplomacy in any game ever - but I love it in this one.

												So let’s review Master of Orion, the rebooted offering from NGD studios. I have a love hate relationship with 4x games and often get the feeling that they all offer the same gaming experience. You get tech trees, alien species, anomaly bonus crates and a thin veneer of a story which is fluffed out by how you go about your galactic business. Weather it’s uniting factions with your diplomatic hippy powers or crushing your enemy’s with fleets of alien♥♥♥♥♥♥kicker ships. You can pretty much do as you will. Master of Orion or Moo as it’s funny acronymic title is okay for a 4x title. I see it as more of an entry level 4x game. It has nice cut scenes, fairly in-depth tactical space battles and a Klingon traitor doing the voice overs. The problem I had with the game is I just couldn’t get in to it. After the first opening moves (or turns) everything just seemed to slot into generic 4x. The thing is I’ve played Distant Worlds which is a huge real time 4x game. Okay DW has graphics that would make a C64 blush but it has enormous depth and customisation. I’m not bashing Moo but just warning seasoned veterans of the genre that Moo in my opinion won’t satiate that galactic empiric feel you get from other 4x titles.So on to the obligatory pros and cons:PROS:Michael DornNice art assets and animationsThe races are pretty well thought out but limitedA solid entry level 4x gameCONS:Generic 4x gameplayPretty limited tech treeNot enough ship and general customisationEvil human race is locked behind paywall? (I could be wrong)I’m giving it a positive review because it does exactly what it says on the tin. The tin is subjective though. It may be a tin of glorious Heinz baked beans ready to be lovingly poured over some toast. Or it’s a tin of all day breakfast that you scarf down after a drinking binge that should have stopped 4 days ago.Cheers! "

												A very welcome update on the original with a few elements missing.Colony LeadersAntarean InvasionsFleet/Ship Leaders Including the Legendary Admiral and his unique shipNo Antarean Defeat VictoryTrilarian race is goneGnolams are goneAntareans are a scrolling marque jokeGetting past that, it's amazing how much was done.  Gone are frieghter fleets, but replaced with a much more effective empire wide distribution network (researchable tech).  Pirates have a much more active role, and can be combated for population or cash rewards.  Ship combat and design is so much more stable and fun than the original 2D combat grid that would constantly lock up or crash even on it's release to GOG/Steam on machines that outclass the 2 decade old release. GNN is one of the best little highlights from the game, and it even has a ""no news"" filler update in the mix of events that the game can offer.  The tech tree allows for simplified choices, and the race customization is less confusing letting the player have access to the core of aliens races.  You have a great deal of variety in the standard races, and the new point mechanics makes even being a creative race challanging.  I'll definitely be getting the DLC to enjoy this to it's fullest.

												I have held off on doing a review of this title to see how it would evolve. As a long time fan of the original MOO 1&2 and, with sufficient community patches/modifications even MOO 3(to a point), I find that this latest installment of the ""franchise"" sits squarely as MOO 1.5.Overall colony management et al. is decent. Graphics are above average. Core races are present (though lacking relative to MOO 2 and MOO 3 in quantity and variation/backstory). Music and sound effects are typical of a strategy title. The UI is viable with most areas being reasonably intuitive for a 4x design.I find the lack of backstory to be a great detriment to this iteration of MOO. Other titles, even MOO 3, had a greater atmosphere in terms of racial distinctiveness--there was a feel of something more vs. a generic 4x that's founded on an excellent series.Though I have never been a hard set fan of leaders, certainly their absense from this product is clearly a detriment--as previous titles in the series and many modern competitors (Stellaris) have such implemented.Space battles are a very curious beast. They lack the hands on control and tactics of MOO 1 & 2, but are more fluid than the system utilised in MOO 3. The bias towards long ranged weaponry, ala MOO 3, remains and the lack of tight hands on tactical control (to the degree of MOO 2) has me often gearing fleets for autoresolution rather than for any sort of finesse (which makes me think of combat in Spaceward Ho!).Overall, however, development has continued. Additional content has been added and many bugs have been fixed. Though this title is far from complete/polished, continued improvements are clearly evident. This, with the nostalgia of the MOO universe/franchise, makes me optimistic as to the true ""end product"" that will be generated.I recommend this title to anyone who is a fan of the MOO franchise--there is enough here, and the promise of more, to afford fans of the MOO series and enjoyable experience. For others who are not veterans of the franchise I would advise waiting to see if the new DLC content is enough to flush out the core options to make this, functionally, more on par with Stellaris (which is curently a more complete 4x experience without MOO nostalgia).

												As a long-time fan of the Master of Orion series, I'll admit was I pretty hesitant about picking up this remake/reboot/whatever you want to call it. Some of the decisions made by the devs didn't sit well with me at all, but I finally decided to give the game a fair go.Before I start - I'm reviewing MOO + the Antares DLC, and I'm running the 5X mod. These both impact my overall impression of the game.I'm happy to say that my experiences with the game so far have been mostly positive. I loved the turn-based combat of the original MOO series, but I have to admit that running battles in real-time allows for a fairer outcome, rather than the ""wipe-the-opposite-fleet-off-the-map-before-they-get-a-chance-to-shoot"" scenarios I quite often had in MOO2, and was almost always able to take advantage of in the late-game.The overhaul of the espionage system with the DLC was a definite step in the right direction.This might not be the MOO that hard-core fans wanted, but this is definitely the most fun I've had in a space-based 4X game since the days of MOO2. There are aspects I'm not entirely fond of, such as star-lanes, the Antaran's obesession with me in every game, the mod menu working whenever it decides it wants to, and the fact that I have to make use of a mod to get a decent balanced game.There are bugs that crop up from time to time, and the game tends to slow down pretty drastically as you get closer to your turn-limit. I tend to let the AI take care of space battles because once there are enough ships on the screen managing all of them becomes a massive pain.If you had to ask me whether I would recommend the game - I would say yes. It's not everything I hoped for, but it ticks most of the right boxes for me, personally. There are still many areas in which the game can improve, and hopefully the devs will work on some of these.If reading this review still doesn't make you decide one way or another, I'd recommend waiting for the next sale, and grabbing it then.

Posted: September 14, 2016
												First off, I am ashamed to say I haven't played the original Master of Orion game (I sadly missed back in the day, and have had too much on my plate since to give it a play. I hope to rectify this problem soon). However, I have played Stellaris, the Galactic Civ games, Sins of a Solar Empire, Endless Space, and several similar games, so I feel comfortable talking about this genre.What I enjoy most about this game are the personalities of the alien races (I've played as humans and Balrathi and enjoyed both), the presentation (the space battles are exciting, the art is nice, and the music is really good). Even though I'm not planning to play through another match anytime soon, I did have enough fun learning the ropes to recommend it on that basis.There are, however, some negatives, especially for those familiar with the other games I mentioned. For instance, troops and ships do not gain experience or level up, nor are commanders or admirals that level up as in Heroes of M&M. True, you can upgrade ships as you learn new techs, but the lack of an experience mechanic meant that I never felt much emotion for the ships in my fleets. I have become used to being very protective of my military in other games (such as Civ) for this reason, and I missed the mechanic here.Secondly, I am concerned about the difficulty level. I played two ""huge"" maps on normal difficulty, and in both games, the pirates were so puny as to be a mere nuisance. Likewise, when I encountered the aliens, I was able to easily conquer them. I'd like to flatter myself by saying it's because I'm such a pro, but, alas, I know this isn't the case. I should've been defeated or at least seriously challenged until I had properly learned the game. To be able to win so easily was a downer for me (and, yes, I know there are higher difficulties, but to me ""normal"" should be a baseline, and I don't like the idea of handicapping myself to compensate for a poor AI). I was never able to use my ""Doom Star"" or death star ship, either--another minor gripe. By the time I was able to build this juggernaut, the game was over.Thirdly, the game feels underdeveloped in some key ways. This is most obvious during land invasions. I can excuse an indie dev for limiting such sequences to a static screen, but here it just feels cheap. If the game offered more compelling planet invasions (or at least a handful of nice cut scenes like the ones for the colony ship landings), I'd be more forgiving. But towards the end, I felt like I was just killing time until my troop ships finally arrived on the scene. Finally, I think there are just too many techs. The tech tree is extensive, but not nearly as finely honed as Civ. There was always something to look forward to that would make a difference in gameplay, but there were simply too many that just offered minor stat upgrades. I slowed down the learning pace in my settings just to keep from being distracted by them (as well as the GCN broadcasts). I would rather have a third fewer techs and have the remaining ones thus be more important and hard-earned.Overall, though, I enjoyed this game, but I must admit that I prefer some of the games I mentioned before. If you're bored with Civ, Gal Civ, dislike the ""sector"" mechanic in Stellaris, the real-time of Sins, etc., definitely consider this game. I can't speak to how well it captures the magic of the original Master of Orion, but I tend to doubt it since that game is widely regarded as a seminal game of the genre. In short, I don't regret my purchase, but I don't feel enough was done to really set this game apart and make it something truly special.			"

												I've been playing master of orion games since the original, and this game more than lives up to the name. My only suggestion to the game creators, please add a collector's edition upgrade option that doesn't force people to purchase the older games. I would love to unlock the extra race but I already own all the master of orion titles and it would be redundant for me to purchase them again. edit: I'd also like to add an observation I made about the A.I. that I think would improve the end game a bit. When I play the game I usually try to ally myself with another race, giving them colonies in my territory, unfortunatley the only way I can completley trust an ally not to stab me in the back is if they are incredibly weak, if they are close to my power level they will betray me when they have the chance, basically forcing me to kill every other race. Some minor A.I. tweaks to make allies more trust worthy would be nice, not everyone wants to win by just killing everyone.			"

												Thank you for a fine game.  I have tried to play at least six or seven space based games over the past 20 years.  I have been unable to play any of them successfully because I could not envision what was happening when I made a decision and thus was unable to evaluate my effectivness in play until some civilization that  I knew nothing or little about destroyed mine.  Your presentation of the balance between populaiton, science, and productionl, couppled with easy fleet upgrades  has made me a 100% fan of Master of Orion.  I haven't learned how to make war and win but I have already won by political victory and come close to winning an economic victory.  Now that I have accepted that I can't buy everything in the toy box and win I am improving rapidly.  Thank you again, James C. Reesman, g2sgt@att.net.			"

												I am a huge fan of the 4X genre. MoO2 is one of my favorite games of all time. MoO4 has done the series and the genre justice. If you liked MoO2, there is no reason you will not like this game. My only disappointments are the fact that the trillarians and elerians are not in the game, and that there are star lanes. However, the presence of star lanes is tolerable, and actually works quite well for the game the way it was designed. Without them, outposts and scanners would serve no purpose, so in that regard I think it was a resonable adjustment to give the game some distinction.Everything else is excellent. Diplomacy is good. Espionage is good (seriously, they did a great job with it, it is better than any other MoO game in terms of espionage). The combat is good. I, for one, enjoy real time combat over turn based. Turn based combat worked for MoO2 back in the day because of the power of computers. In this day and age, real time does better and offers more interactivity. Most of the core aspects of the game are still the same as MoO2 with only some minor adjustments, fresh technologies, and modernization. I love the technology tree, it has very sensible choices, and still retains the aspect of MoO2 where you had to make choices between technologies while bringing the technology tree of MoO2 more into the 21st century. All in all, it is worth your money. Support the developer, they did a good job. I paid for this to be a reboot of MoO2, and it is exactly that, with all the flavor you'd expect.Overall: 9/10Side Note: Add Trillarians and Elerians as DLC, and it would probably be worth a 10/10 for the effort of rebooting a legendary franchise and not making the reboot suck.

												As someone unfamiliar with the past of Masters of Orion and a newcomer to the series, I have to say that I've really enjoyed what I've played so far. It's basically Civilization in space, with very colorful and distinct races, exploration/combat/tech trees. The main distinction is the overlying goal to reach Orion, a legendary planet populated by an advanced race. Other goals for victory are the typical ones we're used to..Diplomacy/Combat/Economy.What struck me about the game is the amount of polish that went into it..I honestly had no idea Wargaming was developing this title and they've done a fantastic job fleshing out the world and giving distinct flavor to each race. Some are more keen to combat, others are more predisposed to economy, while a few are downright unpredictable and unstable.The art and animation is fantastic. They even went so far as to add fully fleshed out space battles you can manually control with cinematic angles (Although auto resolve will be the solution 95% of the time). The dialogue with the races is really cool, and having to keep in mind the nuances of each race versus the planets you colonize also gives the game depth I haven't encountered before.I've been having fun with it so far, but I do wish there was some campaign element. However, I've had a ton of fun creating my own narratives as my empires have prospered (And crumbled mostly) in this colorful scifi strategy title. Highly recommended.			"

(NOTE:) The team behind the game are still consistantly updating and making fixes after the realease.This game is like combining the space section of Spore with civ.Positives:The graphics are amazing. The designs of the worlds are beautiful and interesting.The characters are colorful and full of personality. (Amazing voice actors)Negatives:Still exhisting glitches.Auto-resolve isn't 100% accurate.Races can break character and randomly do something they wouldn't.			"

												I really loved playing Master of Orion 1 & 2 when I was younger, and this game is a good modern version of those. Yes, a lot of reviewers have complaints about it being too simple or the lack of tactical combat, but I wasn't bothered in the slightest. This feels closer to Civilization than other space 4x games, which is fine by me. If you want a space strategy game with tons of micromanagement, this isn't for you. But if you are ok with a streamlined experience, you'll enjoy this game.			"

												Have you ever wanted a Master Of Orion game that gave MOO2 the JJ Abrams treatment? Me either, but that's what Master Of Orion (4) is. It's got more than 2/3 of the features from MOO2, more than 2/3 of the playable races (by default), and over half the fun. It's the most logical reaction the developers could've had to the critical reception of the catastrophically boring, unpolished, yet innovative and deep MOO3.I often get the impression that the voice cast is so great (you'll recognize voices from Borderlands and Invader Zim, for example) because of the development team's apparent ""homage to MOO2"" approach to designing this game. And you could say the same thing about the graphics. The musical score is forgettable, but importantly, fits the tone of the game and isn't intrusive enough to become irritating when repeatedly played. There was clearly a lot of thought behind the animating of the various characters, for that matter. The lighting, as odd as it is for a turn-based strategy game to have noteworthy lighting, adds a charming tone to the visuals. It's the most grandiose and beautiful monument to MOO2 that's ever been constructred... which is of middling consolation for its fans.The gameplay, though, is functionally identical to Master Of Orion 2, other than the parts that were removed. Some of them are being added back into the game through patches. The tactical combat isn't as.... glaringly absent as before, due to a series of patches. The other races, evidently, are going to be added back into the game via DLC in 3-packs. No announcement (that I know of) has been made about the possible return of the Imsaes, Ithkul, or Evon to the game, or of any of the other races from previous MOOs. And the fun can be added back in through mods, to a surprising extent. There's a custom race option, but the balance is still botched (custom races are always objectively, statistically inferior to non-custom races, *which both sucks and blows at the same time), and hopefully will undergo yet another overhaul before a final version is settled on. And so far, we've got neither the delightful ground combat animations of MOO2 nor the delightful ground combat radio drama of MOO3.So do I recommend this game? Sorta. This is a textbook example of a review that would've benefitted from a ""sideways thumb"" option. If you've got a lot of disposable income and you're sitting on the fence about this purchase, I'd encourage you to give it a chance. It's by no means a bad game. It's average. It doesn't make me worry for the future of the series, nor is it entertaining enough to compete with MOO2 and Sins Of A Solar Empire for my attention. It's definitely possible for a game with so much post-launch work behind it to eventually become even better than MOO2, especially with mod support (which it has), but it's clearly not there yet. For now it's a shallow but reasonably well-crafted Master Of Orion sequel. Its foundations are sturdy, its facade pictureque, and its insides unfurnished and empty. Yeah... that'll do. You get the idea.*Edited for clarity			"

												Master of Orion was one of the first computer games I bought when I built my first DOS computer back in the middle 90's. I loved it. Master of Orion 2 was even better. MOO3? Well, if you can't say something nice...I've played a lot of 4X space games but few ever recaptured that magic of MOO I & II. Until this one. This new reboot of Master of Orion is not ""old wine in new bottles"". It's new life altogether. If you have ever played any of the old titles, particularly MOO2 you will be able to jump right into this. The learning curve is easy and the game is complex without being complicated. The interface is clean and easy to navigate and the cinematic space battles are a joy to both watch and play out. It is not perfect. It does not have the customizability of the Galactic Civ games I'm sorry to say and it would be nice to see new races and hull types added as future DLC. I'd certainly buy them. But like their predecessors this game does have heart and soul and that indefinable something that drives all 4X gamers to say ""just one more turn"". If you have never played a Master of Orion game this one is well worth your time. If you have then don't hesitate. All your old friends are here: the Darloks, Meklar, Klackons, Bulrathi, and all the others who kept you awake long into the night fifteen years ago. They are waiting to say ""hello"" once again!			"

												I'd call this a solid, space 4x. It does nothing really new - and nothing spectacular but most of the parts are well executed. If your expectations aren't too high then this is a game that can provide a satisfying amount of 4x gameplay. The unfortunate thing is I think this could have moved from a ""good"" game to a very good one if they had:- done something interesting with the battle system. The current implementation gives you so little control that I auto resolve almost every time. That is in sharp contrast to the very involvng battles of MOO2.- fleshed out the spy system. Right now dealing with spies is almost like busywork and could have offered so much more. Why not let spies level up - and make them more hard to recruit (it feels like spy spamming right now).Here's hoping the dev will improve these areas and others because it's a pretty good game to start that could be even better.

												I would recommend this game, particularly to 4X newbies who want to cut their teeth in the genre. The gameplay is accessible yet can be deep – has a low skill floor and high skill ceiling.It is highly polished graphically and in terms of sound assets (great voice acting talent bar none) and the fluff story of each race is lovingly re-created from MoO2 days of yore. The race customisation screen has most of the MoO2 staples like Creative, Lithovore etc. My only hesitation so far was in that the game still has a few bugs – I mean other than the Klackon - on my rig but the devs have been very keen to interact and help address any issues the community flagged to them. This gives me confidence in the long term prospects of the game. "

With the latest patch (v54.6) the developers have introduced some terrific elements from the venerable original and the highly acclaimed MOO2.  Chief among these are primitive civilizations and the colony and fleet leaders.  They continue to plug away at making it an enjoyable game for both first-timers and for those seeking a little stroll down memory lane.  This is sure to be a new ""classic"" in its own right.			"

												I am going to do something I do not normally do, I am going to review a game.  Though, in all honesty, this is more a review of the game company then of the game itself.  When I heard there was a new Master of Orion game coming, I was estatic.  I have many fond memories of all the MoO games, I enjoyed all of them, even 3......And here we were getting a new game!  Then I realized the way gaming companies are now a days, games get released halfway done, lazy programming and shoddy quality checking along with excellerated deadlines is the norm for most game developers today.  And I have always blamed the system more then the people in the system itself.  But enough of that BS.  The new Master of Orion game did something, and has continued to do something, that I have not seen in a development crew for a long time.  It impresses.  I love this game.  It's fun.  And that is why people buy games....To have fun.  But I have seen a commitment in the new MoO game that I dont think I've ever seen in a development company.  They keep working to make this game the best that it can be.  You may not agree with every choice made, but they have been willing to make it.  There have been a ton of games abandoned after being finished.  MoO is definently NOT one of those games.  And for that reason alone, I recommend buying this game.			"

												Before there was Galactic Civilizations, there was , for a great many of us, Masters of Orion. This was the trailblazing game for this type of strategy game for those of us who love them most.I, for one, am simply delighted to see it updated, yet kept more or less true to the the original.Is it the equivalent of Galactic CivilizationsII, or even 2 or 1? Of course not. Nor should we excpect it to be. No matter what is done to update it, if it is to remain true to the original, then it cannot be more than  it was at its core, without making it a whole new game.If you want to do that, then just look at the complete disaster that was Masters of Orion III, perhaps the most disastrous sequel to a game that was ever released!No, I say this is a delightful little trip down memory lane and totally enjoyable if you approach it as what it actually is....an updated version of the same game that it was, with better graphics, better voices more amusing scenes, etc. I love it!Once they get the rest of the bugs worked out (and you know they will), mods will make it have endless variations and I look  forward to the inevitable revival and endless websites to come!Now, SOMEBODY GET BUSY AND POST SOME CHEATS!!!!! please???

												I feel after a half dozen games that there are still problems that need ironing out. I love the game.. I have played every incarnation of MOO since it came out. I am not an expert but in the past have always played at the 'normal' difficulty or one harder and dont reasonably alright.In this incarnation, I have had difficulties and not sure why. The diplomacy is very one sided in my experience.  The AI always seems to want much more than they offer.. even the races like the Klackons and Silicoids that are supposed to be repulsive and suffer a minus to diplomatic negotiations. Which is hilarious if you think about it.. what makes a race repulsive to a galaxy of differing life forms?I don't care for the spy system.  It just doesn't feel right. Im constantly harrased by them shutting down research and production for 10 turns or poisoning my food. Having anti spies everwhere does not seem to help. I have not tried the Darloks yet so I have never gotten past gathering data with anyone; while they are constanlty crippling my planets.  Its just 'uninteresting' to me.The graphics are nice... not what I look for in a 4x game, but it really is *cool* to have large fleet battles having my destroyers taking out all the AI frigs whilst my cruisers hurl heavy missile fire on their capital ships.  The DOOM star is f-ing EPIC! Using Guardian weapons is great too. The 'State of the Galaxy' stuff was interesting the first couple of times.. kinda funny seeing the antics of that male? robot anchor.  But now I just skip it because I can see the info in the victory path screen.The differing ships for each race is nice. The Silicoid rock ships and the classic 50's UFO shapes of the Psilons...Tactical battles are fun. Don't ever let the computer figure it out for you. I am not sure what more I could want from the game... it isn't MOO2 but its nice. If they fix some of the imbalances, make the diplomac and espionage more engaging some how... I still highly recommend the game even with some of its, ummmm.. lets say small disappointments for any fans of 4x games.  For the publisher... Im sorry, but I won't be paying $20 just to get the Terrans. I already paid for Moo1, Moo2 and Moo3. So the 'collector package' is not an enticement.			"

												Tried the different maps and each one requires a slightly different play style or strategy.  Each race has slightly different bonus or ability but mostly all have same goal,  get planets, beat other races for most population.  More population means more money or research or ships or whatever you want to win. Realtime combat is fun and works, no bugs yet.  Only everyone has same options for tech and weapons.The differences being in whether you pick item a or item b after researching a box, but you can trade for the tech you don't choose with friendly ai.   AI does some wonky things but is mostly sound in their empire building.  The races who get fast growth are usually tougher to beat since they have larger fleets and mass quanity usually beats quality.Some things to make the game deeper imo ..............Resources ....  generic manufacturing resources can be broken down so that you can harvest said resources or not....i.e. wood, food,  metal, rare metal, energy, exotic space elements ect. instead of mine, big mine, bigger mine to build anything and everything.   Farms harvest food, so why not wood cutters, mines, manufactucting, and assembly plants ect. to deepen the building of fleets and weapons to keep it from being a game about quantity over quality. Human race survives better because of diplomacy and staying out of untimely wars.  Research, and stealth aren't nearly as competative to mass quanity right now. Research.....split up research tree's to keep it from being a 'research everything first' ftw.....Being really good with lasers and,  energy should be competative  to expert mass drivers and armour builders but researching both takes too much time.  Have a separate tree for racial only benefits and society perks.  Phylon gets their own science building techs, Humans get diplomacy techs, Bulrathing get terraforming techs, Crag get elemental harvesting techs, ect...Also, variety of planets would add to depth,  most any planet can be made into Gia .... 8-/			"

Many seem to forgett that this is more a MOO than an MOO 2 reboot and are upset becouse it doesnt have all the things moo2 had.Well they are right, on the other side it is adding new elements which i greatly enjoyed make it a great game on its own.To those comparing it with moo2 well you might consider playing moo2 ... moo2 was a reboot of the original moo and had many changes so please stop whining about changes ...

My only complaint I wish there was a better planet side  colony level picture with your building you built like waas in MOO2, more than that ugly globe with tiny building on it as now, that is my only complaint.

In Stellaris the same can be said , but for one difference. The Tech tree is random. Sins of a solar empire Technology Tree is race speicific which is way better then MOO and Stellaris. All 3 games are fun.If i wanna quick simple game - thats MOOIf i want a deep challenge - StellarisIf i want race specific tech game - Sins of a solar empireIf i had to pick one - it would be Sins of a solar EmpireWhy ? The race tech tree is different. If you think about it. No 2 races would have the SAME tech.Even in WW2 - the germans had the Tiger/panther tanks, Americans - Shermans the Russia  t-34s and IS tankssame can be said for Ships and Plane designs.  me 109, spitfires and Yaks and Zeros all were different designs with different weapons and structual designs.  Finally - babylon 5 was better was  because of race specific technology. everyone in Star Trek and Star wars had the same tech. Some races in bab5 had no gravity on their ships, some had shields others didn't. Some had Jump drives other needed to use jump gates.  Get all three games.			"

												I had a hard time deciding for or against recommending this gameIf you played the original Moo and Moo2 you may still enjoy this game for nostalgia  but don't compare them because this game doesn't improve on them in my opinion.  It seems like they pasted the MOO theme on Civ 5 which is another succesful game I enjoy so I cant blame them. I can't imagine paying full price for this game. There isn't enough in it so at this point you are just paying for the name. The game is in early access so there is a chance they will eventually add enough to Master of Orion to make it worth the name..  I hold high hopesSo yes I recommend buying this game, on the next sale, so they can have the $$ to finish building it into the great game the name demands.			"

												Fantastic evolution of the genre. I played the original 1996 release 'to death' when it came out and have recently put some hours into it again thanks to Steam. Although this version still has some game play issues to streamline, it feels that the devs are constantly tweaking the game and listening to the feedback from players. Sometimes it even makes for better gameplay when a bad 'tweak' upsets the game balance. I am not a huge fan of the current Antares ship numbers or powers, or the bug that scraps the gateways periodically, but I do have confidence it will be fixed as other problems were.			"

												Overall it's quite a bit like the old 90's version of MOO2 with a couple differences. Some people hate the pollution mechanic, it doesn't really bother me though. You can have a lot more leaders than you did in MOO2, which restricted you to four of each type. The game is just as addicting.The only real draw back, which doesn't really affect me, is the weak tutorial. I knew mostly how to play the game based on my prior experience in the series.I was cautious and I waited to purchase this while on sale, though I probably would have paid full price ($30 USD) with my current knowledge of the game.

												Well, what people say is true. The developers abandoned a relatively big name title that I think everyone was hoping would slowly be patched back to life. Maybe we can hope they're working on a DLC? I'd buy it, strategy games are still mostly niche so I'd rather support them and see if they can fix this game even if it costs more.Does the game stall for long times between turns? Yes. Are some parts completely broken? Eh, yeah kinda I suppose. Is the realtime combat part a piece of utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ YES YES YES IT'S LIKE SOMEONE'S FIRST GAME THEY EVER MADE. It's bizarre and jarring since the rest of the game is so polished visually, and then you have this early access looking thing for ship combat. You have to nurse it as if you're playing League of Legends, constantly clicking the mouse and repeating orders. It sucks because even though you can skip the realtime parts entirely, the automatic calculations aren't in your favor even when you should win a battle, so it's better to do it the realtime way.One of the complaints I hear the most that is more subtle, is that the game just isn't very strategic. Funny for a strategy game. Well, this is VERY TRUE. It's much more like an arcade game in a strategy game's clothes. The planning and thinking are as shallow as dish water, it's mostly just about gathering up the strength to throw all you can at the enemies, and with mind control letting you steal a planet instantly with one click, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monkey smoking a hookah could beat this game.BUT ... it's a pretty dang fun arcade game. The news broadcasts are funny, the lines the characters say are filled with cute geek references and stuff like that, and the visual polish feels like watching an animated movie at its best moments. I think the problem is that too many hardcore strategy fans bought this and thought it was bad, but it's more for someone who wants a relatively simple stress-relief game that they don't have to think too hard about when they're playing. It's cheetos, not filet mignon.So, uh... honestly, for that, I recommend it. It's great to blow off some steam and play something that has the dance moves of a more complicated game but goes easy on you even at the highest difficulty levels. Hah, I just realized something while writing this - you know what it's like? One of those clicker games, like Cookie Clicker and all of those! Just with a bit more structure. You click your way to victory meeting funny characters along the way. Is it worth $30? For the amazing animation quality and beautiful music I say yes, yes it actually is.Insanely high production values black-sheep game that everyone hated, would play it any time I need something simple and stupid. 10/10 for what it actually is (instead of what it was hyped to be, mostly by the fans). If you can stand the idea without getting angry that someone turned a venerable strategy franchise into a shiny glorified version of Galcon/Dyson/other casual smartphone-style games, yeah, you'll have a nice time.I truly believe the developers had a vision, but it wasn't one that most people wanted, and so people just labeled it bad because of that. But it's not that they made Master of Orion ""wrong"" to me, it's that they made their own game that does its own thing. Things get reinvented all the time, and I feel like maybe the developers felt there were enough dry and deep 4X games out there, and made a more lighthearted Cartoon Network style one on purpose. The performance issues on computers with slower CPUs probably didn't help either, but if you keep it down to 5 opponents or so and have a recent i7, it's fine. If it's okay for a chess simulator to take a while to decide on a move, it ought to be okay here too.			"

												This game is not Master of Orion.Yes, I am one of those who played the original games years ago.Ok, so it is not Master of Orion, but it is a good 4X space strategy.This game feels more like a combination of Endless Space and Galactic Civilizations, with a very dull real-time combat where you cannot change the outcome much. Doesn't matter if you just watch the battle or command the ships yourself. Now, the real-time combat can be done right. For example StarDrive 2 has significantly better real-time combat where you can actually change the tide of battle by moving the ships smart. Even Endless Spaces' autocombat system feels better than this.So yes, this is the biggest problem for me with the game. It lacks the turn-based combat that made the original two Master of Orions so great, and it does the real-time combat all wrong. I can handle the changes in the travel system (star lanes like Endless Space) or the (way too) slow game pace, and the tedious espionage system. But the combat system is just.. meh.However, I do like the game. The poor combat system does not kill ALL the fun for me. I enjoy the colonizing & research phase of the game.If you like Endless Space, then you should get this game on sale. I do not think this game is worth its full price, but on sale? Definately.If I had to give a rating, I'd say 7/10.It's pretty good, but it's not great. And it's definately not Master of Orion.They had the budget to hire well known voice actors; why didn't they hire Steve Barcia and Ken Burd to oversee the project? Maybe next time.			"

Early Access Review
								It is no MOO2 like Master of Orion. This is more like MOO3.Only the colony screen is like the old one. The fights are realtime, which makes the ship design and tactical combat kind of useless.the starlane system would be okay, if noone would be able to fly through the whole galaxy from the beginning. (Fuel systematics missing)This game is cool! But is more like a better Moo3 not a real remake. And Moo3 was not a real Master of Orion anymore. I also liked it but in a total other way.The Diplomacy is more like civilization tradeing.. so at least the nice diplomacy system from moo3 could have stayed or?I cannot give a like for this as a oldscool Master of Orion Fan I really miss the Turn Based tactical Combats.I will still play this as a new Master of Orion 3, but it cannot replace Moo2 for me,.Conclusion:They tried but failed, hopefulley they will at least change how the combat works, then i might change my review.greetz			"

												this is an improvement over moo3, but is nothing compared to moo2.1] get rid of the space lanes from moo32] to much colony micro management3] its a turn base game and needs turn base battle [what happened to assult shuttles]4] not all ship improvements need a refit [ dautless is auto, not a mod to refit]5] need a bring back a telepathic race/option [hate wasting time on troop ships]6] why nerf the star base's? an outpost is tougher to destroy. they are good for command points only!7] the map looks really nice and is as annoying as all the other new games that think graphics make the game more playable. i don't need to ""zoom in"" to the colony to make changes. in/out and jumping from colony to colony is to much. please give me the option to turn off the pretty graphics and switch to a flat map like moo2.i could go on, but the point is: this is a good start for new players, but i would be happier with an expansion pack for moo2. moo2 may not be pretty, but after 20 yrs, its still a better game!the best part of this game for me: moo2 came with it and its on steam. i no longer have to deal with dos box to play moo2. steam has done the work for me!

												I've been a fan of the MOO series since it came out.  Certainly not a ""die hard"" fan, but I played all the games, and would rank them in my top 5 strategy games of all time.I was hesitant to purchase this game based on many reviews, but I do really enjoy it.  I do believe it's shelf life is relatively short unless they bring out some major updates or expansions soon.  Some of the positives that I really enjoy about this game is that games go rather quickly.  I enjoy the level of management meaning.  I don't enjoy games that bog me down in the details of every thing.  Ship design is done well to keep it easy, but there are enough choices that need to be made to make it interesting.  The game is beautiful, and the voice acting is pretty good.My primary negative is that the races don't feel all that different.  I also think that custom races start with too few points.  I think if they gave custom races 2 more points it would retain balance, and make the game more fun by being able to design your own take on the races.I can see myself putting another 10-30 hours into this game, and then revisiting from time to time because of how easy it is to pick up and play.

The game has a hard time processing large battles, antarian attacks/buildup, between turns and makes it so I can't run anything else on my PC. This game is a big memory hog but if you have the gear then it should be less worse. I'm really enjoying the multiplayer feature on this game lately. Updates have addressed most issues.

												Definitely a great throwback with some creative new ways to win. I do think that placing the game in the fastest mode should provide a more accelerated play mode for those that don't have a week at a time to play one game, but to each their own. The race cinematic are entertaining and so are the colonizing cut scenes, but they tend to get old after a couple games. Micromanagement of the battles can be quite challenging, but can also be simulated for quick and conservative game play. Still haven't ventured into a multi-player game, but I will soon!			"

												I love this game. Coming to the space 4x genre as an avid Civilization player I found a lot of the games to be dry and unintuitive. Masters of Orion though, is intuitive and genuinley exciting as well as having depth and intersting choices. I'm still getting my head around the combat. Here are some features I absolutley love:A terrifying alien race that raids the lead player periodically as a balencing mechanic.An interesting balencing act between production and pollution so your capital isn't able to pump out everything in the game in one turn come late game.The ability to build Death star equivalent mega weapons and decimate all who oppose you. I'm not a veteran Masters of Orion player and I'm told this game doesn't bring a lot new to the genre, but everything it does bring is laid out in an intuative and visually stunning way. So if you are new to space 4x or simply want to enjoy an epic space opera than I cannot recomend this game highly enough.			"

												A simplified remake of MoO2 - some reductions in complexity have been sacrificed for a more streamlined and ""ergonomic"" product. Most of the hate here is because fans were hoping for MoO2 with a new paint job, but (like XCOM before it) the developers believed that something more streamlined would be better received. (Of course, there is considerable hate here about mod support or lack thereof, but that's a community I will not comment on as I am not part of it) I think their gamble paid off, and the game is solid and fun. If you're not a militant purist, or you're a newcomer, I heartily recommend the game as a fun and addictive experience.(Edit for typographical errors)			"

												Where to begin on this one? I picked it up the day it was released, liked it okay, but was slightly let down as an old time fan of the original series. Then Stellaris happened and I forgot all about this game. Which turned out to work in favor of this reboot for me. Master of Orion operates in a different space than Stellaris for many reasons. Presentation is top notch, and I often find myself lost in the environment. While the game is much more simple than others in the genre, it still presents quite a challenge. Some reviews mention the game crashing at ~500 turns, but i've never experienced anything more than a couple of extra seconds. I enjoy the pace, espeically if you decide to crank up the game speed. All in all i would give it an 8/10. If you enjoy 4x space games, and want something new, I would recommend.

												I am not sure why so many people have disliked this game. I love it. I also am a good mix of heavy gamer in some respects, but also I am a casual gamer in other respects. In regards to Orion here I am the latter. This is an easy game to play with amusing voice acting, and simple gameplay. Mods are also fun to play around with. This game can satisfy my need for sci-fi elements without creating a lot of stress to do so. I like that you can make it a short game, or a long one, depending on how you set the game up. Each race is amusing, I prefer the Psilon people, as they are more peaceful and discovery oriented. It's paced well, and if it's not fast enough for you the settings will help that. Beautiful graphics. It makes me feel like a god manipulating the fate of a universe. I can spend 7 hours, or 7 minutes and still get the same satisfaction consistently. Bottom line is it's easy to catch on with, play, and balance your time. If you like sci-fi, I'd highly recommend this game to anyone.			"

												I spent a LOT of time playing MOO2, and think it's one of the best PC games ever made.  I also consider MOO3 to be one of the worst PC games ever made.  That said, I find this newest iteration to be a good, but not great game.  I bought it on sale for $14.99 and am quite happy with my purchase.The Good:The graphics, soundtrack, and general atmosphere of the game are great.  The dev spent alot of money on the voiceover work and it shows.  The game is quite pretty, and really has a lot of polish.  The game mechanics are solid and fun, and the UI is very functional without getting in the way.  Combat can be underwhelming, but unlike alot of RTS space combat, ship design actually matters quite a bit - which was one of my favorite parts of the previous games, designing ships.  The tech tree is well thought out, and the way the Creative/Uncreative racial trait works is fun and IMHO, better than MOO2.The Bad:I had to restart several times in the beginning to get to know what I was doing.  There is a tutorial, but it locked up on me the first time I tried it, and I prefer jumping in with both feet anyway.  There are nagging little bugs also, the UI does funny things sometimes, and late-game the time between turns can get a little long.  Combat is pretty, but the camera needs a couple more modes and some tweaks.  The ""tactical"" side of the tactical combat is a bit weak.  My favorite race, the Elerians were, locked behind DLC which I bought on sale, but those 3 races should have been in the base game  Also a race (the Terrans) and a couple of features are DLC-locked for the collectors edition only - which I didn't buy because I already owned MOO1-3.  Other:Be sure to download the manual for the game, I didn't realize it was an option at first and was annoyed at the lack of in-game help.  The game also seems to have a little more of a MOO3 influence than I'd like - starlanes are back, and the Antaran victory condition has a MOO3 feel to it.  However, the classic races are back, including the Mrrshan, and the MOO3-specific races are gone (thank goodness).  Verdict:All told, I'm pretty happy with this game.  It's fun, it's pretty, and it's MOO.  There are things that could be better, sure, but it's fairly solid in its own right.  At 14.99 I feel like I got a pretty good deal, and even at full price I think I'd still be happy with it (except the DLC - $5 was ok, but $10 is too much imo).  I'd give the game a 7/10 overall. "

												This is a good game.  Fairly polished and well-rounded.  A lot to enjoy.  However, it pales in comparison to Stellaris.  I kept going back and forth in comparing the two.  More often than not, MOO came up short.  That being said, I enjoyed the game and I have started  a second greater campaign to play more.IMO, it is a good buy and game for fans of space-strategy games.  IT is NOT a must play though.V/R,RPC			"

												I've played ALL the MOO games since they came out.  I think by FAR this one is the best yet.  The first one was revolutionary, and the second was even better.  Only MOO 3 ended up being a disappointment, but this one fixed everything that was wrong with that and made it shine.  The only thing I have a problem with is trying to control combat on my own is difficult, but there's a full and semi-auto modes, so it works great.  Love it, two thumbs up.			"

												A refreshing remake of one of the best games i have ever played.If you like 4x games, this is one of the best.+Great graphics and sound+Ultra Smooth gameplay+Great tutorial makes it easy to learn, but still with good depth+Mods option is nice+Single player experience is superb, one of those games where its always ""Please! just another turn!""-I still prefer the layout of master of orion (the original game) where you can manage planets from the right side of your main screen-No turn based fighting like the old game, you can watch the fights and maybe try and think ur helping your fleet win, but you are not as in control as the old game-Hard to find a multiplayer game, wish more people knew about this and played it			"

												The game feels very basic at first. The Dev's def played it safe on this one. But after completing my first game, I must say, it isnt too bad. Especially if you get it on sale. If you are looking for a good 4X game to play. This is the best one I've found in a while. Probably since Sins of a Solar Empire. My favorite thing is how thoroughly diverse the tech tree is. You get option after option in it, I imagine you'll never play a game the same way with the same tech tree decisions... There were doezens of options. Almost every single tech tree upgrade had a decision on what to choose. I'd certainly recommend this game, especially with friends.			"

												There are many 4X strategy games out there, but what any new player must realize is, Master of Orion is the father of all modern 4X space games. Since the first game, followed by the huge success of MOO2 (Master of Orion 2) and the mess the 3rd game was, this new one, is a modern copy of MOO2. Is that bad? Not really. While all the core concepts that made MOO2 the best 4X space game, Master of Orion is a gem. I played the old games to exaustion and do not let the low hours of play I have here on Steam foul you. I know this game very well. Pros: - A totally redesign of the old concept that works with new graphics and improved gameplay and new concepts that work.- Total freedom of customization. You can setup your game in difficulty and the galaxy at your own taste. - Many different types of victories - Great implementation of Steam workshop and multiplayer. - Great graphics effects and colors make the galaxy feel alive.- Relaxing gameplay- Real time battles, control your ships, give orders and let the AI take over but always ready for you to take control- It's Master of Orion!Cons:- Game still needs some tweaking, since in late turns it takes some time to end a turn even on high end systems.- DLC with extra 3 races that always were present in the franchise.- Can be a bit repetitive in easy levels of difficulty.About the DLC's I cannot recommend buying this game with all DLC's for full price. In particular the one that adds the extra 3 races since they were always present in the franchise.If you really want to buy it now, go without the dlc's or wait for a sale and buy it all.It is a great game with many different types of gameplay, the same tactics might not always work. If you already know the franchise and still wondering if this is worthy, It is! imaging MOO2 with today technology.If you never played the franchise and know some titles like galactic civilizations or Stellaris or even Sins of Solar Empire, then you really must have this game.In other words, It is the epic Civilization in space!

Early Access Review
								This game is unworthy of Master of Orion name, and, frankly, is unsalvageable. 1) Combat is real-time only, with unwieldy camera and no preset tactics. You can't even designate primary target to be fired upon while your ships are executing your maneuvering commands. 2) Ship constuctor has arbitrary limits on the amount of special system and weapon types you can install.3) For some reason, systems are divided into separate planets and warppoints, and it takes a whole turn to travel from one point to another within a solar system. Not only does that considerably slow down travel, but it also leads to annoying games of whack-a-mole when enemy ships spread out and jump between them.There are also numerous ""minor"" problems like: no espionage system, no custom races, terrible tooltips that don't show difference in damage between basic beam weapons and ""heavy mount"" ones (if there is any ATM), etc. But there's no point in fixing them until main issues are adressed.

								I've requested a refund after a little over five hours of play. I've seen enough.Yes, I know it's early access. Yes, I know that not everything is implemented, but I've seen enough of the bones to know that this isn't the MOO2 of my youth, polished by two decades worth of technology advances. This is just another croak in the long death rattle of PC gaming as we knew it.After about my third hour of play I became conscious of the hard truth that I simply wasn't doing much playing. Technology advancement, auto-upgrade all ships with a single click, keep building those Civilization V-style upgrades on your planets. Click next, next, next, next, next, next. It all feels hauntingly similar to the dead, passengery feel of MOO3, complete with ""star lanes"" and a general lack of any ability to micromanage.Perhaps, at this stage of my life, I'm going to have to begin to accept that game developers just aren't pitching their product at me anymore.Of course, this generation of ""professional reviewers"" will love it.

												We old 4x players can't help always comparing new 4x games to Master of Orion II which is pretty much still probably _the_ defining title in the genre. I pretty much dodged this title completely in it's early access state, finally got it and can't say I'm displeased at all.First of all, majority of the thumbs down seem to be exactly about this not being MoO II. I'd recommend disregarding most of that ""feedback"".It's gorgeous, has fantastic voice acting, it plays simple but solid, and - ironically - it's probably closer to original MoO II than any other title ever. As it should be.It isn't a hardcore space strategy game such as Paradox's titles, but more relaxed, straightforward older light strategy game. You can still get your virtual butt kicked though if you're being silly. And talking of Paradox, MoO has ok music but Andreas Waldeloft (composer of Europe Universalis and Stellaris soundtracks) takes a longer straw by clear mile. But for most people that's probably not relevant :-)			"

								In its current alpha state it has the price tag of a fully developed game and what you will get is far from that. You will get about 5 hours of entertaining game play learning all the mechanics before the pretty asthetics and sound effects get old and you realize this game provides zero challenge due to the AI being passive and utterly incompetent. You would be wise to stay far away until it is vastly improved unless you are confident in the developlers and want to support the game.			"

I can't remember much else.I think this reboot is good - not perfect but good. Its got some bugs but so do all new games.Pros: The multiplayer is stable, the interface slick and half the fun is learning - okay,  there might be a manual now. Its quite playable though.Cons: Feels like a work in progress - an allied team doesn't seem to yield a victory at the end for instance.A fun game.			"

												I did love MoO2 and I really do love this game.The races are well drafted. THe cinematics are lovely and the options and strategies are vast.I hear a lot about the game beeing to linear, but I can't say that I agree.Playing in different settings and the like can give the game a lot of twists. Different playstyles are rewarded in their own way.I like the polished style and the interface. Everything seems well thought through. Lot of love for the details.Great, Thx!LINUX:I do play it on linux (Mint 18) and there are a few glitches with the Cinammon Display Manager crashing. But that happens a lot lately and I assume it might be the fault of the Display Manager. Most graphics gliches can be solved by going into Options -> Restore Default Settings.Thanks for the game guys. Thanks for the effort to bring it to Linux!			"

												I was a huge fan of the original Master Of Orion and MOO 2, and for many years I have been hoping for a decent reboot (MOO 3 was terrible). I'm very happy to be able to say I've found it. I was wary of this one due to the number of poor reviews. Thankfully, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I feel that the negative reviews are mostly in relation to early issues which have since been patched out. Some seem to have expected something this reboot never promised to be.  If you enjoyed the original version of MOO 1 and 2, then you will find this to be fairly true to source with some nicely updated graphics. However, be aware that the genre has evolved somewhat since the originals. Newer releases such as Stellaris include a fair amount of complexity and variation, whereas this retains the majority of the original gameplay. In comparison, MOO seems streamlined and simplified in comparison, although from me this isn't a complaint. I began playing with high expectations and was not disappointed. The layout is at once polished yet familiar, with all of the character and style of the original. The diplomacy plays out as well as I remembered, with some nice voice acting and animations to really give each race their own personality. The combat has made the switch to real time with pause, and varying levels of control depending on your preference. I have thoroughly enjoyed  my first 12 hours or so returning to the MOO galaxy, and I expect there will be many more to come.			"

												I have had a nightmare in regards to this game. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE. STAY AWAY FROM THIS AWFUL TRAVESTY OF A GAME. IT DOES NOT WORK WHEN INSTALLEDI downloaded the game due to the half off Steam Sale. I finished the download, clicked ""play"" and instant crash to desktop. Frustrating, but not the end of the world. I used my Google Fu to find out possible fixes and it said to try verifying the game cache. Ok, not a bit deal. Did that and tried to play it again. I clicked ""play"" again and it crashed again. I decided that maybe I got a borked install and that it did not work. So I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game. Annoying as hell, but I did it anyway. After the reinstall, I went to click Play and guess what? IT CRASHED AGAIN.After some more investigation and a tip from someone who had the same issue, I updated my graphics drivers. They weren't all that old, but apparently it wants the newest drivers. So I did that, restarted my machine and got ready to conquer the galaxy. I clicked ""Play"" yet again and YET ANOTHER CRASH ON LAUNCH.At this point I am furious. I will never buy another Wargaming product ever again, and my World of Warships account will never recieve another subscription for Premium nor will I ever get any more doubloons for Free XP conversions. I shouldn't have to troubleshoot my machine just to try to fix their failure of a game. If the game cannot start on luanch TEN MONTHS after it's release, then you are absolutely hopeless. I have never had a game do this, and every other game in my library works perfectly fine.DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL. STAY AWAY FROM THIS TERRIBLE, BUGGY PROGRAM.			"

												Review disclaimer : I've never played the first three games, so this game is my first experience of the series (although i have just recently added MoO1 and 2 in my steam libraray) so my review is coming from a neutral position, with no positive or negative pre-conceptions if i was a long term fan and/or hater of the series.Review disclaimer 2 : Have only played the Humans, Psilons, Alkari and Darloks so far.Pros :Interesting races with different characteristics making them feel unqiue and different to the other races.Clean and crisp graphicsWarp Lanes (some people might have this in a 'Con' colume) - can be strategically and tactically used in various ways, especially used in conjuction with warp gateways (tech you can research)Ability to design and custom fit your layouts / blueprints for your ships - always fun doing this :)Civilisation type feel to the game with multiple ways to win, with the game being turned based generally (excluding rts combat).GNN can be funny at times (some ppls might find them annoying - but thankfully there's a option to turn off GNN) and provides some niffy updates / random eventsAbility to customise games, with different galaxy sizes, galaxy age, galaxy types, number of AI / human opponents, change game speeds and difficulty levels.Cons :Tutorial is not fleshed out enough and doesnt do enough to explain all the key concepts needed to play the game succesfullyAt the time of writing this review, the rts combat is simple and lacking a bit of depth. Currently i dont believe its available for MP (simulation only) though this could change or be patched in.Pirates were under used. No diplomatic, mercenary or bounty hunting options with them. Pirates dont really level / tech up to much as far as im aware so far (though i haven't played the harder difficulty levels so i could be wrong!)Occasional bugs / glitches with AI for some races and they might act ""OOC"" in their dealings with the player(s).Lack of a proper story / campaign mode.Overall i've enjoyed this game so far, and hope to play the other races soon to find out how they play / what they are capable of. Some of the races that i've played are fun to play, but honestly i belive they might need some tweaking in terms of balancing. The Psilons are probably just a bit o.p. when it comes to technology, where as the Darloks are weak in comparison and their spying (while strong) isn't that strong to make up the difference. Haven't played the rest of the other races yet so please bear that in mind. Very little ground combat, all of it being simulated so if you're looking for a game where you can fight space and ground battles (ala Star Wars : Empire At War / Forces of Corruption) you will be disappointed.Not too bad a game and has the potential to be great, but definately will need some work in terms of balancing and content patched in, alongside a full tutorial to help us MoO newbies learn the game better. At the risk of annoying long term fans of the series, i currently rate this game :6.8 / 10Above Average, with alot of potential :) UPDATE : Have played the Mrrshan Pride. This race seems best geared for an early conquest victory, with the race starting with destroyers and better marines. They do have an advanage in terms of other races accepting deals, though this is useful later in game, not at the start.Their tech seems inefficient however, so if a game drags on, then the Mrrshan Pride could find themselves at a serious disadvantage tech wise, especially if they're up against the Psilons. Theres very little ground combat so far in game, so the""advantage"" of better marines isnt that useful. Best bet is to build an early fleet and ""Zerg Rush"" opponents before they can build / tech up to much.UPDATE 2 : Have now played a little bit of the Klackon hive. This race seems to be the Zerg / Tyranids of this game (whatever your preference is lol). They are an insect race, controlled by a hive mind, led by a queen (sounding familar yet? ROFL).They have an insane production rate for ships and buildings, and grow and insane amount of food, which in turn increases their numbers to acheive higher production values. If their tech and research wasn't so poor / slow i would say they're o.p but i'm assuming this is the game's natural balance to their overall high production / population advantages. Note : they also have a beginning disadvantage diplomatically as well, but no where near as pronounced as the tech disadvantage.UPDATE 3 : Have played the Sakkara race. This race is kind of a reptilian / dinosaur race and has been in previous versions of MoO (not that i have played them!). They are an aggressive and highly reproductive race (holy hell does this race have a big advantage over others in terms of population growth rate!).Because of their high reproductive rate, this race is an expansionist race, especially since they get the biology tech straight off the bat! They do suffer a disadvantage in terms of diplomacy, and their technology/research is uncreative, which might hurt their cause late game. A race it seems best suited to be aggressive early before the other races can catch up in numbers or tech.			"

												I honestly was not expecting a great deal from this game, but in retrospect I think I gave the game too little credit on my first glance. This is actually a rather plesant slimed down Turn-Based Strat game, so for those who want a Sci-Fi version of Tottal War, but with a more basic aproach then this is an ideal game for you. If you want something intensely complicated and in-depth then this is a game to make a pass on and take a look at Stelaris instead.I found myself drawn into the more minor characteristics of the game rather than the main mechanics. For one, I have to say the character visualizations in diplomacy is extremely well done, and the All-Star voice acting cast is much more of a draw for me than I anticipted. Combined, this made the diplomacy/narritive more engaging than typical games. With that said, this is the RARE strategy game that has a half-decent diplomacy system! Negociations are in general what one can expect, but I wish they would use my captured spies as bargining chips rather than just kill them. On that note, the spycraft for the game is somewhat basic, but still functional enough to make it a valid component of the game, but spycraft is a hard fit for this genra to balance out appropriately.The combat system is one of the best parts of the game I find. I love the aspect that you can have a hybrid system where the AI takes over the multitasking functions while you can focus on a single task (or stack tasks via pause function). The combat visualizations are somewhat generic, but the gameplay itself is very solid. I find myself confident in my ability to command, but there is always still that edge of if I developed my fleet for the right task (where as some games its so imbalanced you can spam 1-2 units and call it a day).Lastly, for those who are running a less than top-teir computers, this game is more lightweight (at least from my perspective) than other high-CPU demanding games.All in all, this is a very good buy for the sci-fi gamer or the TBS type gamer. A must have for those who love both.			"

The one thing that bugs me the most is that it is unstable as hell! it wasn't during early access! HOW IN GODS NAME did you manage to ♥♥♥♥ this up? As for the rest: shallow combat, shallow expanision, shallow building. This game sucks at everything a 4x is supposed to be! The worst part: Nothing has changed during early access! with of course the exception of the new races, which were probably already finished anyway... GOOOD GOD I HATE YOU FOR THIS STINKING PEACE OF♥♥♥♥♥♥GAME! There are way better alternatives out there: stellaris and endless space 2 for example... and whatever anyone else says. the graphics suck! you know what is even worse? The game is virtually the same as endless space 1 .... and if i am not mistaken it is at least 10 years old! This is the last! GOD! DAMNED! TIME! I AM BUYING EARLY ACCESS! ((ps i would like my money back!) you have done♥♥♥♥♥♥when it comes to listening what people posted on your forums! )			"

												Played a game for a weekend, finished one run on medium diffuculty (it was way to easy by the way) in 350 turns - one big AI player left by that time and some small scattered bases of smaller ones, I was controlling the most part of the universe and was going to capture Orion, but won through UN voting, deleted it not to be distracted from other stuff, it's a time black hole. I was a big fan of original series. So this one really reminds me the old good MoO, except now it's more casual. Graphics are nice, not so agressive after CPU power, runs smooth on my macbook pro retina 15 on max settings. I wish the music wasn't cheesy epic orchestral with slight electronic touch, but something more space-orientated, like Jean Michelle-Jarre. Yet the game is kind lacking something, universe and AI are lifless a bit, maybe there should more life and details in the game, on the other hand, I had really nice two days playing the campaign, but I wouldn't play it again. Let's say it's my tribute to the series and my teenage days. If you'r looking for a big universe strategy with really flexible diplomatics, resources and military system, look somewhere else. If you'r after casual simplified ""civilization in open space"" - give it a try. Hey, you get original series as well, pay your tribute to the game history at least.

												The game is still in development although it is no more an Early Access. It has a lot of bugs, and more content is coming via paid DLCs.Having said this, I have to say it is one of the best 4x I have tried, and AI works fine, not like Civilization's.UI is fast but not efficient at all, and it is possible that sometimes you find yourself repeating the same mechanics because colony helpers do not help much.I still recommend this game because I'm sure that developers are going to fix most of these issues.

												I thought I would try to counterbalance alle the ""It's not MoO2!"" rant reviews: I played Master of Orion 2 myself, and loved it to bits. However, that does not keep me from enjoying this for what it is, which is a damn good space 4x game in the same spirit. It is a lot of fun to play, and comfortably gets a niche between illustrous competitors like Endless Space or Galactic Civilizations. It is definitely not just a pretty UI, and a great addition to your library if you like 4X and space.			"

												Very polished. Art is impressive, music's good, voice acting is good. It feels and plays like a MoO game, except updated to modern levels. Incredibly, I havn't hit any bugs yet. I can't remember the last time I picked up a 4X and had it just work as intended. And it's only $30. I have no reservations about recommending this game; the developers did impressive work.			"

												New Review - 'Revenge of Antares' edition===============================Master of Orion benefits from good game setup options, a clean, useable interface, automation options to reduce micromanagement, and a turn-by-turn notification system that helps in keeping track of colony development. The new 'Timeline' system enables you to review your progress and reload previous turns to change strategy and rectify missteps. For the most part, the interface on every menu screen is sharp, clean, and efficient, giving you all the info you need with no clutter. Diplomacy is clear and intuitive, providing clear, real-time feedback on how each response affects your relationships. The designs for each race have been updated perfectly, while mirroring the original Master of Orion aesthetics, and each has a distinct and engaging personality, enhanced by top-notch voice acting. Espionage mirrors the classic Master of Orion setup, giving you complete control over how to use your agents. Revenge of Antares switches agent recruitment from auto to manual, adding hiring and maintenance costs for each spy. The expansion adds the three races added in Master of Orion II - Elerians, Trilarians, and Gnolams, all of which have been well-updated to match the quality of the rest of the species in the game. Ship design and real-time combat work well, though there are still only a few options for modifying your ships' appearance. The game still suffers from the same clunky economic model, expensive short-term trade treaties, impossibly expensive research treaties, lack of freighters, and high facility maintenance costs. Random events are more often annoying than helpful, and the game's exploration still suffers from lack of range limitations and sparseness of anomalies. Pollution can no longer be removed manually, instead decreasing gradually over time based on each planet's threshold, which can be raised by building pollution control facilities. Leaders have made a return appearance, though they're generated in specific quanities according to each race present in the game. Gone are the colorful characters of MOO2, instead replaced by a fixed roster of generic, fairly forgettable race-specific commanders and administrators. Most are often lacking more than a single ability, giving them less bang for the BC despite their fairly low hiring cost. This is the one addition where the interface is not quite up to par, as the system seems tacked-on and clunky compared to the rest of the game's menus. Still, having them is a bonus, though it could stand some improvement. The inclusion of the Antarans is the most significant change to the game. Their periodic appearances are much less randomized than they were in Master of Orion II; they seem to fixate on the same handful of systems, refusing to attack alternate planets until the first target is obliterated. Their fleet strength seems to skyrocket on a very steep curve as well, making it nearly impossible to fight them off ship to ship, even in the late game. Overall it feels like their mechanics could use some fine-tuning.Master of Orion, with or without the Revenge of Antares expansion, is a very well-designed, well-balanced, challenging strategy game; though not without its flaws, I don't feel that any of them are so glaring as to affect the overall quality of the experience. The changes made by the expansion are all welcome additions, albeit imperfectly-implemented ones. The game is still being updated according to player feedback, and thanks to the community, there are a variety of mods available to fine-tune things.			"

												Overall, the new Master of Orion is a fun strategy game.  It's a little part familiar with a few small adjustments that are overall neutral to the original experience.  For those who have played the originals, I will share some feature comparisons for you to help decide if you will enjoy this addition:Things that were removed:-Antaran attacks against the top player (I really miss this)-Branchless research trees-Distance restrictions on space travel (and fuel research in general)-Turn based combat-Unique characters to manage colonies or ships-Racial government traitsThings that were added:-Warp gates (all travel between systems must go through a warp gate)-Command points that limit the fleet sizes (no more bloat warfare in space)-Economic Victory Condition (in addition to the research, military, and council win conditions)-Factory ships that build system upgrades (such as star fortresses, artificial planets, etc)-Snazzy graphicsSome things are still present that probably shouldn't be, such as space monsters, the obnoxious robot news broadcasts, and the espionage system.  All of these things are even more time consuming and pointless than their previous incarnations.  Fleets can't skip systems with space monsters anymore to reach distant planets because of the warp gate restrictions.  The news broadcasts are rarely interesting or relevant, but still play at regular intervals if only to force a quick comparison between empires (which is viewable at any time from the menu).  The espionage system is MUCH worse, spies are trained automatically, but must be moved manually, and have to complete several tiers of spy activity before important tasks like stealing research are possible.The one feature about research I appreciate most is the research choices.  In classic MoO, each tier of research had several choices and you could only select one.  In the remake, you get most of the research each time you make a discovery, but there will usually be two or three extras you must choose between.  Creative is still a good boost, but not nearly to the degree it once was.  Being uncreative is a race trait that is actually quite playable.In closing, I would like to share that the real-time combat system a LOT of fun.  The pace of combat is very good, ships move at a respectable pace that caiters to strategic thinking.  It is not at all a click-fest, weapon systems fire automatically and there is little need to micromanage.  The scale of ships is better as well, titan sized ships truly dwarf everything else in the area.  Large fleet battles in MoO and MoO2 are unbearable ordeals and very one-sided in the favor of the player who had the first turn.  This real-time version is much more fair to both sides and actually very entertaining just to watch.			"

												This game, like the others before it can offer many hours of fun game play. I think it is one of the best strategy series I have known. The AI gets rather predictable quickly so you do find your self playing the very hard to impossible levels pretty soon. All in all a great strategy game.Two issues. Why are all the windows incomplete with info that you need? If you are going to choose a planet for a leader, then why can't you see the planet names in the window????  Many windows in the game show only part of the info that you need to make decisions based on the missing info. Just doesnt make sense.Now the biggy. Terrible planning or forsight makes for triple or more the clicking that you need to use if it was actually thought out.I would like to point out, however that this is very typical of most software I have used in the 23 years that I have been gaming. Namely the inter face is woefully bad. I find it amazing that you have to constantly click from one side of the screen to the other, back and forth back and forth.Why can't developers see that if you right click a menu and make choices it is soooo much easier than clicking the upper left, then the next window the lower right and so on and so on through out the entire interface. You wind up opening 3 or 4 windows to do a simple task and all of them require clicking some where else on the screen one time. Very poor planning and probably all in the name of making it colorful and bright. I just don't know why it would be that way.Also down to the level of deleting saved games for a half hour, clicking on the one save you are allowed to erase at a time, and then to the other side and,.............. well you get it. Never heard of shift buttons? The game is very fun to play. The interface is incredibly bad. See Carpal tunnel. You will be older one day.			"

												I did not play a lot yet, however, I liked every one of the few hours I played. I still play MOO2 from the GOG install and was looking forward to this new MOO. Now I play as a Meklar custom build (creative) in the largest galaxy with 3 other races. I think the new MOO is very nice, because:- GUI is very beautiful, modern and gives the important info in a clear wayd,- All (at least so far as I have seen) the known technologies are back (Megafluxers, Neutronium Armor, ...) and new ones... Most of the technologies work a little bit differently and, in my opinion, it's for the better... the devs surely have invested some brainpower into designing the technology progress.- A much better and much more realistic diplomatic exchange systemand, lets not forget:- the two very nice gnn bots... :-)I have so far not encountered one serious bug and everything should work as expected. Master of Orion, as AlphaCentauri and Homeworld, is an incredible legacy... you have to have courage to try to recreate it or reference to these legendary games (I am looking at you, Civ:BeyondEarth and Remastered Homeworld, and I am very disappointed). While there are differences between the old and the new MOO, many of them are for the better in this modern game. If you liked MOO and MOO2, you will surely like this as well.I am very thankful for MOO, I hope for more (e.g a modern MOO2 with the Antarans and also the Elerians, Gnolans and Trilarians). You'll enjoy this as well. Others seem to be punished by nasty bugs, if so, as we waited long years to have a modern MOO recreation, just go and grab another game for the next 1-3 months and come back, the nasty bugs are surely worked out by then. I am glad I bought the game. "

												I've never played a 4X game before, I was always put off by the amount of features one must manage to be able to play.This game instead splits the features into different parts that may or may not be used to play the game. For each feature there is a kind of ""Autoplay"" that allows you to ignore it and concentrate on other things.Take for instance Blueprints: If you want you can design your own ships from scratch, but if you don't you can simply ignore that and the ships will be designed for you. I found that wonderful, it allowed me to learn how to play the game part by part.Instead of ""Ugh, so much to learn"" this game turns it into: ""Wow! I can also do that!?""Everytime I finish a game I just want to play another one using that new feature I discovered.Given that I've never played 4X games before I can simply say: If you're new to 4X, this is a great game to start with!Cheers to the development team! Great work!			"

												I'm giving the game a positive review, though it doesn't mean it's perfect.  I'll get straight to the point via bullet-points.  Review is based on Dec 1, 2016 patch with latest DLC pack installed. + Oozes charisma and charm.  Some of the best voice work for aliens ever done for a game.+ Animation and graphics for the aliens is superb.+ Good tutorial to get you started (a bit too basic though).+ Great game for new players to cut their teeth on a 4x game.+ Interface for managing your empire is great.+ Warp gates and choke points are a fun secondary 4x gameplay option that gives 4x space games some variety.  I'm glad we have this method for MOO, yet traditional hexes in Gal Civ 3.  Makes each game feel special.+ Game plays quick.  + I think I'm going to like the real-time combat aspect but I need to spend more time in it to formulate a better opinion.+ Easy to manage your colonies.+ Love GNN News!  I'd even pay DLC prices to have more GNN events added.  Same goes for more voice overs for more diplomatic options.-  Music for some parts of the game are annoying.  The research screen in particular makes you want to gouge your ears out. It's disruptive and and loops too quickly.  Likewise in main game, the basic music that loops majes a huge mistake you should never put in a game.  It uses a *ding* that closely resembles one used for messaging in Apple devices and error messages in Windows.  It is distracting and annoying.  Rest of music feels uninspired.-  Graphics for planets and stars on the main screen are bland and too small.   Can't zoom in much.  This make it hard to ""immerse"" yourself in the galaxy as you feel a bit distant from it all.  Galactic Civilizations 3 does this better.- Ship Combat - I'm just not getting it yet.  I think it's because camera control and the options in the combat zone are not good yet.  Maybe I need to look at how some other people manage combat.-------------Overall a fantastic game.			"

												As a big fan of this series it's no surprise that I would endorse. This game is more in the spirit of MOO 2 which was most fun of the first three (my opinion). I feel that this game is even more fun. There are two areas of gameplay that stand out to me as fundamentaly different than MOO 2: Spying and Movement.Spying in MOO 2 was very simple. Produce spies in the building que then send your spies in the diplomacy screen to steal tech or destroy infrastructure. In this game however your spies are not made through production, they are rather trained (once unlocked) giving you one at a time. There are more specific options on how you wish to afflict your opponent, such as causing a food shortage leaving your potental conquest more fruitful than simply destroying random buildings.Movement in MOO2 was simply distance limit from your closest colony or outpost. In this game the junction points that connect the systems offer you a more ""front line"" way of thinking than constantly worrying that your oppenent is going Ender's Game on you by sending his ships directly toward your home planet. That strategic reality is not nessesarily better, just different.			"

												I am enjoying the game as a whole and it does have that one more go feature common in the better games of this 4x genre. I would say it is not better than Civ IV or Civ V but it has similar mechanics. I do prefer it to stellaris and GalCiv3 although GalCiv3 is a little more complex and deeper but I dislike the mechanic of having to continually settle planets just to keep up while Stellaris is an unfinished game and quite boring to play. In MOO you can sit back a little more and enjoy the experience without the feeling that you are getting behind because you haven't settled twenty planets before turn 100.PositivesIt is well polished with voice acting, cut scenes and pleasant to the eyeComplex enough that you just can't steamroll the Ai Custom races and twelve built in racesMacro and micro tweaking as you progressLots of tweaks in setting up a gameCONSVoices can be ittitating after awhile but can be turned offSome features still need to be implementd and added eg mp tactical combatNo experience for ships and no heros or governorsNot a wide variety of extra resources which can add depth to a playthrough "

												It is more or less a precise copy of the old MOO games, including the technology trees and races. But unfortunately it is worse in several important aspects.For example, the interface keeps harassing the player with unnecessary warning dialogues (e.g. when upgrading ships) that cannot be deactivated.I have played two games and it always happens that the trade treaties become so expensive that no race can afford them any more. What is the sense of organizing trade like this? It is also annoying that the treaties do not auto-renew. Research treaties are almost never affordable.The worst is, however, the tactical maps for fighting: it looks 3D, but it is essentially a 2D plane. However, the round-based fights of the original games was much better and in particular arranged much clearer. The real-time implementation in this new game is chaotic.The game has many nice details, like the avatars of the advisors. But hearing the very same statements over and over again becomes boring or even annoying, too.			"

												I about wet myself with glee when I heard they were doing this. I downloaded immediately and initially wasn't too displeased to find out that they'd essentially taken the last game and revamped it, kind of like XCom. But, unlike XCOM we slid backwards. Messing with the formula, best way to lose your fan base. The original battles in MOO had 100% control. It was tedious with large fleets, which is why they had the auto battle which flew by and you could interrupt it and go ""wait... why would anyone do that?"" I liked having the ability to use my special abilities that I spent all those research points researching and all those industrial points putting into my ships. Instead, it's real time, difficult to move around the map, no fine control over vessels firing, your ships will fire off their point defense at other vessels leaving you defenseless against missiles, you have to toggle on auto use to use more than one power, even then it doesn't always work. I liked it when it was more of a chess game and felt less like I'm coaching pee wee football. ""No, LEFT! Your OTHER left! No tackle the guy with the ball! WITH THE BALL!"" I'd buy a MOO2 if they promised to fix that nonsene, but likely... not going to happen.			"

												How odd.  I was going to give this game a luke-warm thumbs up but it turns out that it is really pretty good.   This is one of those rare games that gets better as the game progresses.  It was almost near the end of the tech tree where my last game errupted into a crazy all out war.   It is odd that the game play gets better the longer you play.			"

												This is a 4x for people who have never played a 4x before. It's a great introduction to the genre, with a clear, easy-to-understand interface and simplistic structure. Once you've played this game, you're ready to move on to things such as Distant Worlds Universe.			"

												I have followed this franchise from day one. Like many others my favorite is moO 2. I have struggled with my emotions about this game. It is not what I expected, I will admit to being some what dissapointed. I think there is to much that has been removed, and some game machanics are seriously flaud.Pros:Graphics are very good UI is well doneTech tree is acceptablesounds from past games are still present reminding you of the games linneage.Cons:Diplomacy is very weak, Allies are aloud to spy and sabatage on each other.Spy machanic is terrible, Planetary security level seems to have little effectWhat happened to the Hero characters you could hire from moO2?Pirates are little more than a nuisance, they need to be more of a threatyou can only create a few ship designsCustom race attributes points are too restrictiveWhere are the Antarans, this a huge oversight.I like the starlane concept, it is similar to Ascendancy (yes I am old lol) Some don't like this machanic, I like they included a stargate tech to skip long starlane travels. In MoO2 there was a way to send a colony ship to a planet while you were in the view planets menu. That has been removed and it should be returned to the game.In closing, if your a fan of the franchise you might be dissapointed. But if your playing this game for the first time, without past MoO titles as an infuence, Majority of people will like it. So based on that point of view, I will recommend this game.			"

												I've played through one campaign of MOO, and I've very much enjoyed my time with it. This remake does play it safe and doesn't introduce much new to the 4X formula, but on the other hand sometimes it's better to not try and fix something that isn't broken.I'd recommend getting this on sale, because as much as I've enjoyed it I probably won't play it again for a few months. That said even a small galaxy campaign is at least over 10 hours play time, probably much more if you take your time.You really don't need the DLC, so don't bother buying this if you haven't played the base game. There are plenty of races in the standard game, and enough depth to keep you occupied. If you've played through 2 or 3 campaigns you might consider getting it, but at that point you would have more than gotten you're money's worth out of the standard game.			"

												This reminds me a lot of the good old Imperium Galactica, which was one of my big favorites.You will research ship types and modules, and put together your own ship blueprints from these modules. This gives a lot of fun experimenting with different fighting styles.Espionage is also very much like in Imperium Galactica, where you hire spies, train them in various missions, and they can get caught, killed, etc.The tech tree is much like Civilization, it almost feels like some alternative version of Civilization. Same goes for diplomacy, where you have the well known table for exchanging maps, currencies, technologies, etc.The exploration is more like Civ. There are barbarians attacking, independent planets to trade with, and some areas require you to research certain technologies first (almost like boats for the sea).The game mostly feels polished, I've only met 1 bug so far - which I fixed by saving and reloading the game.I also appreciate the possibility to make/apply mods to the game.

												This game was pretty disappointing, there was no reason after the first play through to run through it again, but I did anyway to see what would happen.And what happened? Stupid update after update. I don't see why it was necessary to change the tech tree so that certain discoveries force you to choose between technologies. I still invest the same number of research points, but get less for my efforts. After the latest update, pollution and gravity mechanics were changed. Neither of these updates enhance game play, they only make it worse and in favour of one particular race and probably everyone will play as sillicoid becuase I think it is really the new game mechanics just irritate you and distract you from game play. Why dont the developers focus on the replayability issue rather than completly overhauling game mechanics -  which were fine to begin with. The AI is stupid and stubborn - it never wants to give up anything, even when I bombing the crap out of their planets. It will happily pick a fight with me, even though I am a tougher opponent, it will never pick a fight with a weaker AI. This game is worse than endless space. It is pretty much a copy, just worse. Just the endless space AI is stupider.			"

												I've been playing MOO games since the original and was stoked when I saw a new version available.  I have tried many of the newer 4X clones, and while they are enjoyable, none were as much fun as MOO2.  So far, I have enjoyed this new iteration of the game, though not quite as much as I hoped.  I would recomend this game to anyone who enjoys 4X games.  I know it's caught a lot of flak from some users (some of it deserved), it's still worth the money.  I like the new movement system even though many people seem to dislike it.  The graphics are very nice, the tech tree dynamics work OK, but it often doesn't seem to affect the game that much in regards to the order you research items.  Diplomacy seems to work well and the AI seems to act in its own best interest most of the time.  I have not experienced any of the bugs other players seem to have experienced, so maybe that would have changed my opinion.  The other thing I really enjoy is the fact that it supports mods through the Workshop.  Those community designed changes really help with certain aspects of the stock gameplay.A couple of things I wish they had changed are the combat system and races.  Commanding the RTS combat system seems to make no difference in the outcome of the battles and is just boring.  I enjoyed the older turn based system where specialized ships really made a difference.  Now there is very little advantage in using anything but the stock designs.  Also, making the complete roster of races (including the Antarens) part of a paid DLC seems like a cheap decision.  They really should have been included in the original package to flesh out the game, not charged for to keep people playing.Still, even with the negatives, it is a fun game and worth the money if you enjoy this type of game.**edited for spelling**			"

I admittedly have little time in this new version of the game, but everything I've played so far feels like MOO and let's me know I can come back for more.I found that other games over complicate things and become tedious.  This game seems simple enough with enough new mechanics to really give a fresh take on MOO.I have a very good impression so far and wonder why all the hate.  I feel that MOO2 has been elevated to such high standards that short of an HD remake exactly like that game would satisfy the critics.  The price on this is perfect right now.  I recommend it.			"

I did play the original MOOs, loved 1 & 2, and was a bit let down by 3. This game is all of the best parts of all 3 put together. I'm over the moon for it and the improved graphics, combat, and diplomatic systems. The one thing I find lacking is the ground combat, but hopefully a future update will make it more detailed. Having it be something like the space combat, with tactical options, would be awesome.Don't let that stop you, though. Overall, this game is fantastic and a great reboot to the series.			"

												Honestly, this feels a lot like the older Master of Orion games to me...and I'm fine with that!I've found it pretty fun. A little bit of the standard 4x 'clickclickclick' problem when starting up, but, well, when you only have nuclear drives, that's a pretty standard problem for any MoO game. xDIt's pretty. I like the individualized advisors for each faction.I'm fairly happy with the auto-ship designer. I mean, you could probably make Super Awesome Custom Ships and stomp everyone, but the general ones seem to work alright.Controlled combat is a little confusing for me. I honestly just tend to use auto-calculate or let the AI handle the fleet, and things seem to go alright. It's very odds based, depending on ship strength and the like, but other than some space monsters (which are nasty usually), I haven't had any 'oh, I have overwhelming odds of victory!' 'Oh, I see, I just lost 90 percen tof my fleet. Awesome.'all-in-all, I'm pretty happy with this, and looking forwards to the Battle for Antares DLC. Because, well......I miss telepathic cheese. xD(Oh, and Humans are Jerks. Which is kinda hilarious, considering they're also supposed to be diplomatic)			"

												As a standalone 4X-scifi game, MoO is quite pleasing. It's not unique or special, but it's generally a decent game that handles and looks good. Turns go by smoothly, the AI is mostly acceptable, and the patches has adressed a lot of the concerns from the negative reviews. Overall, I like the game.The obvious comparison is to Master of Orion 2. And now I start to wonder WTF happened. Few of the gameplay elements feel like they are better or more polished than MoO2. Has nothing happened in 20 years of game development? Graphics and sound are definitely better, but you get the same buildings and races, a worse tech tree (copied from Civ?), duller exploration and it just feels like there's been no real improvements to the gameplay. The UI is a step back from the ease of MoO2, and ship designs have become static - instead of the total freedom from MoO2, you have a fixed amount of blueprints to alter, and all your ships are locked to that blueprint and it's upgrades.So while I do recommend the game, I still rank MoO2 as a better game. And it was released in 1996.			"

												Master of Orion is a reboot of the serie that pretty much definied space 4x games with Master of Orion 2. Which ultimately is both a strength and a weakness for this title.  In essence this is a steamlined freshed up version of the legendary Master of Orion 2, it has superb production value, and what it does, it does extremly well making it a genuinely fun game. And that is preciesly sort of the main problem of this title: yes it does everything beautifully, but it doesn't do that much as it's missing some key features the previous title had such as:- Lack of heroes- Lack of an end game attack on Antares - Missing races which in turns offers less race customisations- Lack of Goverrnments- The battles are in real time, which for me is totally fine, bur can be seen as a negative for some peopleThis all contributes to the feeling that this master of orion is a good, fun game, hence the positive recomandation *especially at such a low price point*, but is just not as deep or as engaging as the 20 years old MoO 2. That being said, one good expansion and a couple of patches could do wonders to this already engaging game.			"

												Solid game.If you played Civilisation V for example you will recognize some mechanics and stuff they used as well. But thats not necesasarily bad. You don't always have to reinvent a whole genre. Sometimes taking good things from other games can upgrade your own. That's what MoO did pretty well. Allthough it is diffrent from the original games from like 15 years ago it plays pretty good. Several things are still the same which makes it a bit nostalgic, but a lot has obviously changed - for the better imo.In the game itself the start always seems a bit slow. You basicly just fly around discovering the galaxy, but as round-based games usually progress at that rate roundtimes will begin to slow down. You need to manage a lot of things. Not caring for your planets for a few rounds can leave your planet enviromentally heavily damaged. Reversing that usually takes a bit longer than damaging it. That's just one of the basic mechanics the game brings.The fighting system between battleships sometimes seems a bit clunky. Even with potentially favorable outcome you sometimes just flatout loose the fight. Maybe this part still needs some love / updates, but I'm positive that this will change in the near future.Still have to test multi player yet as of now I have only played against several AIs			"

However, it is worth noting that games like Endless Space are nearly identicle save for a few details. I would like to see Master of Orion do something extra to stand out from the crowd. It is, however, worth buying in my opinion. Like most 4x games you explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate. If you like Civilization, Stellaris, Endless space, and other similar games, you will get a similar experience playing Master of Orion.			"

I love this game and I think it is seriously underrated + it runs flawlessly at 4K on my GTX 1060 at 60 fps so it just makes it even better.

												One word: EPIC!!! :DI've been a long time fans of the Master of Orion series. Imagine my excitement when I read about a remake (reboot ?) of the first game of the series.After playing the game for a while, here are some things I like or dislike about this game (at least so far):Likes:- MUCH better graphics than the original game. :D - Still have the same feelings of the original game's game play, despite some bugs and improvements.- Mods! Updates! DLCs! Oh my.. (Etherians and/or Harvesters, anyone?)- Have I mentioned better graphics?Dislikes:- Terran Khanates must be bought as a DLC, if you want to play them.. :( Then again, they're just a variant of the human race anyway, so for me it's a minor inconvenience than a major setback.- Bugs? Nothing major that I have encountered so far though.. can't say the same about others though..- No tactical ship battles like in the original game.. :( oh well.. I suppose I can live with it..- Can't think of anything else at the mo.. hopefully nothing more will come up.. :/Recommendations:HIGHLY recommended, especially to old veterans of the series. Bear in mind, though, that this game is NOT just a remake of the original MoO.. It has the potential to be more, and beyond.. Give it a try.. You won't be disappointed..			"

												Master of Orion it is!I'm not really a Review person, yet when I saw a remake of this fantastic gem made in the 90s, I thought I simply had to try my hand at writing a review. Not to mention that -honestly- I don't know why there are so many unfavourable reviews that I just have to write this one.So is the modern version of Master of Orion any good and worth a try? In my opinion it is. It's a good game. It's a great game! It's Master of Orion at its best, so what else do you people want? :)The new game has got the same planets colonization system as the original game from the 90s, the same good folks like Darlocks, Mrrshan, Sakkra, Alkari etc. (folks that we all love so much!), the same galaxies to conquer, the same GNN robot (well with a female-robot colleague this time) and so on. All of the good elements of MoO plus the amazing graphics, animations, music and visuals a modern game must have.The major comment I hear is that the modern gaming can offer much more than just a neat-looking clone of an old game. I haven't really played the other space civ games these days, games like Stellaris, so I can't compare to them. Yet the concept of the old MoO is an immortal one and a well thought-out one. So why complicate it, add to it or change it?The new game resembles the old Master of Orion quite colsely in my opinion. Game mechanics are similar. Just the graphics are of high quality.Throughout several matches which I played, it became obvious that there were some minor bugs here and there, but nothing too serious. Nothing that would spoil a good match. Although I agree, the devs should take some time to fine-tune the game.I found the difficulty levels to be a bit out-of-balance, something that was very well established in the DOS game. I started off with a ""very easy"" difficulty level and that occured to be quite difficult actually. The major problem was the 'upkeep' costs, which really made it impossible for one race to speed up the growth. That is because if you buy too many assets, you will run into a deficit and that's not good (your money supply will run out and then the game will auto-sell your goodies). As I watched the charts, my race grew in line with the others over time and only in the mid or even late game I was finally able to get a better hand.The voiced-over advisor is really annoying and does not suit there at all. They should have provided a ""fire the advisor"" button. :)I imagine that any new player will find the game confusing at first. Someone who doesn't know the old Master of Orion or doesn't know the civ games. The learning curve is rather steep and the game is not intuitive at all at the beginning. You need to delve into it and be patient, learn and you will get a hang of it after a while.I found the music to be great as well as the graphics. The themes are exactly the same as in the DOS game, but of course improved in qulity. The sound when you have a new discovery, for instance, is just fantastic.Population grows slowly and it takes a lot of time to fully populate a planet, but that was exactly like this in the old game as well.The interface is made in such a way that you need to patiently move all of the single units and click on every single planet to adjust production. Sure, there are shortcuts and improvements, but it still takes time and it's a tedious routine. However in my opinion, that's what it is, it defines Master of Orion really. If moving patiently every single unit is not ""your cup of tea"" than don't bother.Also what I really liked in the new game is the emphasise on the races. They are unique and presented in a great way. Let's say, when you first meet Sakkra, they are big, monstrous creatures and that is impressive. Darlocks are mysterious, dark and malicious. Every race is very well presented and introduced. That was also a big thing regarding the old game.I hear that people complain that the battles are real-time rather than turn-based. I didn't find that to be a big problem, although yes... it's different compared to the old game.Regarding Diplomacy I found out that in the new game, the races seem to be less sensitive to the changes, which is good. It was always too unpredictible in the DOS game.Overall, I was plesently surprised to find out that Master of Orion got its 2016 remake. I was more surprised to find out that the remake is good actually. If you're a fan of Master of Orion, you will enjoy the matches with the good-old enemies, which the new remake offers.			"

												Delightful fun in a surprisingly serious environment. That is due in fact to the incredible star studded voice acting! The colorful UI and ease of management are big wins. Diplomacy is well done but sometimes I wish there was a bit more dialog. When its this good you can't help but want more. Space combat can be a lot of fun as well, but once you learn to equip your ships well the AI has a bit of a challenge keeping up and builds lots of smaller ships. If you are expecting a classic 4x experience you won't be disappointed. But if you want something very involved you may want to play Stellaris. Personally I prefer Master of Orion because you can get your strategy fix in 8 hours or less and space combat is more hands on with races that have lots of personality.I'd absolutely get it again.Pros -Great UISuper Voice Acting (ie. Michael Dorn)GraphicsImmersive UniverseSoundtrack Great Developer (They actually listened to us Beta Testers to improve gameplay)New Victory Conditions (ie. Economic Victory)Cons -Sometimes repetitiveMany soundtracks composed in the special edition are not in the gameTurn base may seem antiquated to some more accustomed to Real Time(but not me!)			"

												Nice slick upgrade to MooII. Does what it says on the tin. My play experience has been solid with no issues since the full release. Would like to see it move forward now with 'New' Colony and fleet leaders. Would also like a bit 'more' Than the original game. New races, new tech trees, maybe a new race with a specific tech tree of its own. Would also like the planet explore to be a bit more of a 4X experience more encounters and random events to find actually on the planets rather than just simple sensor blips for money, ships or tech. Lets see the new imagination unleashed now they have rebuilt the past.			"

												Master of Orion 4 is a big step-up from the previous game. Master of Orion 1 and 2, especially 2, were amazing. They were what got me into strategy games. Unfortunately the series lost that with Master of Orion 3. Everyone gave up on the series. Wargaming.Net took a risky task and did it. They brought back what made MOO so great with Master of Orion 4 and it is even better than before. I highly suggest this game to everyone, especially strategy games fans.			"

												Master of Orion is a title that still gives me nostalgic shivers when I boot up one of the three previous editions (which I still do every year, even trying to get the original MoO to work on my Android tablet with some success). This reboot did so before I even had a copy however, happening when an old friend sent me an article about it before release.MoO - the little acronym belies the epic galactic spanning game within, a game I spent many, many hours engrossed in as a young gamerling. And then came MoO2, and I was able to expand to conquering my friends - which brought many laughs and also a few almost Risk level arguments (and subsequent self imposed 'Geneva Conventions' on our sessions). MoO3 was a bit of a let down for most (and I can see why, it was by far the weakest of the three (now four)...however, I did see what they were trying to do and I did (unlike anyone I know) finish the game. I have conquered and colonized Orion in each and every title (doing so for this one just last night).The new game draws on the strengths of each previous title, absorbing and melding each into a game that feels like the first one in flavour (especially with the races currently available, though the brand new Terran Khanate faction included as DLC hints at the possible inclusion of missing races from MoO2 and MoO3 - bring back my psychic Elerian babes! EDIT - Coming soon it seems!). However much of the colony mechanics, a good portion of the UI and the accessibility of the second is core to the gameplay. A few pieces of the UI - such as the galactic map, including the starlanes idea - and a much improved version of the combat style of the third have come along for the ride too...all in all, a solid choice on most aspects, and the game feels complete at launch unlike many other 'smaller' titles.There are a few things that I would say warrant another go at (such as a better 'Empire Management' screen) and a few tweaks to the UI in places (moving multiple population from one job to another on the Colony/Planet Screen) but these aren't core gameplay issues, and could probably be fixed easily enough with a mod-patch ala 'SkyUI' for Skyrim, though hopefully the developer will follow them up in time. This would add another 0.5 to my score below.8.5/10 - a strong game, lots of fun and great for the nostalgia reserves while still being something new. I am looking forward to some multiplayer with friends soon!			"

They have nerfed some of the items for playability, and the critters are much tougher.My only (real) gripes are ship building takes forever in real time (I have yet to build a titan) and spying seems kindof useless.

												This is actually pretty good game, if it was better, it would be Master of Orion 2 with new graphics.Still, better than Stellaris. (I made a mistake and got that at release, had to play it over 80 hours to figure out it's crap. Technically and gameplaywise.)Pros: -Turn based main game.-Can micromanage almost everything (except the battles).-Original Master of Orion 1 races.-Many remixes of Master of Orion 1 soundtrack.-Ok voice acting.cons:-Not a turn based battle system. Can't play ""chess"" with spaceships. Can't really use any strategy in battles at all. -The voice acting especially in psilon reserch screen gets on my nerves.-Why those ""space lanes""?-Ship blueprints. No reason to edit them, they automatically are as good as possibleSome minor annoyances could be fixed just by taking example from Master of Orion 2... Like, when you go to assign a new project after a previous one finished, it would be great if you could see which project just finished.. on that screen where you choose the next one.			"

												It's no Stellaris when it comes to complexity, but the last time MoO tried to be complex, it ended up killing itself and the genre for the better part of a decade.It's no Homeworld when it comes to tactical real-time combat, but at least they tried instead of shoving in autoresolve and calling it a day.It's no MoO 2 when it comes to be the untarnished, shining image of literal perfection that will absolutely never be surpassed, but not being perfect doesn't equal being a bad game.It has a certain charm of its own, the late game tedium is kept to a minimum and, somewhat unusually for a Wargaming title, there seems to have been some actual, rational thought put into the UI this time around.Most importantly, its developers care. Patches are rolled out at regular intervals and include new content in addition to bug fixes. Community feedback is considered and acted upon - many of the early grievances, such as spies, pollution and leaders were corrected. The DLC, while priced perhaps a little too steeply, does not contain anything essential to enjoying the core gameplay to its fullest extent.It could still use some polish. Tactical combat needs to be introduced into MP first and heavily rebalanced second, as the current go-to strategy is ""MIRV missiles, loads of 'em"". Racial traits could use some work. The manual needs to be updated to account for new mechanics. A little more variety in anomalies and random events wouldn't hurt.Still, as of now, MoO 2k16 is a perfectly adequate, enjoyable and accessible game well worth its price.Oh and there's stuff voiced by celebrities. This is supposed to be a selling point, but I'm rather confused as to how the voice of Col. Blair Luke Skywalker makes for a better gameplay experience.			"

												In a lot of ways, this game is just like MOO2 - especially after some of the updates that added things like Leaders and the Antaran attacks.I've also never noticed any of the multiplayer problems I've seen in this genre from Civilization, Endless Space and others. Things like going out of sync, player disconnects, and system freezing in large maps don't seem to be present in MOO (although I frequently experience these issues in many other 4X games).After playing the old MOO2 for many of my teen years, I'd have to say this game stands up to the original and stands alone as a classic on its own.

												Essentially a remaster of Master of Orion 2, this new game delivers the sequel we all wanted. Master of Orion is the turn based strategy game that has you up light murmuring, ""just one more turn."" The interface is simple and most commands are intuitive, making it easy to govern your space faring civiliation. Where graphics is the most obvious improvement over the originals, the primary innovation rests in three areas: research, espionage, and combat. Research is simple and not nearly as punishing as in the past. In former games, you would research only a single tech from a category and then move on (unless you had the creative trait). Now you ae only occasionally faced with that choice (thus curbing creative). Instead you are choosing research based both on what it gives you now, but also what it may unlock in the branching and twining tech tree.Espionage now feels like its own minigame, where spies gain experience and go on specific missions to help you achieve your goals, rather than just charging into the enemy state and flipping desks for enemy research or propaganda. It at least feels like a vital part of the game now instead of something bolted on.Combat is not as user friendly as the game's namesake. It is closer to MOO3 with a three dimensional map that has shipps rushing towards each other in defiance of logic and tactics. It sure looks pretty though.			"

												I recomend the game as it is a good remake - and follows a simple formula: Keep it simple and fun. You can somewhat dwell into micro management or you can leave it to the AI to handle. Other than that - you DO end up as a passenger a lot of this game. Even on a hefty gaming rig it will bog down atrocioulsy in the later stages of game and you sit and wait.. and wait.. and wait. You can try to command the combats which initially sounds like a lot of fun, but rather is also just about watching what happens as - pretty much - if you touch anything you will make ships do silly things that looses you combat (you can say where to go. but you cant say how to get there etc). Pros: - Good remake- Fun simple ecconomy/production/food model. Easy to get into and feeling you ""master it""Cons:- Bogs down- Has a number of bugs which will make you SCREAM at the computer. Example: Late stage games suddenly you will become a passenger to the turns automatically going forward and you try to stop it to take control again. No such luck. I had an enemy fly in and bomb my main planet and fly out again - 7 turns before something happened in a colony that needed my attention. That kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥game-testing ruined it for me and I am basically scrapping the game. Because after investing hours of playtime only to see that Sh33t happen - uh no thanks!			"

												In my humble opinion at least, Master of Orion: Conquer the Stars is an excellent 4X style space strategy game, and is my game of preference over the more critically acclaimed games of the genre such as Galactic Civilizations III and Stellaris. I feel as from both an objectively critical standpoint and from my personal regard of the franchise that the latest master of orion game outdoes more advanced games of the genre not because it creates new inventions and innovations within the context of gameplay, but because it holds true to the gameplay principles that made master of orion the gold standard from which all other space strategy games use in the foundational principles of their gameplay. Master of Orion: Conquer the Stars makes it possible for both veterans of the franchise and newcomers to enjoy the gameplay that made master of orion such a critically acclaimed computer game franchise as well as indulge in the advancements made in computer graphics and character/ship design. the virtue of this game is in both its ability to uphold the fundamental principles of 4X space based strategy while improving upon the aesthetic qualities and design that allow such a game to remain competitive in the market. another stantpoint I will take in regards to my criticism of the game, albiet a subjective one, would be in my personal regard to the aethetic design and computer graphics that went into the production of this game. I take great satisfaction in the sense of personality and character that went into designing the various alien civilizations and their respective fleets. the human republic is inherently the game's version of the united federation of planets, with bonuses in diplmacy, trade, and governement as well as ship design reminiscent of starfleet ships from star trek mixed in with the imperial star destroyers of star wars. the psilons are inherently a tribute to the most classic aliens in science fiction, more commonly known as the greys or the bug eyed monsters, this also holds true in their ships designs, which are simple, yet elegant in their traditional flying saucer shape. another curiosity that i regard with utmost delight would be the simultaneous existence of two human empires, the noble and humanitarian human republic based on earth, and the militaristic and imperialist ""Terran Khanate"" based in the alpha ceti prime. while not necessarily the evil empire of star wars, the terran khanate are inherently descendants of outcast humans who objected to earth's unification. having adjusted to the harsh conditions of alpha ceti prime with the rise of an absolute dictator in the form of the khan, due to the context of the environmental and poltical conditions of their new home planet, the terran khanate are not evil so much as their are survivalist, with a strong emphasis on its starfleet and army. i would continue to critique my reasons for liking this game but i felt sharing with you only my most favourite aspects of it would allow you to leave the rest for interpretation. in short it is a good classical space strategy game for a new age of gamers.

												Been a MoO fan forever. This is a nice addition to the series and LEAGUES better than that piece of garbage 3, but ultimately comes nowhere in comparison to MoO2 with regards to fluidity and content. Considering it's a reboot, they did some interesting design choices - namely I absolutely love the voice acting and the 3d graphics as well as revamps and consolidation in the lore of Master of Orion. Ultimately, I wasn't entirely satisfied with the finished product, but I do understand the love and detail added to this game. It's a MoO lite. It takes major themes and dummies down some of the more complex game mechanics and makes it easier for people to jump into the 4x titles. While I was disappointed at the overall lack of depth shared by such titles as Galactic Civilizations 2 and Stellaris, I also found myself smiling at certain points that I found charming and unique to this game. I wish there were several elements added to the game that harken back to MoO2 - system leaders, turn based combat, better events, better exploration (like stellaris or even Star Trek for that matter), better storytelling, and making war, diplomacy, economics, espionage, and science feel like a much greater achievement. There are a lot of shortcomings, but as a reboot, it's a nice step in the right direction (considering the developer is exploring new territory for them, haha - so props for the love and detail they added). I hope expansions and dlc will add to this game and make it far more robust. If they come out with a new game in the next few years, I will be far more critical, but for now, I am just glad this genre defining series is back from the development graveyards. So, thanks for bringing it back and being really interested in what the fans had to say. Tldr: MoO Lite - not MoO2 by any means, but a fun game with some unique aspects. I would recommend waiting for a sale, or if you want to support the developer, buy it full price. If you are new to 4x, I say give it a shot! If you want a deep 4x experience, you will find this game lacking compared to other 4x games currently out, but it's still a fun experience nonetheless.			"

												At first Master of Orion IV feels like Master of Orion II with a lot of window dressing slapped onto it; and it is in many ways. I read the reviews and stayed away from this game for the longest time because of peoples' complaints. However, after playing through a few rounds I feel that some of the negative reviews were completely unjustified.One of the common complaints was the addition of warp points, since the old games allowed you to fly around the map at will. In some ways I miss the old system, but seeing how other games have gone this way I can understand it. If you’re looking for examples look at Sins of a Solar Empire and Endless Space. Both games are fantastic and they use warp points, jump points, hyper points, whatever you want to call them. A lot of hard military science fiction uses jump points in them, usually because it’s suggested that gravity plays a role in how ships are able to move between star systems (see The Lost Fleet books) or there’s gravitic waves between them (see the Honor Harrington books).The ship design system can be a little annoying at times. Namely the auto-upgrade for your blueprints can oftentimes take a weapon off that you really want to keep and replace it with a newer one that sometimes reduces your DPS! You have to be mindful of this as you’re designing your ships. Yes, I know, this seems like an unnecessary step but you could just skip the auto-upgrade and use your best judgment.One thing I will agree with other reviewers on here is the need for DLC. I simply can’t believe how the gaming industry is going this way. Everything is coming down to micro transactions nowadays. It’s horrible. In order to experience the “full” game you have to pay additional money for something that should’ve been included to begin with? Bull****! The developers did this with the Elerians, Gnolams, Trilarians, and the Terran Khanate. In addition the developers made an unforgivable sin in my book, packaging the Khanate into a “Collector’s Edition” that included Master of Orion I, II and III for an exclusive price.I can’t justify paying that. Not when I was able to download Master of Orion I and II from www.gog.com for a lot cheaper and both still play on Windows 10 through their system! Although, to be fair, Master of Orion I looks absolutely terrible when stacked against Master of Orion II.The industry is going this way with DLC and will continue to do so as long as we the People are willing to go along with their shenanigans. It’s either they nickel and dime us that way or they get us with “early release” versions (see beta versions) or pre-ordering.  I for one won’t pre-order most games because I know that buyer’s remorse may be just around the bend. I’ll wait until reviews come out before I buy a game. The only company that has my trust for pre-ordering is Blizzard, and that’s because they consistently make a good product every time.  Say what you will about Diablo III or World of Warcraft, but both have been solid products since their beginnings and I trust Blizzard to continue delivering solid products.It will take we the People to stand up and say, ""No more DLC!"" for the industry to change their ways. But as long as gamers (who are supposed to be the most unforgiving people on the planet) are will to go along with the industry's ways they'll keep right on doing it.			"

												This game is visually gorgeous and with some exceptional sound design and voice acting. However, at least in this current patch, the game is numerically slightly imbalanced. The rate at which enemy civilizations can accrue vast armies whilst maintaining strong infrastructure is simply too fast even at low difficulties such as Easy and Normal. At its heart, I believe the reason for this to be that population is weighted too heavily in terms of its utility in the early game. Because a fast population growth is essential for Research, Production and Expansion, civilizations that should be able to go aggressive early are hamstrung into playing extremely conservative, base-building strategies because their homeworld has a biome unfit for growth (looking at you, Mrrshan...). Despite this, the game has enough positive qualities that I would happily recommend it to a friend. I'd just advise staying clear of playing Mrrshan as a new player until the game has undergone some balance adjustments.One idea: Give Mrrshan a Destroyer to start instead of a Frigate, allowing them to farm pirate bases, because Fieras is garbage to start.

												I read lots of bad reviews and held off buying this game for quite a while. Then I thought ♥♥♥♥ it and bought it anyway.It's great, it's just like MOO2 with nicer graphics - sure some features are missing but it's mostly there. The real time combat isn't as bad as I thought it would be, but I would prefer turn based as I find myself skipping most of the battles that I would normally take control of in MOO2.			"

												Well here is my Review. Both good and bad.First off, I like that the team pulled on the best parts of MoO 2. Colony management, Galactic diplomacy etc. I really like the new relations bar. far better than the old Cassus beilli in MOO 2. In fact the over all experience was so simmiliar to moo 1 and 2 that i didn't take the tutorial. Yaay! Though I  know that There were new systems that i probably would have a better understanding of if i had. Now the stuff that I didn't much care for. If you have played MOO 3. well.. they kept the warp points. I am not a fan of these. I liked how your freedom of movement was limited by your ships' fuel tank tecknology in MOO 1 and 2. (maybe a mod?) So in summary: If you enjoyed 1 and 2. You will like this game. Needs more Mods..... and maybe some more official DLC...or was it expantion packs?			"

												This one is a hard call - I played the original TBS games back in the day and this game is polished and well done. However, IMO it is a bit safe, easy, and boring. Starlanes and slow pace of ships and the game itself make it a little dull. The starlanes make fortification and blockade too easy, and allow the player to concentrate fleets. The game itself feels ""slow.""With the old MOO II, there was apprenhension, checking distance and fuel ranges, and having to station ships at every border planet that was in range of your neighbors. Whether the AI or other players. It GREATLY added to the suspense.Some of the mp MOOII games I played in online were epic in their treachery! There really isn't room for that in new MOO.Best games I have had out of this title are  with research at extremely slow, production and population growth at fast. Even then, you almost collect techs too fast to use them. If you like the Civilization series and the Malfador Machinations ""Space Empires"" games, this one is a bit of a combo of both, with a little MOO seasoning. It would be a good game for someone who likes the above titles.  3.5 stars and for recommendation, depends upon your taste. No recommendation attached to this revioo. For me, I am done with it unless starlanes disappear, and the pacing is right.			"

												Master of Orion - like we've always wanted it!And yet...  not quite.The ship graphics are lacking.  Each ship class only has two choices for it's appearance.  (standard and optional).And.. if you sellect the optional version - most of the time it still shows as the standard (icon / map)Most of the advisors are intentionally aweful.  This is cute the first time - but grows weary.Antarans attack the same planet repeatedly, and are always a match for your biggest fleet - so there is NEVER any getting ahead.  It should be possible to out pace them - but the game is set up so that is impossible.  I find myself just turning them off.  (then.. I use to do that for MOOII as well).And moving fleets takes forever and a day.  You can't ever really have good fleet battles because it takes half a bleeding game just to move your ships into place.Monsters use to protect great planets - worth the effort.  Now they haunt random systems, and most of the time just get in the way.  I say these things... hoping that someone will be able to 'fix' them in future updates or Mods.  Thanks!Overall ***Game Play ****Fleet battles :(Ship Graphics / Choice :(			"

The graphics are better and a lot of time has been put into making everything user friendly. I like the animations and videos. And there are different difficulty levels for those who want a challenging AI. I know when I first play a game if I'm going to return time and time again. This straight away made me think yes. "

												Hmmm, well, what to say. I was a MoO fan when the 1 & 2 came out. Had a falling out with 3,  but thats another story.MoO remake is faithful to its roots in almost every sense of the word. The races involved & tech tree feel familliar, the playing is smoothed out & has a new if a bit simplified feel to it.The simplification is superficial though, as your colonies number in the 6-10ish the simplification feels welcome and maybe even lacluster (MoO veterans know what im talking about, The horror of managing 20+ colonies). There is a  colony manager that you can set in general terms, manufacture, research etc (helps a little).Ships can be upgraded, so thats a relief, no more Mk I s*itboats running around getting blown up. Upgrading is easy (just park your ship to a planet you controll & refit the bugger to the latest blueprint)Diplomacy is there, more choices than most 4x games.. Pretty straightforward.. Spying, now this is where they made a lot of changes, you can now select what your spy does. Disrupt trade, steal tech, etc etc.. There is a whole tree for that now.. Combat: Realtime, felt odd at first, but after a few bouts it works.. Weapons are arced so you can manouver your little buggers to ""bite the bears♥♥♥♥♥quot;.. Wont work so well in big fights (naturally) turning speed seems to be linked to the size of the ship.. Overall.. I would recommend it to every MoO veteran out there.. Give it a go and dont be too critical in the first hour or so.. You might just have found a jewel in the rough.. (Oh, yeah, allmost forgot to mention, the game is still getting patched, minor races for example are coming in the near future)The negative: After playing for a while, the tech advancement is pretty fast.. (Or maybe thats just me)EDIT: Almost forgot, the voice acting is a controversial thing for this game, personally I love it. Familiar & professional actors bring a certain charisma to the different races.. As for the controversy, people are saying that the acting took too much from the budget.. Not so from my point of view..			"

Early Access Review
								Just finished playing through a full game. Many lesser issues which I will not spend time on in this post. Two major issues hurt the game however. Number 1 is the star lanes which were a terrible idea in MOO 3 and should never have been copied to this new itteration. MOO 1 and 2 were about free travel and exploration in space. The forced star lanes here dumb down the overall strategy and promote huge fleets building up at choke points. Developers claim star lanes are the more popular choice (doubt it), but at least make an option for no star lanes in game set up. The second major fault is tactical comabat (the complete lack of it). Its supposed to be a hybrid of RTS (real time strategy) but is more like RTW (real time witness). You can pause the action at any time in battle to ""take control"" but besides steering different groups of ships and changing their formation, there is nothing to do. You can chose tactical mode and watch the battle happen with nice graphics, or you can skip that and just get the results with a simulate option. In ""tactical"" you have no control over individual ships (groupings only), no control over weapons fire, and cannot tell damaged ships to pull back or retreat from the battle. There is nothing meaningful to do. The developers said turn based combat was too slow so they dropped it for real time, but at least turn based combat was meaningful and really impacted game play. These real time battles seem decided almost entirely by math rather than tactics and are neither engaging or memorable.All told the game does capture much of the same atmosphere of MOO 1 and 2 and it has development potential. Wait and see how they address the problems before buying though. They haven't earned our money yet.			"

												I love this game. I had MOO I-II for a while now. Never could get the hang of them, wasn't able to read the UI at all. Had no idea what was going on and what I could be doing.This game with its complete and quality voice-over, the awesome (and if need be, skippable) cut-scenes alone make it a very immersive experience for me. With the tutorial and the clean interface I understood the basic mechanics in minutes and could start to build my galactic empire pretty soon. I even picked up MOO II again, and started fiddling with it. Now I can play with it, because I have more than a clue about what's going on.MOO 2016 might not be the most complex 4x TBS game in the market, but people, let's give credits where they are due: it is an outstanding (re-)introduction to and of a franchise that is considered to be among the great classics.

Early Access Review
								Started off as an interesting, sparsely populated game that was easy, reasonably balanced, but lacked complex AI and dynamic content.Since its inception, the AI has grown far more complex.  There's a great deal more content, some good and some immediately repealed.  There was progress, in the traditional two steps forward, one step back format.  It had promise.Now, it's so unbelievable variable and poorly organized that I can't really handle it or recommend the game or its future trajectory.  Bugs that were ""fixed"" reappear in future patches.  Completely oscillating design changes appear on a patch by patch basis that suggest there is not so much a plan as a ""hope this works"" mentality.  I've spent many hours on this, and I can honestly say I enjoyed the first version far more than the last.  A half year in, and the game feels less finished and polished than the beta started with.Maybe they will recover and launch to acclaim and wide-eyed optimism.  I no longer wait for that day.			"

								There's no depth to this game. Tech tree is essentially a line, racial differences don't matter except in how good they are (i.e. there's little that feels different, except some bonuses are just better.) So much fiddly crap and annoyances leads to avoiding colonisation and espionage because being prompted to make irrelevant decisions is just not worth it.The AI is irrational and there's no choices to be made with your civilisation. None. Don't bother focusing on one path to victory - they're all basically the same, one with trigger first and it may not even be the one you were trying for. And that's because *you can't specialise*.			"

												Definitively worth the buy; and in the deluxe package you get all the old games too.I spent a day and a half on the first play through. Man this game would be awsome on a tablet :)It quite resembles to MoO2. The tech trees among the races are similar and the ship designs are a lot simplified, but overall the game in itself will give you a lot of hours of gameplay - more replay value than most of the games out there today.The DLCs are optional, and not required for the full game experience - the game feels whole also without them - but I bought them just for the sake of it.

												I really tried to like this game, I love this type of game and more specifically I loved Masters of Orion.  The first was great, the second is easily in my top 10 games of all time and the third... well everyone falls flat on their face sometimes. Masters of Orion (this one) is close to being a good game but its problems add up and bog the game down making it one hell of a boring time sink.  I've played through each race and a few custom ones and each time the game goes the exact same way.  Endless pirtes, being yanked all over the map to see stuff I don't care about and good god is the manual ship combat just the worst thing I could have imagined for this type of game.  Most importanly its not very fun, moving from turn to turn feels like running in mud.  A slow drudge through the same stuff again and again.*** tried it again after it came out for real and its an even worse game than it was before.  I don't think I have the words to discribe how much I dislike this game.			"

								Clearly on the bleeding edge of early access at this point. I had to start a game over because a non-existent ship kept demanding orders. Computer isn't aggressive enough, there are too many worlds so there's no competition.I think they did the right thing with planets this time around, as oppsed to the MOO3 disaster. I like that there's more yield in the first good spots.Star lanes are bad. Part of the reason diplomacy isn't what it was in MOO2 (which wasn't what it was in MOO1) is that you rarely border more than two other empires. None of the craziness of five-ways wars in the middle of the map.I miss the cheap ships of MOO1: dangit, I want to have 10,000 fighters in a stack.Played it a lot trying to like it. Still too early.			"

												Easily one of my favorite game. It has an impressive voice acting and an excellent ai. The computer controlled opponents make trade or diplomatic offers that are actually fair or even favorable for you if you are stronger (unlike some similar games). They seem to be using every aspect of the game (every ship design, spies, different technology options, etc.) and have their own style of gameplay. For example, I've played a game where the ai Sakkra was colonising as much planets as he could with his huge army of frigates and destroyers while the ai Silicoid was using a smaller number of bigger ships using biological bombs (or whatever they are called) as he was trying to genocide everyone.In my opinion, pretty much everything is balanced and there isn't any overpowered technology, ship design or race bonus. These are all good at what they do.The game has improved massively since its apparition. The development team is clearly working hard to make this game awesome. Good job and keep it up!P.S. : Most of the negative reviews are people complaining about the lack of content that was in the previous games of the series. What if it was the first ""Master of Orion""?			"

												I heartily recommend MoO for anyone who likes the 4x turn-based genre.  The game is fun and can suck away all of your time.  It is wonderful to build your own race, build ships, populate worlds, and blow the daylights out of alien scum.  The AI is superior with some minor issues.  Diplomacy could be more robust with more ability to haggle, but on the whole this is one of the most fun games in a long time.Even BETTER than the gameplay is that I get the feeling that the developers LIKE gaming.  They want feedback.  There is an in-game bug reporting function.  The trouble ticketing is easy and simple.  I contrast this with Sega's Warhammer Total War.  Sega appears to be much more about the money and is willing to put out substandard games.  NGD Studios appears to want to play GREAT games and share them with us.  Thanks for being gamers first NGD!			"

												Well I approached this without having participated in Early Access or played any of the previous MOO titles. Regardless of the naysayers I have to say having played Stellaris and Polaris Sector this is a really enjoyable game.No the maps are not No Mans Sky huge but the game is well balanced, full of choice and the AI is capable as far as I can see. The differences in emphasis between races is definitely there and I can see these being amplified with patches and expansions.I have had precisely zero crashes.Happy camper.Give it a go you will be pleasantly surprised.

												This is a mediocre recommendation.  They have the tech tree, they have the nice animations when the aliens talk.  The combat is weak, there is no turn base to it, and yes a lot of times, people want to control combat directl and the real time version of the combat is horribad.  The actual aggressiveness of the AI is HORRIBAD and need to be fixed.  Just played the game on the highest level, and the enemy AI doesn't attack you if you have enough ships, they just stay away and let you continue to grab land while their inevitable decline comes.  Its really bad AI that needs to be FIXED.			"

												Master of Orion and Civ - these were the first games that really captured me, all those years ago. MOO3 was abysmal, some of the later Civs haven't had the charm and addictiveness of the earlier incarnations - but the revamped Master of Orion is a welcome return to form. This is the first game in years I have been compelled to stay up playing until 3am. Is it perfect? Of course not. There are aspects that could be improved (like - the ability to create, save and load build queues - hope that gets added at some point; it would make some of the micromanagement less painful), but none of the little flaws in design and user experience ruin this game. You put up with them because the game has successfully harnessed all those mechanics we're so familiar with and made them fun again.Thank you!			"

												Be careful which reviews you read. Most are from when this game was 'officially released' earlier in 2016. At that point, the game was nearly unplayable from lack of features. However, the developers have been extremely diligent since then, and have added many features and fixed many issues.I feel that this game lost many sales because of how the game was released and reviewed, which is kind of a bummer. When I played this game back in May(?) I was straight up angry that they basically made a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Moo2. Well, I started playing it again over Christmas break and was delighted to see that they made what I consider a strictly better version of Moo2. I still see complaints regarding star lanes, but I approve of them personally. It makes for easier to manage defensive strongholds, as opposed to parking a doomstar at every star system you have			"

												if you liked moo2, you will like this edition. Very similar, but not really as good. Nice graphics. Works well on win10 on a five year old PC. -Tech tree is expanded and better -real time system in tactical combat works wellOther than that, the game is a little worse in every way. -Even with max control you don't do much in tactical combat. -You can't tell what's going during ground combat. -missing the governor and ships captain. That was a nice feature. There is no bonus for ship experience-new ship engines don't seem to mean anything-AI is better is some ways, but often just anoying. Asking the same thing over and over-spying shows promise but gets very repetitive after a while. Just send them home and shut them upOverall I am enjoying it. But it won't have the same replay value as moo2. Good game...just missing the last 20% that makes you want to keep coming back			"

Expansion is never explained, and once you know the trick of it, boring. I can see this being a seriously awesome frame to build some mods on though, hopefully that happens sooner than later			"

												As the Psilon supreme commander i forged an empire that straddled half the galaxy,a very large galaxy,my research prowess unmatched,my technological acheivments the envy of the galaxy and my diplomacy forged an alliance we thought would never wane,but then the treacherous Alkari stole what was on Orion, and for the good of the galaxy the Psilon collective decided action must be took to stop the fanatical Alkari from using is newly found power to commit genocide on the Mrsshan empire,perhaps it was the Mrrshan fate to become the hunted,for they were the apex predator but now we must act but it was too late,the only felines left in the galaxy in the form of 1,muffin,my domestic short hair. Cowardly apathetic humans dishonored our alliance and stood idoly by arguing over who would be the worse president,and something about a frog, while the Psilons die by the thousands, planet after planet fell in the wake of the Alkari war machine. this game is a beatiful tribute to 4x and the MOO franchise. it has the nostagia and has depth but still accessible to newcomers, graphics are very nice,and have a nice modern feel. im glad they came out with this dlc i was feeling like it needed a few more classic races i know alot of people dont like paying more than 50 or 60 for a game but as long as you keep coming with patches and support its totally justified in my opinion, personally ive loved MOO since i played the original on dosshell floppy drive pc when i was 11 and that may make me a little biased and nostalgic but thats why i think its great,because it rings true to its predeccessors success while infusing some modern-(ness?) into the game.

												With an old IP like this, there are plenty of nostalgics to moan and groan over any little change, from what i have seen this team genuinely gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the franchise and has done a great job. I am still encountering some bugs, but usually a reboot will fix them. Some things to note: Combat is in real time rather than turn basedYou can pause at any time to issue orders to move/attack, which are then carried out all at the same time when you hit 'play'. I think this is great, and gets around the issue in MoO2 where a large fleet would take forever to command. This also opens up options like having a horde of small expendable vessles rather than a few of the biggest ships available.Original races as DLCYou will need to purchase DLC to play as the Elerian, Gnolam, or Trilarian races. I dont like that these races were excluded from the original game. A more palatable move would have been to have all the original races playable, and to invent some brand new races/traits as paid DLCMods are essentialSome silly decisions by the devs are made moot with mods. e.g. having only 10 points to spend on your custom race, not being able to see/select all perks when making a custom race, Anarans being stupidly strong, (Mods a collection here)Voiceovers get annoyingThe voice acting is great in my experience, but overused. Your advisor pops up all the time, and says one of about 5 lines every time you choose a technology to research. Thankfully there is an option to mute the advisor.Starlane travelUnlike prior games, travel between the stars takes place via 'starlanes'. Each system has one or more point from which you can travel to another system. These points are the only place to enter or exit a system, and so become chokepoints you can block or defend with military instalations.FuelA major part of previous Orion games was researching fuel tech, to enable you to explore further. In Master of Orion there is no limit to the distance you are able to venture from your colonies. To make up for this, you must now explore each planet within a system to determine the size/biome/mineral/bonuses, meaning exploration is a more involved task.Overall a very enjoyable game with mods, and getting better all the time.

												I find this game interesting and highly re-playable. It can be difficult to play since the AI seems to go for a no-holds barred approach, but this brings up the significance of having and maintaining alliances or not sitting on one's haunches.The military is limited to the resources you can throw behind it and/or how much can be realistically supported... This makes wars realistically challenging strategically. If you're tired of easy games and want something highly customizable where you can conquer and rename systems, kill alien species off Starship Troopers style, or even work with everyone as friends a 'la Star Trek, this is the game you're looking for. Fair warning though, the AI will not wait for you to play catch-up. You need to be on your game to advance.			"

												I have very mixed feelings about this game. It has great cut scenes and voice acting, but lacks in game content and depth. POSITIVESNice graphics and cut scenesModern UISmooth transitions and scrollingTech tree display is very nice/well donePleasant musicGood sound effectsExcellent path to victory timeline graphNEGATIVESFew planets in each systemMulti-ship fleets appear as one vessel despite zoom levelNo multi-player manual combatOnly one tech research at a time, few pathsOverall nothing really bad but not exactly innovative either.I would have liked to see a few things different. First, because of its relationship to the Wargaming company, I had hoped to have battle occur in the manner of World of Warships or World of Tanks. Likewise I had hoped for the ship customization that is used in those titles to find its way into this game. Upgraded modules, signal flags, pennants, ammo options, etc.The espionage system has tons of potential but is handled very simply. It would be amazing to have a few espionage cut scenes and some more detailed choice trees. Perhaps specialization of operatives? Maybe some tactical missions that allow players to control the spy?This game is competent and has a modern look, but there are more interesting options to consider. 7/10			"

												Master of Orion: Conquer The Stars is a strategy game best described as the “streamlined version of Civilization in space”. Graphically it’s eye candy and the limited number of races are beautifully animated and voice acted throughout. I got a huge buzz out of defeating Mark Hamill’s Alkari whilst the Meklar sounded exactly like the cylon centurions from the original Battlestar Galactica. Presentation wise the game is a joy and for me it certainly has that one more turn quality essential to a turn based game.It would be remiss to not mention that the game feels bare boned at the moment and doesn’t have the overwhelming complexity of its competitors. The early exploration certainly feels lacking but the UI is extremely good and intuitive. If you love sci-fi and you’ve never played a 4X before this is probably the most fun one to start with.			"

												Simple and fun space 4x. The UI is fantastic, graphics have a nice style that looks good and fits well with the overall atmosphere. You can tell the dev team put a lot of love into this title, it really shows. Each race has their own style and they all seem really cool. Combat can be hands on or off and it seems well balanced. The only thing I don't really care for is the GNN cut scenes. They try to be humorous and relay the happenings of the galaxy but it comes off as really cheesy and seems cheap. The concept is cool, but I would have prefered a more serious tone and greater variation - otherwise a news ticker or something similar would be just fine and much more welcome in my book.I don't really know what else to say. If you've played a 4x before, you should be able to pick this up quick and get going right away. It's not as in depth as some of the other titles but it is still a lot of fun to play! I would choose this over GalCiv 3 to be sure. Otherwise, this sits nicely on my space 4x digital game shelf next to Stellaris, Endless Space 1 & 2, and Distant Worlds.			"

												If you have any desire to do anything more than build stuff,  and fight then don't bother. it's really just 4x in space now. Despite  investing in all things diplomacy and espionage, every offer to another race is countered with ridicilous requirements, and despite highly invested espionage skills, the first spy on a low risk mission is caught by a race with no security?  At this point I can only play this if my plan is ti research, build ships and kill other races... there seems to be no logical way to influence. Quite disappointing.			"

												As a huge MoO fan, I was heistant to try this out. There have been many attempts to reboot classic series and none have come close to delievering an updated experiance that also maintains the spirit of the origonal. I was happy to find out that Master of Orion 2016 does both.I have played many space empire building games. I love building ships and researching crazy sci-fi techs, but most of them over complicate the experiance. There's too many things going on, the research tree is over blown with stuff, Colonies are over compicated to manage and everything is just micromanaged to heck. MoO isn't this. Everything is there, the menues are intuitive, you don't have to search for important information at the bottom of a menu that's overly busy. Colony managment is easy, ship design is intuitive and its not had to see whats going on in the galaxy with a glance at the map. Not to mention knowing who hates you at this moment. There are some things I'm not too hot on. It does still have the thing from MoO2 where the Sakkara, Klackons and Silicoids would rampage though the galaxy because their racial bonuses were over strong early game. Obviously with some planning this isn't a problem, but its still fustrating to start right next to them and known ""welp, better make a giant fleet"", which is my second issue. Each race has its own style of ship, and they're all fitting; the Humans have classic Star Trek/Wars looking sleek high tech looking ships; Burathi have suitablly bulky and brutal looking ships; Klackons have what looks like a fleet of giant bugs and so on, but the problem is there is only 2 versions of each ship. Both earlier games had multiple options for each class, and this means your fleets are basically going to look the same the whole game. Not that the games are going to go on that long where you'll have too many ship types. 500 turns is not long enough. I have never finished the tech tree, nor built a doom star, and even when I'm rushing as fast as I can, bam turn 500 and its over. Either things need to speed up, construction and research wise, or there needs to be an option to increase the number of turns. It does mean you can finish a game in an evening, but it would be nice to have long drawn out games. I have to point out yes you can keep playing beyond the Victory screen, but that's just not the same. Also, Economic VIctory needs to be reworked. I have won it with as little as 3 shares bought. Though over all, if you want a easily accessable Space Empire 4x game, you cannot do any better than this. Plus you get to hear Mark Hamil as a bird person.			"

												Master of Orion is a great 4X game! if you love other 4X games pick up Master Of Orion! lots of unique races to play with, lots of paths to victory, Great AI with a balace of hyper agressive races, peacful races, races racing to the victory lines, they will provided you with good compitition! There are a few minior problems i have with the game (at this time) which im sure they will fix, i get game crachs when closing the game somtimes, and if you are in the very late game, the load betweek turns can be a few mins, i also dislike that you can not destroy volcanic planets unless they are owned by the enemy, would be nice to kill the ones in my territory.overall a great 4X game with meny hours of play in it, great design, mechanics, AI, and races.9.5/10			"

												I have to give Master of Orion two scores.As a single-player experience I'd rate it 4/5 stars. The graphics are gorgeous, it captures the spirit of the original game perfectly, and goes a long way to reclaimin the title of King of the Turn-Based Strat games. I do have to deduct a half star for not being able to set up custom-defined autobuild ques for extended planet development (beyond the 4 slots you're allowed). being able to set up a custom auto-build command for late game development would be invaluable. I also deducted a half point for the controls of the battle interface. Commanding your fleets hands-on can be tricky at best.As a multi-player game though, I'd only rate it 2/5. There's no easy way for a disconnected player to jump back into a game, and the hands-on battle interface is just gone. you're only allowed the auto-resolve battle option. In my book, these are two huge hits to the quality of that side of the game. Overall though, I still reccomend this game and hope that these oversights can be rectified in the future.			"

It looks really good. The battle system may be a bit simplistic, but it is fun to watch.			"

												I had been looking around for a new 4X style space strategy game, and I ran across this one. I had my doubts, but upon playing it I've been nothing but impressed. This is a very polished game, the game feels colorful and vibrant and even immersive. The planets and other races are detailed and interesting with great animation and voice acting, and the humorous space news segments really gave me a chuckle.I think it strikes a nice balance between simplicity and complexity. It's not too simplistic, and it isn't overburdened by ridiculous levels of micromanagement like some 4X style games. This is a game I think can enjoy sinking a good deal of time into because it has a relaxing and atmospheric quality to it.More random events and a more diverse tech tree might be nice, however. Definitely recommend.			"

												This space strategy game is a little more simple and fast-paced than competitors like Galactic Civilizations 3, but still feels rich in personality. It doesn't really do anything vastly different to its predecessors or rivals, but it's quite competent at what it does. If you're looking for some cool new gimmick to make space sims insteresting again for you, this game will probably feel pretty generic, but if you want a fairly straightforward game of galactic conquest done well, this has plenty of cool ships, colourful races and (in my opinion) a pretty smooth presentation.

												This game takes many of the best stuff out of the original 3 games and cuts some of the bad.The game play is quite familiar if you played the originals.The game has a few bugs. One bad bug is that I had a fleet, a rather large one,  That got lost off the map with a negitive number of turns to reach its destination. I could view the fleet on rhe fleet screen and see them compleatly outside of warp lanes but could not interact with them except to change their destination. They could never reach their destination. It would just drop to -1 tum ro arrival and keep counting. I also could not scrap the fleet so the still took up resources.The bug only happened in on game. I had not seen it before or sense.  "

												Great game, I am glad I didnt listen to the reviews. If you enjoyed and think you would still enjoy the original MOO games than you will like this.  The combat is really good, and pretty much every aspect of the game is improved compared to the originals.  There is nothing new or revolutionary in this game, but they made smart decisions.  It is just an improved MOO with better graphics and i am happy with that. Two things I want1) Leaders ( would make the game so much more interesting)2) the Antarans.I would give the game an 8 or 9 out of 10.EDIT- After playing some additional MP games I am going to have to reevaluate my score.. Change it to a 6.5 out of 10 for now.   No tactical combat in MP is a really really bad move for many reasons.. There is just too many unknown variables, for example is it still better to load your ships with nukes in MP? or should you do mix? does the AI know in the simulation that your nuclear fleets should stay as far from the enemy as possible?Devs please give us some information on this. thanks			"

												Masters of Orion, in lame man terms, is FREAKIN AMAZING. The game plays very smooth and is always a joy to play. The characters are all unique and play differently. Some you can let go and they'll love you for it (Crag) while others require constant supervision or else they'll kill you (♥♥♥♥in Klackon). The game's strong points are the real time battle gameplay, the characters, and the designs for everything in general. However, it's not perfect. The ship designs are limited to two per ship class, which is dumb considering how beautiful those two different ships are. If they added detailed ship customization or even more ship designs in game, it's be amazing. Another dumb thing is fleet merging. There is no button to do this, so in the beginning, you'll have multiple fleets. This isn't really an issue later on, but still. The game can also be slow at times, so if you're used to face pace combat, you're not going to like it.TL;DR Game is really good 9/10			"

												Let me say this: Someone looked at what MOO3 failed at and did EXACTLY the opposite. And they succeeded. As an old MOOII addict, I was let down by MOO3 immensely. Besides the many technical problems it had it was just not fun to play. And thats were this version excels at: it is fun. It doesn't take itself too serious, has a lot of self aware tongue in cheek humor. MOO3 was depressing. It tried very hard to be gloomy and bleak. Not in a good, mature entertainment kind of way, but in a emo teen trying to be dark and edgy way. Some people remarked it goes into Disney territory, and thats partly true. The Races are stereotypes, but than they never were anything else in the originals. There are the warrior Cat people, and the smart, arrogant, big headed Psilons ... that was never meant to be ""realistic aliens"". This is one of the few things which MOO3 can be praised for, it tried that and partly succeed. This version gets back to more comic bookish alien races, but they know that and they OWN it. The science advisors comments still make me chuckle after 80+ hours of game-play, and the high profile voice acting is superb. As for the game mechanics and were it stands as a strategy game: It is basically an exact copy of MOO I&II if it was made in 2016. If you liked the originals in that regard, you will like this one. I read reviews about calling it dated, but I disagree on that. The concept was good back in the days, and it is good now. I love how they brought this oldies into this time and made it work. The power of the ancients is now yours to command ... :)			"

												Loving it so far! I guess I'm beginning to understand the majority of the downvoters. It seems simpler than the classic complex X4 most followers of the genre are used to (apparently including the original MOO's as well). If you are not a genre extremist or you wish to try this kind of games for the first time, I'd surely recommend it to you.I haven't found any bug yet, though I haven't played for too long. Audiovisuals are really amazing!Update: ok, I'm finishing my first 500 turns game by now, and I can confirm I haven't found any bug. I enjoyed this first playthrough a lot. Before playing, I had read several negative reviews complaining about turns taking too long to process when advancing through a game. My desktop, which has an 4th gen i5 is now taking a few seconds to process turn 460. I've also tried the game in my FX7500 laptop and turns are being processed within 20 seconds.I can confirm this is a great game!			"

It is 1 step ahead of Galactic Civ while several steps behind Stellaris.Not sure why these limits are:Why only 6 races in play?Why game is limited in turns?Why fleets consists of so little ships? Shouldn't be galactic scale battle?Why alliance does give a lot?Why races are predefine and there are no minor races?Why so many micro management? It is fun when there 5 planets, but no so much when you have 30 ...Why music is not distinctive, some games you want to play just for awesome music.I would give it 7/10. "

												Overall, I'd say it's a good game. Especially if you are into long term strategy games. It is your basic 4x game, build up a base, explore, and either exterminate or out research everyone else. That being said, it does have a few truly significant oversights. First and foremost, the inability to save a ""custom"" race, or more advanced, setup. This has been brought up multiple times and is still unaddressed. I find it personally irritating to have to reselect EVERYTHING to restart a game. Civilization(tm) allows a simple ""escape"" feature and all your original starting parameters are queued up and ready to go, no reselecting everything.The overall design and gameplay is good. The graphics and audio are excellent! I certainly do not wish to discourage anybody from playing this game. I have to admit that there seems to be just a ""few"" to few scientific advances. I'd like to see the end game actually have some reason to comtinue researching after you've discovered everything the game has to offer.			"

												If you are familiar with Space TBS then you will have no problem having to learn how to play.The micro was also reduced compared to some games. This seems to be due to fewer items to manage. (Less complex)When I first started a new game the optons availabe with many choices to customize the race was nice.In short this was  $18 well spent.

												Is it different from previous Master of Orion entries? Yes. Is it lacking some features they had? Yes. Is that a bad thing? Not really. Honestly there are parts of the mechanics that previous MoO games had that I miss, but overall this one is not only beautiful, but plays well and is a lot of fun. I've actually spent far more time with it since beta access than I did on any of the previous entries from their release to now. It's addictive, it's fun and with the coming expansion it looks like it's about to get even more so. There's been a wild knee jerk from people who wanted to buy the same game they bought years ago with just a graphical facelift. Ignore most of it. Little if any of what they are ranting about is related to flaws with this game, it's more about flaws with their expectation. Most people don't want to buy a game they already have. They want to buy a game that offers a different experience.  It's well worth the money, especially as of today when it's on the Cyber Monday sale at $17.99.			"

												Master of Orion (4) seems like a reasonably faithful update of MOO2.  The major difference is that combat is real-time rather than turn-based (though through strategic pausing and direction of ships this can be somewhat simulated).  Gameplay and ship design also have been steamlined a bit so you don't have to spead so much time micro-managing things (which could be a plus or minus depending on whether you you enjoy complexity or not).  Mostly the overall game experience is very much like playing MOO2, which is also an excellent game despite it's age.Overall I don't have any major complaints about what overall is a really good game. The worst thing I can think of is that ""Heavy Gravity Homeworld"" is a 4 point ""advantage"" when it no longer allows you to settle the much more numerous normal gravity planets without a penalty (For obvious reasons, the Bulrathi are one of the worst races to play because of this), which all things considered is a fairly minor complaint.

												There are many negative reviews, so I figured out this game deserves a positive one.Firts of all, the problems in negative reviews are real: the game has bugs. I haven't encountered an infinite turn processing, but there are problems with some game mechanics and a couple of graphical glithches. The AI is realy wierd, still managable.That being said, the game is freaking awesome from my point of view!PROS:Beautyful interfaces, voice acting and graphics.Much easier to understand how mechanics work. Planet management on the fly. (Compaired do Galactic Civilizations 3)Simple managment even on a big scale (400+ turns)Really cool races with deep story and set of traits (it gets spioled by some bugs and imbalalnces, but still feels great to play for each race).The game will be great for you, if you're not deep into 4x strats and just want to casually spend a couple of days conquering the Orion :)Buy this game on a sale, if available, buy the DLC, support the devs.The collection edition is now worth it imo.GL HF			"

												Don't even listen to these nostalgia glasses wearing butthurt whiners in the comments, the game is great, yeah it's not as customizable, yeah it doesn't have as crazy of a tech tree, but it makes up for that in a more streamlined approach that lets pretty much anyone pick up and play it without really knowing too much about the MOO games. Couple this with incredible voice acting and a diverse race roster and you have a really really fun game.There are problems though, some of the stronger ships really aren't worth the cost. In a game like Stellaris or Endless Space, the largest ship classes in those games can EASILY destoy several dozen of the smaller weaker ships if they are built correctly, with good upgrades whereas in Master of Orion the stronger ships are only better because they have more slots, they don't have that much more HP than smaller ships to justify the cost, so it's generally better to just mass an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of smaller ships with good upgrades, than rush your tech for the ""powerful"" large ships.For example I built a Doomstar (A thinly veiled Deathstar reference), the largest ship in the game, and even with all of the  most incredibly expensive upgrades I had, with technology that was FAR superior to the enemy, I still lost a battle against only 24 frigates (the second smallest ship class).That is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. And this isn't Star Wars where your Deathstar has a critical weakness ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that only a small ship could exploit, it's just massive wall of health, and it doesn't do nearly enough damage to justify it's INSANE cost.Other than the balance issues listed above the game is great, It's only 30 bucks and it's essentially CIV in space. So If you like strategy games with a very streamlined, easy to pickup style, then look no further.But if your looking for more in depth gameplay, with complex systems and a cluster♥♥♥♥ of a UI, then go play Stellaris or Endless Space(both excellent games).

								Waste of time.The interface is smooth and the game flows. But there is very little real challenge here. Diplomacy appears to be complex but the reality is that your neighbors will bully you until you are stronger than them. After that, they will leave you alone.Designing ships is an abstract exercise which point appears obscured. Until you get into combat. Then, you will realised that it is pointless. Combat options are limited and useless as the combat is reduced to a couple volleys before it ends. There is no scope for tactics as it is over as quick as it started. At the end, this game is reduced to conducting admin on your empire and moving fleets about. Everything else does not add anything to the experience. Even getting into combat can be best described as looking a statistical tables and letting the computer determined the outcome based on those table.Stay clear of it. I got bored with it pretty early on.			"

								I just bought this game because i was a HUUUUGGGEEEE fan of Masters Of Orion 2, and this game for the most part is a 2016 update of MOO2, all except in one area, the combat.In every other area, it's a perfect replica and updated graphics / sounds / music of the original game, but Combat sucks.It's kinda the worst combat I have seen in a 4x RTS game, the ship design is really bad also, that could be vastly improved on also, so ship design is basic and combat SUCKS.Why does it suck you ask, because it's hard to watch what is happening because the camera control is too awkward to control, the combat is basicly ai vs ai, you do nothing but watch, I remember the original MOO 2 combat, it was like chess. you have your ships vs AI, the enemy hits your shields you rotate your ship to put the rear shields facing the enemy for the next attack.You sacrifice some ships so others can get the win, it was a great combat system. this one is start combat sit back and wait to see which AI wins.Other than that it's a good game			"

												A fitting reboot to the franchis, MOO manages to capture *most* of the good from the previous three games while still containing a little of what MOO and MOO3 do worse than MOO2. Although with the advent of live patches and high speed internet, Firaxis has done a wonderful job of listening to the community and not outright screwing players over with DLC (I find the additional races as DLC alright as long as they contain their proper back stories and interactions that made them memorable in the ""expansion packs"" of old). It may not be the best M00 right now, but with proper support and continuing to listen to players, Firaxis may have revived one of my favorite franchises.

												I'm a very devoted MOO II fan.Started the game with uber low expectations,The game managed to fail even that.I had to force myself to avoid ALT-F4 & uninstall.Honestly I'm horrified and disgusted of this abomination.I can't recommend it to anyone.In overall it feels like they wanted to make a totally dumbed down strategy game - so even the most mentally handicapped can play it. But they were ignoring the fact that the original tried to be as complex as possible. It was successful, because it gave quality gameplay over 20 years ago!To compensate the atomic simplicity of the game, they tried to give it more style, story and graphics. Failed attempt.In my opinion, the game is worth 2$ at max, no more.Not going to go in a detailed description in what makes this game terrible, as it doesn't even deserve serious criticism. "

								I changed my mind. As of this release, MOO is more like a space themed Civ5 expansion pack. And unfortunately not a very good one. Bringing one ship per warp point limitation will complete the joke.I know it is early access, but it is not progressing in a good way. If you are considering to invest, I suggest to wait for the actual release. --------------------------------------My previous review (May 5):I have been playing MOO2 for ages. With its transcendental music, lovely graphics and rich possibilities that may make each game unique, MOO2 is like the ultimate tool for meditation for me. The previous sequel, MOO3 (not this game!) was quite the contrary, I genuinely disliked it.So, briefly I have been waiting for a good sequel for ages. It has finally arrived. I loved it.This new implementation did a very good job on maintaining the original qualities that made MOO2 a cornerstone piece for 4X lovers. Even though the game is still in early access, it is engaging, doesn’t overwhelm with details even though they are there if you feel like micromanaging, same calm graphics and music, and is very playable. If you are looking for one, this game is a proper sequel to MOO2. It is definitely worth its price. If you love MOO series, go for it.I have some criticism for the early access as of May’16, though:It is getting a bit too similar to Civ5 dynamics: City states, establishing embassies etc. While it gives a familiarity feeling for Civ players, I would expect more innovative diversions from the Sid’s path.Diplomacy is still a bit shaky, very frequently in a single turn you may become the common BFF of the galaxy and after a few turns suddenly they see their error and declare an all-out war on you. I am sure there will be a better AI diplomacy when the game is released.I like playing tactical battles, but they are still a bit confusing for me. With every new release I give it a try but I always end up auto-resolving the battles. It is obvious that the designers have pretty good ideas and trying them out. "

												Did you like MMO2?  Do you want to play a game almost exactly like it but a bit modern?  Than this will be worth the money.This is a 4x turn based game that is really simple to figure out and I agree does not have a ton of variability.  It's like a water down Civ in space.Which is sometimes all you want to do.  I don't need to be challanged with every game I play or have massive depth.If you want something that is difficult and complex, you probably will be disappointed.If you want a fun 4x game (even if you never payed MOO2), then I would highly recommend this one.Plus, who doesn't want to min/max a couple hundred small ships with no armor and only high power weapons and missiles to conquer the galaxy?

												Awesome game! It's been a while since I played MoO2 but this definitely brought me back to it. I'm addicted! There are two things that I don't like. First, it feels like the game moves a little slow. I've been playing the tutorial campaign and it's taking me a long time to get through it. However, different campaign settings may change this. Secondly, I'm not a huge fan of the 3d perspective view on the galaxy map. I feel like it's harder to view everything than the 2d top down view of MoO2. The graphics are definitely more appealing, but I do wish there were a way to rotate the camera. Perhaps there is and I haven't figure it out yet.That being said, I've enjoyed every minute of it. I also love the ability to jump back in the timeline and redo something. Great game!			"

												A simple, effective turn-based strategy game just like the original. The orchestrated music is great! Faithfull to the original and as i imagined it to be back in the 90´s, some rules have changed but for good, gameplay has been simplified and its quite friendly. Buggy still, combat view needs free camera mode, but overall a decent game, it has more potential but lets se if the updates can exploit this great game a little more...			"

												I kept hoping, but feared I'd never see the day, where another 4x space sim would ever top the original Master Of Orion (MOO).  That day is finally here!  And wouldn't you know it, it's a reboot of the original!!!  If you love the original Master Of Orion, and have been waiting for years like me for a game that is just as great, and better, than the original, that wait is over!Master Of Orion (reboot) is an amazing game in every aspect!  Graphics, Sound and Presentation are the cream of the crop and AAA!  But where this successor really shines is in the Gameplay!  The original game is unrivaled and the reboot doesn't disappoint.  It fixes the two small niggles that stunted the first game, slow start of each game, and some late game micromanagement.  The original Master Of Orion was the first of its kind (4x space sim) and of course there would be things to improve on.  After playing the original MOO, the only improvements I wished for was an up in graphics (of course) and to fix the two aforementioned items.  Well the reboot fixes just that!  The reboot flows amazingly from start to finish with no lag/grind time, and the management (sans micro) is so streamline that there is no problem controlling your empire as it grows.  Every aspect of the game fits neatly with every other aspect making the game perfectly seamless!  And with every turn showing everything you need to manage at the time you need to manage it at the bottom right hand corner of the screen every turn, you don't even have to go into any menus manually if you don't want to!  THIS IS GAME CHANGING!  This makes the game accessible to ANYONE AND EVERY TYPE OF PLAYER OUT THERE!!!  This is so major that if every other 4x space sim adopted this, every game could be this AMAZING!  And for those who still want to have more hands on and dig deep into management systems, IT'S ALL STILL THERE!  This game is extensive enough for veterans while also being simple enough for newbie's!  How many games get this right?  It's EXTREMELY RARE!  This kind of rarity should be, and is, appreciated!So you may be wondering, many fans claim that the sequel, the original Master Of Orion 2 (MOO 2), is actually the best game in the series.  I never understood that, or comprehended why.  Yes, it expanded on the original Master Of Orion, and it looked like the original Master Of Orion, but it didn't feel like Master Of Orion.  This is when the series started going more down the ""micromanagement rabbit hole"" that most 4x space sims build themselves on today.  MOO 2 lost the ""pick up and play"" aspect that made the original Master Of Orion so great, and at its heart, what it was.  MOO 2 was prettier (and that's all that needed to be updated) but its predecessor was about giving players a choice of being as simple, or as complex as desired.  With MOO 2's unnecessary large amount of micromanaging, it pushed all simplicity aside.  It became a numbers game and sacrificed its simple fun making it feel more like a job rather than a game.  One only has to look at the horrible Master Of Orion 3 to see how they built upon micromanaging at its worst.  This is why the series lay dormant for so many years.The original Master Of Orion spoiled me to the point that I expected better of any game that tried to do what it did.  I waited so many years for a true successor, and it brings a tear to my eye to finally have that.  The new Master of Orion is perfect in almost every way, but like its predecessor, it too has one minor niggle; not game breaking in anyway.  The game introduces a cinematic camera view during battles, that is great in concept, but doesn't work as well in practice, or as well as I'd like.  The camera doesn't show the best of the action most of the time and often you miss the best parts of a fight.  If they fix this (and this is the only thing they need to fix about the game in a patch or even a sequel) then this series will stay in the top spot of 4x space sim perfection!  Go buy this!  We need to show developers that we want more games like this.  Though I got it on sale, I believe it's well worth full price!-----Updated 11/24/16 - Steam does it again!  They created an Award celebration where we get to nominate games we think are the best of the best!  I'm giving Master Of Orion what I think is Steam's most prestigious award, since they don't have a ""Best of the Year"" category, I'm giving it the “Just 5 More Minutes” Award!  You can't stop playing!It's a shame to not see Master of Orion on any ""best of"" 2016 award lists this year.  This by far is now the best 4x Space Sim you can play!  I hope you decide to pick it up, sale or no, because it's an experience you simply can't miss!  This is my pick for game of the year 2016!So now that Master Of Orion has rebooted so successfully, there is a HUGE opportunity to grow this franchise right, avoiding the pitfalls of the past.  So what do I want to see as an evolution to Master Of Orion, either as an extension to the existing game, or its possible sequel?  I would love to see random story missions/events.  The kind you find in the side stories of games like Elder Scrolls and Mass Effect.  And make many of them!  So many that you won't be able see all of them in a single play through.  This way, multiple play through's will be unique, and things you do will make you feel more connected to the experience like no other 4x Space Sim before!  Sure there have been other games that have made linear story lines in 4x Space Sims, like Galactic Civilizations, and although they can be quite good, they are still too constraint, and people end up skipping them and just jumping into what makes these games so desirable in the first place, the random sandbox experience.  But if someone could program story elements, that don't force you into a predetermined end, or handful of endings, that would be amazing!   And since this is Steam, why not workshop it!  Make a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" interface and make it easy enough that people can come up with their own stories on the fly to share, and you could continually have more and more events all the time!  The possibilities are endless!So yeah, Master Of Orion, Game of the Year 2016, and best 4x Space Sim of all time!			"

												It gave me what I wanted which was the nostalgia of MOO2 with some UI updates. The lack of some of the core races as DLC is annoying at best, but I didn't really expect to want to do so many playthroughs of the game so I am OK with it. If you just want a casual chill and conquer the galaxy game, this is it.			"

												This game feels a lot like MoO2 did for me. The early game is exploration and discovery, with several turns going by between actions other than ship movements (playing on Prewarp, which I always do). The GNN events bring me back to that as well, although I was surprised the first time I saw a whole other race (Mrrshan) wiped out by a supernova! Later in the game you become more cautious, consolidating your gains or taking advantage of your opponents' weaknesses to attack them. It's fun and exciting and I enjoy it thoroughly.I don't prefer the combat system, as many have stated, so I just put it on cinematic unless it's a close battle that I think my human brain needs to participate in. Most of the time, though, it isn't. The AI seems fine, nothing extraordinary. No complaints or accolades yet.All in all, if you liked MoO2, you'll like this one. If you're a MoO2 purist, though, believing that any successful sequel must copy it exactly (except updated graphics or what have you)...then maybe not. Although it really DOES feel like that to me, honestly. "

												First things first: is this MoO2? Simply put, it's not MoO2. It's inspired by it, sure, and those lines are quite clear.  However, WG has decided to make several changes, and you'll see that the majority of the other reviews all either say that it's good or that it's not MoO2 and therefore bad. YMMV.In the end, I like it. The game as a solid game. It's not just a carbon copy, and it definitely has the MoO/MoO2 spirit.An addendum: a lot of people think the tactical combat was the heart and soul of MoO/MoO2. I'm not sure I agree, and it's definitely not a reason to rate the game down.			"

												Update 3:  This review is updated after not playing the game in a lot of time and finding out that they've released it as a finished product.  In my opinion, wait to a very good rebate to buy this game; I originally bought it in early access at full price because I wanted to support the devs and I don't regret it, but if you want to invest your money in a good game, this one is not for you, beside all the flaws and things that I kept writing to the devs through all this time, now that they had released it for real I played it again to a great disappointment as it seems that all the feedback the gamers gave for months were ignored, beside the previous things I reported now there's another list (with things pointed out before):- No control over scouts and colony ships design (as in MOO1, 2).- No need to research technology to colonize extreme environments (that gave some advantages to different races in the game and gave more strategy to research, as in previous games).- Linear technology research with no different technologies for different races (again, that gave more strategy decisions and sense to spying technology from adversaries).- If player changes the production (no matter if it was a mistake) all the previous production is lost (say, you had 10 turns producing something, bam, lost, start from zero again).- No previously saved games list, if the user wants to overwrite a previous saved game it's necessary to write down the name again (don't use complicated save names!), if you don't overwrite you'll need some time to browse saved games and delete them if you don't want to pile up a lot of unnecessary files.- No way to change colony names.- Scouts and colony ships can't withdraw from battles when unescorted (idiotic game design).- Scroll zoom deficient, there's one point when you jump zooms.- Crappy ship design UI, the previous one (from months ago) was better, and until now there's no way to know how well your ship will do, when upgrading technology you actually downgrade the ship (another great idea from the devs!).- Idiotic just 4 ships design slots available.- Space battles are pure crap (sorry, but I can't describe it in another way).+ Overall performance is good (unless you start, load and exit a game, those takes ages).+ Some of the original spirit of the game is there, but devs keep ignoring gamers and how awesome the previous (1 and 2) games were.In conclusion:- Unfortunately for the devs, they chose 2  great games to update them (or to base their game), and ignored the things that made them great (maybe for the franchise's new gamers it'll be fine).- Save your money (this game isn't as MOO1 or MOO2, I had that hope but now it's all lost); if there's some 75% plus disscount then buy the game, until now the only great things that I've got from this is the digital artbook and the soundtrack.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So far so good! Until now the space battles system doesn't convince me so much, but the rest is very good, a wise combination of the old good things and modern gaming!Update 1: my saved game has disappeared! And there's no ""Continue"" option neither. When saving a game that was previously saved there's no way to select it, forcibly one has to write the name. Take notice devs.Update 2: The planetary invasion is somewhat basic and honestly I expected something else than watching numbers and random explosions, it's supposed to be infantry+mechs fighting on the surface of the planet! At least in the original MOO they had the animation of soldiers facing and exploding.Once the game totally crashed when loading the saved game.Another thing that's bugging me is the turn limit for a game, is it only for the EA version or it'll be like that forever?The ship design is somewhat not good, the devs can visually add the weapons bays for the player to decide where to place them, or some sort of real ship customization; though, the option to update the ships to a new model (when orbiting planets or battlestations) is awesome!And finally, when voting at the council meeting, you don't know how many votes you can place until after the voting is over (I voted for myself but didn't want to have that victory, only to later realize that my population was enough to decide the future of the galaxy...).

												I like this. I've been playing a lot of 4X, starting with MOO1 waaaay back. MOO2 and Alpha Centauri were my favorites, and I still play a game of Alpha Centauri every now and then, since it is such a stroke of genius.Anyway, this new MOO somehow just works for me. It copies a lot of things from MOO2, but that's not a bad thing. I don't know what the exact reason is, but MOO2 was always more FUN than other space 4X games. For me, at least. I have not played a whole lot yet, but so far it's been a very fun experience.Also, they didn't just copy the game, they made lots of little changes too. For instance, they switched to star lanes, which I like, because you can no longer just attack the inner planets of an empire, without going through the outer ring first.If you put too much population into one field, you get diminishing returns, which is a change I especially like. When you take all your nerdy researchers, give them a pickace and tell them to slave away at the new spaceport, it's not exactly efficient. :)One thing which they both kept and improved is the research system of MOO2. You still have to pick between technologies, which is probably why MOO2 was so awesome in the first place. In this game, there's a baseline of technologies you always get, which is a bit sad, but I guess also makes things easier to balance. Anyway, you still have to make lots of tricky decisions.On the technical side, I have not had any difficulties , but I've only played a few hours so far. Anyway, it ran for 6 hours without ever crashing, which is a plus. ^^I've only bought this game now because I read mixed reviews and was burned by MOO3, but now I bought it on a sale and am definitely not regretting it. P.S. The new Trilarians are awesome. Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn! :)			"

												This is the first MOO game that I have played. My initial thoughts of the game was it was pretty fun, but over time it has gotten a bit dule to be honest. I am a World of Tanks player and War Gaming has made that game the huge success that it is. This game is still pretty new and trying to revive an old game series and I am willing to put my faith into War Gaming and this game. Only time will tell how this game will work out, and I still find enjoyment in this game despite the rare occasion that it is just a bore. So with that being said, if you like games that are about space or building civilizations/empires id recommend this game for you.			"

												I played MoO 1, 2, and 3.  This version has the majority of MoO 1 & 2 with the Star lanes of MoO 3.  In MoO 1 & 2 you did not have star lanes but you could only go so far until you colonized a planet or got a better engine.  With MoO 3 and this new version of  MoO it might take 2 to 3 turns to get to the next system at the start and with new engines it can take one turn.  I like the game, the only down side of the game is in Huge Galaxy after about 600 turns it starts to slow down taking about 3 - 4 minutes per turn.  I had a few crashes and they were always fixed with the next update to the game and I had 2 or 3 crashes during the turn. On a 1 to 10, I give it an 8 because of slow turns and crashes.			"

												I've been playing Master of Orion games since the original came out in 1993.  Since then, I've always had a copy of MOO & MOO2 on every computer I've owned.  I still have the original manuals as well.    I, like almost everyone else, experienced the extreme disappointment that was MOO3.   So, I wasn't overly optimistic for a reboot.  That being said, I must say that overall I am pleasantly surprised by this game.  Yes, it does have some flaws which I'll get into later, but what struck me the most is that it feels like I'm playing Master of Orion.  You can tell the developers put a lot of love into this game and tried to recapture the magic of the originals, and I think they succeeded.  The iconic races are all there, and have their own unique flavor.  The soundtrack is a delightful remake of the original's.   And the technology tree contains the advancements we all know and love.Outside of that, they've also managed to improve the managementment aspects of the game without overly simplifying them.  Planet management is smooth and easy, the sitrep updates let you know what's going on, and my favorite aspect is the game will warn you if you have any outstanding actions to address or ships that need to be moved when you click the End Turn button.   It reminds me of the simplicity of MOO1 where you can just sit down and enjoy playing the game.  The game however, is not without some flaws.   It still has balance issues and bugs that need to be fixed by the development team.  The combat, while enjoyable to watch the first few times, quickly becomes repetitive - as you lack a lot of fine control on the 3d battle map.   Many die hard fans (myself included) had hoped NGD would include a turn-based tactical combat option, similar to the originals.  But alas, that was not the case.    Another complaint is that the game uses star lanes, where MOO1 & 2 did not.  This doesn't bother me as much as I like the idea of choke points. However, I wish they did include an option to turn them off and play without them for those that  want it to feel more like the originals.   Lack of race customization is another complaint I hear often about the game.   On the surface, you get similar customization to Master of Orion 2 where you're able to take any race in the game and tweak them as you see fit.    What you don't get is the ability to create an entirely new custom race.    This seems to be because each race is tied to its associated ship models.  Ideally, I'd like to see you be able to create a new race and choose the ship model family you'd like to use for it.   So, to sum up - I feel this is a fine successor to Master of Orion 1 & 2.   If you're looking for deep strategy and tons of options - check out a different game, like Stellaris.   But if you're looking to curl up with a relaxing game on a Sunday afternoon and just have a good time - I'd highly recommend this game.   Especially if you're a fan of the originals.After today's update I'm glad to see the developers haven't given up hope and are still working on fixing and improving this game.  I hope they continue to improve and add new (desirable) features to the game in the years to come.  With a bit of work and polish this game has the ability to (one day) become THE Master of Orion game. Thanks			"

												As a fan of the original Master of Orion 2, this game feels right in line with the play mechanics. Basically, it's that spot between the the foundations of Master of Orion 1 and the spreadsheet simulator Master of Orion 3. It fills the nostalgia fix for any old MoO 2 players out there.			"

												I was a fan of MOO2 back in the 90s, and of the 4X genre in general, and this game doesn't dissapoint.  Certainly a trip down memory lane with races, weapons, building, and research names pulled dutifully from the older title. So similar, in fact, that you will quickly find Espionage to be as much of a pain to defend against as in MOO2, and the Psilon creative trait still just as overpowered. While this new MOO does not have the depth/intricacies of a game like Stellaris, it is a polished and straightforward title that is easy to jump into and understand.Don't let the somewhat limited subset of available races turn you off- each one has unique ship types and voice acting that make it obvious why they didn't launch with all 13 original races. That said.. they'll probably be available as DLC in the future. "

												Overall a great 4x strategy game when not comparing to the previous editions of the series. There is a lot less micro-managing and many streamline autobuild/research/explore/fight options. Also, if you link your game to your wargaming.net account they will also give you Total Anniliation on Steam for free. Watch the following video of the tutorial to get an understanding of the streamlined style of play Master of Orion: Conquer the stars has.

												I have nominated this game for the “I THOUGHT THIS GAME WAS COOL BEFORE IT WON AN AWARD” award, and I think it should win, because graphically, it is amazing, mechanically, soo amazing, so much ability to customize and randomize, then using your species' traits, abilities, and hindrances try to make the galaxy yours, and I love the ability to choose what to set population units to do. Honestly this game is amazing and easily one of my favourite games and *Definetly* a game that you should check out if you're into long-term/grand strategy games.			"

I cannot fault this game, granted it would be fun to have more tech-trees and races, but thats the case with all turned based- but maybe I play games for too long and like them to be drawn out :D I highly recommend it!

												I wish there was a middle option where you don't recommend it but you don't hate it either as I feel this doe not fall into either yes or no.Original player of all the MOO games of old.I am not sure if I am looking at the old games via rose tinted glasses and unfairly judging this game or the fact I am comparing it to Stellaris which is a superb game.They have captured some great aspects of the original MOO, but feel they may have limited themselves on how to go with it, seems like a reskinned MOO2 but with the industry having moved on so far in terms of gaming and expectations I find it somewhat under my expectations, as said that may be a mix of looking back or judging against some other games but this IS now so needs to be judged as what it is.If this is on sale say £9.99 then grab it, quite a few hours of enjoyabilty, but if you are looking for some long hours I would honestly say, get Stellaris instead, it is the one to beat, at least for me.

												Loved this game. But I'd pay $15. A good space Civ game. Though, I had a ton of errors the later the game I got. Really the game comes alive late game with the unlocking of the ""Doom Star"". I love editing and crafting new ships and load outs, then taking them fighting in the tactical map. Only problem I found was kind of a game stopper. My long domination games would get buggy, which then casues my game not to take turns. I'd have to save the game, quit out, reload and then the turn would work. Over and Over and Over. I just quit playing after that.Will start playing again once that bug is flushed out.			"

												Master of Orion 4 brings back the feeling of the old Moo2 with a fresh look. I played Moo2 for years, the same will probably happen with Moo4.True, there could be more new stuff in the game (this game reminds a lot to the old Moo2). The fighting system could be better. But at least the Darloks are improved and there are new winning conditions, making the game even more flexible in terms of goals.Overall: 4/5 points, I like it, definetely worth the money if one likes 4x games. Sidenote: Probably the collectors edition is not worth it, though. Get the three extra fractions (Gnolams, Elerianer and Trilarians), that gives more for the money imho.			"

												This game is very fun.  I only paid $14.99 but I think its worth $29.00 because I know that I will get alot of replay on it and I have played most of the space games of its type and this is the best one.  Even though I have played games sense ultima online and before, I have never played any of the master of orions so I have no expections of some game that was made 30 years ago like alot of people do in the reviews.  Its like playing Civilation 5 exept in the future star trek envirorment with very cool space battles where you can build your own custom ships and send them to battle.  And it is good just how it is as of feb 27, 2017 and I hope they keep making it better.			"

Early Access Review
								The game looks nice, the interface is slick and its really fast - but it has no useful AI and there are just many big elements missing like tactical combat that is not just watching a boring movie. Judging by the announcements and videos and roadmap, it looks like they do not understand this yet. While saying AI is important etc, their roadmap suggests othersiwse. Looks like the just want to use the brand name of MOO, they do not actually want to make a challenging and deep game.In addition to not being challenging it feels really dull, you dont really make choices. You can colonize this or that planet, it does not really matter. You can have this or that design, it does not fell like it matters.Moo players stay away, you will be disappointed by the shallowness.Also many people are giving feedback, but they are not really engaging with the crowd.

												Update 3:  This review is updated after not playing the game in a lot of time and finding out that they've released it as a finished product.  In my opinion, wait to a very good rebate to buy this game; I originally bought it in early access at full price because I wanted to support the devs and I don't regret it, but if you want to invest your money in a good game, this one is not for you, beside all the flaws and things that I kept writing to the devs through all this time, now that they had released it for real I played it again to a great disappointment as it seems that all the feedback the gamers gave for months were ignored, beside the previous things I reported now there's another list (with things pointed out before):- No control over scouts and colony ships design (as in MOO1, 2).- No need to research technology to colonize extreme environments (that gave some advantages to different races in the game and gave more strategy to research, as in previous games).- Linear technology research with no different technologies for different races (again, that gave more strategy decisions and sense to spying technology from adversaries).- If player changes the production (no matter if it was a mistake) all the previous production is lost (say, you had 10 turns producing something, bam, lost, start from zero again).- No previously saved games list, if the user wants to overwrite a previous saved game it's necessary to write down the name again (don't use complicated save names!), if you don't overwrite you'll need some time to browse saved games and delete them if you don't want to pile up a lot of unnecessary files.- No way to change colony names.- Scouts and colony ships can't withdraw from battles when unescorted (idiotic game design).- Scroll zoom deficient, there's one point when you jump zooms.- Crappy ship design UI, the previous one (from months ago) was better, and until now there's no way to know how well your ship will do, when upgrading technology you actually downgrade the ship (another great idea from the devs!).- Idiotic just 4 ships design slots available.- Space battles are pure crap (sorry, but I can't describe it in another way).+ Overall performance is good (unless you start, load and exit a game, those takes ages).+ Some of the original spirit of the game is there, but devs keep ignoring gamers and how awesome the previous (1 and 2) games were.In conclusion:- Unfortunately for the devs, they chose 2  great games to update them (or to base their game), and ignored the things that made them great (maybe for the franchise's new gamers it'll be fine).- Save your money (this game isn't as MOO1 or MOO2, I had that hope but now it's all lost); if there's some 75% plus disscount then buy the game, until now the only great things that I've got from this is the digital artbook and the soundtrack.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So far so good! Until now the space battles system doesn't convince me so much, but the rest is very good, a wise combination of the old good things and modern gaming!Update 1: my saved game has disappeared! And there's no ""Continue"" option neither. When saving a game that was previously saved there's no way to select it, forcibly one has to write the name. Take notice devs.Update 2: The planetary invasion is somewhat basic and honestly I expected something else than watching numbers and random explosions, it's supposed to be infantry+mechs fighting on the surface of the planet! At least in the original MOO they had the animation of soldiers facing and exploding.Once the game totally crashed when loading the saved game.Another thing that's bugging me is the turn limit for a game, is it only for the EA version or it'll be like that forever?The ship design is somewhat not good, the devs can visually add the weapons bays for the player to decide where to place them, or some sort of real ship customization; though, the option to update the ships to a new model (when orbiting planets or battlestations) is awesome!And finally, when voting at the council meeting, you don't know how many votes you can place until after the voting is over (I voted for myself but didn't want to have that victory, only to later realize that my population was enough to decide the future of the galaxy...).

Early Access Review
								This is a review for anyone thinking about purchasing MOOcts early access.I have completed two play throughs of the game with the humans. Although there are some good points I can not recommened the game and its 50 dollar price tag in its current state.Things I liked-Looks nice (ships, planets, races)-Voice acting is well done-Music and SFX are good-UI is easy to navigateThings I don't like-Combat is too fast and boring. You can try slowing it down by using the pause option but really it's pointless. You can win almost every battle simply with numbers and let it auto play while you watch. Faster to just simulate battles than go through the cinematic tactical fighting.-Customizing ships is pointless you can easily win with the default set ups the AI chooses for you-AI currently isn't implemented so diplomacy plays no part in a game (other than extorting money from the weak)-Tech tree choices don't feel like they mean anything. I can easily get through a game just randomly picking.ConclusionDon't buy this game in early access. If it goes on sale maybe. I don't think it's worth more than $25 in its current state and that's only because it comes with MOO 1 and 2. It has potential I hope that the developers use the player's feed back to improve the battles and AI.***EA5 UPDATE***So I tried the EA% update and can still not recommend this game. First I'll have to say that the developers made some great changes that fixed many early version problems. For exampleImproved AI both in diplomacy and overall strategyShip designer finally in a good place (was pretty bad until around EA3 or 4)Custom race designer and galaxy generation paramaters greatly improvedThey put spies in EA 3 or 4 (can't remember exactly) and improved their functionality some what in EA5RTS battle UI improved and it's a bit easier to  control ships nowThese are some of the things that I thought were well done by the dev team. Having said that the following issues are simply holding this game back and will continue to do so in my opinion.Absolutely horrible UI camera during empire management. I can't stress enough how annoying it is when the camera moves and zoomes from one side of the galaxy to another to make sure you aware of some mundane event (congrats you just found a planet...ugh) and now you have to zoom back out, find where the camera was focused just so you can continue playing normally. This happens ALL THE TIME and is incredibly annoying.Planet management is absolutely boring. It's so boring in fact that they are planning on adding preset building queues to the game as a feature. Now some might say 'yay preset building queues!' but to me it's the same thing as admitting that there is a boring part of the game no one likes to do so we are finding a way to automate it. Now this happens with a lot of 4x games but it's especially bad in MOOcts. Some 4x games try and get around this by using a grid system for building placement and assigning values to each box in the grid so that there is at least a level of randomness and value in building on one box over the other. In MOOcts however its the old boring build queue that might as well be the same for every planet (again why they are making preset build queues). For sure this was a flaw of the original moo2 and should have been identified as an area where they could innovate.And the big one BATTLES. Lets face it 4x games are about big space battles. Everyone wants to  see their super badass fleet mass up against another empire's super badass fleet and PEWPEW till there is a clear winner. And although there can be big space battles in MOOcts they just aren't fun. You would think an RTS style battle system would guarantee awesome big fleet battles but nope. Most of the time you just end up sitting watching it happen like a little movie. Sure there are tactics to use and ways to move ships around but it's nothing like the strategy someone would use in a game like starcraft for example. The system lacks the feeling of speed and split second decision making that will make or break the battle found in traditional RTS and at the same time has managed to simulate the boring sit back and watch as things happen found in turn based combat.  I can't stress enough how boring battles are in this game. It's a killer failure imo.Again I very much appreciate the work put into this game. The graphics are nice, sound is excellent, atmosphere is very MOO style but the game is just dull to play. Why pay 50+ dollars to play a mediocre 4x game when there are so many out there that are doing everything this game offers but better and for less money.			"

												So, I really want to like this game.  However, the AI makes it almost impossible to do so.  You can spend the entire time making friends with the AI just to have them declare war on you for no reason.  I've had it happen in two different games now since the game was officially released.  This has been a problem since early access and still hasn't been fixed.I absolutely hate the two robots giving their news update.  They are extremely annoying.  If you're unlucky enough, you could see them every other turn.There are better 4X offerings out there.  Spend your money on one of those.			"

								Terribly disappointing game play. Excellent voice acting.It's pretty and at the start and it can be entertaining, I had to bump up the difficulty just to get some kind of enjoyment out of it.  The feature I kept waiting for was espionage, this felt like was an after thought and rushed out. In my opion it is pointless to even bother with. After a 100 turns on a large or huge map you more than likely are set to win the game and it is just relagated to mopping up planets.There are events in the game, while entertaining as a story, has little impact on game play. I beleive it was meant to break the monotiny that you find yourself in at the later stages of the game.			"

								Nice graphics update, I like the idea of having ""blueprints"" to update our fleets.  I think the scroll for the galaxy screen is to limited and I don't like star-lanes.  I think linear progression is a lot more fun.  When you plan an attack or defense you don't have to do it through a space maze.  Whats really frustrating is the star-lanes are randomly generated so getting to a system right next to yours could force you to go through a back way up and around 2 other systems to get to your closest neighboring star-system!  Most other facets of the game our good however:)			"

As soon as you start the game your mose moves forwad constantly into the right hand corrner only stopping when you agressivly handle the mouse then it starts up again. You can't mouse over anything click on anything. It's constantly moving the mouse to fast to be able to click. This was not like this when I played the first time. I can't even go through the menues to try and fix the mouse. My mouse does not act like this with any other application or game.			"

												This game is way better than the old edition you use to play in the 90s. It has a well detailed tech menu as well as many many different races. You can be challenged with a different race every day and not be poured or mix-and-match. It will take you half a lifetime to master this game.you will not be disappointed when you start this game up with the awesome intense detailed graphics of the quirky, cool, hilarious, unbelievable aliens in the game, some good and neutral. Some just hang around till trouble starts and some are just outright horrible and will murder you and your crew in a heartbeat. if you liked any of the previous versions of this game. This game is an eye-opener. If you are new to this game, you are gonna love it because if they did not let me down. They certainly have not even showed you the capabilities that this group can create. They are an awesome bunch and develop awesome games. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed.Chris in Orefield			"

												This is a very fun 4X game with a bright personality, beautiful graphics, and in my opinion smart design decisions. I do feel like it was a mistake calling this game Master of Orion however. It shares many similarities with its predecessors and I feel it's fitting to say it is a game in the Master of Orion series. The problem with calling it Master of Orion however is that long time fans and veterans will expect almost an exact copy of Master of Orion 2. These two games a very different and objectively I would say that this game is better overall. Of course nostalgia plays a factor and people may be frustrated to discover that this game is different and not realize that many of these changes are for the better.I could go on and on about various specific parts of the game but pretty much anything I could talk about fits into what I have said above. Tl;Dr: The game is very well made by a developer that cares what people think. Long time fans expecting a very close copy of Master of Orion 2 won't find that. Instead they will find a new and exciting game that is heavily inspired by the games before it. It is a fun 4X title and earns my recommendation.			"

												This game is almost as good as master of Orion 2, which was apart from the bad grafik a perfect 4K game. So now to the ""But"": 1: The taktikal gameplay was made to realtime with pause. Verry unfortunate as you lose the controll of a big aspect of what made MOO2 so great, it could or let me say should have been done like in Knight of the old Repuplik, were the pause could actually been used for taktikal desisions and futeur movements.2: Making an Custom Race should have more perks to pick from and some of the MOO2 perks are missing and to save this custom race for later would be nice as well.

												This game is a remake of Master of Orion 2. As such, it's a good game. Graphics and sound are updated to today's standards. Gameplay is almost exactly the same, except with some  minor tweaks. It is not a grand strategy game or a game that has deeply tactical combat. If you liked MOO2, you'll like this.EDIT: After putting in about 30 hours I can say that this is a good game, but still missing some elements from previous games in the series, such as Leaders, animated ground battles (and stats), etc. I expect the devs will put out updates to correct this, as the game has alot more potential.Also, as I've often seen, people come in and bash a game while touting another. I have to wonder if they're working for the companies that put out the other games. For example, I've played Stellaris, and it is also a good game, but the flavor is different. To compare the two dirrectly without going into a long discussion on the pros and cons of each style is at best a diservice to both games and at worst useless propoganda.			"

												Master of Orion 1 and 2 in a different shell. Nothing has really changed gameplay wise, I was able get right into it with no hassel. The only difference I notice is that the technology tree has been changed so it's taken some getting used to. Also a shame that the Antarans didn't make it nor the hero hiree system, as well as ship raiding/boarding.If they could add those things it would be great.  "

												As a hardcore Master of Orion I & II fan, I was highly anticipating this modern version. That being said, having experienced the disappointment of Master of Orion III (and I know the game has its fans, I'm not one of them), and having experienced many disappointments of poorly redone classics, I was also majorly cautious. I decided to get the ""Early Access"" version after trying it out so that I could follow its development. The Early Access versions were certainly fun, but their flaws were also apparent, which made me concerned about the actual release.Now that I've played the release version, I can say that they've managed to quell my concerns. Once I learned some of the mechanics of this version of MOO (mostly deciding how to prioritize using the colonists to properly research/farm/build), I found a much greater appreciation of the game. I'm in the process of figuring out what weapons work best on my ships, as well as how to deal with being bullied by the Silicoids. After doing some reloading, I blew up their fleet that was surrounding one of my planets. Very rewarding, while I also learned the tactics so that I won't have to reload in future playthroughs.My biggest complaint is the lack of turn-based space combat. I *loved* that mechanic in the original Master of Orion, so I greatly miss it. I also feel like they needed to be clearer about some of the effects within the game. For instance, they don't fully give the details behind the properties of the different biomes (for instance, the food production per cell or the different cell availability. It was much more readable to look it up on the MOO Wiki). So there are other concerns that have popped up, and I'm curious to see how the AI will stand up to the test of time.Overall, I'm enjoying the game in the same way I did with MOO I & II. This is not to say that I think the game has lived up to those versions yet. I do need more time with the game before fully comparing it. However, I can say that I'm really enjoying the process of learning & growing.			"

Early Access Review
								---------------------------Original ""review"":As others have said ""This game is unworthy of Master of Orion name"". The game is shallow.---------------------------(I was too annoyed and my expectations where perhaps too high when I left my first review row.The game have some fealing of master of orion... missing the soul though)I compare this to Endless Space and Galactic Civilizations 3 as I still at times play this games.But as this is Master of Orion I expected it to give it al that I remeber from my countless of hours with Master of Orion 2 and given some improvements, or so I hoped.When only given the choise to recommend or not, I can't recommend it. There are better alternatives now. -- But by not recommending it I am not saying that the game is bad!, it's ok. --spacelanes, bad ""tactical combat"", no leaders, no ground combat animations. Stuff just seams somewhat dumbed down too.It's just not enough for me to recommend it.Another note is that I have not been successful in started Master of Orion 1-2 that came with this bundle, but I gues with more reaserch I could make it work.I will try this game again when more content is added. (There was some missing parts in the Early access)			"

												I will keep it short: good reboot of the original MOO2. The game is very polished and enjoyable. Devs payed attention to some must-have (for me at least) details like: GNN, new colony animation, random events, easy to understand command queue.I have played many 4X games after MOO2 and I couldn't find one that I really enjoyed. The only exceptions are Endless Legend (not Endless Space) and now Master of Orion (the reboot).Pros: polished, rich animations, intuitive UI, devs obviously were fans of the originalCons: battles are not meant to be manually controlled. If you accept this you will save yourself a lot of grief.			"

												Master of Orion isn't innovative to the genre of Space 4X like it used to be.... But... if you've played all the other Space 4Xs like I have and your lust for galactic genocide still isn't sated, Master of Orion will give you some very happy moments!The gameplay is exactly like other turn based 4Xs; expand, manage, bide your time and plot your enemies demise. Pros: - I've never found a space 4X that you can conveinently terraform gas giants into usable planets with worker units. - Those same workers, Space Factories they are called, can construct planets out of asteroids. That is just cool as hell! - The voice acting and diplomacy screens are beautiful! Top drawer!(yet, the biggest pro and the reason to buy the game is one thing I've never seen in a Space 4X before, something I've craved for so long.....)- YOU CAN DESTROY ♥♥♥♥ING PLANETS WITH YOUR OWN DEATH STAR! Ah hem! I mean ""Doom Star"". It's very late tech tree but oh man is it satisfying. Suddenly the colony ships I had following my armada weren't even going to be used.... I made the Jedi weeep as I literally shattered the remaining planets my enemies held. Cons:-The AI to autobuild in your dozens of colonies is terrible. It kept pushing me into a deficit on the imperial level! It was unusable until the endgame as a race that doesn't use food when the autobuild decided to build each farming upgrade.-The main starmap looks terrible. I couldn't imagine a way to make it look more childish and generic. Overall, I would recommmend you get this one if you like fantasty galactic geneocide as much as I do!			"

												8/10As a casual gamer who often play 4x genre, I love this game and GalCiv3. Here's what I think.Pros- nice graphic, UI have modern designs- Space maps looks lively, you always see many things happen on the screen (Endless Space's maps feels like a spreadsheet, that's why I never like the game although people praise it a lot) - Real-time combat like Total War!- AI opponents often communicate with player, they're not quiet like AI in Endless Legend- Pirate faction and monster, so you have something to fight in early game- quite complex game mechanics- espionage system- managing planets is more fun than GalCiv 3- fair amount of random events (still less than GalCiv3)- Easy too keep track of ship updates- The Dev even put their effort on unimportant aspects like Space News, Council voting scenes, Planets colonizing animations. This make me trust them more, because if someone spend their time to make minor detail more interesting, it mean that they dedicate to their game a lot.Cons- player cannot create custom ship appearances like GalCiv3 (But you can choose alternate ship models, however there are only few of them)-  ship cannot travel freely in space because star lanes mechanics  (but it doesn't make the space maps look boring like Endless Space, so I'm fine with it)- there's no way to remove grid lines on background in tactical combat views ( http://imgur.com/a/2FZKY ), I want my space fight to look more cinematic could you add an option to turn it off?- the game should take more advantage of pirate and Monster, I want to see them become more threatening (like pirate era in Distant World: Universe)- still need more random events- Terran race dlc is expensive because they are included in Collector Edition. Can't we have a cheaper way to get a race that have a hot chick as an advisor!?- ship models in main maps looks very ugly and have little details, GalCiv3 did a better job on this aspect.- no option for adjusting map panning speed, edge scrolling spped			"

												This is a great game. It is also a different game to MOO2, albeit inspired by it. If you want MOO2, play MOO2.To me it feels like Stellaris for people with social lives: it's not as deep and a bit more light hearted. Although the strategic side of things is by no means neglected.A couple of things irritate me: there could be a bit more lore to all of it and the default score based victory condition is annoying. I like to beef up to the hilt before attempting a victory. Luckily you can turn the score victory condition off, when setting up a new game.			"

								I got gifted this game (by a friend) as I am a diehard Moo2 player.  Still fire Moo2 up today from time to time.I can't say I'm all that impressed with this new MOO.  Awful (not funny) advisors, starlanes (wtf), awful tactical combat, awful GNN broadcasts, boring pollution mechanics... I could go on and on.I seem to be able to win every single game I play by finding the AI early, boxing them into their home system by blockading the star lanes and colonising everything else I can get my hands on until the unstable star lanes tech.  By that time my fleet is so vast it's like a roflstomp after that point.  There is literally no point in communicating with the AI at all.Why on earth did the developers grab the licence for this if they were going to completely ignore what made the original (2) games great?  I can't help but think that they thought that Moo3 was the highlight of the series.Stellaris is going to murder this game, set fire to its corpse and bury it forever.			"

Early Access Review
								Problems that I found out pretty early which made the single player experience pretty bad for me:-You always have to produce something at a planet. No options for passive choices like production boost, income boost or anything (you have the ability to rid your planet from pollution, but once your planet is clean again, forces you to build). The game doesnt let you end your turn as long as you have an idle planet. This is a pretty big deal because every building and ship has maintenance cost, so constantly building them can make it pretty hard to save up money. UPDATE: Later in the game you can actually get a passive income boost on planets but you have to complete 2 research options in order to do that which is just plain stupid.-Diplomacy is not finished. (or if it is, its flawed to the core) When ever the computer proposes something to you, you either accept it, or not, you cant send a counter offer. Now this might not sound much, BUT every proposal you refuse hurts their little feelings and potentially makes them hostile towards you, and when they offer like a hundred something credits(when you have like 1000) for a pretty expensive tech you have over and over, well lets just say you better forget the whole inner peace in this galaxy.-Unlike previous titles of the series, the battles are in real time, which is kinda bad, but thankfull you can pause and issue orders to your ships.-Now, the ship customization is actually pretty good, its a bit buggy right now, since you cant remove core systems you dont want to have on a ship like shields once they are on. (when you select create new ship, the game automatically gives a sample ship fitted to the max, and yes usually including shields too) So its pretty hard to create glass cannon like ships at the moment.-One major intented option I encounterd and basically where I dropped the game, is that when you delete a ship design, and you already have ships built with that design, those ships disappear(get scrapped) from the map....yup....I loved it when my attacking fleet just disappeared when it was one jump away from the enemy capital planet.-One funny fact, is that there is an option to turn the whole GNN news cast thing off. Now this made me think why did they create it like that in the first place? But thank god for that option because those droids get really annoying really fast.-I tried to play a multiplayer game, but when the room fileld with people,  just closed right after that, now I'm not sure it that was the host or not, but seemed pretty stupid to get a room full of people and just close the whole thing.-Now I saw a lot of people compare it to endless space, well, I can see where they are coming from, but I personally prefer the style of this game over ESs. Its not as deep(not nearly as complicated) but still enough to have enough to keep you playing. Also ESs space combat is just a huge no to me.Ok I'm done not gonna write a novel, but I still managed to list most of the major problems with the game that to me, just makes it unplayable for the time being. Now its still in early access. If they fix all the things I mentioned above, the game can be pretty fun. The voice actors are indeed top notch. Alan Tudyk is pretty funny, makes the psilons really fun to play. Human and the kitty advisors are less stellar, but still ok, but omg Dwight Schultz gets annoying pretty fast, which makes me pretty sad because I really like him, also the dinos assistant is I think probably even more annoying.

Early Access Review
Master of Orion is the beinning of a great space themed 4X and I enjoy playing it, but I wouldn't recommend any Early Access game, hence the negative review.This is a list of things that are either missing in this build (as of writing) or not working, etc. but one way or another these things hold the game back from being released.UPDATE: Im going to try and keep this up to date and Strike Out anything i feel has been addressed in updates to the game and you will see this notes for updates.Battlefields have nothing in them except a few asteroids that will block a few shots before being destroyed. They need events, more objects, special effects, etc. (UPDATE: They added Nebulas which stop shields but I dont personally think thats enough to spice battles up)Ship designs are bland. You have your standards such as shields, direct fire weapons, missiles, etc. but no variety in those and this comes down also to the tech tree and the fact that you seem to only unlock better versions of the same effect items. Theres no shields that are more effective against ballistic weapons etc..The game doesnt support SLI.You can't subjugate empires.Pirates respawn in the same system several turns after being completely wiped out there.Ship weapons fire in massive volleys which makes it look like duisgusting clumps of glow / smoke effects and makes combat shorter, ships dying instantly to volleys. On the same point there are no area effect point defense systems to counter a large missile barrage.Races are too similar. They have some minor traits bonuses but nothing to have them stand apart from each other such as unique technology, unique mechanics such as being synthetic and not requiring food (they still require food) or anything realy to seperate them aside from their 6 ships looking different.You can't select individual ships. If you have a large fleet the game will start forming squads using your ships which is handy but you cant micro manage them in that state which is another reason the combat is lacking.You can't set the range settings in the design of the ship.There is no political penalty for destroying planets or repeatedly waging war on none aggressive enemies.Every other empire could be afraid of you and have a low rating of you but you wont see them teaming up to destroy you out of free or retaliation which weakens deplomacy.AI can become rediculously stubborn in diplomacy, refusing to concede to your demands when you offer them peace while they have one planet left and no fleets.Diplomacy lacks depth. I touch on specific aspects of it in this review but in general theres not many ways to use it to manipulate an empire.There is no prompt to attack invaders (only a notice about nearby enemy fleets that comes up much to regularly to pay attention to) and theres also no prompt to act with a unit that has completed its movement during the post turn movement phase (eg you send a fleet to an enemy planet but it doesnt prompt you to attack with them when they get there you get a notice that they have nothing to do the turn after).Theres no allied victory or allied vision.You can't see the details of an enemy or allied planet so you dont know whats built there or what you've destroyed during a bombardment etc.. (UPDATE: This has changed with the introduction of Spies who let you reveal this information but the information should be visible if you have a fleet in orbit let alone a blockade)The research tree is very narrow it makes it hard to get to technology you want when you need to get more and more branches completed the higher up you go, which isnt that high either.The Dauntless Guidance System re-targets enemies based off the ships position not the missiles (It makes missiles reaquire targets if their target is destroyed). Also on the topic of the DGS the missiles turn 180 degrees instantly and seem to have unlimited range after being fired initially.Tanks don't seem to work against marine invasions (I could be mistaken but there is so little information that the game gives you about invasions its hard to tell).Treaties must be shared. You cannot bribe an empire into declaring war on a 3rd party or request access to their territory while keeping your own secure.The map does not give you much information on what kind of ships are where and whats going on.Health bars use green pips inside black borders that do not shrink as you zoom out they just start to overlap so you end up with unreadable health bars when zoomed out far enough.Animations and effects are broken or missing in certain areas such as holograms on the deplomacy screen resetting to their generic pose and the game lacks a lot of animations like for monsters or ship destruction, events in the galaxy like colonizing a planet.Ships are weak with the highest size ships dying to a few volleys from a moderate group of much smaller enemy ships in fights that use high tech weapons.Weapons are unballanced which makes a lot of them redundant as well as contributing to other issues.There is a distinct lack of information that the game gives you. A huge number of tooltips are either missing or have placeholder text and the UI in certain situations just doesnt show you whats going on such as two enemy fleets fighting, you wont see any info untill one of them is completely destroyed.The maps are too small. Eight civilizations on a map so small that you have other civ's homeworlds two systems away.The Meklars research page (specifically the initial one with the advisor) has a huge graphical demand in comparison with the other areas of the game.Equipment for ships needs to be sorted. (UPDATE: Its sorted now but not very well)You can't customize certain things such as event frequency or number of pirates / monsters, etc..You're able to destroy a planet as soon as you arrive at it, so you dont even need to destroy the defending fleet or space station etc..Ship AI is not only sub-par but broken, with destroyers flying right past stations without correcting their facing for front firing weapons.Hopefully they iron out the game before release because its the beginnings of a great space 4X.

								Master of Orion has the chances to eventually become a good game, but it is currently useless on Macs: e.g. it can freeze your laptop every time you view a particular planet in a way that you have to reboot the system. It's also relatively slow when it comes to loading times and FPS could bea lot more impressive.The concept and the idea to revive the legendary game is great though. It's a shame poor engineering makes Master of Orion unplayable. I hope the bugs will be fixed and the performance improved before the final release.  "

								I really like this game up until patches 46.4.X. This is when the game began to crash for me regularly, as in every 20 minutes or less. Before if I was playing a hugh game and was in it all days it might crash and I could understand that to a point. But now all the fun is gone as I have to contiunely redo truns as it blows up so fequently. All I got from support was don't run Defrag, yeah let I would and check the game cache.As I stated before I have been playing this game for some time, and yes I checked the game cache after the first support ticket. Since then I have also tried running the game on 2 other computer with the same results.After all this I think this game is not worth anyones time as they have not even made and effort to discuss or fix for sometime.

												I'll first say if I could give this game a mixed review I would at least until a few things are presumably cleaned up in patches or expansions.The reboot of MOO is very streamlined mostly to good effect but in some cases detriment.Pluses:starlanes create tactical options.Don't have to micromanage ships and to a lesser extent planets most of the time.For the most part game just gets you to the fun.Artwork is good.The races have fun puns in their dialogue.NegativesRaces and replays have no personality and little difference between them.Lots of ""bugs"" where you can kill each others ships without war, races that are good friends will declare war without warning, redundant items exist in the race creator, and other minor things.Music is repetativeThe game is fun for fans of the genre, however I can't help but feel underwhelmed by combat, diplomacy, and the overall game.  Consider this a tepid yes for fans but no for everyone else. With the $40 price tag I wish I could pay another $20 and get a more complete feeling game.			"

WHY real time??   Ship design is almost obsolete or doesn't pay off fun wise so to say..The rest of the game feels fine and ok..   just travel distance mechanics are not there??? Anyways, i hope there will be a way to implement turn base combat somehow!!!I'd like to have a story mode for singleplayer with mysteries to discover and please no funny psilons!!, seriously why is their voice and appearance try so hard to make them funny ??  id really doesn't add to my immersion while playing a Star Lord final word: just not happy yetcheers o/			"

								So months later anda few more Early acess updates and not much better.  Polishis nicer but the game play the rts is so offensive and clunky its just as if the devlopers are spittign directly inthe eyes of the fans and goign  ha ha. its vexes me because iloved the orginals so much and this game ahas so much right  itslike gettinga lovel gourmet meal witha big stringing turd right in the center.  you cant just eat around the turd it totally ruins the exsperience. I inall honest really feel that stronlgy iam regrettign paying money for this game by ths point becaue the combat is so lousy so please gamers friends of mine  do not feed the trolls dont give this game money. Dont be fooled by the polish and slick grpahics and lovely voice acting under all that polish is an Ai thats brutal even on the most easy settings. While the music is great it feels to soft and gentle for say combat scenarios. The Ai players are difficult to work with and suddenly allies  staret attacking you out of the blue for no appearnt reason  even if your keeping your diplomancy up. The game relies on toomuchmincromanagment andits hard to get to the fun techs and actually be able to use them. and above all else ther tactical combat is stupid. Its really clunky and hard to work with.Please guys most of this other stuff is easily forgiven but please fix the ai so its playable and please make that ugly awful tactical combat away and give us back out nice fun turnbased combay jsut give us more polish on that  otherwise theonly way yo play is withauto combat and if your goingto do that you might as well given us galatic civiizations.I am tough on thiis game even if its early acess because Moo2 had sucha big place in my heart. Alos please get rid of the  stock exchange crap its adding to that micromangment clunky feel of this game.			"

								The AI is awful, like unforgivably bad. It's a shame because the design on the whole seems decent to me and I am a MOO devotee (been playing MOO and MOO2 for around 20 years). It's definitely rough the edges and that's fine, it's early access, I have some faith that they will address many of the issues that other reviewers have noted (lack of diversity in the races' play-styles being my biggest other concern). I have real concerns about the AI though, it's so bad I'm not sure it can be fixed, I hope I'm proved wrong and I'll certainly update this review if I am.			"

								As a huge fan of 4X strategy games and a big fan of MOO2, I was excited for this reboot.  Unfortunately, I just put in my refund request.  I hope this is a good game in the future, but as it stands, this is a very shiny package (graphics, cutscenes, and voice acting) with very little underneath the hood.  The strategic depth just isn't there, and so I can't recommend that you spend $50 on this title unless you're (1) a diehard fan; and (2) have faith that the developers will eventually produce a complete product.

								Early access is almost over and the game has not been improved in the area that matters the most. The tactical combat is not fun and is in real time.  You have little control and very little idea of why you won or lost. Ship design will lock up your computer sometimes.  Your enemies will fly unarmed ships on top of your war fleet over and over again. Because the developers believe they know alot more than the people who made Moo2, they have been changing the things that made Moo2 fun for me and now it resembles a real time strategy game with bugs. The game is not horrible it just is not as fun as Moo2 and it is 20 years old.  Hopefully they will do a 180 turn and things will get better.			"

Early Access Review
								*Edited for EA7, Aug 18. Release expected Aug 25.*This game is not finished by a long shot. However, it looks done and that has convinced the higher-ups to stop bleeding money and release an unfinished project. I don't recommend purchasing the game unless it's on sale or after the first one or two patches are released.Overall, it's a shiny tablet version of MoO, dumbed down but full of tedious micromangement.Pros-Excellent audio and visuals.Real Time combat & Squads provide a fix for the old combat failures (but bring their own issues to light).Game feels like the old ones, but is very different at the same time. In a good way.Ship design is confusing but once you figure it out it works nicely.Cons-Combat still has things to work out, most important is a lack of information and the lack of difference between beam weapons.AI is pathetically weak or extremely aggressive. Mixed reports. AI has come a long way since EA1. Almost there.Diplomacy *still* feels useless.Random events are lacking.Antarens? Plot? Orion system discovery?Custom races are weak and held back by the developers intentionally.Spying...*everything**Edit*  The lead dev has a vision that doesn't coexist with the majority of long time MoO fans. In my opinion, he is the reason this game feels like a tablet version with shiny graphics and voices.Audio-I love the audio except in combat.- Combat - I think I heard some lasers. Can we have different audio files for different weapons please? That would significantly add to customizeability and replayability. It gets old hearing the same weapon audio a few thousand times. Engines and specials could have their own audio too.Visuals- Everything looks fancy.- Then you see the same buildings on the same planets and all of a sudden you've got 30+ gaia planets with the same exact layout.  This is not important, but would be nice.- Ships - PLEASE add many many many more ship designs. I love Psilons but why do I have flying saucers with purple paint or crop circles? That's ridiculous and is an immense turn-off. If I'm going to get 3D real time battles, I sure as♥♥♥♥♥♥want more than two ship designs to look at. Especially if I have a long range ship and a short range ship that look the same.- Battlefields are terrible. Some nebulae gas clouds and some asteroids on a blank canvas. Cinematic view or bust.UI- If you've played MoO2 and other 4x space-strategy games, you're familiar with this UI.- Combat UI - Come a long way since EA1 but would still like actual tooltips or detailed information. Works well enough however and once you figure it out it's nice.- Ship Upgrade UI - *almost* there. Again, come leaps and bounds since the beginning. A few minor kinks to work out but for the most part works very nice.Combat- The AI thinks ""run in and shoot"" is intelligent. As such, creating specialized roles or a diverse fleet is useless if you don't manually fight every battle. A cruiser with nothing but missiles and torpedoes should not be rushing off to the front lines. Battleships with displacement devices should actually use them instead of lumbering along while everyone else dies in agony in the midst of the fray.- Pew pew, shoot the asteroids! Ohnoes, they shot the asteroid I ran into three times! Pathing AI could be more intelligent.- Ships refuse to keep their minimum engagement distance, so you end up with a cluster♥♥♥♥.- Invading is rather pointlessResearch- Tech tree is great....but feels like Civ VDiplomacy- I'm not sure the devs will figure out how to make a properly working diplomacy AI before release. Maybe after.Random Events- Few and far between. Please add more, and add a failsafe so that I don't get three or four negatives in a row while no one else gets anything.- Sometimes really cool. Sometimes your planets get ♥♥♥♥ed over. I like it.Specials/Monsters- Oh look, a monster. Well, they're probably not even guarding anything worthwhile anyway. Let's just ignore them till mid-game when I can slaughter them.- Why the F did you nerf Orions Guardian? Such a terrible idea, especially in EA7.- Planet specials are...almost useless.- Anomalies are cool and a nice addition, but add more of them.Antarens- ...wait, there aren't any?Orion- I love getting all four techs, this is a wonderful change. BUT YOU NERFED THE CRAP OUT OF IT SO WHO CARES. Not even worth the effort for one decent planet in the entire system.AI- Where's the backstabbing? The aggressive expansion? Underhanded cheap tricks (otherwise known as common sense to the AI)?  *There it is, finally showed up* Now fix it so we don't get mercilessly slaughtered immediately upon discovering a species.- The AI is capable of doing well on it's own, but makes few decisions in terms of other players. As it is now, the AI won't attack me while my forces are on the other side of my empire just because...well I don't know why.- AI needs to be significantly more aggressive in each races' respective ideology. I.E. expansionists need to expand instead of twiddle their thumbs because they were blocked in on one side. Humans should be diplomatic monstrosities and making treaties/friends/etc....I ran out of room!!			"

												I love it. It is just like playing the original Orion, with a few changes here and there to update it. The original races are there, with a promise of more to come, but I do wish one could customize a race like Orion 2. Seeing this is an early release, there are surprisingly few issues with it, A few things that need work is that I've not been able to terraform a volcanic planet yet, I hope this comes in future updates. Also, the Guardian is too weak, I beat it with just 4 battleships, losing only one. The guardian should be a lot more powerful. Another thing that would add to the game (and be true to the original if I remember correctly, if that wasn't MoO2) is that once you grow more powerful Orion may launch surprise attacks at any race unbalancing the universe too much. But I really miss the turn-based combats, I hope they will be next to be included.As of the latest update, if you choose a larger planet than normal you get the gravity penalty to all production, halving food, production and science. The penalty is too big to compensate for the late game profit of having a large or huge planet. This is reason enough to change the rating from positive to negative, since the starting planet (even by biologial reasoning) should always be considered normal gravity, with no exceptions; after all that is the gravity the race you choose is used to.Another update is that custom races are available, but cannot be saved, still a miss from the developers. And finally, older games cannot be replayed or continued, so there's no backward compatibility between game versions.With the laterst updates I'm starting to question de competence of the game designers, and whether they should be replaced... after all the last updates made the game so much worse that the rating changed from positive to negative, and I'm considering a refund. In any case, I will change my review on other sites to ""do not buy"" now.After going commercial there are some improvements, however, the perks ""huge starting planet"" and ""heavy gravity"" still need to be merged. This is a very stupid thought that these are separate, I cannot think of one reason a race with a huge home world would have a grvity penalty; huge world=high gravity, no discussion possible, so that still needs fixing. Whomever had these two separated should be fired for an utter lack of intelligence and understanding of physics. There are a lot of better ways to fix that imbvalance that causes, and it is more efficient as well, just contact me for details (and credits of course)Then there is another issue, which is actually a big fail on the side of the devs: if defending your planets, all ships should have a possibility to place, at any point on the map. No auto-placement, but ANY point. After all, yau are defending, and can deploy forces wherever you see fit. Especially with Antaran attacks, you have 5 turns warning, so REMOVE the FCKN aout-placement, and allow full tactical deployment of ships on the map. This is evidence of hiding poor AI programming, and that the devs are essentially incompetent to provide proper AI.Later updates of the game have corrected the gravity issue, however it is now most useful to start with a low gravity small homeworld with a 50% production boost and more points wherever you need. These devs seem to utterly fail to grasp the concept of balance, even in a relatively simple game like this, and I am sorry to say my negative review remains negative. What I fail to grasp is that a (presumably) intelligent team can come up with this type of poor balance of the game. Perhaps they should fire some game designers and hire some from Blizzard. At least they get balance a lot better done than these clowns. And I HATE clowns.			"

												This game feels like they ran out of money half way through their admittedly interesting vision. The lore is fantastic, I only wish the gameplay was too. It starts well, but is simply too basic abd doesn't evolve into something more. The intrusive DLC deployment path chosen is also a problem.I want to like this game. But I can't recommend until it has more content and is richer in gameplay. I'd get it in a year or two.			"

								Lets keep this simple. DONT BUY ITBoring, as if they made it for children and not for the adults who actually grow up with these games. game play gets old real quick, ai wont attack you if you are stronger then them. no real stratergy to the game just keep pressing next till you get bored and turn off the game. The characters are♥♥♥♥♥♥ i mean really really♥♥♥♥♥♥which is sad as the only thing i liked about number 3 which i wished they kept was the stories and look of the huge number of random playable races. ( worst thing about the races are the voices they gave for each one. so childish, such a waste)You will spend most of your time taking planets and systems with out contest ( which is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥as to how slow your fleet moves and how it now must move in a grid formation ) The ai does worn you too back off every now and then and will offen ask for money to keep the peace no matter what your ties with them are.

								The game looks nice and is mostly stable, but still needs a lot of work.  The User interface is clunky and missing a lot of features to make gameplay efficient.  The AI is not very well developed at this point.  I would hold off on purchase until after the Early Access phases are over and what the general reviews of the finished game are like.I'll come back and revise my review after Early Access is complete, if the game significantly improves by then.EDIT: after a month you can see from my ""how helpful"" review score how diametrically opposed the game's followers are.  To re-iterate, you are better off just waiting for the release, perhaps instead watch the youtube videos of game play to see if this is a good game for you or not.    I suspect casual strategy gamers may like this game and play it a few times.   For more hardcore 4X gamers this game will probably be too simple and very easy to beat the AI, based on players' feedback from the hardest difficulty settings.  Based on that assessment one certainly doesn't want to pay full price for this game.As of the EA 2 release the AI still has issues.EDIT:  Updated for EA 5.  I still find the game very annoying to play.  The zooming around on the galaxy map is inconsistent and difficult to control.  I don't like the inconsistencies in their Racial Traits overhaul.  For whatever reason they made the Alkari inherit traits that the Mrrshan used to have (bonus for attacks), and give no explanation why.  Maybe mod-makers can fix this game once NGD Studios has taken their hands off of it.EDIT:  At this point I'm done: I don't believe these developers will ever get the game to a state where I will enjoy it.  I arrived at this conclusion after reading all the explanations from the developers about the various changes they made for EA 5 for colonization and custom races and for tactical combat. Their decisions with each EA phase are erratic and don't show any sound methodology to their designs.Also their QA is atrocious for each phases' new features and redesigns they arbitrarily come up with.  The game is a nice-looking mess and it's a shame Wargaming got their hands on this IP to begin with.			"

Early Access Review
								I will get the things I don't like out of the way first:1) The landing cut scenes are crap. The ship is way off in the distance and yet it is shown as if they are flying in front of the trees that are right in front of the camera (from your point of view). I am not a game programer by any means, but this is just lazy and shows either that they don't have much in the way of quality control or just have not gotten around to fixing it yet (I hope it is the later). 2) Landing scenes part 2: No ship sounds...just music. I hope this gets changed. I have tried turning down the music, but the ships just float down without sound. Also, when the ships get ready to land...no landing struts? The scene just cuts out (and some of the designs don't look like the will land too well...with parts that will be buried deep into the ground and cause the ship to crash!)3) The Psilon AI (helper) voice is the MOST annoying voice in the game. No way to shut off the AI helper yet. Please get rid of the Psilon AI voice or change it's tone. Too shrill (IMO).4) Sol, the home system of the Humans usually only starts with 1 planet? I'm pretty sure our Solar System has more than one. Also, along that same note, I have yet to play a game where your starting system has more than one planet that you can use. Sure, late game tech lets you change gas giants and asteroid belts into planets, but that doesn't help you to start off. 5) There needs to be more options under advanced options: Such as: Minimum planets per system and Max per system. I have had several games where I found yellow stars (which should generally hold the best planets) without any planets. Also, needed: 1) Distance between star systems, 2) A ""Huge"" galazy size, 3) Difficulty setting for each AI (some species are more aggressive than others). 4) The abiity to customize your ship types (the models shown. I love playing the Psilons, but hate their ship shapes). 5) The ability to choose your empire color and flag.6) Combat right now is a major sore point for many players. Some absolutely hate real time and want the turn based of the original MOO. Others are on the other side of the fence. I like both ways personally. However, The orders for the ships need to be fleshed out a great deal more. I don't want my long range missle armed ships to closed to point blank range. There also should be a chance to get some tech points or something from wreckage I think (maybe have to have a salvage drone on your ships?).7) Asteroid belts need to have a chance to have some kind of bonus (have rare metals (bonus production/research if a base is built) or artifacts or something. Right now, they can be explored...but I have yet to find anything special about them.8) Ship designer needs to have an option to edit your military bases and star bases. Right now the computer chooses what tech to place on your bases and it will upgrade it, but if you have choosen a missle heavy approach and beam weak...the beams on your station won't due you a whole lot of good will they?).9) Ship designer needs to have more stats about the weapons. When I am building my ship, I want to see the range of the weapon I am placing on the ship. I would also like to be able to test my ship (either against another design of mine or against known ships that are out there), before I start building a fleet of them.10) The tech tree is a bit limited. There are no race specific techs and some of the explanation for the techs are wrong. Example: Cloning centers should increase your growth by a certain percent. Yet for months they are listed (and any other structure that is supposed to give a bonus to growth as well) as -x%, not +x%.11) The game in general feels very watered down. No artifacts that you can discover on planets that give bonus tech, ships or credits (though there are some things floating around in space that you can pick up, rare though). 12) The game stutters some (like all WG platforms I think). I have a 2.67Ghz i7, 24GB Ram, Geforce GTX-980 (not the crappy version).Okay, the pros:1) If you are a fan of 4x, you will like this game. Is it 100% ready? No. I would say it is about 70-80% there (I hope they are going to flesh it out a bit more). 2) The graphics (when they get them right) are good.3) The special effects of battle are good (when you can zoom in and see them).4) The replay value is good, however, it can get boring since parts are still missing.Overall, I would rate this game a 6.5/10. It has the potential to be a 9. If future patches change my opinion, I will update the review. However, I am personally waiting for Stellaris to come out on May 9th. That game seems to be just fricking awesome. Disappointed on how WG seems to have dropped the ball on this game. "

								Don't bother with this game unless:1. you have a huge monitor and great eyesight2. you like leaning forward every two minutes in your gaming chair to read miniscule text3. the developers fix the small UI issueThe game looks like it might be playable if the developers do something about this small UI (WHICH they morally OUGHT to do given the 50$ pricetag).    But as of the latest EA release, they are saying that ""there were no problems reported with the UI"".  This is a bald-face lie since I have complained numerous times  on the feedback discussions along with quite a few other gamers who have mid range monitors and video cards.Now, mind you, I'm not some guy trying to play this game on his 8 inch RCA tablet.  I got a Maingear custom machine this last summer and I'm running a 21'5 inch widescreen off a NV970 GTX with 4 Gs.  The font only comes close to readable when I set my monitor res to 1900 and THEN start the game from there.  Otherwise, everytime I try to play it I end up straining both my eyes and back.For 50$ the devs really need to get off their cans and fix the Ui problem.  In fact, I recommended to them at one point that they go for a nice retro cartoonish interface in order to capture the spirit of the original MOO games, but at this point I'd settle for something that was comfortable to read. Also - they look like they dont want to address the planet and ship ""leader"" feature that helped give MOO2 its own unique character, even though counless people on the ""feedback"" have recommended it.  In short, I don't feel like this company cares about the legend of MOO2.  The devs probably haven't even played it. Put it this way GC 2 is a far superior and more thoughtful game to this in its current state.  When I see something other than proof that the company just wants to just make money off the MOO franchise, I might change my opinion.  But right now, I feel like I've been bamboozled out of 50$.

												Up front, I'll acknowledge that I only played the game for less than an hour, but versus MOO2 and other available games I felt I had already found enough to be done with this game.- Star lanes.  The game doesn't let your ships fly just wherever you'll order them to go within a maximum range.  Instead, there are definite paths between star systems that the game chooses for you.  You must follow them, creating a strategic layout that is remarkably worse than MOO2 offered.- Simplified interface.  The game feels like it's been streamlined excessively.  The strategic depth and decision making that you'll find in other 4Xs, like Space Empires IV, Civilization IV & 5 just aren't here.			"

								I'll preface this by saying that I've never played any of the previous games.This game is WAY too easy on the normal difficutly (which is the only one available at the time I wrote this). I played on a Large, Old, Spiral Galaxy with no end date and won with absolute ease. Basically I started boxed in with one other faction by unstable warp points. After crushing them I pretty much colonized unopposed for 300-400 turns. By the time I met the remaining factions I was so powerful that I was able to bully them all to vote for me on the council and won the game WITHOUT EVEN BEING ABLE TO REACH THEM. While I think the game's a lot of fun, the ease with which I, a 4x neophyte, dominated kind of spoiled it all in the end. Unless they do a MASSIVE overhaul of the AI or the harder settings are lightyears more difficult than Normal, I won't play this game again. If they do, however, I'll glady give it another go.Long story short, don't buy the early access, wait for the full release and check reviews and Let's Plays to see if they've fixed it.Also, if the devs are listening, GET RID OF UNSTABLE WARP POINTS! I hate them.			"

Early Access Review
								After playing 4x games for.....decades at this point, I still list MoO2 among one of the best I have ever played. After playing the remake, I can't help but feel extremely disappointed. Looking down the discussions list, I really do question what people VALUE out of this genre.I do have a big problem with the lack of tactical combat. I think it's a damn shame. However, I will avoid talking about the lack of turn based combat, you can find about a thousand topics about that fairly easilly. But what about everything else that seems to be so poorly thought out and designed, or just plain doesn't follow what established Master of Orion as a great 4x IP?To start: Star Lanes.Why? There was already a very logical method to travel in MoO. Do you have X amount of fuel? Great, you can move Y amount of parsecs. If you can't get to a system you want to get to, you either make a priority out of fuel research, or build an outpost, which is also good for your ship count. This made exploration a much more active affair, forcing you to change your build order/priorities based on the system that was generated. Star Lanes are boring for exploration. Just mindlessly click the next thing on the path you've taken. Fuel also brings me to the next thing:Research.Simplified into (or copy/pasted from) Civilization. I like civ, but not as a 4x space game, which should take research very seriously. Research was half of what made MoO interesting. You COULD NOT know everything, unless you were creative, which was an ungodly expensive race trait (which got even more expensive after a patch). To know as much as you could, you had to trade. Or steal. Or invade. The ""branched"" techs in this remake are shallow, and boil down to extremely superficial choices of numbers (get more industry, or more research. Woohoo). In MoO 1 and 2, the choice was very difficult. Like mentioned above, you needed fuel. New fuel was often one of three researches, and the others in the same pool could be very useful, but if you wanted to fly farther, you had to make sacrifices. I don't feel like any of the remake's branched techs make you sacrifice much of anything. However, one in particular caught my eye, and that brings me to my next point:DiplomacyWhy, oh why, is the ability to make a trade or research treaty stuck behind a tech choice? The other race, upon viewing my ship, called me up on my space phone and told me that they wanted to lay their eggs in my stomach. Could I not figure out how to say the word ""trade"" in their language? The method by which you do diplomacy also seems to be lifted directly from Civ, from the interface to the presentation of the alien race, lounging in their background of choice and talking at you as you decide how best to screw them over. What about the audience screen from MoO2? Or the holoconference from MoO3 (one of the few decent things from MoO3...)?CosmeticsGone are the days of HR Giger inspired artwork. I understand why, it's hard to have art that detailed in a full 3D environment, but much of the game looks to be constructed of clay and coated in KBToys brand plastics. I won't say much on how the game looks, as that is as deep into opinion as I care to go, but I will say that for a PC exclusive game, I expect it to look much better.All in all, I really think MoOremake is still in desperate need of work. Of course, we all know the game is easy access, and much will probably be changed. However, I doubt any of the changes will be drasticly different from what we see before us now.			"

Early Access Review
								First off, as a gamer, I love turn based games in general: CIV, Endless, X-Com. I've been playing for more then 2 decades now and I loved MOO. I'm a casual gamer, a fan of the actors voice playing this game, but not a fanatic or a power monger. Keep this in mind as you read my review as you may or may not have the same playing style.Second, this is Early Access and REALLY not suited for casual gamers.I do not recommand this game at the moment for gamers who are like me; casual, micro-managing and graphics oriented. To those, I say get the Endless equivalent for now if you must, cause the early access is more for passionate gamers who don't mind the ""serious"" lack of depth, dumb down everything, semi unpolished graphics, limited everything (again and always, only one leader per race, usually male). Don't beleive the vid about interstellar battles, they look nothing like that...for now. Just tiny ships moving about in RT and cheaply shooting at each other. That said, I've yet to encounter a bug.Things to do on this game:- Polish the leader, planets and buildings on planets graphics. They just look like meh spheres with badly drawn structures here and there, like warts added to the surface of the foggy planetary graphics. Honestly, I think MOO 3 looked better then this.- Make the tactical space battles MUCH nicer to look at, with command choices and either turn based and/or with a less pathetic flow to it.- I know that more leaders are coming, but so far they are soooo shallow! There's no...connection to the races and of course, you're limited to THAT leader (with no pics while playing), usually male, and his/her point of view.- Choice of empire color; I know it seems silly, but its a choice the gamer can make and it SHOULD be simple to add.-More, more, more 3D graphics! MOO is an old title, but a NEW game, yet it looks and feels cheap compared to others of its type. Seriously, look at the difference between the old X-com and the new one!			"

Early Access Review
Uninspired reboot of MOO2 (not MOO1) with poorly designed galaxy map mechanics(April 10th 2016 - review based on playing EARLY ACCESS, SECOND STAGE release)The developers of the new game are promoting it as ""a worthy successor"" to the original Master of Orion, and that's why I purchased it. Based on the current release, it is not a worthy successor to the original. In fact, it seems to have far more in common with Master of Orion 2 than the original.MY TAKE ON THE ORIGINAL GAMESI'm old enough to say that I played all the original Master of Orion games when they were new. I played MOO1 when I was in university and spent an obscene number of hours on it, sometimes missing classes after playing all night. I purchased MOO2 back when games came in a box with CD-ROMs and a printed manual. I did the same when MOO3 was released.MOO3 was pure crap, so I won't even discuss it. MOO2 was fun, but lost much of the 'epic' feel of the original. The UI in MOO2 was clearly worlds beyond what was in MOO1. The atmospheric background music in MOO2 was excellent. MOO1 is still my favourite though. It was released in the early 90's, and a PC from that era had less horsepower than a cheap smartphone of today, so the graphics, sounds and UI look horrible now. Despite that, MOO1 really captured the feeling of starting small in a big galaxy, expanding in all directions to stake your claim for more, and eventually fighting for it. One of the best things about MOO1 was how the tech 'tree' was different in each game. Each race was only able to research a random subset of all the available techs. The rest could only be obtained via trading, espionage, or conquest. That was brilliant. It made the game very replayable and unpredictable, and forced you to adapt if your preferred early-game techs were not open to be researched.MOO2 dumbed-down some core mechanics from MOO1. In MOO2, you were limited to a number of ships less than the overall 'Command Points' for your empire. The tiniest ship size cost 1 CP per ship, and the biggest cost 6 CP per ship. The number of CPs in the late game was often small, like low 100's. Late game MOO2 fleets were not very epic.The new game closely resembles MOO2 in several ways. Most notable is the boring always-the-same tech tree (even tech names). They also kept the Command Points.BAD AND GOOD STUFF IN THE NEW GAMEBad - Galaxy map and scale of the galaxyI really hate the way they implemented the galaxy map.  The scale of the galaxy vs individual star systems is just BAD! To compare with a modern 4X game that gets it right, look at Distant Worlds (also available on Steam). That game has it's own set of problems, but capturing the system vs galaxy scale is not one of them. You can zoom all the way in to individual planets, then way way way out to see the entire galaxy, and it feels right. Master of Orion feels totally wrong. For example, moving a ship from one side of a system to the other side often gives you vision of the adjacent system on that side. Isn't the size of a star system insignificant compared to the distance between stars? On the other hand, let's say the size of a star system is vast. Then why does any 'move' within any star system always take exactly one turn, regardless of the system size? This mechanic is goofy and really needs improvement. It makes the game feel cheesy.  Star systems are connected by fixed 'warp paths' that are pre-determined at the start of the game. If there is no warp path between two systems, then it means you can't go there. It doesn't matter if those systems are right next to each other on the galaxy map. It makes the galaxy map seem like its just a nice graphic drawn over a simplistic graph of lines connecting points that I'm forced to follow. You may only enter and exit a star system via a 'warp point', which is one end of a 'warp path'. This mechanic isn't fun and makes the game seem like a low-quality app.  Building a 'Military Outpost' (kind of a mini-starbase) on top of a warp point completely prevents opponents' ships from entering the star system at that warp point, unless they destroy it in battle. Come again? Space is pretty vast, right? Why not just go AROUND the outpost? Whenever you start a combat with one of them, you start out of range, so why not just fly around. These Military Outposts are available right at the start of the game. Lame.  There is no concept of 'ship range' or 'fuel'. Any ship can explore around in space indefinitely, and go anywhere that there are 'warp paths' to follow. This includes the scout ships you start with on the first turn of the game.  Midway through the tech tree, you can get a tech called 'Warp Gates' that makes a joke of the whole 'warp paths' concept. Any system where you build a Warp Gate is now considered to have a 'warp path' to every other system you own that also has a Warp Gate. Why not just do away with both of these cheesy concepts, introduce fuel/range back into the game (like MOO1/MOO2), and allow fleets to travel anywhere that is within their range.Bad - Boring tech treeThe new game has stuck with the terrible MOO2-style tech tree, even keeping many of the technology names. The tech path in MOO1 was possibly the best thing about that game. Each play-through gave you a different set of techs you were allowed to research, and there were more of them than in MOO2. If you've played and enjoyed MOO1, you'll know what I'm talking about. The new game should have kept this.Good StuffThe new game does have some aspects that I like.  The fleet battles look good, even though this part of the game isn't finished yet. The options for controlling your own fleet are still somewhat limited. Ships in your fleet that are the same ship model are grouped together in combat when you issue orders. You can choose from different formations, each giving unique combat bonuses. The fleet combat looks great. Each type of weapon looks and sounds unique. When you hit a ship/starbase with shields, you'll see the shield impacts. When a ship/base starts to take a lot of hull damage, it will start to look like its on fire inside the hull. This part of the game is headed in the right direction.  You get diminishing returns when you assign many of a planet's population to Farming and/or Industry. Each planet also has a fixed number of production slots on each production type (Research, Farming, Industry), and the number of slots depends on the planet size. This usually prevents you from putting all of the population on either Farming or Industry. I like how that works.  More industrial production causes more pollution. If you allow the pollution to get out of control and it reaches 100% polluted, then that planet will be permanently reduced to the next lower category of 'biome' (like Terran downgraded to Swamp). Your three options to prevent this are: a) research tech that reduces generated pollution; b) spends turns on 'cleanup' (which is lost production time); c) build things more slowly, so production stays below the threshold where pollution accumulates. This game mechanic makes sense and is a good addition.  Production queues are a thing. Done better than MOO2.  I'm mostly indifferent about the sci-fi celebrity voice actors. They recruited heavy hitters like Mark Hamill, half the cast of Star Trek TNG, and even the pilot from Serenity. I hope they didn't spend a lot of the development budget on this frivolous aspect of the game. I'm embarrassed for Michael Dorn, that he was forced to read some of the uber-crap dialogue (wait for the narration after you bomb a pirate base - /facepalm...) The exception to this is the funny Galactic News Network anchor robot that is voiced by Dwight Schultz (the actor who played Lt Barclay in Star Trek) - love it! "

												This review is no longer early access. Its the same review because nothing changed.1. Pollution. The way this was implemented means you have to micromanage everything, since the autobuild doesnt care if the planet biome drops a level.2. Micromanaging. I am fine with this, but the way its done you have to control EVERYTHING it seems like every other turn, which in small empires is fine but once you hit 10/12/15 planets or more...beware.3. Combat. Not only is there no tactical combat, you cant even tell your ships to fire on a certain enemy ( they will spread out to fire on all enemies of that class instead).4. Tech tree. The tech tree was ""streamlined"" aka dumbed down. There are very few ""choice"" techs anymore, and most of those are no-brainer choices anyway. So no trading for other techs or stealing them, since everyone has the same tech.5 Spying. Since stealing tech is almost worthless, the best way to use these forced to micromanage spies is to put them on a planet you control for counterspying. If you really want to use them, you had better have a better tech level than the enemy, because otherwise they WILL get caught almost always before their mission is done (missions have timers, but there is an rng every turn to see if they get caught).6. New Colonies. Since a colony can starve pretty quickly on the planet you just landed them on (whether its a barren or a gaia), youd better buy a food prod building or have 2-3 population transports right away to put there.7. Star Lanes. Bottlenecks that make the game less tactical, more, build more ships to win.8. Diplomacy. It seems like the devs ripped the diplo right out of civ5, aka all other races hate you but hide it ( As of the last update, I have had a full ally declare war on me because I deported the spy he was spying on me with).9. AI. The Ai in this game is bad. Just horrible. They are really stupid about every single thing, and then when you get ahead  of them they cheat to even it out ( On harder difficulties, that means they ""make"" 20-30 ships in one turn on one planet to even out power).I probably missed something, but thats enough. Overall I would say this game is a buy on sale IF you have friends to play it with. If you have noone to play it with, buy it deep sale or not at all.			"

								Well, this game should have a name: MOO 2 HD: the down syndrome.One of the previous reviews of this game started with a postulate like that: ""You are a Psilon now... I don't care that you are called Bulrathi because you can research all tech from current technology benefits most of the time."".Well, it is also possible to make a postulate like that: ""You are a Silicoid now... I don't care that you are called Bulrathi because you can colonize all planets except gas giants and asteroids now from the beginning"".The list may be continued. Simplified game mechanics leaves no room for visible race difference.If you want some MOO, buy MOO 2 on gog.com, also you can find relativly fresh mods for it.Or buy Star drive 2 se4ctor zero, I am going to buy it soon.I also do not recommend to buy anything from NGD Studious or wargaming (WG Labs) from now on.They are just impudent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s trying to get money for no work.This guys, for example, didn't include a goverment system and leaders system in their pityfull byproduct!They dare to say that just maybe they would make leader system in the future (maybe, in DLC?).Features, which there were in MOO 2 20 (yes, 20, Karl) years ago!Imagine, I do not know, John Carmac releasing Doom 4 without armour and with decreased number of weapons in comparison with Doom 2! And tells you, that he have heard the wishes of community for armor in the game, and he is thinking that maybe somehow (DLC?) it would be implemented in some future!If we would pay for such freaks, they would continue to degenerate the hole game industry.Well, there are also some ""minor"" issues for not buying this game - their game designer didn't play MOO 2 any visible amount of time and, while being cleanly identified as a civ-player (and not moo player) by MOO community, is considered to be a mediocre player in civilisation at best by some. So, while it is early access now, it is doubtfull that a good progress would be possible. Watching their forums, keep in mind that this freaks delete negative posts, threads, and ban unwelcomed users.So, just stay away and wait for metacritic results, and compare the rating of the game with stardrive 2, stellaris, polaris sector, galactic civilisations 2-3, and think twice before supporting idiots who make a remake of 20 years old game cutting off many important features of it and adding about nothing but graphics, Well, this stupid creatures also boast that they hired a well-known artists for postcoring an advisors for this game, but periodically on the forum appear themes were people ask to shut down some of them because they are very annoying.

								So close and yet so far... This is not a MOO remake. It is a MOO2 remake.And that is a BIG difference.This game MIGHT turn out sort of fun, but I really dont understand why we need another Gal Civ clone, when you actually could remake MOO...In my oppinion MOO has four MAJOR advantages over ANY other 4x Space game and very little flaws.1) Simplicity in the planet management - No buildings plz. Leave that to Civ and all the other space games. The ledger system was (and is still) quite unique.2) Random tech lists - Somtimes you just get stuck with no planetary shields or the right tech to colonize. Have a good laugh, cross your fingers and hope for a miracle to happen.3) Unique Fleets - We only needed room for more than 6 ship designs and a way to upgrade old ships to new designs.4) Gigantic turn based space battles - How many legendary fights have you had where your repulsor beam held back waves of enemy ships, while your planetary missles ripped the enemy apart.But you are not going to find all of that in this game. So thumps down from me. "

								Not too unlike Endless Space. It's interesting and fun for awhile. But, sadly, it is caught in the 4x epidemic. Like all these games, this also suffers from the ""4x Virus"": mid-game it turns into a micromanagement department and becomes masterfully boring with no real difficulty, as you can already see what the outcome will be, and the rest of the game is just mopping up. The feeling of exploration and discovery, the unexpected events, the eagerness to advance your tech and build your empire fades away. The mid- to end-game really needs an overhaul if I'm going to waste any more time on these 4x games. Something more than an obsessive compulsive drive to finish what you started has to happen somewhere.I usually quit at that point and start a new game. And repeat this until that also becomes boring. For this one it only took about fiver or six startups to get me bored.			"

												I can't in good conscience recommend anyone to buy this game right now at the current asking price. It is missing to many features and mechanics yet that are necessary to keep the game interesting for an extended amount of time. The combat system is one of those systems, it is shallow to say the least. Also, there is currently only 1 difficulty level, and it is painfully inept. So I have to recommend that unless you can get the game gifted to you for free, or find some way to get it at a drastically reduced cost, don't buy this right now. It needs work.P.S.- I don't talk about the graphics of games because they are meaningless to me, unless they are next level incredible. Gameplay is the #1 thing that determines a great game. I will try to keep this review up to date as the development progresses.UPDATE 3/25/2017: So, this game released a while ago, and it didn't get any better. The combat system is complete garbage, and ridiculously imbalanced in every way. Stay away from this game. It's complete trash. The Dev's are amateurs who have no idea how to make a 4x game.			"

The devs seem fairly commited to the game and are updating it regularly.  That being said, $50 for what is basically a graphical update to a pair of games I can grab on GOG for $6 is excessive.  If that's what you want, then great, get this game.  But if you're looking for something new or different, it sure isn't here.			"

In order to proceed out of my small area I had to research half way up the tech tree. I was basically stuck within 7 systems. Secondly, pirate bases will spawn out of nowhere. One minute you have eradicated their presence from a system and the next they randomly show back up in another. Once they are gone they should be gone, not popping back up without a pirate ship from another planet claiming their new one! Are they just evolving from the planets lifeforms to terrorize my planets!! Wtf guys.... Im going back to Stellaris..			"

								One small change can make all the difference in the world. Though master of Orion it prettier than the other games in the series the way space travel, exploration, and combat work in this versiont takes out all the strategic depth and fun. Instead of only being limited by your ships fuel, this game only allows to travel from system to system through a handfull of warp tunnels that link to their neighboring stars. I sound like a small change (and it is) but it changes the game entirely. It has more in common with ""Sins of a Solar empire"" than the previous titles of Master of Orion.			"

								Sadly as of right now I can NOT recommend this game at all. The Bad:1. The devs withhold on tactical combat for a long time before they let us know it's going to be real time and it's going to be ready for Early Access to show off. It failed on every front at the moment. Compared to RTS like Homeworld or Sins of a Solar Empire, the combat has very little depth and any ""tactics"". Compared to Swords of the Stars, the combat has even less depth and strategy over all. It's very simple, click attack, your ship fire, done. In Homeworld position your ship is important, especially Capital ship, and flanking Capital ship is very important. There's nothing like that here. In Sins of a Solar Empire you have hundred of abilities and micro managing your ship in real time (like any other RTS) is the key to advantage. Right now this Tactical combat has less Depth than Dune 2 24 years ago.2. The Races has very little diversity, there's almost no different bar very minor bonus/penalty. Coming from MoO 2 you will find this a big disappointment. It's like MoO 2 but you take out half of the strength and weakness of the races.3. Tech tree. If you are expecting to make important decisions with the research path in MoO 2, forget it. Decisions are too far and few in between and has too little impact at the moment. Like after researching 20 techs you are only asked to make a decision to choose between Fusion Beam and Fusion Bomb once. The rest of tech everyone has the same thing.			"

								This is actually a pretty good game relative to other 4X games currently out there. This is largly because it takes some of its content from a genuinely great 4X game, MOO2, that was so good that it is still excellent (in spite of some flaws) after 20+ years.The research categories are taken from MOO2, but they are broken up into smaller pieces that are incremental. Where, for example, in MOO2 an Automated Factory would give +5 production and an additional +1 production per person, in this game the Automated factory merely gives +2 Production, making it an incremental change rather than a major strategical achievement.The designers, in their words about design admitted openly (see Steam discussions)  that building an almost chess-like 4X game like MOO2 was beyond their programming capacity. In MOO2 the one who went first in major battles would depend upon something called initiative, based on speed and maneuvering capability. This worked very well and typically with two relatively equal human players in a large battle the best ship or two of each side would go first and then the other ships. It worked extremely well, while the developers of this game called it ""unwarranted complexity"" and claimed they just couldn't do it.Please read some of the positive reviews for discussion of this new games virtues. There are all some and sadly it is better than many 4X attempts there because they did take a lot from MOO2... but not nearly enough. That is the reason this is very sad.Hopefully, someday, a genuine reboot or sequel to MOO2 will be made. The tragic part is that the existance of this game might give potential backers the false impression that such a reboot/sequel has already been done, which it has not.I did pay my $50 and play this game to give it a shot. I could give a balanced look at the positive qualities, but instead, in this review I merely wish to share my deep feelings of heartbroken disappointment. It is frustrating when designers just cannot understand what is great about a game they are trying to reboot or give a sequel to.For comparison there is a great colony building game called Outpost that was turn-based and genuinely great but rushed too quickly into production without completing it. When Outpost II came out it had been made by some clueless executive at Sierra into an action game. As an avid Outpost enthusiast waiting for a sequel/completion of the original, I was offered a free copy of Outpost II which I refused. I don't care about the $40 then or the $50 I paid now. I care because a great game like MOO2 has never been rebooted or done with current graphics, refinement of the random event/initiative systems, a better AI, etc. This game took from MOO2, but changed way too much of what made it great.

								Overly simplified MoO2 with somewhat better graphics.Original reasearch system is scrapped and replaced with Civilization research system.Diplomacy system is taken directly form Civilization as well.I'm not sure why they are calling the combat tactical because there are no tactics involved. It's also a horribly looking mess.Things like no heroes and no events and no multiplayer tactical combat might get fixed. But overall direction of game never will.Psilons get a special mention: Cartoon ships, cartoon characters and an advisor that makes you want to either mute the game or not research anything. It's like you are playing a mobile game!Do not buy.			"

								After playing all races, I can say it's a good 4X SciFi Game, but nothing exceptional.If you have already a 4X game you don't need to buy MoO.All the things, that made Master of Orion 1 and 2 so special are missing. Worst of all is the combat system. There is no tactic or strategic necessary, the battle begins and after 60 seconds (at maximum) the battle is over. And the developers will not change it as they told in the forum.The star lanes are also disgussing. In MoO 1 and 2 the possibility for exploration depends on the size of the fuel cells and it works fine.The differenz between the races are at this point also to marginal. The tech tree for all races is the same and therefor also no differnece between the races.			"

								In its current form the game is a bit frustrating to play, there a numerous UI elements that dont appear, for example on the ship design screen. The AI will immediately try to kill you so it doesn't look like diplomacy is an option. Auto upgrades are really stupid and will break your ship designs, for example removing all your pd and replacing it with missiles.That said I can see it becoming a great game, once its out of alpha. its aesthetically nice and reminds me of star trek. Some reviews are excessively negative, I think it generally retains the things I liked in MoO2, except I dont think the combat system is that good when compared to MoO2/SotS. Its basically auto combat where the stronger side will win but that seems to be the case in most space 4x games these days.			"

												If you've never played Master of Orion 2 (1996) before, I would recommend this game. In that case you can ignore my complaints mostly - MOO2 was a big hit back in the day. Basically it's a well made 4X game that does many things just right. It does look pretty as ever, no problems there.However, it's way too much like MOO 2, in good and bad. For me, playthrough feels like another nostalgic trip through the same old game, as if there hadn't been any progress during these 20 years. Same set of alien races, same technologies, same command point mechanics etc. Overpowered traits like ""creative"" have been balanced away, which is nice. Late game micromanagement has got is a little bit better but it's still pretty bad. Like before, you spend most of your time managing colony build queues, which isn't very interesting, unfortunately. The colonies are pretty much like each other, so you keep doing the same thing over and over again. I would have wished they had fixed the problem with limitless expanding being a valid strategy, but alas, no. Like before, in this game you compete with volume. There's simply no room in the galaxy for small empires, big empires do better in every aspect. Also, nothing's been done to fix the uninteresting diplomacy system.Others have complained about the combat system and the starlanes, but I'm pretty much OK with these. The combat feels a bit more chaotic than before, but it slows down the game a lot less, which is welcome. I'm not yet sure how much you can influence the outcome with valid tactics - mostly the ships seem to be blasting away at each other until one side runs out of hit points. The starlane mechanic seems a bit weird at first, but I like the way it makes it possible to fortify your empire by building military outposts. Jump gates allow for faster travel inside your own domain.I sincerely wish there were DLC or mods that would make this an interesting game in 2016 as well, in the way of DOTA, counter strike or long war. It'd be a shame to have all the love poured into this game to go waste otherwise. Originality goes a long way.			"

If you were a fan of MOO2 you will certainly recognise the mechanics, themes and events you encounter.For a good decade, I've been hoping for an updated release of this game which, in all that time, reflected the pinnacle of this genre. Sadly, a mere month after it's release, someone went ahead and redefined the genre with Stellaris. I truly feel sorry for the developers.			"

								Well it must be noted i only put 62 minutes into this game before requesting, and being granted a refund. So there is that.However, im not going to spend the time writing a long review. I will however state that i suggest you go somewhere else for your fix of 4x. So why am i recommending that? It's rather simple. While the game is pretty, and alot of effort has been spent on making the game beautiful, this has been a zero sum game. The effort spent in making this game into a beautiful game has not been spent on making this a complex game. There is no tactical combat, ship design is a thing of the past, diplomacy doesn't function very well, and the galaxies are relatively small. Planet management is pretty great though. So if you're looking at building simplistic spaceships by clicking on predetermined modules, then building said space ships and spending 19 turns moving it across starlanes to attack an AI that's completely useless then this game is for you. If you're looking at a game with a learning curve, and more difficulty then a puzzle for a 3 year old then look elsewhere.			"

At this stage only average difficulty avaliable but i am not sure if the AI will be much better or will it get ""benefits only"". - No difficulty selection avaliable and average difficulty is definately not for average player.- Ship desing is quite limited compare to other 4x games.- no tactical formations in the tactical fights.- no leaders- no spies ( at the moment but will be implemented)- doesnt give the feeling of exploring big universe. - Planet specialization is  not needed. Just build all avaliable!- Graphics are not spectacular nor so bad either. But they definately need to work on it.- Star lanes and no range for the ships. So techincally you can travell all the map.- has potential but long way to go.- diplomacy so so. i havent experienced any great or smart moves.- high price tag for the current stage ( i bought it just because i had creaving for a 4x game :S )For now stay away.

I dont know if there is anything planed for endgame but right now is unrewarding.The combat system is good but the simulation is horrible, is basically hit or miss even if you the see laser or bullet hitting the ship, There is not alot of ship types, even if you find a ship and recover it is the same ship of your race is not speacial in any way.Planetary management is VERY simple and when you cap a planet with all the buildings and population is a sitting duck, or turn it into a ship mega factory.The races are very cool they are totally different in their own way that is something i found good.I know is still a early acces game but even if you choose a race that is different docent seem like the traits of the race is affecting in any way how you play the game. HECK even if you choose the silicoid and in the description says it docent eat food to grow, The ♥♥♥♥ing farms do change the population growth, and that pisses me off.I would like to see these people add mod support so people can at least bring this game into a fun game, because right now even if i did play the game for a few hours I dont like the path this game is going for.

								My no reccomendation is based on the current state of the game, and could change.MOO is a timeless classic.  Even MOO3 was startling for its excellence - its problems were early release and play style that encouraged excellent players but put off lesser players.  The current MOO version is an obvious attempt to bring forward the excellence of MOO2 and MOO3, perhaps wreitten smaller with less innovation in the technology tree, fewer races, less tidbits of detail, and and smaller horizons.Right now it is pay for beta grade.  I never suggest player pay to play a game that is in essence a late alpha or early beta.  The game has serious flaws that prevent carry through an entire contest, and is essence a rough draft.  The rough draft though shows extreme promise.  Double the number of races, double the number of techs, work out the vario bugs in visual style and in combat, and get the combat rules to work (which of course, MOO3 never really did) and you have a game that would be one of the best of its type.  Add to that MacOS support - a game killer for many who have friends from the Mac side, and this could be the new standard for MOO>That said, there are rumbles on the horizon.  The forums are filled with people who want the game to be a RTS or a nerfed experience.  Most of them never played MOO before.  If the DEVs listen to the very loud rapid fire posting of their minority, the game will die a death and be a waste of 30 bucks.I would say revisit this in six months.			"

								Update: I just tried Phase 4. Tactical battles have had some work and certainly look better. I did not notice missiles hitting the seemingly omnipresent asteroids on the tactical map. The initial pirates are no longer a joke. The basic mechanics and style of tactical combat seem unchanged though.However, the game is still incredibly bland, visually and in gameplay. Check the simplistic ship models out which you can't even zoom in on. The gameplay is still a simplistic rush to build constructor ships and block off choke points while expanding your holdings.Honestly, this MOO reboot looks and plays like a tablet game. Doesn't it look like it?I'm so glad I bought Stellaris which gives me a visually gorgeous and immersive game with deep mechanics that give a feeling of running an interstellar empire. Try zooming in on the ship models in that game and watch in awe as the turrets track their targets and fire in visually glorious style during tactical combat. Stellaris needs some development work too and that is underway but it outclasses MOO by a long shot in my opinion.**********This game is incredibly bland. It would need serious development and additional features to make it an engaging experience. The game is a very simplistic remaking of the original MOO2 with some of the good parts of that earlier game currently missing.There are few random events and creatures, and pirates are not a threat in any way as they are very easily defeated. These features are bland and almost irrelevant to your gameplay.The models are cartoony and simplistic. I find the map overly bright too but its part of that cartoony style. While the leader models and voice acting are great, I find some of the advisors to jar with the tone set by the leader. E.g. the Psilon leader has a calm gravitas in his voice acting yet the advisor is a snivelling Golem-like creature. Yet any character of a race is made irrelevant by their diplomacy AI which is simplistic and hostile to any player offerings. The language is quite hostile too with the AI rudely cutting off contact despite decent deals being offered.Tactical combat needs so much work. I personally don't like asteroids on every tactical battle map. There is so much scope for varied maps. Currently, the AI will simply fire through asteroids causing shots to miss. The control and information available on the tactical map is so limited. It's a poor gameplay experience and it needs a lot of development work.Colonisation and planet management are both very simplistic. They're simply copying the mechanics of Master of Orion 2. While it was a great game back in the day, the computer gaming world has moved on. More depth could've been achieved while maintaining the core atmosphere of a MOO game. Espionage is also a strange set of mechanics. You can't enter systems blocked off by military stations to find enemy colonies and without that location information, your spies have nothing to do except counter espionage on your worlds. But spies keep being recruited. Once all your colonies have an agent, the rest will just sit on Hold on your homeworld. So boring. Surely spies should be helping you find out information about other empires, aided by trade and other treaties as they infiltrate other empires?			"

								With this being out of the way. Its way BETTER than 3!!! But way below master of orion 1 and 2. So with that out the way here are reasons why its not that great. its a lot...For starters combat is basic.... too basic. you can only set formation and your special items like boost or jumping. all your guns and missiles are on auto. Ground combat.... what ground combat? there is none. yes its like 1 where you can bomb, biological attack or invade. but when your troop transports can only make like 1 and thats it. thats pointless. This game has star lanes and some can't let you go anywhere because its unstable unless you get the tech. I liked the 1+2 where it will tell you how far you can go depending on your fuel cell type. The 500 turn limit. yes 500 turns and thats it.... that needs to go. As usual everyone hates you so diplomacy is bad. For example i was part of an alliance and the lizard race demanded i gave him 6 systems for no reason. no negotiation for it. so its off to war with him.  You can't demand peace or peace with another race in an alliance so thats pointless.  voting for council is just bad. i literally cheated and had top tier stuff and everyone abstain their votes. so i gave them all tech just to see what will happen. and they still abstain their vote. Ship building is ok, but I do not understand why if you upgrade something like if you designed a carrier with crud load of fighters, and bombers it will throw your design to the curb to put 100 laser cannons.  Espionage.... what spies??? there is none. but you have to research it???? Speaking of research this I don't understand. Why would a fusion beam and fusion bomb be seperated? Does someone invent the fusion beam but can't make a bomb or visaversa??? just put them like rest of the research. ON top of that fusion beam does less damage than laser but its a higher tier??!?!?!?!   its nice to see the planet being active with your buildings and all, but it could be better if I was in a same system with multiple planet colonies and jump from planet to planet. not system to the next system and back. wouldn't it make more sense to go to next planet and not the next system with the buttons on the bottomThere are some good parts Its in early stage so there is a lot of room for improvementShips look a lot better and if they can put more ships in the ship design for certain classes. and if you just stick with high dps, at least upgrade gives you the best dps, with some tweeking...the research is easier to follow on the tech tree, and can plan where you want to go with research. similar to endless spaceThe UI is better from 3 and similar to 2 with a more 2010 look. Landing of the colony ship is cool, sometimes buggy b/c it will say your systems on the side. othertimes... nothing. plus it has the same sound effect from 1 i believe.I wonder if they make an Imperium Galatica 2 with better graphics and steam workshop to put in different ship designs and whatever. that would be a killer game. hint hint			"

								I was so hopeful for this game. I wanted to give it a chance, I honest and for truly did. I broke my 2 rules for things that I never do on steam for the sake of supporting this game. I purchased it in early access, hopeful that it would become what the MoO franchise deserved and I paid full price, not waiting for any kind of sale, just so that I can support the creation of this game.Now I see that this was just another cash grab seeking to take advantage of an existing fanbase so they can milk the nostalgia for all its worth before presenting a steaming pile of shiny crap. The most impressive thing about this game is the A-list voice actors. And no, that is not a complement. That squandered money could have gone towards making a decent game.I do try to look on the bright side, and although this game wasn't nearly worth the $50 I paid, or the shattered hopes, I now I know what I can expect from this company and I now have a better awareness of just why I have those two rules in the first place. I won’t make this mistake again. "

Additionally, there appears to have been no work done on the late-game which descends into either 1) a maddening labyrinth of MicorManagement or 2) complete boredom of anonymous automation.Points for the starmap looking nice tho! Made my original review during EA, but came back later to check in again.  Unfortunately the combat seems to have hardly progressed at all.  Lost interest again quickly			"

								I want to like the game. The graphics is good and the system control nice. But I really can't. The battle mode is useless. But thats not the worst. I am running the game on a new Macbook pro and it crashes all the time. it then takes down the entire computer , sometimes until a hard reset is needed.Also often the game stays in the system after closing and uses one whole processor.As long as they don't fix the stability it is no fun.

								The devs are tone deaf regarding turn based combat. Waited patiently each iteration to see if their real time combat would ever come up to snuff of Moo1 or Moo2 but it's just not there, nor can I ever see a place where the combat would be fun. It's like they shot for Sins of a Solar Empire but ended up with just a pretty screensaver of a battle where none of your decisions matter. They really need to fire the lead dev and give the player base what they've been asking for on the forums which is turn based combat.			"

Please don't let it go the way of stardrive 1&2.  Please add ground combat and tech. let me name my planets& fleets. Add in Government styles. Really you guys should have taken the Moo3 concept and fixed it and spruced it up. or Made it more like  Distant worlds universe but 3d. At this point i can't recomend it.  it's kind of just Meh.. But i'll give you some time before i pass my final judgement.Thanks for taking it on though!			"

												This is a classic 4x game where you colonize planets, build fleets and conquer your enemies. The game has good voice acting, I did not encounter severe bugs or crashes, and the graphics are good enough for a strategy game. On the downside the game mechanics are shallow and become repetetive very quickly. If you are winning you get rewarded with meaningless micromanagement of countless plantes where you build the same buildings again and again. No planet specialization, no alternative victory conditions, no innovation -- it feels like 10 years in the past. It does not feel like Master of Orion 1/2 though, the childish art style with oversaturated colors prevents that. There are much better 4x games out there, like Endless Space, Endless Legend or even Civilization 5. This game is shallow, boring and tedious.			"

												Ok I picked this up think I was going to get a remake of MOO2 but sadly that is not the case. The game play is very basic and the AI is not very good. I was also disappointed with the size of the galaxy map, a huge map has roughly 50 star systems which seems a little small when it wants to put you up against 7 AI players. So if you are expecting an in depth 4x game I'm affraid you will be disappointed with this shallow MOO wannabe. With two other 4x game just around the corner you may want to leave this until it's available on a sale or leave it altogether.			"

								One thing that i dislike about this new MoO is the absence of Turn Based Combat which i considered the main selling point of MoO. We have simulate (auto-battle) if you dont have time to do every combat, I Really hope they will change it into turn based. because the current option is CINEMATIC and SIMULATION, seriously i see 0 reason for tactical, because it have notihng to do with TACTICS. Positioning is tactics, zoning is tactics, turtling is also tactics  but the depth of itit was butchered by Real Time approach. its like turning Street Fighter 2d fighting style into Tekken.Other than that i have nothing to say because this an EA title, but thing that must be keep in check are- No Espionage (to be implemented)- Sometimes AI do some questionable action- Managing Economy is somewhat too easy, CIV V is 20 times harder- Theres is virtually 0 punishment for Aggresive Colonization other than constat bugging of pollution and/or pirates- Ship design deletion will also ""delete"" the actual ship, i think the should change the shup name to <type> obsolete instead of delete the ship.- Race leader is somewhat become MMO character that kept begging you to give them money CIV-style, please do something more interesting with diplomacy- Random Event like Supernova is interesting, hope you can do more random thing like that maybe like some event that will disconnect jump between stars- Make things that buildable via Planet factory to be upgradeable (like the military outpost), because they have very little use			"

								The Elerians are not in the game. Just in case you were wondering. I bet they'll be in the DLC, heaven knows you'll pay $20 for some space drow fanservice. Right?MOOX is basically a reskinned - and simplified - version of MOO2. Note that MOO2 was not at all a complex game to begin with. The AI is much more forgiving than in MOO2: it is less aggressive, less intelligent, and also gets a much smaller production handicap. The diplomacy is an awkward mix of the rather outdated and opaque systems from MOO2 and Civ3: you can create deals a la carte, but it is difficult to predict whether the AI will accept them (and there is *always* a rep penalty for a failed proposal, even if your offer is only marginally less than what the AI would accept).The game fails hardest at the strategic level. The basic problem with the game is lack of player choice, combined with pig-headed AI that sends out fleets to destroy everything in their path until they are ground down by attrition by the player. In sum, the AI has the level of intelligence and sophistication one would expect from a game written 25 years ago. The game has a very low skillcap and basically plays like a piece of freeware or one of those no-name 4X games you can find in the bargain bin at Staples. These days, one could literally get a better game for free. This is not a game worth the same retail price as Starcraft II or Fallout 4. MOOX has the makings of a good game, but I think the dev team is overly cautious and uninspired - I get the feeling the devs are from B-game companies and the dev team leadership is really tepid and just copies features from other games, rather than innovating and doing internal testing - and the end result will fall far short of its potential, which is a shame because MOOX does, like I said, have a lot of unrealized potential. Maybe modders will play with it later. Frankly, I think the goal at the corporate level was just to make a low-budget, B-team $50 cash cow players would plop down money on for sheer nostalgia. From a financial standpoint, I have no doubt they succeeeded. Anyway, bottom line - in terms of game experience, this game just isn't worth it. Don't waste your money.Game elements in MOO2 gone from MMOX include:- Almost all tech implementation picks (a handful of techs have them on an individual basis)- Intra-system colony pods- Boarding parties and self-destruct- Freighters- Spies (apparently not yet implemented, although the overall structure of the game suggests this functionality will be very limited)Compared with MOO3:- Spacelanes, a really bad design element, are in evidence- System (sublight) ships, which were actually a cool idea, are not in evidence- Moon development does feature in the game but is very, very limited, offering only a few bonus points for a couple touch-and-go improvements Suggestions for devs:- Remove spacelanes- Buff AI intelligence and strength- Add more options overall- Make the game pacing more variable; differentiate short/long-game choices- Add system ships, the ship design system from MOO3 was basically good but poorly implemented- Reintroduce features from MOO3 without making them overwhelming or inconsequential- More terraforming / economic customization- More races- Less cliche in race design (hurr durr big tough guy / indigenous nation mystics)			"

There you could shoot each weapon at desired ship etc, also board other ships to capture them. these options arent in the new Master of orion.Also i mis also a the leader's  of planets and ships they stripped this option too.It would have been nice if they took game mechanics of master of orion 2  and just improved the graphics....i cant even finish my map now because of crashes but i hope some update will come as it is under development jet.

								While this game is early access, it is finally nearing completion. I very much want to give the game high marks, as it's beautiful, and does give a lot of the MOO1 and MOO2 feel of gameplay which has been sorely missed. Unfortunately, the game is criminally hampered by an insanely bad AI that's given insane amount of 'cheat buffs' to compensate. This results in an uneven game that's either rediculously easy or impossible. The difficulty switch seems to make no difference in this oversight.Until this AI system is completely revamped, just avoid this game for now. Fortunately this is early access, so maybe we'll see some much needed improvement.			"

								I love how they promised this game would reflecte the master of orion legacy. The only things this game has in common with this legacy is the names of the races, star system and technolegys thats it. The things that made master of orion great were the many exclusive technolegie chioses, a vaste free roaming galaxy and the (chess like) turn based tactical combat. This game is beyound boring you got nothing to do but click turn and when you think you might actualy have fun destroying enemy you click one button to either look at the fight or just the results. I dont know about you but i dont realy care about fight results, I'm more into actualy fighting the battle. In my opinion this game was a complete waste of money. Be warned.			"

								MOO 2 was a great game. The new Master of Orion maybe a great game in the future but it  is not now.  It is lacking depth (tactical combat, AI, diplomacy, espionage, heroes, antarans,...), comfort (especially order colony ships from the planet overview...) and atmosphere (missing animation for ground combat,  star destroyer ...).  So hopefully these things will be added in the final release.			"

Early Access Review
								First of all, I am aware of the fact that the game is in early access but sadly I don't recommend it unless you really want to support the devs.EDIT: The devs are apparently working hard on the game, considering the reviews etc. It looks even more promising (early access version 4). I will happily recommend the game if it continues in that way. END OF EDITThe game is definitely a good looking remake of Master of Orion 2. The graphics and sound are excellent. The details are very nice. The game is already very polished at the moment.The issues of the current version as I see them are1. Star lanesSystems are connected by star lanes and you must travel through them between systems (unless you have built jump gates). In my first game I got coined in by AI blocking exactly 2 spots in the universe with a starbase. I could not go further unless I attacked him or sorted it out diplomacally accepting his ridiculous price. Well... it's supposed to be the 3D space modeled as 2D space...and it has been made a 1D space in fact. Why? The defense strategy is just to defend a few frontier points which does not require much of strategy really...2. System travel pointsIn a system, besides the travel points that are one end of a star lane, the ships can stay at each planet... when travelling from a system, they need to go to the travel points on the ""edge"" of the system...and then continue by the connected star lane...So basically in a system, they do not travel at full speed...why? That is one more feature of the freeness of space movement that is somehow diminished in the game...3. BattlesYou can simulate a battle, that's fine. You can enter a 3D battle and ...well, watch it. There are some controls but you cannot really influence the battle much, or, have a feeling that you actually do something. I need to compare this to MoO2 now since there you saw how your ship designs perform. You could control every aspect of the battle and thus took care when designing ships. At this moment, the battle in Master of Orion (4) is just as bad as in MoO3...4. Minor issuesThere are some minor issues that will hopefully get fixed. For instance, the UI of the ship design part needs a bit of work: once you have many components, the large icons are not very clear. There is a feature of MoO2 that has been copied: all troop transports get eaten when you invade a planet: I should be able to choose how many marines I want to invade the planet and after the battle how many of them should stay boarded to ships. (The ships of dead or garissoned marines will still be eaten .... )Once more, I know the game is in early access and might change. And hopefully it will change and be the best MoO2 successor.			"

								It's just crap right now.  All the money wasted on voice acting should have went into making an actual game that isn't horrid.   This game is nowhere near as interesting or as well put together as Master of Orion 2.  Starlanes are horrible idea, there is no sense of exploration when your starting scouts can visit every single star system without comming back to refuel or anything.  Monsters guard individual planets, not systems, so you don't have to worry about anything at all and map the whole galaxy.  Diplomacy is a joke,  you have to spend money to make trade agreements that don't last more than 20 turns....WTF?  In Master of orion 2, if you could actually get a treaty going,  you were rewarded with that treaty until you Messed up, or got framed for stealing a Tech that you really didn't do, that's fine.... buy why spend hundreds of credits on a treaty that wont even give you the money back that it cost you to set up before it runs out?  Stupid and pointless.  Espionage is pointless because everyone gets every tech, what is the point in wasting time stealing something that you are going to get anyway?   In Master of Orion 2 you HAD to spy if you wanted to get some of the good stuff that you HAD to pass on to get something else that was Indespensable.  Diplomacy animations cannot be disabled at this time, you have to wade through listening to crap that is pointless, the best strategy I found was not ever research the tech that let you establish an embasy so you don't have to listen to drivel.  No Turned based Combat is a total deal breaker,  the real time tactical combat is so boring and pointless and such a small 2D arena, I really don't understand why the Master of Orion 2 model of combat can't be used, I mean, the combat arena in Orion 2 is bigger!  SAD.  Overall, if you liked Orion 2,  keep playing Orion 2.  This game isn't even as good as Master of Orion 3, which is just about the biggest insult I can give to any game.			"

Starlanes or Not - its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T ... why bother researching a new engine? youre still moving like a 99 year old granny - slooooooooooooooow like hell. The whole game feels like youre supposed to be sleeping at all while playing it.If you want to travel trough 5 Systems you will have to plan 5 turns only for moving within those systems.. than moving along those ""great"" ""wonderful"" Starlanes (well i *could* accept them if they wouldnt only give me the feeling they are there to slow down the game... )Uh and then... if youre finaly got your ships to the Enemy ships (i mean if youre still awake... ) youll be punished with that great useless combat system... Sure - with the old turn based combat system and a few broken Ship Designs you could kill a fleet of thousand ships with only one little Cruiser... but you too had the chance to beat a stronger fleet with smart movement and designs... Now? Just hope youre stronger, got the better techs and hit ""simulate"".The only ""good"" things:The Planetary Screen right now... Build queues, Overwiev etc. is nearly like it was in MoO2 (could have some more ""details"" like the old City Screen in MoO2 but its ok)The Ship Editor - quite good like the old was... not that hard because its nearly the old just with a few fance graphic updates... (i wish they would have done that with the rest of the game too..)Iam sorry but after those first 4 Hours of playtime i would strongly recommend to move around this game and look for other games and have more fun with those games then with this Game here right now...

								I'm a big fan of the series MOO. I played in the  MoO and MoO2. The first images from the developers were wonderful, I bought just as the game appeared in the early access. But playing is not much to say that the old MoO here are only the names of the races / technologies. Everything is simplified to the limit. No food management, no pop management. Technological discoveries of all races are equal, there is no bonus psilon like in the old Orion. No tactical battle  (realtime is not replacing the old regime). Special difference in the weapon on the ship is not who has more guns is right. In general, it turns took the name from the well-known game, but could not make a sequel. Hard to say which is worse or the new Master of Orion MoO3.I would not recommend at this time to buy this game . If you're a fan of space strategy look at Polaris Sector.If you are just getting started with genre can then view, Sort ssesion play. gone a couple of hours played and won.			"

								Never played the original MOOs but I was still very dissapointed by this game.  Rigid starlanes, a very limited tech tree, no functional differences between races and overall a system that feels like a dumbed down endless space with different graphics.  And for the starlanes, no matter how good your engine is your ship depletes its moves upon arriving at a star system, and whenever moving within a star system.  Since the starlanes themselves arent that long this means if you have a good engine halfway through the tech tree or an engine at the very end of it if there are 4 systems between where you are and where you want to go it will take 8 turns to get there, your ships will never get any faster.

								The more you played Master of Orion I and II, the more this game will disappoint you. It's basically a MoO 2 reskin with less features. And it has the feel and look of an iPad-game to boot.If you never played the originals and you'd like a basic 4X-game, this could certainly be the game for you. Just don't expect a tactic-laden, deep experience. MoO 4 (this game is the fourth in the series) is the 4X version of a cup of noodles. Easily digested, decent enough but not something you'll remember for very long.			"

Early Access Review
								I remember how much I loved Master of Orion when it came out.  The nights until 3am - during school - I'd stay up because ONE MORE TURN.That carried over to Master of Orion II.  ONE MORE TURN, and oh how my grades would suffer.  Chemical addiction had nothing on Moo2, and I regret nothing.So then came Moo3 and I got deeply involved in the fan side of things and worked to make the game good.  While it is largely considered a failure, it still holds a warm place in my heart.This Master of Orion is in absolutely no danger of challenging any of that.  In fact, this tripe feels more like a student project than a game worthy of a genre-defining classic.First, the good points:Slick graphics.  Lots of JJ-Abrams flare and a strong palette.Music is nice and fitting.Voice acting is stellar.Beloved races from earlier incarnations are well realized.Now, my problems:Abyssmal diplomatic feedback.  Friendly, treatied neighbor attacked without there being any feedback to me that this was coming.  Straight out of the blue.Disastrous diplomatic design.  Really, friendly races suddenly attack?  No insults, no declining relations?  Just a roll of an invisible die and 'hey, lets shoot at the human.'Pathetic star systems.  One or two planets might have been fine in the early 90s but today it feels like cut budget (or cut corners).  And those early 90s games at least benefited from the then-dominant threory that planets were rare.Spacelanes.  Can you say chokepoints?  First one to a few key systems wins whole regions of the map...no way out of that.Boring tech tree.  Anymore linear and y=mx+b could be used to plan your action.Races don't feel special.  Everyone is just a rubber-suited alien.  60s Star Trek sported more attempted diversity.So I wouldn't recommend this and struggle to see if it's salvagable.  The diplomacy engine needs to be gutted, completely, and rebuilt to perhaps make some effort to resemble interacting with real races.  Instead I'm left at the mercy of a random die roll and there's NOTHING a player can do to stop that. Take your money and go get Stellaris.  Or Distant Worlds.  Don't make my mistake.			"

								The game is just goofy.  I played the psilons because ever since moo 1 i played the psilons.  And they're just... embarassingly goofy.  Remember in moo 2 how elegant the psilons looked?  Frail but graceful.  Now they're just these cringingly goofy grey-alien dorks.  The ships look stupid.  The psilon ships look like the old 1950's UFOs.  Nothing feels impressive or powerful or awe-inspiring.  The tech tree is disappointing, it is unimaginative, doesn't make you feel like you are glimpsing into the future, the tech at the end of the tree doesn't sound like awesome god-level tech.  They've got Worf(micheal dorn) doing voice over for the game, and he sounds... so bored.  Even the music is goofy.Here is moo 1's research screen music:

								Like it or not, putting a brand name on a product does not make it good. Doomed to be just another of a number of uncountable Master of Orion 2 clones, this game offers nothing that Galciv 2 or even Stardrive hasn't done better already.  Putting this game out in early access is the same mistake Sword of the Stars 2 made years ago. It's so poorly optimized that you won't be able to enjoy the excellent visuals even with a beastly rig. Crashes are common and the interface, while intuitive, has basic difficulties with important aspects like saving your game.Stay away from this for at least another year or two. They might save it with updates, but expect to pay through the nose for DLC. Attaching the old games to this one is just a slap in the face, when they could have just been offered seperately like Firaxis did with the older X-Com games.			"

								I'd like to recommend this game, but it is far... far from ready to leave early access.  The game feels shallow and oversimplified.  It is still fun but clearly not close to finished.  The voice acting is nice and the combat system is promissing but needs some polish yet.  The AI is lacking in a number of places (it has improved but has a long way to go) and the resource system is far to simple for a 4X style game.  I fear that this game will be pushed to a finished product far to early knowing Wargamings practices especially seeing how they pushed World of Warships out far before it was ready. In their recent development progress post the devs claim in is almost ""feature complete"", which is extremely disapointing.  I fear they are going to release the game far from ready and try to shove a paid DLC down our throats several months from now actually fleshing out all the games features.			"

Final Update, August 17: Well, that's all folks. They squandered every opportunity to make this game worthwhile. Release date is August 25. They took into account basically none of the player feedback. Pretty much my every previous complaint still stands. All they did was squash some bugs. Their EA program was a lie and a joke - they never intended to listen to their players at all. I cannot recommend this game. Furthermore, for the horrible EA practices involved here, neither NGD nor Wargaming.net shall ever again see any business from me. Sigh... what a waste of potential. Does not live up to the name they bought.July 22 Update: EA Phase 6 now. Lots and lots of bugs squashed... but many get reintroduced in subsequent cycles. They have still not implemented ANY of the heaps of great feedback regarding tactical combat. The combat system, aside from some ""balance changes"" is largely untouched, simplistic, and devoid of any requirement for strategy/skill. There is also still no tactical combat for multiplayer, and there probably never will be. Strategic level gameplay has seen some improvements, some worsenings, and many bugs come and gone and come again.I still cannot recommend this game. I have lost hope that I will ever be able to. If you value campaign map gameplay over combat - seek out Stellaris, you'll have more fun there. For an integrated approach, look into Star Ruler 2, Sword of the Stars, or even previous Master of Orion titles.Should I ever be made to eat my words, I will happily do so and amend this review. Until such time... avoid this game, it is not worth the asking price, and has been a perpetual mess. I have no confidence in the development.May 6 Update: well, they let out a patch that fixed some technical issues - which was welcome, but that's about it so far. You still can't fight your battles in MP, which basically makes MP a snore. I still cannot endorse this game. I don't like the direction the game is going in, and I don't think it will be ready at launch. Will update again when they do something with it. Sigh.Original Review: As of this point in time, Early Access phase 3, I cannot recommend MoO. It's actually gotten worse since EA2, despite the new features, and there seem to be no patches inbetween EA phases to fix what's obviously broken. Furthermore, they seem to be ignoring player feedback entirely, and many bugs that crop up go unfixed. I am very disappointed in this game so far. For a much better 4X experience, I point you in the direction of the Sword of the Stars franchise, as well as towards Star Ruler 2.This is an EA review. If they get their stuff together I will amend this review.			"

Early Access Review
								I am a big fan of 4x games and strategy games, and loved the original two Master of Orion games.  This new iteration of Master of Orion feels like a shallow example of a 4x game, with weak attempts at being a rts. To me it feels like a disaster of an addition to the Master of Orion series.Many of the core elements that made the originals great have been stripped away completely or deluded so much that they are almost unrecognizable. This is to the point where several aspects of the game that have been brought over from the previous iterations just don't seem to function as they should anymore. Several of the playable races seem ineffective and pointless in comparison to others. Weaponry and technologies have little logical uses and are therefore trumped by a handful of superior options. Combat has been reduced to what equates to tactless skirmishes with extremely limited control. The game has ship customization, however it seems like a mute point when all elements of strategy and tactics have been removed from combat.The game is pretty to look at, but only to an extent. It seems as though there are a very limited number of well crafted objects in the game, but the small amount of them get redundant very quickly. The same ships fly past the same planets, while your advisor rambles off the same line of text he has said dozens and dozens of times before. The game as a whole seems extremely skeletal in many ways without any real substance.			"

I build on any planet the same order of all buildings. It doesn't matter which race I have.- technology is also always the same. The choices that exist are not relevant. You don't have to adapt your play on them.- fights have lost lots of tactical depth. I autoresolve them.I played a couple of times with different races. I did nearly always the same things in the same order. The ""magic"" of the old master of orions is missing. But hey, they have time to bring it into the game...			"

								Early Access reviewI am a bit torn about the game in its current state.It looks nice and has a streamlined interface and plays fluidly, also it has not crashed on me so far.On the other hand currently it is just too easy, yes opposing powers declare war on you but that is all they do, they do not even attempt to attack, and if you do a counterstrike after just one fallen system they call for a truce.Also as son as you developed the cruiser you will win every spacebattle as it seems no matter how long you play the AI never builds anything stronger then destroyers, and a shielded cruiser kills tons of destroyers without even breaking a sweat. So with 2-3 ships you wipe out the enemy spacefleet of 20-30 small ships in one battle and thats it for them. I played MOO and MOO2 just recently and there if someone declares war, on the next turn they turn up with a spacefleet on your doorstep.Also it does not really seam to make a difference if you specialize your planets as over time you can build everything you have on every planet. And the planet overview is terrible there need to be a list what you have built and not only a planet you have to scroll around and search to find your installations, even if you can build all some buildings make it easier to build others so it would be nice to see that, because after you own 10-20 planets you just loose the overview what you are building.Same with the research tree, apart from the few times when you have to choose what to build after you complete a research there is no problem researching everything there is.Diplomacy is hardly implemented right now, and really is not needed as you can pound the AI into the ground as soon as you get cruisers, and the AI wont attack you anyway. Same for the councilmeetings, most of the time all the parties withhold their votes, and even if there is an alliance you are so strong that you have more votes then the 2 together. Not sure if it is intended or a bug, but the AI seems to lie on a few times I had 2 or 3 parties who vowed to vote for me and when the meeting came they either withheld or voted for the other candidate. The worst of all are the GNN news updates, the robot does not only look annoying he also sounds like a C64 doing some text to voice. That is too bad as some of the ticker news are quite funny (if not relevant to the game itself).A bright spot is that the original MOO are included if you do not have them already.If there were a neutral vote I would give it for now.But considering the price and the dumbed down AI I will give it a thumbs down for now.

Early Access Review
								Early Access Review:I played MOO and MOO 2 A LOT up till very recently. MOO 3 was a train wreck that had good intensions but just was a horrible implementation. Seems this version is slowly going down the MOO 3 path with a glossy version of MOO 2 graphics slapped on top.   Graphics are good for a 4x game, sounds ok I guess but I do not play these games for a good soundtrack. In fact I play with them muted as it is about tactics and what you are going to do next turn not how nice the alien leader sounds. They spent way too much time and money worrying about that when the gameplay is lackluster.To start star lanes really make it so easy and unplayable. Basically defend 2 planets and you are good to go. There are definite choke points which make those systems critical.  Combat, ah combat. Pre beta people that are younger wanted real time combat. True MOO fans that are older and enjoy the tactical nature of turn based obviously didn't. Well they went real time, but not really. You just build a fleet, and click fight. Trying to do any sort of maneuvers or tactical layout really doesn't matter. You can try as I did, but you will find out that in the end is useless. The combat system is a glorified combat viewer of the simulation. Once you realize that just skip combat. But wait, you want to control your ships, this system and game doesn't really allow for it to make a difference or change the outcome much at all. So sad, they could have done a really nice turn based or even a put in your moves and both sides move and fire same time type of setup and would have worked well for this game. As it stands this game ""combat"" just doesn't stand out from anything else in the 4x world of games and thus they missed their chance. The races seem to be missing their big differences that existed in MOO and MOO2. I have played most and they all seem the same. You research the same, build the same, build same type of fleets, etc.  I would have preferred if each race really did well on one type of planet type, or you could take pros and cons like in MOO 2 where you can customize each race. I cannot nail it down but they all seem very generic with a different skin. The ship builder looks nice and works well but again is really useless as the whole combat system really doesn't work. Since real time combat just isn't meant for this type of game the upgrades to weapons with fire arcs and such just won’t see the light of day when you can just cram on more weapons in same space without having to worry about such mundane details which made MOO 2 much better. They need more areas of the map that affect game play like nebula, super large asteroid fields, etc that affect areas of the map differently. Adding those would add a lot of depth to the map and gameplay.As mentioned on the discussion board AI is just awful. As much as I hear people say, ""just play multiplayer and your problem is solved"", have you tried to play and FINISH a 4x multiplayer game?  I have maybe finished 5 in my lifetime. Most games with 4 people, 1 will drop early, 1 will get run over for various reasons and drop out, thus leaving 2 people who then you hope have the time to play out the game over the next few days/weeks. But invariably 1 of the 2 will drop out making the game you vs. the AI in the end. So the single player game has to be somewhat resilient to keep me engaged between multiplayer matches. This game doesn't even come close, period. As AI programming is a bit of a hobby for me, this game makes me want to cry how someone is paid to create an AI and this is what they came up with. If the game wasn't ready for beta, then delay, and delay again. Any sort of alpha test would have found or shown most of these issues.  AND IF the development team would listen to the outside alpha testers the game could be fixed. My guess is another development studio thought they knew best and missed the boat on this one. The best games I have played in the past many years are games that change and adapt to its core player base. Because if they are somewhat happy, they spread the word, others come and like the game and lo and behold you have a hit. This game seems to rest on the past IP glory and hope to make millions on people like me that paid and hoped for more but got a lot less. I would at this time NOT recommend this game unless combat, star lanes and AI are fixed which may take a more in depth rewrite than this publisher has time/money.I will change/update review after some major patches/final release comes out and things have changed, hopefully. :) "

								At the current stage, game is too easy and simplistic. If you b-line your research towards cruisers and build a few of them, by the turn ~100, you can start demanding colonies from AI. Just pick the weakest rival, ask for their colonies one at the time. They will accept. After that, skip a turn and do the same for second weakest rival. After 10 or so turns, all AI opponents have 1 colony left and you own the rest. There is absolutely 0 challenge in the game at the current stage. AI is fully passive and does not really take advantage of their tech or position. You can win the game in 150 turns with glass cannon strategy. Capturing the planets is ridiculously stupid. You need to build troop transports which magically vanish after you take a planet. That seems just an arbitrary rule to limit the speed of conquest. That's why it's easier to just diplomatically annex your enemies and bombard the hell out of the last colony instead of conquering with troop transports.Game is so much dumbed down that for a player with years of experience in strategy games, there is nothing to be seen after you've heard all the voice acting. Even that the voice acting is done very well, it starts to repeat itself and you just skip all talking you can. There is no connection between you as a player, and the ""empire"" you're running. It is just another turn away from evident victory. Even if  you try to play ""stupid"", there is no challenge. Hopefully they fix the game prior  to full release and add some challenge. I will be anxiously waiting for updates to see if this game turns out to be the 4x game which it should be.			"

								4X games are my favorite genre... and they are also the most disappointing.The universe should be a vast place full of profound variety and diversity.... not walking, talking bears, birds, cats and lizards. The gameplay mechanics are very simple, and each race feels nearly identical to the next as far as gameplay goes. There is no variance in the tech trees available from one race to the next; ship design is a simple numbers game, and combat is an uninspired affair. As it stands, there is no replay value, and based on the way the game currently presents, it is highly unlikely that the game will develop any replay value before it is stamped as a ""finished product"".I recognize that this is an early access project, but at this time, the mechanics of the game are so simplistic that I doubt it will gain any weight between now and launch.Unless you're looking for a very simple 4X experience, one designed for kids, look elsewhere; the $49.99 price point is certainly not justified.

								While promising, Master of Orion is missing key elements to make it a true successor to it's namesake.Races The game is going to have 10 races in the final release, six of which are playable now. These are the ten races of Master of Orion I, and include the Bird-like Alkari, the Bear-warrior Bulrathi, boring old Humanity, the Cat-like Mrrshan, the subterranean lizard Sakkra, and the scientific Psilon-- with the Ant-like Klackon, Rocky Silicoid, Mechanical Meklar and secretous Darloks planned for a later release. Missing are the Trilarians, Elerians, and Gnolam.each of the races are drastically different from their originals, and overly diluted in characteristics. Rather than a race that is tuned in to it's heritage, each one must play more as a generalist instead of  focusing on a single strength or two.The Alkari, for example, were originally highly effective in combat in space, and masters of propulsion-- a function of their evolutionary history with flight. Now, they have a 25% defensive bonus to certain combat scenarios, the end.the Sakkra were the masters of overwhelming populations, able to reach twice as high populations thanks to their ability to live both on and below a planet's surface. Now? They grow a little bit faster. ResearchAn important mechanic of the MoO universe has always been research. New technologies, and important research decisions: Do you want to use the new Fusion technology to upgrade you ship bombs, engines, or beam weapons? This sort of decision made decisions critical, and brought diplomacy to a monumental forefront in the game. It wasn't just about which tech you chose, it was about which tech you let your opponents have. The Psilon used to have a special racial characteristic: While they sucked at most things due to their frail nature, their brilliant minds allowed them to capture all these options instead of just one-- and use these technologies to surpass their enemies. But the tech-tree has been redesigned such that technological decisions are few and far between, and the Psilon's unique advantage has been replaced with a flat bonus to research. The GalaxyIn the original MoO games, travel took time and fuel. If a star was close enough, you could reach it. If not, you did not go there. Later in the game, you could travel from any star directly to any other star, if fuel allowed. You expanded your reach by building colonies and outposts, or by researching new fuel technologies. This entire system has been scrapped in favor of a starlane system, with each star acting as a node-- and if you can navigate there, you can go anywhere in the galaxy from level one. The advantages of this system are, presumably, greater strategy-- creating choke points around the galaxy to protect your territory from opponents. Military bases can be built to ""blockade"" ends of starlanes, for example, from enemy travel. But it destroys the open feeling of space present in MoO2, and is completely not worth it. The current version of the game includes pirate raiders who will occaisionally attack, forcing you to keep a few ships handy to quickly dispense them as an annoyance-- and a few stationary space monsters like a Giant Squid, Eel, or the Guardian of Orion-- usually guarding a particularly nice planet. There are a few scripted events and anomalies, but not nearly enough to keep the game interesting just yet.Final VerdictThis game shows promise of being true to the Master of Orion Spirit, but I am concerned that the scope will not go deep enough to make it worthy of the name. MoO fans from the original series will find the game fun for a few hours in it's current state, but the lack of complexity and depth really prevent this game from being the huge hit it may become if the developers revise the systems they've created to make it more like the original. The controls also are unintuitive for now, space combat is boring and unmeaningful, and ground combat is non-existent. Voice acting shows promise, but has way too much repetition. ""I used to be an adventurer like you, but then I took an arrow to the knee"" kind of repetition, only 1000 times worse. But if the developers do what they should, this game definitely belongs on any 4X fan's wishlist. But as is, it feels too much like Civilization and not enough like Masters of Orion.Will continue to update throughout the game's development, and if the game ever reaches a fun state for non-MoO fans, I'll give it a thumbs up.

								Combat is very basic and disappointing. The battles are real time, and you have very little control over your fleets, so there aren't any real tactical choices to be made. Select ship, click enemy ship, unpause, and hope you win. Loved the original MOO2, but this new iteration is highly disappointing so far.			"

								I first got Master of Orion because I thought it looked interesting.After playing Stellaris, however, I realized how much Master of Orion lacks in content by comparison.Combat in Master of Orion is a hit or miss and doesn't feel tactical at all.  It's basically the ""I have more ships"" or ""My ships are bigger than yours, therefore I win"" strategy.In it's current state, Master of Orion leaves a lot to be desired.			"

												Problems with the game are design based, while not completely bad it just makes the game not have enough 'fun'.  It is a 4X game but it's like a casual 4X game as there aren't any real hard decisions to make and everything is kind of bland.  For those that have played Starbase Orion in iOS, I feel like that game has more 4X/strategy than this game.			"

Early Access Review
								I've played very little of this game so far, less than 1 full hour, but 2 things already are disturbing as far as how I see this game ending up. Yes this is a Beta, benefit of doubt and all but I'm wondering how many of the shortcomings I see being resolved in 3 or 4 months since the flaws appear to be part of the overall plan.I hate turn limits in 4X games. So here we go:CONS:1) A turn limit. Doesn't matter that it's a rather large 500, it's there and I hate turn limits, feels like board game I'd play with my 9 year old ""ok, we'll play 10 turns then back to homework"". WHY is there a turn limit??? Just kills the whole feeling of.. something, I dunno. 2) Small number of systems on ""Large"" which in itself is ok I guess, but unfortunately each system only hold 1 or 2 planets. The game feels teeny tiny already. 3) The Pathways to each system. I honestly don't get why game designers would opt for this route (no pun intended). It works in only 1 game series that I know of, ""Sins of a Solar Empire"" and that's because that game is so freaking stressful and fast that you need choke points from paths otherwise you'd go insane. But in a turn based open space game, it's a flaw to me.And yes, people will argue that some of the earlier games we loved used paths to systems, still, today with current tech and the state of gaming and computer hardware an all that, it feels weak, like a crutch that the designers couldn't figure out how to overcome. 4) Lack of rotating view (view angle, rotating clockwise/counterclockwise). Make it feels smallish again and rather outdated. If they at least let us alter the view a touch to get a sense on the galaxy from any direction or height level. A bit nitpicky, but I guess it irrites me a bit.Pros:1) Runs smooth at max detail (there isn't much detail so this is to be expected)2) UI and gameplay is clean and jumps from location to location easily upon orders being needed in certain places.Summary: Feels like a highly scaled back Sins of Solar Empire remake but with turns and without the 3D view and all the cool 3D fleets and effects and much less planetary building options. If you've never play another 4x space game before this will probably make you happy, but for someone who has played everything from MOO1 to Sins, to Stardrive1,2 to Distant Worlds universe, and a dozen or more recent titles that I can't even think of this second. Any game where I basically lose interest under and hour, doesn't bode well for me. I'm willing to stick it out until release, but I think the kicker and what set me off on writing this review is that dumb turn limit thing staring at me. Ugh. I hate turn limits in 4X games.			"

								I was thrilled with the news that the MOO license was acquired and that it would see the light of day once again. I stubbornly watched the progress of development and saw them water down design choices. But I decided to get it anyway. So after 5 finished games I say that loosely since the game finished for me after 500 turns.... Here are my thought on the EA & Full Release.Pros:-Good voice acting (even so, money spent on better things..)-Feels like master of orion universe.-UI not terrible.-*Space combat looks good (needs to be fleshed out)-Multiplayer-Ship design and upgrade system. (needs to be able to upgrade with production not just money.)Cons:-Races dont seem to be too unique. (customization to come?)-Starlanes. Give me free movnment. (Why? just why? Even with endgame tech galaxy movnment is slow and a chore.)-AI too easy, Should be improved later in EA. Better in Release but not great.-Turn limit (500 Turns really? I dont want game to end before I meet victory conditions or exterminate everyone.) *fixed in latest patch with victory condition additions.-*Space Combat need to be improved. The realtime combat is not that bad but the need to actuallty control your ships needs to be included. Currently a ""Disable AI"" button is not functional so you ships just charge in and do what they want. *Was improved but still feels off.Wells thats my limited take on MOO so far. Hopefully improvnments will be made in before the full release. Should you buy it? Only if you go in not expected a MOO1 or MOO2. It tries but comes off as a generic 4x thus far. Fun maybe but thats all in the eye of the beholder.			"

								As a MOO 1 and 2 veteran I have certain standards when it comes to space strategy games. I feel as though this could be a good revival-making the MOO 3 disaster dissapear and reawakening what made MOO 2 great. Here is my biggest issue thus far with the game. The combat, make it turn based like MOO 2 or risk being like ANY OTHER space strat which just requires that we watch a battle unfold. Undo that feature and you will have a lot more up votes and a lot more support.			"

								**This is a review written as the game was just released in EARLY ACCESS. Developers will improve many things before the final release.First of all, I have never played MOO before so I am unable to compare the game with its predecessors. So my perspective when evaluating the game is one where I'm mainly comparing it to other modern 4X titles.In that regard, I have to say that both Endless Space and Stardrive 1/2 seem like better options for the reasons stated by other reviewers.

								For an early access title it's pretty good, as a successor to the MoO series it fits, but as a 4x strategy game there's nothing particularly interesting or innovative about it.  It has all the required features of a 4x space game: tech tree unlocks ship and planet upgrades that advance the economy and the military,  citizen mangement system, diplomatic interface that allows trading of resources and tech. My gripe is that there's nothing new. Nothing to make this game any more interesting than any other entry in the 4x field. It looks nice, there's good voice acting, there's cute news reports, but it doesn't feel like a new game, just a reskin of the old ones.  It's fine, and if you're nostalgic for MoO, you'll enjoy it.  I'm hoping that a lot more fundamental features get added to the game before release.  Especially in the tactical side of combat, where it's pretty much 'watch the visualization' or 'don't watch the visualization'. The one notable exception to the lack of innovation is that with some tech upgrades you have to choose which benefit you get instead of unlocking all the benefits of that tech level.  I'd actually like to see this expanded to encompass every tech, which would do a lot to make the game stand out in the genre.  "

								A.I. and comat are not existent in this EA release.The promised changes are a ""long term plan"" and focus on balancing, where there is no mechanic from the start.Devs already told us they will leave most of the ""fine work"" for modders.This is all it will be.Start a huge map, may A.I. opponents, click on next turn 200 times, win the game. time consumed 1,5 hours. Greatness again not achieved.Edit: A lot of patches later...A.I. is still not able to do anything that would challange a gamer. Colonys are mismanaged, fleets are send around seemingly without reason. It seems that the A.I. is not able to understand the game and unable to playn ahead in diplomacy. Sad.The fight system was discussed and discussed. Dev through in ""ideas"" and started ""pro-con-discussions"". All in all the tactical combat is still gone and the wants-to-be-RTS has gotten a pause function.The problem that there is no combat system, just ships flying at each other on a straight line shooting is not worked on at all. Combat system is still no RTS and it is definitly not tactical. It might as well be a loading screen when auto-resolving a fight.To not only be negative: We now have several new features such as races and espionage. Content is nice, but teh game remains to easy, because teh A.I. is still horrible at it and has no combat system at all.			"

												A bland game chock-full of uninteresting choices and frustrating limitations. Despite months of EA, and lots of great feedback from players, the devs made only minor changes to the game, and have now released the full game with most of its original flaws intact. I have played a number of partial games, throughout the EA process, but haven't yet had the heart to finish one.A few of the many unnecessary flaws and limits:- Why can't I put multiple layers of armor on a ship? Multiple shield generators? Multiple engines? Where Stardrive 2, Star Ruler 2, and Endless Space give you real freedom in ship design, MoO seems determined to limit my imagination.- Why can I design combat ships, but not stations or civilian ships? Again, where Star Ruler 2 allows wonderful freedom in design, MoO creates unnecessary limits.- Tactical battles just aren't real tactical. This is a deep and complex problem, too complex to outline here, but there are many deep and thoughtful discussions of this topic in the forums.- The tech tree is bland, full of lots of incremental improvements, but rarely anything that feels interesting or meaningful. The game plays (almost) the same from start to finish.- Planetary special resources are piddly, giving a simple +1 or +2 to research/money/production. This means that, except in the very beginning of the game, there's no reason to choose a planet with a special resource over one without. This is a huge missed opportunity.For sure, there's some fun to be found in this game, but with such a bland design, there's little replay value. And in this age of gaming, with so many better choices around, why waste your time with something so bland?If you really want a space-based 4x game, go for Stardrive 2 or Star Ruler 2. Both are a bit buggy, products of small teams stretched to their limits, but both are also full of genius and innovation - and that genius makes both these games far more fun and interesting than MoO.

								This game needs a lot more content... It misses half the races, but at this point they are for 90% cosmetic. This needs to be redone.The development team has stated that the game core mechanics are already implemented and that rather minor changes will be added till the full release.(PS Also don't let me start about combat... the tactical mode.... but it's alpha so that is forgiven)Also changing the civ/endless legend style of research, every race has the same tech tree. In MoO1 you could have some randomness in research as it made each playthrough a little different, you could be UP or OP. Come on developers, be innovative. FRAK look at Stellaris??(not exactly same type of game but humongeous amount of content)It has potential so i bought it, but in it's current state, I would preffer Endless space. Cross that, waiting for Stellaris. For now a thumbs down, I will update the review when/if something changes since I've read that the core gameplay won't change...  PS Dont look at gameplay time since I've played a lot more before buying it. Call it a Demo run.			"

								Please remove starlanes.. I can't believe this was resurrected from that great abortion MoO3. No one gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥about choke points ... in SPACE.. Also, take a note from the musical score of MoO2. It was epic and mysterious... the soundtrack of this new one just sounds cliched for the genre, exploring the stars with so much child-like whimsy. For races, how about making the human homeworld earth, along with a special planet design that looks like, well, earth.  Tech is cool, AI diplomacy is a little simple, graphics are pretty nice.  The Psilons should look more Psilony (MoO 1) and less Roger the Alien from American Dad. Final Note, for the love of god please don't make this a GalCiv clone.The whole game is the most dumbed down of the four, even beating out the originals simplicity.  Don't buy, just wait for Stellaris to come out from Paradox.  It's what MoO should have been.https://www.paradoxplaza.com/stellaris "

								For a new 4x space strategy, their is nothing innovative or unique about this game that has not already been done in prior 4x space strategy games over the last two decades.  At best, this game is a MOO2 remake with some simplistic GalCiv2 elements.  MOO suffers from some severe gameplay imbalances:  1) random events can wreck your entire empire within a few turns, leaving you open and exposed to attack by AI; 2) Space Pirates can respawn on the same planet that you just nuked, one turn later; 3) AI will ask for/demand peace, then instantly attack the very next turn.  Lastly, like MOO2, the AI is predictable and a tech rush will always win the long game.With the upcoming release of Stellaris at a $40US price tag, MOO is in deep deep trouble since it can not even compete with Paradox's newest 4x *grand* space strategy due out May 9.  This game is not worth the $50US for early access, and even when complete, will be little more than a modern remake of MOO2.  Sadly, I can't help but feel as if this game is nothing more than a franchise name money grab.			"

								Like others have said, the AI in this is so poor that the current mode of game play should not be call normal, but instead call newbie mode.  To share some of the issues, I was playing Psilons and my neighbors were humans, I had completed the tech tree and holds 445 votes, enough to vote myself in to finish the game, they were number two and had 76 votes, their best ship was a crusier, I am fielding doom star, titan, battleships...etc, so what do they do? Hey Psilon, give us this system or else, I said...hell no, so they declare war!!  Really?So why do I have 445 votes and am so much more advance compare to them?   Well, cause they wont expand.  There were 3 computer players left , human holds 5 systems, and the other two has 2 systems each...  We were playing on default mode, circular galaxy, so there were literally 30+ systems that were vacant, but they never bother to expand.  I was holding on to about 10 systems, the galaxy is a big place,  but if they wont expand and wont develop new tech, probably slow development due to not expanding in the first place, the only way I can see a player losing is to do exactly the same, and just send scout ships to map the universe and never expand beyond the first world.I know it is Early Access, but at this point I would say the game isn't really playable, at least not in a war game sense of playable.  I am not saying hey just make it impossible and auto spawn fleets for AI and ignore command points like Moo1 does, but tuning the AI a few notches just so that a NORMAL game would feel normal.As it stands today, this is not something worthy to be call MOO, more like a dumb down version of Galatic Civilzation meets Ascendancy.

								The game is very pretty. It is polished visually, but that is about all it does better than previous games.Early game is fun when turns are short. Turn time increases at an alarming rate as you grow, if you want to keep your empire as productive as possible. It's similar to MoO2 in that respect, but MoO CTS is even worse in this area. A few examples:You must manage all your colonies one at a time; with a 5 long queue; which can only be accessed in each separate colony. Almost the same as MoO2 (which had a 7 slot queue).Pollution works as in MoO2; reduces production. However, the system is different in that you need to manually manage the pollution with clean-up projects. Not fun with large empires.Population movement between colonies is done 1 at a time by building tranports. A very time consuming process, but necessary as colonies don't grow unless supported by population influx. Fine in small empires; not in large.Each colony must manage food separately (cannot send food to other colonies), and production output per worker is variable (more production for first worker), so population management is much more complex than in MoO2 where you simply set enough on food; all on production/research depending on richness.It might sound fun, and it can be in small empires. It does however not scale for large empires; where you have multiple colonies growing every turn requiring you to check each and every one of them, if that colonist is doing what he should be doing.Between turns, you must watch all visible enemy ships moving and fighting one at a time instead of all simultaneously, increasing turn time even more.Diplomacy and Espionage are arguably not as important as in previous MoOs; largly because of the changed research system.Research is linear much like in Civ 5 with a few techs where you must choose between 2-3 different options ('choice techs').The only techs that can change hands (via diplomacy or espionage) are the 'choice techs'. This means you can never advance your research by spying, and you can also never catch up in research by trading.The reason for this review is that it's becoming more and more apparent, that they are creating the game for those that like the game as is; pointing to steam reviews being mostly positive, so everything is fine in their eyes. The problems listed above are non-issues to them.Only buy this game if you like it for what it is now. Don't expect it to change.			"

												11/1/2016Note that one issue that detracted from my enjoyment of this game is being addressed by the developer (the tedium of the polution mechanics). This is a step in the right direction. I'll have to stand by my experience with this game up to now which was overall mediocre. But if the game looks interesting to you, I would consider it a safe bet. Even if it's not quite there at the moment, it's definitely heading that way. Moreover, the developers are making radical changes to imrpove the *base game*. That means a lot to me. Many other, less admirable developers would make these improvements an excuse to release paid DLC for their game. But not this one. This developer is doing right by their customers. Support them.8/27/2016I've updated my review online with the first Let's Play video for the release version of the game. I outline my concerns and my hopes going forward with this game. I conditionally recommend this game, but overall (until I've spent some time playing it in its current form) will remain a thumbs down for the average consumer. 


YouTube™ Video: Master of Orion Let's Play 1 | Discussing Space 4x Genre and MOO's Place In It 

			Views: 717		

			In this episode/review, I begin the first few turns of the Sakkra Brood in Master of Orion. Skip to 17:20 to bypass game setup and introduction.		

8/11/2016I'm still on the fence with the current state of the game, but I will say this: between MOO and its primary alternative: Stellaris, MOO shows much more promise as far as becoming a great game. I look forward to enjoying MOO. Alas, I think Stellaris is no longer interested in become better than it is now, which is not really any better or worse than MOO as it is now. See the difference, though? MOO has growth potential.3/27/2016The game is much more enjoyable than initial release. Before, I could barely play an hour before getting bored. I'm still overall a ""no"" on the game but I hope it continues along the current path. If so, I expect to change this review to a ""yes"". But my criticism below still stand. Tactical combat is better now and actually is interesting and allows me more controls and choices. Before it really seemed rather arbitrary. Regardless, I STILL WANT FUEL RANGES. This would pace expansion and make it scale with research priorities.2/28/2016At this point, I don't recommend MOO. The graphics and asthetic are great and go a LONG way to make me like this game. It's very lovingly crafted. But there are some things that keep me from really being interested beyond playing 1 hour.First, the game lacks the range limitation that came from fuel tank technology in MOO2. Apparently, as long as it doesn't get destroyed, your scout ship can move from one side of the galaxy to the other. Logistical range really added a great element of balance and decision making in MOO2. If you needed to prioritize expansion, you had to research it to reach new stars. If you needed to turtle, you'd postpone it. I'm really missing this element. Instead it has been replaced with ""unstable warp points"". That's ok, but it's definitely not the same.Next, I can't see any situation where you don't research all the lowest techs first before moving to the next teir. You would never want to ignore lesser research to go to higher research because if you do, the AI will outpace you militarily while you're saving up for something else. Anyway, especially in the early game, it feels pointless to skip a tier 1 tech to rush a teir 2. Later down the line maybe you can...The research tree as it is now is also rather uninspiring. CIV:BE and Polaris Sector both innovated the CIV style research tree in a way that feels much more appropriate to a science fiction setting.I'm still waiting to see how alien assimilation and race bonuses work. I would like to see meaningful reasons for both purging an alien population and assimilating one depending on a player's overall global strategy. Enslavement (not killing but not allowing to reproduce) would also be a welcome option. And of course, the ability to change one's mind throughout the course of the game.There are a few minor issues I won't mention because surely they will be fixed. The one I will mention is that you have different ship models you can use as well as patterns. That's great, but in the build queue they all look the same. In MOO2 you could see at a glance the different ship designs in the build menu. It's a minor thing, but it *always* throws me off.I really want to like this game. But *as of this moment* it's not very fun and definitely not worth the price.			"

												Being a huge fan of the 4X genre and having played an endless list of 4X games, like Master of Orion 2+3, GalCiv 1-3, Sword of the Stars 1+2, Endless Space, Distant Worlds, StarDrive 1+2 and many more and even supporting upcoming games like Predestination, I really wanted to like this. Unfortunately it is a huge disappointment, serving a dumbed down 4X experience totally out of touch with why people still enjoy turn based games, for instance considering the recent huge success of XCOM. Sure, they got it to look almost as pretty as XCOM, but all the research and a lot of the ship systems you could add in MoO2 are not to be found, because they went for simple RTS combat implementation. Combat is ridiculously simple and vastly inferior to great RTS space games like SotS, Homeworld or Battlefleet Gothic: Armada. Combat, ship technologies and ship design in this game feels more like an insult to fans of the genre and few games makes ship design as meaningless and combat as dumb as it is in this game. This mass selecting clickfest where kiting the AI is basically the only ""advanced"" technique at your disposal is just not appealing to guys used to much more juicy space combat offerings both currently and in the past.I recommend that you save your money for one of the other more recent 4X space games (Stellaris, Galactic Civilizations III, Predestination, and many more worthy of your cash), which offers a much more satisfying strategy game experience either turn based or RTS. I will revisit this review an edit if if they update the game to be more fun. If they add turn based tactical combat with ship initiative in some future DLC, this game would finally be a worthy successor of MoO2 and I would probably be able to recommend it.			"

								The game looks good, sounds good. As it is in early access the playability is very poor and I would recommend anyone interested in this game to wait for a while before purchasing.I am a huge fan of master of orion 1 and a very part time player of master of orion 2.I play for the ship design and combat side of the game, if you do too, do not purchase thisgame as it is a massive let down. I regret the purchase.			"

								I've been waiting patiently to write this and I may revise this upon the game being completed, but I doubt it.When I heard they were remaking this game I was so stoked. Michael Dorn and Mark Hamill are doing voices as well, that's awesome! Bought into the early access and played the game, thought it was good. Beautiful, great sound and all my favorite races were back. The problem is each time I play it I find I'm less and less interested. The game seems to forgo deeper strategy for a glossy polish that simply makes the replayability slip and fall on it's♥♥♥♥♥ The combat is kinda fun, but I found myself simming through battles more and more. The only time I can remember doing that in Moo 2 was near the end and I had a gross number of doom stars and didn't want to watch every stellar converter animation tear my opponent apart. My choices don't feel like they matter in combat, and you know who will win by the difficulty bar before it begins.The colony managment is a little better, but growth based off food supply doesn't seem to make much sense. Does having an abundance of food make my population sexually agressive? No freighters either so forget about colonizing that terrible radiated world that happens to have gems on it using food farmed somewhere else...Tech tree seems really streamlined. By that I mean it's pretty boring. Different weapons don't ""feel"" different. They get a little blastier as you go, a little more green or blue, but nothing substantial enough to make a mark on your memory like some of the weapons in Moo 2.Maybe that's not fair, this is a good 4x game, but every person who has played Moo 2 will have their opinion colored by their previous experiences with that game. Maybe they shouldn't have called it Master of Orion. The biggest problem with this game is I've already forgotten I own it and likely won't pick it up again. In contrast, if I'm flipping through my old CD book looking at old titles and find my copy of Moo 2. I usually spend that evening ignoring my wife and conquering the galaxy. I just don't see the staying power that title enjoyed.So congrats, you cashed in on my nostalgia and made a decent game, but I wouldn't expect people to be talking about in... wow has it really been 20 years? God I'm old.			"

								I just backspaced out of 10 paragraphs of valid reasons why this game sucks. I don't even care enough to post because devs are close minded/short sighted in their old age. They should've just remade MOO2 with better sound and graphics and left the genre alone for another 20 years. Sad, that they didn't. So sad.			"

												EDIT: son bought the game (yay). He can't start a single player game, nor join or create a multi-player one. (boo). No one helping on the tech forums (full of people with issues no responses from devs) (boo again)____just...damn.I nearly cried playing this, it brought back so many memories of playing MOO2 with friends. The art, play style, everything, is a perfect homage to the classic. This is a long overdue overhaul imo and worth more than I paied for it. Buy the collectors edition imo, it was worth it for the retro style fleets and terran race choice.I can't wait to get my 10 yo playing it so we can conquer the galaxy together. (or destroy each other, never know :))This is what most MOO2 players expected from MOO3 I believe. It certainly is what I was hoping for way back when. And this game delivers. Seems stable as well, I haven't played long (yet) but no crashes or graphics glitches or anything.Devs, well done and thank you for doing this right.EDIT post playing some: I think the lack of multiplayer combat like moo2 is a double edge sword. makes the game go by much faster but yeah, misses something too.

												Originally, I had this game as a ""do not buy"" due to a now fixed issue with the wait cursor freezing up the game around turns 45 - 70. Thankfully, the developers have sent through a patch to correct the problem.Now, on to the game itself. It's a definite improvement of the prequels. Graphics, sound, and game play are all pretty good. Nice choices for celebrity voice actors. Another improvement is not being hindered early in the game by basic engine technology limiting where you can go on the map; now it just defines how fast you can travel to a destination.No complaints worth mentioning. Still might be a little expensive, especially considering that there's going to be some DLC soon, but if it's on sale, I'd recommend picking it up.			"

												*Edited february 2017*I cant recommend this game anymore as looks It has been abandoned by wg and NGD. And its not finished yet. Shameful.First: It's early access. This is the main consideration if you're going to buy. Its not done yet.My opinion in shortVery polished and with great future if the devs give the game some love (it's EA, remember). Nice visuals, nice and clear UI and pleasant screens. Combat its Rts. Not done yet, now looks like a placeholder. But with potential.I liked MOO, MOO2.I like stardrive 2In fact I like many 4xAnd I like this new Master of Orion. I'm ready to give them a chance to make a great game.			"

												As a player of Master of Orion II i was very happy about a remake for this best 4x game known to me.I have hoped, that the new Mater of Orion will be the same good than the original game, but with better graphics.The graphics may be better, but some of the gameplay changes have made this game worse:1. The new pollution system is much worse than in the original game and needs much more micromanagemant and unneccessary work on every single planet.2. The Antarans have now become annoying as hell and have made this game with their extremeley increased strength almost unplayable.3. The game is bugged. I was newer able to play this game to the end, because always after many truns, during the start of an antarans invasion, the game turn doesn't and.Als long as this the Antarans ai turn not ending bug isn't fixed, this game can't be recommended.

												EDIT 19 Feb 2017 - I cant recommend this game anymore.Besides several smaller gameplay bugs, Something is wrong with the optimization of the game, because i cant play it on large or huge maps as it becomes unplayable after the mid game. Once you hit the end turn button it takes for ever for end turn to process. So unless you like to play on very small maps (even the ""large"" ones arent too large in this game), the game becomes unplayable.Just for reference, my PC runs stellaris, Galactic civilizations 3 and other games without issue.But the reason im changing this review to Not recommended, is that the developers seem to have abandoned the game completely. They dont interact in forums, no future patch announcements, nothing.Its a damn shame really. This would be a nice game, if only it worked as intended.EDIT 11 Dec. 2016:More bugs have shown up in the game, some of them quite annoying! I wont change the review to ""not recommended"" because it IS a good game, and because the developers have been releasing patches and fixing problems regularly, but i will advice you to:Hold your purchase, check the forums first to see if the current issues have been fixed!This is a great 4X game with the perfect ammount of comlexity. It not so complex that you need to ""study"" how to play it for hours, or have to spend endless hours in micromanagement, while also not too simple as to make it simplistic or boring.It had some issues (bugs) in previous versions, but the latest patches have ironed out most of them. To me, its strongest points (what i like most) is:- The balance of complexity vs simplicity- The UI is very well tought out, intuitive and easy to use.- Graphics & cinematics are just beautiful. Probably the best ibe seen in a 4X game.- Music and sound is also very good. They keep the ambiance going.- The races are varied and interesting.The game is great. But you know whats even better? The Developers behind it. Unlike most other companies, these developers participate in the forums to help, update the game constantly, and even offer new features for free, where as other devs would try to sell them to you as some DLC [cough! paradox cough!].If you like 4X/space games, do your self a favor and get this one!

												Revised since EA:TLDR, still no tactical combat option, the whole pollution mechanic is a major fun-killer, and the 'warp lanes' choice has really made it less than satisfying experience overall.  My EA recommendation is being changed now to a NO.  It's not a bad game.  It's just not MoO w/o at least a turn-based tactical combat option.  And, it's a simplistic 4x compared w/ so many others today.  The graphics and voices were great.  I'm not even upset about DLC races.  But, it's NOT MoO.  It's a MoO-basic.  I'll pass at this point.EA Review:So many good things about this game so far.  It is definitely early access--reduced races, weak AI (only average is available at this point), typical diplomacy issues for civ games (not clear there's the threat of war if you don't accept an offer, etc.), and similar minor issues.  But the game plays well so far and is true to the genre.  It's GalCiv w/ better graphics and smoother gameplay--but warp points and paths instead of freeform movement.  It's a different approach.  You can certainly better limit access to your homeworlds--but, you don't have the constant feel of threat either.I haven't found a ship design feature--and that's good, b/c the game is more 4x, less tweaking your loadout on each vessel.  Again, it's a different approach, and this one I prefer b/c the races that exist and ship designs are very cool and just as I pictured from the MOO past.The voice overs are fabulous.  The graphics are very nice.  Sound is nice.My only real complaint at this point is an RTS approach to combat instead of Turnbased as in MOO2.  For me, this is a real disappointment.  It isn't a 'No' at this point--there is still hope they'll add it before release, or promise it as an expansion option or dlc.  But, it isn't MOO2.  It isn't even a good RTS--even w/ a pause feature.  I find myself auto-resolving all combats b/c of it (i.e., 'Simulate' instead of 'Tactical').  That really makes it a different take on GalCiv III instead of MOO.Good game so far.  But, wait for 3 months until it releases if Turn-based combat is a big deal to you.Hope this is helpful!			"

												I am am an old gamer that grew up with the original MOO. We never had these fancy alpha accesses like you kids get. Back in my day you got 15 floppies a flip pad intro book and a prayer that it would work. When this project was released I jumped at the opportunity. MOO reimagined OMG MOO!!!!The game is growing, alpha access is just that. The devs have a vision, its to stay true to the original concept and develop a MOO that pays homage to the original. They arent there but they are well on thier way. The game does play close to a civ type game, its relaxing, its fun, its engaging. While in the 4x category the original MOO wasnt a 4x, it focused on empire building. Newer tacticle combat is just that newer, dont make me pull out the back in my day again...The game is looking good at this point. The devs are making a true MOO game and will probably start adding more of the details the community wants like strat crap but honestly those arent the original fans. Those voices are those that grew up in the true 4x genre. I hope the devs continue with thier vision and make a truly great experience that lives up to the original.**Updating my review to a NO! The game had potential and it was something I was so excited about. However the developer rushed the game out, and is locking races behind pay walls. Its sad that they original MOO had so much and now here we are in 2016 where half games get baked and sold. I wont play this game or buy from the developer or anyone related to the development of this game to ensure I dont support these type of antics. My review now is a HELL NO			"

												I have had this gamem for a while now, and there are a lot of things I really do like about it. The game looks better that MOO2 (I'm going to try to forget that MOO3 never existed...)  The technology tree is fine, the custom race options have been improved.  Diplomacy is better, espionage is improved.  Game play is fine too.  In fact, there are really only 2 things that bother me about this game, and I hope the developers fix them... because they are major problems.First is pollution.  We are unable to dedicate workers to offsetting pollution, and the facilities that we do have are woefully inadequate for the task.  The pollution system effectively punishes any race with bonus production.  Surely there is a better way to handle this?  A species that can travel in space, destroy entire planets and transcend physical forms can't deal with pollution in any way except through a ridiculous degree of micromanagement, constantly having to readjust production?The second is the Antarans.  The most obvious problem is the fact that every 50 turns they come in, wipe out all ships and defences around a planet, and then obliterate the colony.  You can try to fight them, but the Antarans will always send fleets bigger and more powerful than your entire fleet... good luck with that!  There are mods available that help with this... true, but here comes the second thing.  I have been playing a game with a mod that makes it possible to fight the Antarans (they're still tough, but they can be defeated... not guaranteed, but it's possible.)  I'im now on turn 264 and waiting for the Antaran forces to process their turn.  It's been 10 minutes, and I suspect that there may be a problem here.  I've tried closing the game and redoing the turn... same result.  So.  This game is broken.  I'd like to play it.  There is a lot to like about it, and the other problems are not so serious... but between pollution and the Antarans, I have given up on this game.  Maybe... hopefully... the developers will fix this, and I will happily change my review   I would like to do so.  It's great that a developer has been willing to continue this franchise, and I was cautiously optimistic that they were getting it right, but for now... I'm done with this game.			"

												Update:  With current changes, making the game look and feel much more like Orion II, I'm changing my review to recommended.  Imo, the developer is delivering on the promises made.  Now that much of the old tech has been added, leaders added, and Antares  reintroduced, the game looks n feels much more like Orion II but with 2017 feature and graphics.  I have not encountered lockups, but gameplay will slow down deeper into the game when playing large maps with multiple AI opponents.  ***********************************************************Buyer Beware - Snazzy new graphic update but that is about it.  Boring gameplay, boring graphics.  I should have heeded the other negative reviews.  Fortunately, I purchased this during the Steam summer sale, so getting the old versions of Moo1 and Moo2 got me something worthwhile for my $.  Hopefully, onging development will deliver a game worth playing, but as of this moment this game is a total waste of my time and $.  I enjoyed 100s if not 1000's of hours in Master of Orion 2; I was bored to tears within an hour in this one.   Going back to StarDrive II which is much more like Master of Orion 2 (with updated graphics, gameplay very like Mo2, but no spiffy voice acting or videos).			"

												Now, after having that freeze bug fixed I would like to change my review to positive. The devs are really quick to respond and I enjoyed the game overall, I would say it's a worthy successor of the MoO2 classic. I haven't played MoO3 so I can't compare to that.Pros:- Great support from the devs;- Nice graphics;- Has almost everything from MoO2;- Has better diplomacy and spy features;- Military outposts: you don't need a fleet to guard your borders.Minor cons:- No hero units;- No colony bases (in MoO2 you could colonize a planet in the same system without colony ship, here you always need to have a colony ship);- No freighters for the galaxy food delivery. On the other hand, the food isn't such a big issue as it was in MoO2;Cons:- No antares. The biggest military challenge is the Orion guardian, and once you can beat that you don't have much left to do unless you're into conquering the whole galaxy. Of course you can beat them economically or technologically but it would be great to have that ultimate goal to wipe the bad guys.===================== My original review =============================TL;DR: Great game, too bugged. Don't waste your money.I've read those negative reviews, but I thought ""what the heck, it's MoO successor and everyone deserves a chance"" and there was the steam sale. At start the game was great, I know that everyone was expecting something on the MoO2 grade but though noone can beat the classic this game was ok. I really enjoyed the first steps, setting up your home system, spy network that works, the auto-scouts, the warp entrance military posts - it all sounded great. But once I hit a certain point the game just froze on the ""stuck on processing turn"".Ok, I started a new game, bla-bla, once I encountered Mrr'shan (or what's their name) ambassador it froze.Ok, third time's a charm, another ambassador, froze again.So no, despite the fact that this game has a lot of potential and I did love it when it didn't freeze I just can't play it because of it getting randomly frozen. And since it's not like a ""reload and it goes away"" freeze but the ""reload and freeze on the same spot"" freeze it's just unplayable.			"
