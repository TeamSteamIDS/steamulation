												A great variation on the classic game Oregon Trail. Instead of heading west to start new cities and find Fame/Fortune, you are trying to escape the Zombie apocalypse  and reach Safe Haven.The game is about resource management and does a great job of staying true to the original, with fun variations. You travel with 4 friends in a crappy station wagon. Your car can be upgraded and repaired with spare parts when it breaks down. You can scavenge for food while avoiding and shooting zombies. And ofcourse Random things happen while on the Road, some bad and some funny.Overall a fun game.			"

												This game is so difficult to give a stern review for. It's just a silly 8-bit game with a lot of humor mixed in with despair. You can name the characters after your real life friends and it makes it kind of heart wrenching when you have to put one down or they get sick or held hostage. You really get put into the game and realize how difficult it is to scavange and survive during a zombie outbreak. Replay is great and doesn't really get all that old. Aiming is kind of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ if you look up videos for it you'll understand what I mean (it's so hard to explain), but you can overlook that. If you can overlook that, it's a really great game and I definably recommend it for hours of addiction.			"

												Hahaha, get it? It's like Oregon Trail, but...No, it really is Oregon Trail with zombies. But instead of being a one-note joke, Organ Trail actually improves on the original formula in significant ways. If you somehow never encountered an Apple IIe in school, the basic idea of ______ Trail games is that you have a party of 4 or so travelers on their way to a distant destination. Random things happen on the way, sometimes you get a choice to make, other times not. Settlements give you the chance to shop, barter, or scavenge for supplies. Organ Trail sets this up as you and your 4 pals escaping D.C. in a beat-up station wagon, carrying as much food, ammo, car parts, and fuel as you can. In addition to the random horrible things that happen, you'll also encounter minigames like dodging zombie deer and motorcycle gangs on the highway, or making a clutch shot to save a friend from a kidnapper. These interactive events really help break up the monotony of watching your beater roll down the highway while bad things happen to you all.Settlements are where the game really shines, because there are a wealth of options for managing your journey. In terms of supplies alone, you can buy and sell for cash, wait for trade offers on your goods, scavenge by playing a little top-down action minigame, and do side missions (also minigames) to get paid in goods. There are additional options for managing the health of your team, for maintaining and upgrading your ride, and even learning new special skills for your player character that help in minigames. Learning how much you need of what resources and what upgrades you should spring for can take time, so be prepared to either lose a few times or start on Easy. The first time I picked this game up I got rather frustrated because my car broke down and I got trapped in a settlement with no way to repair it. But after a few more rounds I learned the power of scavenging and practiced my minigaming and now everything runs smooth... on Normal, anyway.It's a pretty deep game for a literal Oregon Trail clone, and the zombie aspect fits the style well without being tired. There are some cute pop culture references that are clever enough not to annoy, and plenty of replay value. As long as the ultra low-res graphics and learning curve don't put you off, this is a grand little coffee break game.			"

												Organ Trail's pretty damn fun. It's essentially Oregon Trail with zombies and a bunch of Left 4 Dead references. I had the iOS version before buying the Steam version, and I feel like the game's easier to control on a computer as far as shooting goes. That being said, shooting is still a ♥♥♥♥♥ as far as controls go, and it's difficult to nail on the head. Some of the in-game passersby even acknowledge the problems with the controls by stating, ""These controls suck!"" (They do.) But having a mouse removed the issue of my finger blocking parts of the screen. The writing is often times humorous and references things from the original game to Castlevania. It gives Organ Trail a certain charm and unusual atmosphere. Some of the locations throughout the game are rather humorous as well (one of these being--I kid you not--a strip club), and it gives me the impressions that the developers made this purely for fun, which I find admirable. It's always nice to find a game that convinces players that the people who made it definitely had a kickass time doing so.I've noticed that, while the overall gameplay is generally difficult (even on normal), it gets progressively harder as you move further down the map, which I found reasonable, in my opinion. That being said, it's very good at screwing you over, as nothing's worse than wasting half your food and all your time stuck on the side of the road trading away for enough scrap so that you can attempt a repair on the car that ultimately fails, causing you to waste all your scrap. That actually happened to me. It's not fun. However, to an extent, the game is as difficult as your are good at strategizing and planning a course of action. You will blame yourself many times for the mistake you've made. Many times, crises can be avoided or worked around if you're prepared enough. Yet, given this, random events still occur, and if the odds aren't in your favor, you could end up doing well to being dead in a few miles. It's always important to be cautious in this game as a result.The music is also spot-on as well. Amidst all of the humor and gags, it gives Organ Trail a more solemn tone. Also, it's generally interesting to listen you and combines an 8-bit feel with a more ""advanced"" (if that's the word) sound to it. I don't quite know how to explain it. But it's really well done, in my opinion.The graphics are also very charming and reminiscent of the original games. They work really well. Not sure what else to say here. I like them a lot.Also, the Clement's Quest minigame is hilarious. It's essentially a TL;DR Organ Trail where you control the car and run over zombies as quickly as you possibly can. I discovered it on accident and couldn't have been happier that I did.Basically, to put it bluntly, despite the game's difficulty, I really enjoy this game and always have a good time while playing it. It was worth purchasing it the second time, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a challenge and a nostalgic, yet new take on a classic.			"

AUDIONeo-RetroVISUALCommodore 64DIFFICULTYLuck, ModerateVIBESomberCRAVINGSim, ManagementON SALEInfrequentlyPROS: Oregon trail made with a zombie twist. It plays just about the same as the original game did, making it an extremely fun play. It demands a combination of skill, foresight and luck in an environment that changes often, giving this game high replay value. Shooting and escape segments control surprisingly well, and random events feel a bit more balanced than in its predecessor.CONS: Zombie shtick is very tired. There is virtually no educational value in this, which I felt was half the fun of the original! The game assumes you are familiar with Oregon Trail, so if you are new to this there may be a slight learning curve in properly managing your resources. WORTH: A single game does not take very long to get through, less than half an hour. However, one or two playthroughs is not what Organ Trail is about. You could easily get 30 hours out of it, especially if you do completionist play. $5.00 is a very fair price for it.OVERALL: This isn't Oregon Trail exactly, but I'm happy there is some version of it on Steam complete with achievements, cards, twitter options and online leaderboards. It blows Super Amazing Wagon Adventure out of the water and is the current go-to to satisfy this nostalgic desire. SCORE:8/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Organ Trail 

			Views: 2,183		

			Today, Analog Reviews looks at Flash game turned indie hit Organ Trail By Senior Reviewer Trent Follow us at https://twitter.com/analogreviews Leave your comments below and like and subscribe if you...		

	The Men Who Wear Many Hats originally created Organ Trail as a flash game and after some fund raising they were able to release an expanded version of their original title on mobile devices and now PC. Organ Trail takes it's primary inspiration from the original Apple II iteration of The Oregon Trail and opens with your character encountering Clement, a fellow survivor who kick-starts your odyssey across a post apocalyptic United States. Much like the game it parodies, Organ Trail is about balance. You will need to ensure that your party is fed, rested and your car in tip top mechanical condition. With every mile that ticks by your parties health degrades as well as your trusty station wagon. Injury and disease are common occurrences on the road as evidenced by the many tombstones that can be encountered on your journey. These tombstones are not only reminders of the peril that face your party but also opportunities for upgrades and supplies. Party members can be bitten on your voyage and may require a euthanizing rifle blast to the head. Of course, if you are a misanthropic sociopath you could always off your healthy party members and not have to worry about keeping them fed and healthy. Dotting the trail to safety are landmarks and cities that allow your party to trade, buy and sell items, upgrade your car and purchase perks for your character. You can also take on jobs to earn some cash or supplies and chat the locals up for information. Scavenging is often the easiest way to stay supplied on your journey. By opting to scavenge an open field pops up with random items spawning. Little green zombies home in on your character as you attempt to scoop up scrap for car repairs, food for nourishment, and cash for additional supplies. It's possible to defend yourself from the zombie onslaught while scavenging with a rifle. You must click and pull your mouse back which brings up a line of site on the screen which you can then spin while in a fixed position to dial your site in on the revolting rotting flesh heaps that converge on your position. Releasing fires and these controls take a bit of time to acclimate yourself to. A couple of seconds to reload between each round ensures a bit of tension as you scramble for goodies. Bosses are also randomly encountered on these scavenging excursions. They are more robust creatures that put up a bit more of a fight than your average walking corpse. The jobs that are on offer use variations of these mechanics. Some require you to defend a position by taking cover and killing zombies before they reach your position, some have you locating an item in a scrolling field while zombies swarm and the last variant has you trading gun shots with others humans in fortified positions. These mini games can feel repetitive after a while since your character doesn't receive new weapons and enemy types are limited. The randomness of these events will keep you coming back however. Also, random encounters with biker gangs and hordes of zombie deer mix things up while in your station wagon. Random interactions with other travelers on the road also spice up the core game and offer a little bit of narrative. Prompts will appear that ask if you feel inclined to investigate something on the road. Doing so kicks off an old school adventure sequence that often results in a reward of some sort. This touch adds quite a bit of re-playability to Organ Trail. While the randomness of Organ Trail ensures a new experience every time it can  also lead to frustration. It's not uncommon for tragic events to occur in quick succession and take out a party member or even your party leader. It can be upsetting, perhaps off putting for some, when a well supplied and positioned expedition fails because of a bout with dysentery and broken ribs...  Ultimately Organ Trail: Director's cut is one of the best games to emerge from the zombie zeitgeist that has gripped popular culture over the past half decade.			"

												A fun variation on a classic game. In Organ Trail you and your closest pals have to venture across the country in your station wagon, trading for parts, scavenging supplies in zombie infested areas, and hoping that you and your crew don't get bit. I purchased it because I had an itch for the nostalgic game I played in elementary school, and found myself playing through a couple of times to explore all of the game's features.			"

												I'm going to recommend this game, even though it has it's share of problems and I'm mad at it. If you enjoyed Oregon Trail growing up, and like zombies, you'll find this game worthwhile. I have two general problems with the game though. My first problem is that the achievements are very buggy. Playing through the game multiple times over for an achievement turns from fun to horror when the achievements reset. My second problem is that once you figure out how the game works, it gets boring. Basically, theres generally an 'optimal' way to play it and once you know how, the game becomes less fun because you know exactly what to do in each situation...there are no more surprises. I mean, in the 15 hours I played I learned the more-or-less ""right"" things to do and got ranked in the mid 300s on the global leaderboards for a playthrough. I didn't feel particularly skilled at the game, just that I followed the obvious rules. Anyway, still fun for a few playthroughs. Get it on sale.			"

												I spent many an hour in my elementary school computer lab playing Oregon Trail, we always felt like our class had won the lottery because we got to play video games in school! I know it was supposed to be secretly educational, but looking back I learned nothing of any value playing it. Regardless, I loved every minute of it.I picked up Organ Trail for something like 27 cents (I don’t remember the exact amount but it was low enough that I could recoup the loss by picking up change in a parking lot) and when all was said and done I got exactly what I expected of it: a silly, over the top interpretation of the classic Oregon Trail formula. I bought supplies, hunted zombies instead of the buffalo/duck hunt mini game, repaired my station wagon as opposed to an ox drawn wagon, and had everyone in my party die of the same disease as my settlers did all those years ago.If you’re looking for a quick, silly re-imagining of Oregon Trail you would not regret picking Organ Trail up in a sale.

The walking dead simulatorOrgan trail is unique 2D Rogue-like management game with zombies. The gameplay is this game's main highlight. Before you start your game, you get to name your character as well as your group members. It is generally advised that you name group members based on people you love/hate (famous people etc) as it will make the experience more interesting as you watch how long they last. After that you get to choose the types of items you will carry along with you like feul, food, money etc. You begin your journey in your station wagon traveling to the next city. Along your travel you may face some random encounters which may affect the game e.g. losing items, more vehicle damage, random stop, members getting sick etc. As you travel you will also consume fuel. Should you run out of feul you can either scavange some or spend time waiting for someone to come along and trade you some. Scavenging involves collecting resources while fending off zombies with your gun. Aiming with you gun is terrible (which isn't surprising because this is basically an android port) as it involves clicking and draging to where you want to shoot and then missing most of the time (It takes a while to get used to basically). When you reach towns you can talk to survivors, take side quests which involves fending against zombies or bandits (which gives you resources as rewards), buy/sell supplies (fuel, food, ammo), heal the group as well as repairing and upgrading your station wagon. Like feul food is also depleted as you travel. You have the option of rationalising the consumption of food. Should it be depleted you and your other survivors will gradually lose health until they die. You also have an option to kill any of you party members at anytime, should you no longer require their company. You basically move from city to city surviving the zombie apocalypse as much as you can until you reach the sanctuary. Should you die, the game immeditaely ends and you are taken back to the main menu to begin a fresh run again if you wish. The game is quite challenging and addicitve so you will play this game a several times. The music adds to desloate atmosphere. Whether your in a town, traveling or hunting you get to experience a spooky and lonely soundtrack which helps to instill the feeling of trying to survive a zombie apocalypse. The weapon sounds aren't that great.There isn't much story to the game. Basically the intro starts you off with meeting some survivors. You formulate a plan to get to the sanctuary (city free of zombies) and begin your journey together in the station wagon.The graphics aren't that great. They do an OK job at presenting a dark atmosphere, but they lack detail.If you want a resource management rogue-like game with zombies and don't min wonky shooting controls, this game will appease your interests.

												Instead of going to Oregon to stake a claim on America's future, you decide the fate of a group of survivors looking for a safe place to live in a post-apocalyptic world overridden by zombies.  You travel from Washington DC, that's about to be nuked, all the way to a safe haven in, you guessed it, Oregon.  The game is faithful in every way it can be to the Oregon Trail, except where it could be made more thematically appropriate to a zombie apocalypse, with multiple additions to improve the simulation and theming.  Seriously, name a feature from Oregon Trail and it's there.  Dysentary?  Check.  Bad water?  Check.  Tombstones?  Check.  You get the picture.Oregon Trail's 'hunting' minigame, being the best part of the original, has become a bit more central to the experience with Scavenging and Jobs using it, with a few others including Defense, Surrounded and Bandit Raid events using the same shooting mechanics.  When Scavenging, you no longer shoot a 2000 pound buffalo to carry back 100 pounds of meat.  Instead you rummage around a wilderness, collecting any supplies that pop up (including food, cash and scrap that you can use to repair your car), while avoiding and shooting zombies that swarm in on you.  Learning to control the flow of these zombies to reduce the amount of ammo I have to spend was a fun mechanic to master (no doubt aided by my recent experience with Gauntlet), and I must say, is probably the best way to ensure your victory at the game. In a funny way, Organ Trail is one of the most complete zombie apocalypse simulations I've played, and if you like the genre, you really should play it just because it's a fun game.  If that's not enough to attract you, maybe the novelty of recreating the Oregon Trail experience on a modern platform with a modern genre is enough.  I would happily recommend Organ Trail even at the premium price of five bucks.			"

												It's The Oregon Trail, but with zombies. And Clements. And zombies. And shotguns. And scavenging for food and supplies. And zombies. And dysentery. And references. And zombies. And biker gangs. And... did I mention it has zombies?In all seriousness, this is a really fun parody of The Oregon Trail. You lead a party of four other survivors in your quest to safe haven, all while fending off zombies, scavenging for food and supplies, dealing with dysentery, fending off biker gangs and undead fauna, and wondering how exactly one would break their leg inside a station wagon. Campaign Mode is your quest to Safe Haven, while Endless Mode lets you travel forever (so long as you maintain your supplies and pray that none of your party members survive) while completing challenges that unlock new presets and buffs that add replayability to the game. If you always thought The Oregon Trail was missing zombies, then this is the game for you.			"

												Organ Trail is nothing short of a fun realization of the old classic with the tried and true zombie twist.At first glance it's easy to scoff at this game and even write it off, but presentation shouldn't fool you. Once in the game, none of that will matter as the solid gameplay, comedy aspect, and nature of the genre take hold of you. You'll be crossing fingers as you push through the hordes hoping they don't take notice. The scavenger side missions are also gratifying, but the controls are a bit awkward, making it more of a flustering challenge than maybe it warrants.After a few runs, things get a bit repetitive, but that's the nature of the game. It's no short haul to make it across country and there's plenty in between that'll you need to survive. I would definitely recommend playing this if you havent, and especially if you are old enough to have enjoyed the original Oregon Trail.			"

												Absolutly Love this game. Feels like the original with a modern twist. Saw Vinesauce Joel playing at and had to come get it. Beat campain on Normal and halloween mode didn't unlock, also clicking leaderboard made a black screen and then nothing. Don't know what that's about if anyone had any ideas on that?			"

												If you loved the DOS Oregon Trail that was out about 26 years ago and crave the nostalga, then this is for you. The ending is anti-climatic, but I find myself playing it over and over anyway, loving all the extra goodies you can unlock and have fun with. A helpful tip would be to scavenge often in low danger zones, it gives you stuff to trade ad buy supplies later. Worth every penny.			"

												What to say about Organ Trail?It's Oregon Trail, re-upped and zombified. If you like the Oregon Trail, get this. If you didn't like the Oregon Trail, you will not like this. If you don't know what Oregon Trail is, or are neutral towards it, I'll explain.Organ Trail replaces the covered wagon of its inspiration with a station wagon, fills it up with a couple people you will inevitably name after either fictional characters or real-life friends and family, and then tasks you with getting them across the country alive. This is easier said than done, this being the zombie apocalypse and all, and you'll need all the meager help you can get.The game is based more on tactical decision-making than it is on high-octane gameplay, though there are more than a few tense moments. Everything about Oregon Trail is now zombie-related: you're attacked by zombies instead of bears (or zombie bears), instead of fording a river the highway is covered in zombies, instead of dysentary you get dysen-- okay that one stayed the same, but the other ones are different.The biggest draw that I still feel to this game is its approach to your ""leadership"" to the group. At any time, you can choose to execute one of your friends. They get no replacement, you're essentially shooting yourself in the leg here and hurting your chances of making it to the end. The main reason why you would ever do this is if they've been infected. It's a tough choice to make, and the game doesn't just let you get away with hitting the ""kill them"" button and  moving on. You have to wait until you're all sitting around a campfire, hit the button to shoot them, and then, in a game dominated almost entirely by menus, you are taken to a small cutscene of you holding a gun to the person you intend to kill. They don't resist, they don't say anything, they just stand there. The game doesn't let you just get rid of them, you have to look them in the eyes and pull the trigger yourself, then watch their body slump to the ground in front of you. It's far more powerful than it has any right to be, especially on a more intense, serious run where you've begun to get attached to your party.The game isn't perfect, though. Its general replayability is high, but its brevity means that you'll probably be spent after about 6-7 runs, which will take around 10 hours or so.The weakest point of the game is the finale; it's a final, incredibly tense mission, where success means victory and failure means back to square 1. Without giving anything away, I'll just say it's not terrible, but it definitely could have been done better, especially when it comes to how it handles your remaining allies.Overall? I think this game is worth the price if you're a fan of the source material, and if not, then it's still worth the sale price.7/10 seems fair. A modest recommendation. Oh, and there IS a Flash version online, so check that out if you want to know what you're getting into before you buy.			"

												I haven't played for too long but i can already tell it's a very funny modern day rendition of the ""original"". Your team will randomly die-off in the nostalgic manor of Oregon trail's disease contracting, leg breaking, attacked by zombie way. It's especially  fun to play with people around and watch them cope with their in game characters dire conditions. In the game's defense, it appears there are ways to escape the madness and survive.			"

There is A LOT of possibilities in this game, A LOT of funny situations and A LOT of upgrades.  However despite what i said earlier about about just wasting time with this game, you can really get into it. Me personally? I played the game twice (one on easy and one on medium) and i also tried endless mode a couple of times. All and all I recommend this game to everyone to at least try it out.

LITTLE JOHHNY has died of dysentery.Organ Trail: Director's cut is a parody of The Oregon Trail edutainment games, and a significantly enhanced version of the original browser game.Instead of needing to colonise the promised land of Oregon, your task in The Organ Trail is to lead your ragtag bunch of misfits, or whoever survives it anyway, to the safety of, well, Safe Haven. Conveniently located across the entirety of the United States, in Oregon. Reason being that the US is nuking cities overrun by zombies, which happen to include all of the East Coast, where you start.True to its origins, it's displayed as an Apple ][ game, with 8 bit sprites and bleeps and bloops for sound effects. The music is damn good though.Like in The Oregon Trail, you must manage your dwindling supplies and grueling pace across the long journey. Unlike in The Oregon Trail, there's a lot more game in this game. Random events still pop up across your journey in a station wagon (hue), but are less frequently going to instantly cull one of your gang. Scavenging plays a big part in keeping your food supply high, but it's a hazardous endeavour in the 45 second long bit of gameplay an hour of scavenging is condensed into. In a bit of a twist, money remains important for buying resources in settlements and cities, and for upgrades on your character or your car, despite the zombies. Across your trek through the USA, you must monitor your party's condition, which is impacted by the size of the food rations, and your station wagon's integrity, which goes down faster if you're pushing it to 60mph. Every in-game hour of travel your party stops to rest and do other things - including breaking legs (lampshaded in a random passerby's dialogue), finding some food, sitting too hard on a fuel can or 4 and ruining them, or, infamously, contracting cholera, which just makes them lose health faster. At every stop you can check their condition, opt to rest and regain health, apply medkits to quickly heal, or put them down for any reason, or for no reason. You also get random events: your gang may be taken hostage by raiders and you need to carefully aim to kill the bad guy without doing in your friend too, or just kill them both you sicko; you have to cross a horde of zombies by either waiting for them to become docile, or going guns blazing; dodging ravenous zombie deer or ramming into biker raiders; and special encounters with people who might need your help.Most importantly, the tombstones are a thing, and they are absolutely hilarious. You can leave your own tombstone when you die, too, and then you can come across it again in a separate run. oh boy what a great dayThe base game offers a very healthy selection of content, and while the base gameplay loop doesn't change across runs, random events and the degree of refuge in audacity certainly do. If you like what it has on offer, the Final Cut DLC is absolutely worth it: roughly double the content, and adding new stuff like choosing what route to take, with pros and cons, dealing with radiation poisoning if you go for the risky but time saving paths, extra skins for your character, extra vehicles to play in, and a couple other smaller things here and there too!But what doesn't change is your party's predisposition to break limbs randomly at stops.

												This game takes the Oregon Trail games and mixes it with The Walking Dead. This game will immediately tug on your nostalgia factor, for those guys and girls out there that grew up in the 90s like myself (being born in the 90s doesn't count as growing up in the 90s). Nostalgia factor aside, I don't think I can recommend this game. The thing that ruins my nostalgia was the pacing of the game. There wasn't enough going on to keep my interest. The only reason I played for so many hours was to get the achievements, which is another complaint altogether. It's just tedious grinding. AND ITS SOOO DREARY AND SLOW. The zombies in the game move faster than the actual game itself. The game is clever and funny, very tongue in cheek. However, I cannot recommend this game, because after one TEDIOUS and UNNECESSARILY long play though, you will have gotten the gist of the game. Honestly, anything after the first play through is dull and uninspired. And to me, one enjoyable play through does not warrant a ""must buy.""			"

												Ah a great refreshment game to burn some hours! And Organ Trail is a good place to start. Firstly, one of the best things about this game is that it doesn't try to be more than what it is, a zombie-remake of the classic Oregon Trail. It has it all, stocking up, fording the zombies, scavenging for goods, surviving attacks, hanging in towns. You truly never know what could happen! Now it's old school, nearly looking like old memories of the original Trail. A great trick, if you have the food, is to wait out zombie hordes that you have to pass through, it gives you great health bonuses. Well good luck out there! Oh yeah, review, review! Closing, this is a great, fun game, and if you can get it for cheap, you should pick it up.			"

												Zombie slaughtering and survival doesn't get any more ghetto than this.  Your main quest is to survive a journey from one side of the U.S. to the other, with four other survivors, with one clunky shotgun, and with your only vehicle to make this journey being a station wagon with wooden side panels.  That's right.  You have the freedom to kill the survivors with you at any time, thereby saving on fuel and food in the long run.  You'll have to scavange for food and fuel with a sh-tty shotgun.  You can catch malaria, or die of dysentry at any time.  Someone could get bit, maybe that someone is you.  At any time, the bit someone could turn around and bite anyone in your group.  If you don't put them down, you might get bit too.  It's only you that needs to make it to the end to win the main game mode.  While driving, you could get runned down by a pack of zombified deer, or a rogue motorcycle gang.  Even though you can run over the gang, or get mauled by deer, or drive through clustered gangs of zombies, all many times during your journey--in the end, the wooden side panels on your station wagon remain shiny and unscathed as if still brand new.  Bring Chuck Norris along for a fuller pimped-out effect.Truly, zombie survival gaming doesn't get any more ghetto than this.			"

												This is a parody of the old classic Oregon Trail, but with a zombie twist to it. The real selling point seems to be that parody. You start out as a party of 5 and work your way from Washington DC headed west. It is a supply and demand sort of game where when you start, you buy your supplies, then at times you'll run low whether it is med kits, fuel, batteries, food or ammo. How do you get more? You stop and trade, scavenge or doing odd jobs.Organ Trail is broken up into cities that have places to buy and sell things. They'll also have either combat training or auto repair shops where you can buy mufflers, batteries, tires or upgrades. You can also fix your car at the shops. If you don't have the cash to repair your car, you can always use scrap, but using X amount of scrap only gets you X percentage the repair will be successful. Like 2 scrap will be 20% successful.If you can't make it to a city, you can stop at any time to repair your car, scavenge, rest for health regeneration, kill infected party members and use med kits. I seemed to find traders more frequently when I stopped outside of a city. When you scavenge, make sure to pay attention to what the game tells you the zombie activity is. More zombies, more problems. The jobs also tell you the risk factor, anywhere from normal to suicide. Just make sure the reward is worth the risk and play it safe.The game is full of mini games. Scavenge has you slowly running around a screen dodging zombies, collecting random things. Sometimes the game will bust out a boss to chase you that is far more difficult to avoid than the zombies. When scavenging, you don't even need to shoot, so much as run and avoid. There are defense mini games that require you to stay put and shoot either zombies or bandits. The shooting feels very imprecise and has you clicking on a zombie with your mouse and dragging it back to your character to aim, then releasing the mouse button to fire. There are a lot of misses even with what looks like a perfectly aimed shot.There is a mini game where your station wagon gets chased by a biker gang and you need to run them off the road and there is even a mini game where you dodge reindeer chasing after your station wagon. After you complete Organ Trail, it will unlock a Clemons mini game that has you driving a station wagon left going up triangle hills, jumping off and ramming zombies in a side scroller.When you are on the road, random events happen, such as your characters breaking bones, getting diseases, being mugged, losing items, finding graves, wading through zombies, helping people, looting bodies, injuring your entire party and so much more. Its all text for the most part.After you complete the game, it unlocks an endless mode. The interesting part of endless mode are the modifiers, such as your party can start out infected or they are deep sleepers and recover twice as fast. The sad thing is endless mode is really endless, and I just don't like the thought of being able to play Organ Trail forever.Even with all of the random events that make every playthrough different, it felt like a chore having to scavenge so much. It was as if the scavenging was the bulk of my play throughs. I didn't find it fun. The random events are really just that, random and rarely benefit you, which is why its more of a supply and demand game. Everything is designed to drain you, but then you need to compensate for it. Please just skip this game, it looks cool, it sounds cool, but there aren't moments of 'yay I did it!' so much as moments of 'how would hitting a bump in the road lose 2 med kits?' Oh well.			"

												The game does what it sets out to do--create a version of the classic Oregon Trail game, but with zombies. There's some neat nods and references to other zombie franchises out there, and it captures the feel of the original game pretty well while still having its own identity.That being said, it also reminded me how boring the original Oregon Trail really was. Although there's a few neat scenarios and moral conumdrums this is mostly a resource-management game with a few very basic zombie-shooting minigames involved (that have controls that are a little frustrating to deal with). If you play the game for too long it can get pretty repetative, particularly when you hear the same dialogue over and over.Admittedly part of my disappointment might be because the version of Oregon Trail I grew up with was Oregon Trail II, which had some pretty campy FMV stuff in it but had more stuff to do overall and felt like a fuller game. I'm also getting a little bored of zombies at this point and Organ Trail doesn't attempt to do anything new. So I'm definitely coming at this game with a bias. It's not a BAD game, just one that I ultimately felt ""meh"" on once I finished it.If you have a lot of nostalgia for the original or just can't get enough of zombies, there's definitely far worse games you could pick up, particularly at the price point. But don't expect anything too surprising, the game more or less plays out the way you'd expect, so if you're on the fence I'd maybe wait for a sale or get something else instead.			"

You and your friends try to cross what once was the USA from the East Coast to the West, chasing a rumor known as ""Safe Haven"", a stronghold where the zombie outbreak seems to have been controlled. Your job is to admin everything until you reach Safe Haven, that is gas, money, routes, including scavenging for food, at what hours you should best do so, keeping an eye out for your ammo, deciding if you should keep going to the West Coast with your bitten friend or if he is a potential menace to the whole group and should be rather put down, if you should risk breaking your car driving for another mile in the hopes of finding a better trading spot, etc., etc. These tasks may appear mundane at first, but once you soak in the rather dark atmosphere and realize how close you have become to those pixels with the name of random friends, the game becomes a tragic story of a group just trying to survive and their everyday trying to do so. And you are the leader. It's so much fun to experience and imagine the situation you go through. One moment you'll think you made a great deal buying that tire for so cheap, the next you'll curse yourself for not having rather invested in scraps. And while on the road, you'll sometimes encounter little ""choose-your-own-adventure""-like events with fellow survivors, some friendly, others not so much, spicing up the experience.Organ Trail is impressively immersive, given it's Atari graphics and lack of a deeper canon story. It's one of those video game experiences in which the game only makes the rules, while you make the story in your head, and I think this is the strongest point here.But as good as it is, it has some very nasty bugs that can bring you serious frustration. For example, I just was at the end of the game, a comrade died and the game refused to advance until I fed all of them to the zombies. As if this wasn't enough, the game got stuck after defeating the final boss. After having spend my time carefully administrating my crew from coast to coast through hordes of zombies, this wasn't a rewarding pay off. I just wish such issues were patched already, since they happen relatively often with me, let's say, every 3rd or 4th playthrough.Be it as it is, though, I can only recommend Organ Trail as a fantastic game for those who like just make up and imagine their own zombie stories while playing along.

												I usually really hate these fake retro games, especially ones with a ""twist"" like this, but I really like this game. The good thing about this game is that it is actually fun to play and it doen't just rely on the fake retro style for nostalgia. I am one of those people who grew up playing Oregon Trail in the computer lab at school (although the version I was familiar with was a later version of the game that this is based on) and this game does a good job recreating the feel of the original, and it actually improves on it. But this game is not simply a re-make of Oregon Trail either; although it is based on that game, it is also a new game itself.I think it is definitely worth its price because it is fun and has a great replay value.

												Anyone who's played the original Oregon Trail game, or any of its remakes, will know vaguely what this game is like. Fun, long, and difficult. What they won't know, however, is how much better this game is than the original. It is an improvement not just because of the zombie aspect and the nostalgic graphics, but also because of the constant Chuck Norris jokes and the subtle oddity of the strange abundance of car parts owned by absolutely everyone you meet, and yet the sudden dissapearence of the one you need just when you need it.As said earlier, this game is harder than it looks, as there are CONSTANT random events that will, more often than not, impede your progress to the Safe Haven. However, this means that, each time the game is played, it will be totally different from any other time.This game is a neverending supply of both fun and frustration, and, in my opinion, worth the purchase.

												The game looks simple but that doesn't mean the game is fun. It is hard though and you need some luck here and there.The game takes you through a small tutorial at first and lets you get used to the controls. The rest you have to figure out yourself. What is usefull and what not, what is the best option to do, ect.It's based off an old game called Oregon Trial. But in here there are zombies and there are some things changed and added. It isn't a long game but it is fun to replay the game and try other ways to beat it and harder difficulties.The graphics are old styled. Since the game where it was based off is also in the same sort of style. But in here it looks a bit better. If you aren a graphics kind of person then don't pick the game up. From the screenshots you see on the store page.. That's all you will get.The soundtrack is quite nice. If you get annoyed by it after a few times of playing it, you can always put on your own music.It doesn't cost much and it's worth picing up if you enjoy a bit of hard and a bit of luck based games. If you don't mind how the game looks like that is. The game is also available for the Android and IOS. If you want to play it everywhere. I find the controls a bit better on there since you have to swipe instead of dragging your mouse. But it is a personal prefrence.Get it when you can if you like what you see and read. And if you think the price is too high then wait for a sale. Though getting it for the IOS and Android would also be a good choice.			"

												They just took him. Grabbed him from the back seat of the car and took him. Sure, he was annoying at times. He lost more cash than he ever earned, and somehow got himself shot by a stray bullet, but Sketch was one of us y'know? Us survivors have to stick together. So I picked up my rifle and stepped out of the car. I didn't have much choice. I wasn't going to leave him behind. Ottah hadn't looked good for some time since the first Z he saw took a chunk of him. Sleepy got bitten soon after. As for Rabid, I'm pretty sure she was high the whole time. She never got ill, never caused a problem. I forgot she was there most of the time.So, there I was. It was an old fashioned stand-off. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was hiding behind Sketchy, holding a pistol to his head. I didn't need to think. I just shot. 


I'm a hero. Praise me. 
A Screenshot of Organ Trail: Director's Cut
By: C.




From that moment on, there was no turning back. Anyone who stood between my guys and Safe Haven, dead or alive, I took them out.It was tough, but we made it. All of us made it. Hopefully Ottah and Sleepy will be able to live with the bites. As for me, there are more survivors out there and someone needs to help them ...That was the story of my first adventure in Organ Trail. I foolishly played on Easy, which I wont be doing again, as once I learned my way around the game it wasn't very challenging. I guess I'm too used to recent roguelikes murdering me on my first turn! (I'm looking at you FTL)I always get an extra kick out of games where I can name multiple members of a party. Naming the characters after my buddies helped me grow attached to them. Or hate them for constantly being ill (Ottah!) or a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥(Sketch!). The shooting took a little to get used to, but it was okay once I got the hang of it.As for replayability, Endless Mode offers up unique starting scenarios and there are a fair few of them. I'll be making a start on those real soon!The sound style matches the graphics, but I'll happily play this on mute and listen to my own music. It's not a problem with the style of the music, I just find it to be quite bad. Also, I'm sure I heard a dodgy distorted version of the 'Happy Birthday' tune at some point.The most important thing I have to say about Organ Trail, is that I want to play more. As soon as I finished the game, I wanted to play again. That's the sign of good gameplay. Organ Trail doesn't have fancy graphics to fall back on. All it's can offer is its solid gameplay. If you're a fan of survival games, and don't mind the design this is something that you should pick up.Bottom Line: Organ Trail is fun and leaves you wanting more.			"

												Could this game be fun? Yes.  Is it fun? NoI get what they are trying to do with this game, but the lack of tutorials within make it just flat out annoying considering it is a rogue like.  There are a ton of different encounters, but with the pixelated graphics and practically zero instructions on how to do any of them, you are bound to fail over and over again which usually means the death of a party member.  Given that you can't go back on any of this, it often means that you have to scrap your play-through and start over from the beginning just so you can maybe learn the controls for that particular event, blah.I like the idea of a rogue like game that follows a group over a long stretch of road that is riddled with random encounter and so on, but it would be nice if you were given some idea of what you  are supposed to do before the encounter or how the controls even work.After starting over for the 3rd time because I lost a party member to lack of instruction,  I got fed up.Leave this game alone "

												good piece of retro survival! The gameplay is simple but fun, and the original's Oregon Trail painful aspects (keyboard aiming for an example) have been scraped out. The game has many secrets and unique finds, aiming for a good replayability factor, but these events are so rare (i only came across 2 in 8 full gameplays, when the game says there are over 15) that you won't experience everything this game has to offer. The game is also a bit too short. There are many, many events and possibilities, but the trailer's makes one believe that this will be also a psychological battle against yourself, with many moral dilemmas and such,  when the largest one you will find is pressing a button to kill one of your crew.6.5/10 ,only purchasable because its cheap , but not for everyone.

												The most brutal zombie apacolypse you will ever experience. Make your way across the vast wastelands of the former USA. You and 4 friends must escape D.C. before a nuclear bombardment erradicates the new england states. You will encounter hordes of feral zombies, ravaging bandits, and you may even have to put down your own friends. You are equipped with a zombie killing 4 wheel coffin, shotguns, rifles, pistols and most of all, your brain; which is what the zombie hordes wants so badly.			"

												The makers of this game really do a great job creating an atmosphere that is charming and sort of haunting despite being so pixelated. It's a lot of fun and the music is very good as well. There are tons of random events, lots of minigames and many things to go awry as you take your group across the United States in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ old station wagon.If you like Oregon Trail at all. If you like zombies at all. If you are looking to play something different AT ALL, buy this game			"

												Organ trail may be the most under 8-bit game I ever played, but it's well made in gameplay and the general feel of the game. I'm not a total zombie fan, but this game is very fun. Survive as you drive with your four companions, who are more of a nusence then help, in your leamon station wagon that'll break down many many times. Remember to check graves, as they sometimes have free tires! Yes...don't ask me why...it is a bit random. It's a nice game though, totaly worth the money.			"

												First off, this game's music freaking rocks. Ambient 8 Bit is like the best. Second off, if you like Zombies, zombie stories, long adventures, and the Oregon Trail, get this game. Keeping you friends or enemies alive or putting them down when they've been bitten is a taxing and emotional experiance, as odd as that sounds. I do think anyone should try this game if they want a good time and some tounge-in-cheek humor.			"

I'm giving it a positive review though unlike many people who 'try' a game with Steam's new return policy and only have to have played it for less than five minutes to write a review...THIS POLICY IS WRONG. If you want to review a game you should have to at least give it a fair shake- play it for a full two hours. I could understand that, unfortunately with STEAM's return policy you aren't even required to play the game fore more than 5 minutes to write a review....then you can return it?!

												AUTHOR NOTE.While i have only a few Minutes on this game, i have played it and beaten it multiple times on a Non-Steam Version.The Best Oregon Trail Zombie Simulator, Ever.Literally, when i saw this title i was surprised by its atmosphere. The Music is a factor but so is the music. I feel like people are being eaten, things are bleak and grim in this chaotic outbreak spanning across mainland america. The game ultimately is extremely bleak and sometimes even masochistic at times, even gameplay. I mean seriously, what other game do you have where you get a choice between marrying a bride to her groom's corpse or to put her out of her misery and blow her brains out? I felt like a Devil playing this game, offing each of my members to get to my location. I felt like my Car constantly was breaking down and we had nowhere to run, even when we stopped by to examine the dead in their graves! (Which is pretty stupid, i mean why would you do that. Would make sense if it was the graves of your fellow team but its not.)The Gunplay is literally Apple 2 esque, you ""draw"" the line you want to shoot with your mouse, it takes alot of getting used to but its a mechanic chosen well, otherwise this game's combat would be very easy. You also walk at a SNAILS Pace while running from zombies, and should judge the distance of the undead with which location you should go. Juking the Zombies, its been done similar in other games and remains a interesting mechanic that makes it much easier to survive the combat portions of Organ Trail. Also the wages you get paid are ridiculous and the difficulty ratings are extremely intimidating initally, the higher ones are defintely not to be taken lightly and i'd recommend wasting a few peons on it to get used to the missions because your not getting money any other way besides taking jobs. Money is so important, i cannot unstate how much ive seen my own people die because ive been a few dollars short of a medkit or my entire car fall to pieces in a few miles. Its rage inducing but there is something in Organ Trail that i see in Risk of Rain almost, where in that i just NEED to find a way to make it all work. Its that which makes it all the more devastating or victorious when you actually Win or Lose in this game. Its hilariously cheap, to a level that i think it personally doesn't deserve but i come back to this title every now and then for another ride on the amazing organ trail.TL:DR?Fun but Nigh on Masochistic. Gameplay takes learning.Defintely a great title to get at the price. Recommended.			"

												Nabbing this, especially while on sale, is most certainily worth your time and money. While a single play through without the Final Cut DLC is all you really need to get the entire package out of the game, multiple playthroughs allow for more of the funnier, if albeit random, events to occur. Playing the game with a friend adds for even more enjoyment, as you both can now experience the random hilarity of dysentary or hapless, seatbelt-less arm-breaks this game often provides. Seriously, it's worth the two bucks. Invite friends over, make funny choices. It's a fun title.			"

												Organ Trail resembles a certain other game, which I doubt I even need to name. Instead of a wagon, you have a station wagon, and instead of homesteading the west, you are trying to escape the zombie apocalypse... by going west! It might have simple graphics, yet it's fun and challenging. Sadly it does have some boring parts, where you just watch your car move, and terrible things like breaking a battery or someone getting bitten will happen. This makes it very similar to the game with a similar name, where someone will just randomly die of malaria, but the zombie apocalypse setting makes it way better. The resource management is also still there, while instead of hunting for animals, you will be hunting bandits or going for an item while zombies hunt you. Organ Trail is one of those simple games that ends up being pretty awesome. Pimp your ride, ford hordes, survive zombie deer herds, then get your brains gnoshed on by a zombie bear and have to start all over from the beginning... again.			"

												One of the things I love about this game is naming all the characters after real life friends, and let them know what happened. Like that time I tried to shoot a bandit but shot my party member. Or maybe the time I traded my friend for some supplies. Or even the time my party member went to have a number 1 and came back with a zombie bite. Desieses are annoing too. Not just do you have to waste time and food on sleeping but if it's on you, you'll have to use a medkit. Not to mention the amount of bones I've broken in the car. Also is it just me or is the character you play as the most rubbish driver ever? Seriously! He falls asleep at the weel, takes about a dozen wrong turns and hits over a million things on the road. This game also has a ton of references!8/10 Would get killed again! (By over a billion things)			"

												Depressing, but not quite as depressing as FTL.This is actually a far better game than Oregon Trail, or most zombie games for that matter, because the bad luck can be remedied with good performance in the arcade sequences. There are several, and they aren't afterthoughts. They're actually fun minigames. Unlike the old action interludes they parody, they're designed to frighten and challenge while still giving you a fair shake at success. Despite its appearance, this is a new videogame first and a retro homage last. Its underlying design is sophisticated and graceful.Much has been said about the awkward aiming controls, but they are like some ancient forgotten system unearthed by gaming archaeologists. I got used to them quickly, without ever becoming too comfortable. They add a manageable awkwardness to the combat encounters that I enjoyed.My one objection was the jarring experience of losing outright when my main character died, something I did not expect after finding myself in a groove of what seemed like a classic party adventure. This game feels more like a successor to Might & Magic, Starflight, and indeed FTL than it feels like like a one-joke riff on a piece of pop nostalgia, and I was a little bummed to just have the story end with four of my party still alive. Then again, there's something to be said for never finding out what happened to those guys. It's a little haunting, a bit more of what we fear about death than usually makes it into a game.Two bonus stars for an appropriate and pretty chiptune soundtrack, good production values, modern resolution options, and for somehow being much easier on the eyes than screenshots might lead you to believe.

												A great indie title that alot more people should own, Despite the basic 8-bit Graphics, It still puts you into a first person perspective of a proper zombie apocolypse with each decision you make affecting the outcome of your whole game. Combined with the fact that you have the option to name your party members, it can get personal (or funny) when it comes to the point of where you need to say goodbye to your close friends, either as a late farewell, or a sacrafise. This game has so much to do and can keep you entertained for hours, And the soundtrack, My god the soundtrack is just brilliant. 8 Bit Music at it's absolute best. The shooting controls are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ But that just adds to the challenge of the game and once you get use to it, It's not that bad.

												A parody of ""The Oregon Trail"", Organ Trail leaves the player and 4 of his buddys on a trip from Washington, all the way to Oregan in a desprate attempt to survive a nuclear holocaust with zombies.If there is anything about this game I can say, it's ♥♥♥♥ing difficult. It's got the good ole dickness of Oregon Trail while actually retaining a level of fairness that will keep you playing for a pretty long time.			"

												An excellent game limited by it's lack of variation and choices.Replayability is very large but long-play-at-once is harmed by lack of variation and repetitiveness. Very fun to try another game at harder difficulties, but if it drags on for too long you eventually become exhausted of the lack of surprises and it's very hard to keep interest. This happened in my first run. Scavenging consists of picking randomly appearing items on a limited map as zombies randomly spawn and get close to you, for 40 seconds. Sometimes you'll need to scavenge many times in a row. Yeah.Music is one of the best i've seen around, a frankenstein composed of chiptune music mixed with real instruments, super capable of conveying the emotions of having to put down your now-8-bit best friend after realizing you weren't going to have enough food to make it to safe haven at this pace.Could have had a lot of variation item wise, and would have been nice to have more things to look at, talking to strangers just consists of a text screen, and you can do it anywhere, even when not in towns. It made you question the solidity of the plot; just how many people are going on the roads at once if you can talk to anybody at anytime? Why is it dangerous then?Once you learn the mechanics it's very, very hard to die. Resting can get over any disease, broken leg, or bullet wound. There's no apparent benefit from keeping your friends  alive other than having extra support at finales and the score multiplier. They won't complain about your choices, you'll never be kicked off being a leader or care too much if someone gets bitten, after all, they won't die if they get bitten unless their health goes really low. Which is prevented with resting a few hours per town. Yeah.Otherwise, the game is really great and the first run you'll be covering your face hoping the scrap you managed to collect before you starved is able to fix your car so you can get to the next town and hopefully buy food. Real tense moments where your hands are tied and you must project into the future to know what to do, maybe Bobby doesn't deserve coming with you guys if he ruined food by sitting on it or throwing your only muffler at a zombie. Or maybe you could sell Karen to cannibals for 250 dollars. Hm. Or you are very wounded but Joe needs the medkit because he's suffering from radiation poisoning and his skin is ♥♥♥♥ing falling off.Gameplay 7/10Music 10/10Graphics 6.5/10 (this is because of the lack of variety, instead of being very low detail, it's supposed to be like that dummy)Overall 8/10It's worth the full price, it's great to pass the time. Although, a friend gifted it to me.			"

												As a person who's basically addicted to this game with over 100 hours of breaking limbs, getting Dysentry, and playing both Endless and beating the Campaign over. I can clearly say that I love this game. Naming your rag-tag group of survivors after friends, and soon letting yourself be more immersed in the atmosphere and looking past the retro pixel graphics, you got yourself a zombie survival game. It's really a huge part of my own personal fun of how I can imagine and experience my friends or certain people coming along to my ride, going through starvation, infection, bandits, zombies, and the like. With the chores of taking care of supplies, you can go at the game with your own pace, either it be conservative, going at a slow pace while trying to save as much food by starving your party, or much more aggressive/safe where you go as fast as possible, pushing your car to limits, as you give a huge buffet for all your party members to keep them healthy. There are two main modes to the game. There's the campaign mode;moving from Washington D.C all the way to the west coast to your final destination: Safe Haven. Then there's Endless mode, with you going as far as possible in the fastest pace for more points, trying to keep yourself, and (depending on your playstyle.) keeping your party alive. This is honestly a great simple game, with an amazing soundtrack along with lots of events occuring along with RNGesus to dicate a slow-death, or a plentiful gold mine of food, medkits, and other supplies. With the complete edition DLC, all your fun with the game only doubles, now adding extras! Such as even MORE RNGesus to give you more ways to death, a lot more choices in what you do. An amazing parody/redesign to the original Oregon Trail. Every dollar was worth it.			"

YouTube™ Video: Steam Review E25 Organ Trail: Director's Cut 

			Views: 78		

			Looking for a great retro game that parodies a classic retro game? Check out Organ Trail! Available on PC and Phones alike!		

Organ Trail: Director's Cut: A retro styled video game that parodies the famous Oregon Trail video game by putting you in a zombie apocalypse where you travel to a Safe Haven in Oregon in a station wagon. Very similar gameplay to Oregon Trail, you'll scavenge or trade for supplies, defend yourself from zombies, humans and evil hordes of deer and other monsters. Encounter random and weird things along the trail and watch your friends break arms, ribs and catch a variety of awful diarrhea disease like a case of classic dysentery. It being a retro game, the graphics are simple color pixel graphics, the sound in the game are also simple with beeps and boops making up all sounds. The music in the game is awesome, its this sort of rock bit music by Ben Crossbones, there is a soundtrack for sale with 22 track, 2 of which are only on the track, I would recommend checking it out for purchase. The game comes with a ton of extras, references to zombies in video games and movies, a Campaign and Endless mode to differentiate your game every time you play, if you don't prefer or enjoy retro games the Organ Trail won't change your mind, but, for everyone else it’s a fun and simple game, play on your phone or with friends and laugh at the horrible things that happen to them. TL/DR: Organ Trail is an awesome zombie game, it references movies and video games alike, and it’s simple enough to play, and it’s even available on your phone! If you don't like retro avoid this game, everyone else should check it out its only $4.99 USD and the soundtrack and the game is only $11.99 USD and laugh as your friends crap themselves to death. Or break legs, whichever.-Thumbs Up from RoyialVideo Reviews: www.youtube.com/RoyialNetwork "

												A fun zombie survival game with a lot of replayability. Put your friends in the game and see whom you can keep alive for that extra fun factor!A lot has been said about the clunky shooting mechanics, but if you give it a chance you'll be able to play without any problems.There are a lot of random events keeping it fresh, some collecting stuff and a good amount of achievements to hunt for.If you don't mind games that are a bit rough around the edges but have solid gameplay then I would recommend Organ Trail.

												5/5The most original remake concept I have ever seen!It's hard to sum up the words to describe Organ Trail...  It is Oregon Trail.  If you remember who Ronald Reagan or Ronald McDonald was, you probably played this game in school.  If not, bear with me.Organ Trail still retains the old turn based, town to town survival as the original.  The only real difference is that you are trying to survive while traveling west to escape the Zombie outbreak, rather than seeking fortune.The game is done PERFECTLY, in my opinion.  The music is haunting and the artwork is as smart and lovable as it is creepy.Lots of achievements and extras.  Every time I play I find something different.If you like Zombies... buy it.  If you like Oregon Trail... buy it.  If you like casual, fun games... buy it.  Oh hell, just buy it! "

												I first heard about Organ Trail from a youtuber who played the free flashgame version of this game a couple of months back.Later i heard about it from another youtuber who played the version on steam and i really enjoyed how the game looked, so i bought it.So far i don't regret it. The goal of the game is to make it from the east coast of the usa to the west coast. If you take into cosideration that a zombie apocalypse is taking place while you are trying to achieve that, it certainly doesn't make things any easier.The gameplay is simple but really intense: You and 4 other survivors (which you can name however you like) travel in a car from landmark to landmark. On the way from one landmark to another there are various things that can happen: You get robbed by thieves who steal your fuel, someone gets bitten by a zombie, a horde of deers appears behind you and you have to dodge them, someone gets sick, etc. etc.On the landmarks you get the chance to trade with other survivors for food, fuel, medkits, etc. You get to scavenge for supplies, repair your car or get perks from traders.All in all the gameplay is pretty simple, but awfully intense. The fact that you never know what happens on the road and the feeling you get when you are close to the safe haven but you don't know if you can make it because you are low on fuel or food is really nervewrecking and well done.Oh and the graphics and sound are phenomenal. 8-bit awesomeness from top to bottom.I'd recommend this game. The replayabilty is also pretty high, since every run is different and there is an endless mode to sum it all up. It's definitely worth 5 bucks. And if you are not sure, try out the free flashgame on the interwebs.			"

It's funny and definitely lives up to the 'throwback' adventure games of the Apple IIc/e era.  It doesn't take long to decide that this game is not your cup of tea, but it has some replayability value if you enjoy it.You are leading a group of friends across the United States.  On the way, you may have to decide whether to leave your zombie friend behind or even whether to shoot a zombie that is trying to eat your brain.  You have to plan for (or scavenge, in my experience) fuel, food, and money.7/10			"

												I just beat the game on Suicide difficulty, and now I myself feel like a zombie.This game retains all the RNG-screwage of the original Oregon Trail, but in a Zombie Apocalypse setting. On easier difficulties, the RNG is proportionately generous, but on Suicide it's just egregiously taxing as you're incessantly starved for any and all resources. It's painful.A lot of the achievements are broken and nonfunctional, so definitely stay away from this game if you're an achievement hunter.			"

												The Organ Trail is based off the other computer game most kids in the 90's played in school.  Cause it was the only game we could actully play in school that the teacher wouldn't yell at us for playing.The graphics are minimal, and I honestly applaud that, to many developers think that they need top notch 3D graphics to make a game fun, when you just need to have fun gameplay.  This game delivers fun gameplay in spades.You start off by picking the names of your companions, so you can sentance people you disilke to die or bring friends with you in spirit, after that its pretty much a zombie road trip, bad things will happen, you can try and prepare for it the best you can, but you are on a road trip cross country to reach a safe haven.The game has plenty of easter eggs, homages, and is just down right awesome, if you love zombie games, and adore indie games you really need to pick this one up for yourself.

I'm puzzled by the number of people who apparently didn't get this problem, so you can try, but just know that if your game somehow doesn't work properly, you're on your own.For the record, every other game I got from steam works fine.

												This one took me by surprise. Organ Trail is a old school adventure game where you travel by car, along with 4 of your friends, to a safe place where you're totally free of zombie attacks and other dangers. The art style is retro, so there are a lot of crude pixels and minimal sounds. I guess that also makes the gameplay retro, because it certainly isn't all that easy.There are so many things you have to take into consideration. Do you have enough spare tires, batteries and gas for your car, or enough food and medkits for your crew ? Are you prepared to trade stuff in order to get some of these things ? Do you even have stuff to trade ? If not, you have to scavenge for items. But is it safe from zombies or is the place packed ? And do you spend your money on buying upgrades for your car, or do you spend it on buying just the necessary ?There are a few boss fights, too, and quite a couple of random events, like, what are you going to do when a friend is being held hostage (shoot the guy in the face of course !) ? These random factors make this a great and fun game.The aiming, however (when you're scavenging or doing jobs), takes some getting used to. It becomes somewhat natural after a while, but doesn't feel quite right. I guess the developer chose this control scheme to keep the game more tense. If that's the case; they have succeeded. Congratulations developer !If you're still on the fence about buying this: I can highly recommended it.[Rating: 81/100]			"

												If you have a nostalgia itch for the old Oregon Trail game, it's an okay way to kill an hour or two. That said...I didn't have a good experience. Some of the mini-games upon leaving settlements are fun (e.g. biker attack, etc.), and the scavenging is interesting for the first handful of times. After that, everything just felt pointless.Resources: While scavenging, you only ever find 3 of the 8 or so resources you need. It quickly became quite boring to always find the same 3 things over and over again. I ended up with uselessly huge stockpiles of these resources to the point that they became irrelevant, and spent days waiting for traders to come by and offer to trade for anything else. This may be better on harder difficulties, but it was my first time through, so ""normal"" seemed like the logical choice.Party: As far as I can tell, there's no point to keeping your party alive other than just for the sake of keeping them alive. This is easier said than done, not because it's actually hard to care for them, but because they randomly wander off, and there's nothing you can do about it. Maybe I just had bad luck, but by 2/3 of the way through the trip all but one of my party had died this way. Maybe there's something that happens at the end if you have more survivors, but I never made it there because...With just a few stops left, my party saw ""something interesting"" happening off the highway. I chose to invesitage, and the game locked up. Just a black screen with the music playing and a little decorative pattern at the top. Apparently this is a common problem.Other reviewers here seem to like it. I found it repetitive, and all the progress I made was too easily wiped out by completely random mechanics and technical problems, making the game more frustrating than fun.TL;DR: Repeatedly scavenged for the same 3 items in order to feed a party that wandered off and died anyway. Then the game crashed. There are better games available for $5. If you can get it for a buck or two on sale, it might be worth it.			"

												If you grew up playing the regular ""Oregan Trail"" off those floppy disks and ancient cd's, and are a fan of the whole zombie scene, you will truely enjoy this game. Although the shooting mechanics may be a little clunky, you'll get used to them. Also this game references a bunch of other zombie things, such as ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Resident Evil"", and ""Left 4 Dead"". This is a nice little indie game, the dev's even captured the old ""Oh my, I broke my leg just driving along the road"", a little humor doesn't hurt, (Considering in game strangers mention this, lolol) This is a great east coast to west coast game, just like the original. Can you make it to safe haven?			"

												The Organ Trail. Right away I’m brought back to the good ole elementary school days of needlessly shooting buffalo and overfishing because it was considered “educational.” This game is a zombie spoof of the ever so beloved pioneer traveling game. You get to name your crew, pick your items, and board up into your station wagon to hit up the west. There are mini-games of wrecking biking crews and shooting zombies. The shooting mechanics are a bit clunky, but when you practice you’ll get better at it. Use a mouse; using a Facebook’s machine’s mouse pad will leave your tired and frustrated. Cute music and sound effects, the pixelated graphics will grow on you. It’s a fun spin on the traditional game. It’s a good game to burn sometime on, and you’ll find yourself amused at your friends catching dysentery because we all know the only people who know of such a disorder are the people whose virtual bffs got it while playing the Oregon Trail.  So board up your “wagon” and get on your way. 8/10			"

												Good nostalgia, solid oldschool gameplay, and a zombie game I didn't want to chuck out for building predictible gameplay on top of cliches - it kept me guessing juuuust enough to keep me interested. Probably a better way to get your Oregon Trail fix than actually trying to go back and play the verison this is based off of - it scales nicely and looks great even on my 2560x1440 resolution and the music/sound is retro inspired but won't make your ears bleed after a couple hours like some of the older games will. It's also got some cute perks and other modes like a little physics one where you mow zombies down in your station wagon and an endless mode. I probably won't go through and get all the unlocks and acheivements, but if you love it there's a lot here that tempts you for another few playthroughs.			"

												This is a really fun game, ESPECIALLY if you do the name-them-after-your-friends experience. Makes every playthrough a unique journey, and the struggles to keep your characters alive pretty tense. As it should be, in the zombie apocalypse. A brilliantly-executed parody of Oregon Trail too. A simple, charming game that is very much worth the price of $5.			"

												Organ trail will all your fulfill nostalgic needs and much more. Pros:The apocalyptic atmosphere is unique and awesomeThe soundtrack is killerThe shooting will feel wonky at first but is fun once you get the hang of itGood replay valueGreat humor, and not too over the topClements story is awesome sidescroller easter eggCons:No controller support (with how simple the game is it seems odd it’s missing)Awesome points of interest / mini encounters, but happen too rarely IMOAn easy game to get hooked on, and fun to come back to even after you finish it a couple times.

												This game really brings back memories of playing Oregon Trail as a kid. It's not a carbon copy of the original but it has enough similarities to give the same feel. I've read some reviewers not enjoying the differences and that the keys are a little wonky, but none of this bothered me. I still really enjoyed the game.			"

												If you grew up playing the regular ""Oregan Trail"" off those floppy disks and ancient cd's, and are a fan of the whole zombie scene, you will truely enjoy this game. Although the shooting mechanics may be a little clunky, you'll get used to them. Also this game references a bunch of other zombie things, such as ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Resident Evil"", and ""Left 4 Dead"". This is a nice little indie game, the dev's even captured the old ""Oh my, I broke my leg just driving along the road"", a little humor doesn't hurt, (Considering in game strangers mention this, lolol) This is a great east coast to west coast game, just like the original. Can you make it to safe haven?			"

												The Organ Trail. Right away I’m brought back to the good ole elementary school days of needlessly shooting buffalo and overfishing because it was considered “educational.” This game is a zombie spoof of the ever so beloved pioneer traveling game. You get to name your crew, pick your items, and board up into your station wagon to hit up the west. There are mini-games of wrecking biking crews and shooting zombies. The shooting mechanics are a bit clunky, but when you practice you’ll get better at it. Use a mouse; using a Facebook’s machine’s mouse pad will leave your tired and frustrated. Cute music and sound effects, the pixelated graphics will grow on you. It’s a fun spin on the traditional game. It’s a good game to burn sometime on, and you’ll find yourself amused at your friends catching dysentery because we all know the only people who know of such a disorder are the people whose virtual bffs got it while playing the Oregon Trail.  So board up your “wagon” and get on your way. 8/10			"

												Good nostalgia, solid oldschool gameplay, and a zombie game I didn't want to chuck out for building predictible gameplay on top of cliches - it kept me guessing juuuust enough to keep me interested. Probably a better way to get your Oregon Trail fix than actually trying to go back and play the verison this is based off of - it scales nicely and looks great even on my 2560x1440 resolution and the music/sound is retro inspired but won't make your ears bleed after a couple hours like some of the older games will. It's also got some cute perks and other modes like a little physics one where you mow zombies down in your station wagon and an endless mode. I probably won't go through and get all the unlocks and acheivements, but if you love it there's a lot here that tempts you for another few playthroughs.			"

												I really enjoyed my time with Organ Trail: Director's Cut. It's like Oregon Trail (I have fond memories of playing this in computer class when I was in grade school in the early to mid '90s), and the game even has a very retro feel. Instead of the new frontier theme of Oregon Trail you'll be treated to a dark and somber Zombie theme... although the game is littered with some light humor. It'll take some wits, skill, and luck to get across the US. Overall I thought the game was a lot of fun, and it's a game I know I'll come back to every so often. I even have it on my tablet and played through it (it takes roughly 2 1/2 hrs to clear... if you can make it) in the hospital while I was waiting for my daughter to arrive. I think a lot of people would like Organ Trail, and I especially recommend it to the people that have fond memories of playing the original Oregon Trail.			"

												Honestly, the way the game is advertised, it sure feels like it's supposed to be a comedy game. However, I was very mistaken. It's dark, dreary, and eerie, and while some parts are very funny, it's still dark and scary. For instance, there is a possible scene where you find a woman who is sad, because on her wedding day, the outbreak occurred and her future husband died. The way it was written kinda creeped me out most of all, though.However it's a lot of fun, especially if you've played Oregon Trail before. Just keep in mind that it's not exactly supposed to be a parody.			"

Aiming and shooting don't come easy but if you were a survivor in a zombie apocalypse and you never fired a gun shooting wouldn't come easy to you too. Achievements add a decent amount of replayability. There's also a few different game modes to challenge you and a couple of mini-games that you discover along your journey. Highly recommended if you're a fan of Oregon Trail or if you're just a fan of zombies... this game is like a re-imagined version but with a zombie twist. I've had lots of fun with this.			"

												Taking the old formula of ""Oregon Trail"", a depiction of Pilgrims making their way across the United States to the west coast, Organ Trail twists this classroom classic into a fight for survival as you flee Zombies and the natural unilateral retaliation from the US (whatever's left of it) Government.With difficulty squarely in place like the old school games of yester-year, Organ Trail can provide a excellent amount of replayability as you change tactics and deal with surprises you didn't have the last run you made.You've probably heard of Organ Trail, well.. It's on Steam for a reason. At $4.00, it's criminal to pass it up.			"

However, Organ Trail is much easier.The trouble is that there really isn't much game here.  It's a lot of sitting and making decisions, which you know, worked for a sort of educational game but not so much this.  It's just a parody, really.  Good for one run, maybe two, but that's about it.I'm not really knocking it, just, yeah.  Play it through once and you're done.  At most?  Probably three hours.I recommend it, I guess.  It's not bad.  Bit boring sometimes and I never could play it for long durations, but it's not exactly a long game, either.  I enjoyed some of the parody elements but a lot were, I don't know, eh?It has some good things going on though, so maybe check it out.  It's not expensive.			"

												At first it might seem only a parody of ""Oregon Trail"", that's only made to parodise a well-known game. But when you start to REALLY get in to it, you'll understand that this game has a interesting strory: it is about you and your group of friends trying to survive the oh-so-suden zombie apocalypse, making though choices (selling/buying neccessary supplies, putting down infected party members), and most importantly making it to ""Safehaven"", a place that is rumored to be the safest place in America.Every time you start a new story, you'll be able to pick 5 names for your group of survivors, the game spawns random events, that make you lose precious supplies. It suddenly starts minigames that make you evade a group of bikers/a horde of reindeers. Every time you start a new playthrough, it will be like playing a brand new game.If you like games about rainbows, this game is not for you. If you like games about unicorns, this game is not for you.If you want to put your zombie survival skills to good use in a very unique way, then this game is for you.			"

												A nostalgic walk back to a simpler time in gaming, with a zombified twist.  The pixel-art designs of each stop along the journey has sly references to other games and movies related to the genre.  My eyes weretreated to creative details the longer I stared at each of these playfully macabre settings.  The trip across the States was filled with engaging events and opportunities to trade, fight zombies, and upgrade my car and combat skills.For +1 to your fun factor, name the people who join you on the journey after folks you know in real life.  I lost my sister-in-law early on, which I'm sure my brother held as a grudge against me the rest of the trip.  Whether or not you played the quintessential Oregon Trail growing up, this game deserves your attention with its grim-spirited, tongue-in-cheek, yet challenging, and full-of-replay-value package.

Each city you can buy, trade, or upgrade if you have thre funds.You have 4 chars and 1 main - trying to make it from one coast to the next during a Zombie apocolypse.  One of the cool things is stopping anywhere to scavenge or wait for a passerby to trade items with to repair your car or stock up before a city.Obviously the graphics and shooting the gun are the weak points but overall I had a pretty good time.  Lost all 3 of my friends - Jeremiah and Johanna got bite by Zombies, had to put them down.  Tommy was killed when taken hostage and I missed the shot. However me and my wife made it.  Cool game!			"

												Rating: 7/10One of those games you think is going to be horrible but turns out to be an absolute gem. The game doesn't rely on the generic formula of incessant Zombie killing and focuses more on the means of survival, which adds more realism to the overall experience.			"

												This is very much a game you buy solely for the novelty of it. Yearning for the specific nostalgic frustration of Oregon Trail with a new post-apocalyptic zombie-plague paint job? Then throw $5 at this and laugh as the survivors you name after friends/famous people succumb to dysentry and squash precious food into uselessness with their bums.However, don't expect this game to be fun for more than an hour, or two to three at the most. This is especially if you've never played Oregon Trail before, are frustrated by randomized events  you have no power over, and an awkward aiming system (you have to drag a quick line from target to your gun with your cursor, as well as allow for bullet travel time).

												At first it might seem only a parody of ""Oregon Trail"", that's only made to parodise a well-known game. But when you start to REALLY get in to it, you'll understand that this game has a interesting strory: it is about you and your group of friends trying to survive the oh-so-suden zombie apocalypse, making though choices (selling/buying neccessary supplies, putting down infected party members), and most importantly making it to ""Safehaven"", a place that is rumored to be the safest place in America.Every time you start a new story, you'll be able to pick 5 names for your group of survivors, the game spawns random events, that make you lose precious supplies. It suddenly starts minigames that make you evade a group of bikers/a horde of reindeers. Every time you start a new playthrough, it will be like playing a brand new game.If you like games about rainbows, this game is not for you. If you like games about unicorns, this game is not for you.If you want to put your zombie survival skills to good use in a very unique way, then this game is for you.			"

												Not everyone who wears hats are nice and compty you know.This game have a nice idea behind it but someone who wears hats suddenly decided that if this game goes in Steam he will change the shooting mechanic and he did, he destroyed the game. Shooting using your mouse is a joke.The game even barely launch, sometimes it launches sometimes it don't and most of the time it don't. It stays in the background and it stays there until you kill it.The achievement I admit are hard to get and I basically had to wait many months for the developers to fix it and when they did I started racking up achievements and after I perfected the game I shelved it, the game is so bad you don't even want to play it again.

												Good concept for a game, solid take on the old Oregon trail graphics and gameplay, but buggy as hell, particularly in the scavenge missions, where you'll sometimes sustain injuries for no reason other than the game not recognizing when you fire or taking to long to load that you've already left.  They stand out since the rest of the game is so solidly designed, but these shortcomings are frustrating and artificially jack up the difficulty of an already fairly difficult game.			"

												Much has already been said, I add my vote and some of my own considerations:- the game is ok, nothing to say about it, but it seems not polished enough to grab your attention for more than... two, three hours...- the graphics, ""minimal"", seems too simplified for a PC game- some event, but not much variation, at the endSo, this can bring us to a 7, or a 8, if you like the style of game and have some fun.Frankly, despite the very low price (excellent, I would say), after only two hours of play I had enough: overall, the game seemed somewhat bland.

												For the price I paid for it, I'm not too upset about buying this game ... but, even at that price, this game is basically a one-shot joke that is given away in the title. If you're both a massive zombie fan and are nostalgic for the original Oregon Trail then maybe you would get slightly more enjoyment out of it, but I never played the Oregon Trail (although similar games from the same period, e.g. Granny's Garden if anyone remembers that...), and really there is only about 10-20 minutes of entertainment here.On the plus side: the execution as far as they were aiming for is solid, the retro graphics style is done very well, and it's nice to hear a few bleeps and bloops. But the minigames get boring incredibly quickly, could've done with a few more of them to keep things varied, and there just isn't the depth to make this interesting to play. I got very close to winning on my first game but for the amount of content here it takes absolutely ages to get there and I wasn't compelled to try again.However like I said, for a few quid you can't really go wrong, if you're intrigued by this game then you might as well go for it!

												An interesting approach to the over-done ""zombie apocalypse"" themed doomsday games, Organ Trail combines pixelated graphics with poor controls to deliver a less than satisfying adventure. Had the controls been easier to get used to, the game might have had a chance at playability solely for the sake of it, but sadly, the catapult style of aiming is not my thing and since there is no way to change it, I quit after 10 minutes or so.Sadly, the game appears to hae nothing new to add storywise either: end of the zorld through zombies, friends in a party trying to survive, trying to find a safe place... Sound familiar? Combined with the poor graphics, and horrible gameplay controls, I'd say you are better off avoiding this game completely.			"

												Nostalgia is a weakness of mine. I have 8 different game consoles going back to the SEGA Master System, and I still play them all. Any game that can offer a memorable experience with a big dose of familiarity is likely to score points with me. Organ Trail delivers.My love of zombie lore is well known, so a game that promises cannibalistic carnage is already on the wishlist. But the real reason I'm recommending this little gem is for the mental rush it gives me. I feel like I'm back in 2nd grade computer class, and Miss Eissens said we could stop the typing and play. I spent many frustrating and rewarding hours shooting buffalo and fording rivers, only for Mary to get dysentery and die horribly. The original Oregon Trail is one of those games that everyone has played, whether they're a gamer or not. Organ Trail is a faithful homage and a ridiculous zombie apocalypse yarn as well. The graphics are simple, 16-color pixels, the controls are hair-pullingly difficult to master, and even on the lowest difficulty setting, you are not reaching Safe Haven without taking a few hits. The random events include blizzards, sandstorms, and bandits. You have to keep your party healthy, and you have to make sure your station wagon doesn't break down. You'll also have to ford hordes of zombies, engage in shoot-outs with gangs, and buy and sell food, ammo, scrap, fuel, car parts, and medkits. There are loads of references to other zombie games and films, including Left 4 Dead, Zombieland, Evil Dead, and many, many more. The game has a juvenile sense of humor and a pleasing measure of self-awareness; it's possible to encounter a stranger in town who simply says ""these controls suck!""There are nearly 30 achievements and over 300 unique tombstones to find (including... YOUR OWN!), encouraging replayability. Endless mode and Clements Quest are also welcome additions to the formula, and there's in-game ""Skulls"" to shoot for while playing. Heh. Skulls. Shoot. I'm funny.Organ Trail is not going to please everyone. This game is not for the hardcore FPS player or someone who wants an in-depth story and simple controls. This game is for people who remember the ecstacy and the agony of playing Oregon Trail back in the day and thinking ""yeah, it's fun, but it could use more zombies.""			"

												An interesting, parodical take on the notorious and educational Oregon Trail games. However, instead of a covered wagon of pioneers trekking from Missouri to Oregon across the 19th-century American Midwest, replace all that with a station wagon of survivors trekking from Washington, D.C. to California across post-apocalyptic America. From the gameplay to the graphics, everything in Organ Trail: Director's Cut pays homage to the classic Oregon Trail for the Apple II, but it adds its own interesting twists for a unique experience. Multiple difficulty levels, game modes, unlockables, achievements, and other various extras give it a good amount of replayability. The controls are a little wonky and take some time to get used to, but the game is solid otherwise. Amidst a sea of other zombie games, Organ Trail: Director's Cut manages to be unique by creatively merging multiple ideas, both modern and classic, to create a rewarding gameplay experience.			"

												This is addictive, but to get into it you really need to be into an RPG experience, I like the style of the game and I get lost in the different options dealing with the struggle to carry on to the finish line. However it gets a bit carried away with the micro transactions, and having to wait around a lot.Also I just encountered a bug the moment I submitted this review, so now my experience is soured because I'm stuck in some small glitch that I have no idea how to fix, I'm stuck in front of a hord in the rain, but I can't stop, wait, or move, so I can only assume the creators didn't intend to make their game unplayable and it has to be a bug. It's a small one that not many people have encountered, so I'll give it a pass for now, since they could patch it and otherwise this is a fun game.It really feels like a tablet game after you play it a while, and it is coming out for tablet devices so that makes sense. I think it's fun, but I'm glad I didn't pay full price, it's more of a game you want to play to pass some time, waiting at the band or waiting for your meal at a resturant if you're with people you don't want to talk to.

Nobody knows what cause the outbreak but we've all heard rumors of this so called 'Safe Haven' out on the west coast.  Grab the gear and put our friends into the station wagon it's time to head west.This zombified version of 'Oregon Trail' keeps enough of the classic game to trigger quality nostalgia while adding enough new mechanics to make it feel fresh and exciting.  Some of the events and outcomes can feel overly random and unfair but the wasteland roads are not the safest.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!Interface/Menu/SettingsThe graphics are Pixelated.The music is very old schoolish but repetive.The game has Local Co-op, but only available on Events.There is a Volume slider that affects Music or Sound. Even Click! (Bullet)You can play this with a Controller (because of 2-player mode)There is a Campaign and Endless Mode.There is an Auto-save Version, For each hour/move that you are doing.There is a Difficulty Settings. About the gameYou can Name your main character and all Party members.There is a Day and night cyclus, which will affect the game difficulty. As in too dangerous or safe.There are Events in the game, Negative, Positive and neutrals ones.There are ""random"" Boss Events.You play with a pixelated character in events, That has to shoot zombies, Bandits and getting Resources.You have Party members that may get sick/infected/die or cause for trouble.There are Cities, Where you can buy stuff, like Car or main character upgrades, Sell stuff, or even trade stuff. They also have Jobs which you may could do to get an extra of something! Other thingsThere is a Serious game-breaking bug going on which put you in a huge advantage and good state.Once you have completed an event, like ""Scavenge"", They will show you how much resources you have collected. When that screen pops-up and u have like 100 Food and 20 Scrap from that event.Press Shift-tab and then click on ""return to game"" You will get the popup screen again, Do Shift-tab again and then click on return to game. And once again you will get the same popup screen again.(This works on fullscreen and window mode and you need to active steam overlay.)You are able to take a wrong turn.... even if u are just driving on 1 straight road.Try to do Drive or Scavenge when the Horde is quiet. If you are driving or doing scavenge in Night time(Which will increase the zombie difficulty by alot) There is a higher chance for a negative event.Otherwise just Rest, Repair or Trade.Bandit Missions are relative easy, Even on suicide. It is all about Timing. So do not be afraid to give this a try.Let's Try Video:

												Organ Trail...where to begin? If it isn't the zombies killing you, which it rarely is, it's the idiotic actions played out by your fellow survivors. In my whole life, I've never broken a bone but each person in your group may break several within a few weeks. I have played a fair amount of this game and I can honestly say that it was worth what I paid for it. The unfortunate reality of a post-zombie outbreak is very apparent throughout the game. I guess once a zombie outbreak occurs everyone forgets how to drive (since you bust your car on almost every turn), how to just be mindful of your possessions (since you break♥♥♥♥♥♥all the time), and herds of deer and very poorly managed biker gangs run rampant across the whole country. If it is on sale, which it is a lot, I wouldn't pass it up. And for a low price of $5 when it isn't on sale, why wait?			"

												This games fantastic and cheap, I usually write bigs reviews but i'll keep this one short.Its probably one of my favourites, if i had a top 50 it would certainly be in there, i believe its based on a game called Oregon trail for the Atari 2600 as well, it looks aged and feels aged but the gameplay is just so well done, you've to basically travel from one side of the USA to the other, lots can go wrong and lots can happen while traveling, theres a nice amount of randomly generated content to keep this fresh and the gameplay just feels fantastic.Its rather hard to talk about all the great things in this game without showing it to you, this game doesn't look like anything special at all, infact i only picked it up on sale because it was literally only about £2 and its been the best £2 i've ever spent, you won't get hundreds of hours out of it but you'll have an experience you'll remember strong, it feels good to play this game and even better to complete it, if i were to pick one indie game to give out to everyone for free for them to play and experience it would probably be this one, it deserves a sequel!

												Organ Trail...where to begin? If it isn't the zombies killing you, which it rarely is, it's the idiotic actions played out by your fellow survivors. In my whole life, I've never broken a bone but each person in your group may break several within a few weeks. I have played a fair amount of this game and I can honestly say that it was worth what I paid for it. The unfortunate reality of a post-zombie outbreak is very apparent throughout the game. I guess once a zombie outbreak occurs everyone forgets how to drive (since you bust your car on almost every turn), how to just be mindful of your possessions (since you break♥♥♥♥♥♥all the time), and herds of deer and very poorly managed biker gangs run rampant across the whole country. If it is on sale, which it is a lot, I wouldn't pass it up. And for a low price of $5 when it isn't on sale, why wait?			"

Take the classic edutainment title The Oregon Trail and replace the setting of 19th century emigrants with the zombie apocalypse and you've got this game. You can still go hunting for supplies, name your party after your friends (and secretly chuckle when they die of dysentery) trade with towns and cross rivers.

												I had to look twice to see if this was a retro classic that had been re-released or ported to the steam store. But it turns out it's not, and is indeed an original/fresh game.The graphics are authentic of what you would expect from a game during the days of the sega master system (and before). Do not be put down by the graphics however, as the gameplay is certainly there. I haven't had so much fun with a pixel based sprite game in at least a decade. There are lots of elements to the game that give you a rush of nostalgia, be it the music, the menu systems, or the animations, it certainly brought back memories of some titles on the sega mega drive; for me.The various gameplay mechanics also work well, even though they are fairly simple. It's also quite fun to discover an old gravestone on the road-side (with a personal message that you wrote) on the next play through.I also have to say that the soundtrack is brilliant. Most games that i enjoy for years to come have succeeded on the basis of the music and the gameplay alone, i think Organ Trail might be one of them.I ended up with this game after the purchase of a recent humble-bundle, but having played a few hours through Organ Trail, i think it's somethin gi would've paid full price for on it's own. 10/10 from me. Lots of fun, and importantly; lots of replayability.			"

												We all loved Oregon Trail growing up. We would spend hours, trying to make it across the new world. Hunting for food, trading for bullets and wagon parts and struggling to keep your family alive, challenged by starvation and illness! Well guess what, If you love Zombies and Oregon trail, this is the game for you! I've already played many stories, seen many things, and have survived many times, but lost a few. Travel to the safehouse across the zombie-ridden United States, scavenging for food, scrap, and money. Trade with locals to get new parts for your station wagon, or more bullets. Run from stampeding zombie deer and fight off bandit attacks! You know those rivers you forded in Oregon Trail? Well now you ford your way through zombie hordes! Still not enough for you? Why don't you go ahead and invite a celebrety to ride in your station wagon with you? You might just get a surprise!			"

												I'm not sure exactly what I thought this game would be like, but that doesn't matter.What matters is, that I got positively surprised by this game.Yes, it's not a very long campaign, but who cares?The replayability in this game is high, since it's completely random.Well, of course it isn't COMPLETELY random, but the events are random.I bought this a day or two ago, and I've already gotten 3 hours in it. ''Yeah, so what? That's not very much.'' I know it might not be much, but it just seem so fresh to me, and saying that I already got 3 hours in it isn't very smart of me, considering I have, by no means, been playing it non stop.I'm no expert in games like these, but it feels like a lot of content for the price tag.I'm gonna give it a 9 / 10 , because it does what it sets out to do very well.My main problem with it is just the fact that the hitboxes when scavenging are a bit messed up. The hitboxes I'm talking about is the players. Sometimes you will feel cheated, or feel that it isn't fair, that the zombie could hit you. Why would you feel like that? Because it isn't fair, the player's hitbox is a bit too large, but it's easy to look past when the rest of the game is so addictive.			"

												Organ Trail is a game that is pretty much what you're expecting: Oregon Trail with zombies in it. The game takes care to explore the wonderful word of '80s graphics and user interfaces, but doesn't do the dumb mistake of going all-in on nostalgia in many aspects, opting for difficulty settings and WASD control methods. The couple of things it keeps from Oregon Trail are the basic structure of the game as well as the savage Murphy's Law ♥♥♥♥ery permeating the gameplay. And also it has zombies in it, but ♥♥♥♥ you, it's a nice reimagining.			"

												Organ Trail is an obvious parody of the old-school game 'Oregon Trail', a game I must admit I've never played, despite hearing so much about it.  I do know what makes a good game, though, and this is brilliant.The aim of the game is simple; survive in a post-apocalyptic zombie-led world as you and four companions make it across the United States to the last remaining human stronghold.  Riding in a clapped-out station wagon, you'll need to gather what meagre supplies you can, keeping a close eye on your food, fuel, ammo and equipment for your vehicle, while riding from safe zone to safe zone.At each safe zone, you'll be able to rest, repair and trade, along with taking part in optional scavenger missions or jobs that put you at greater risk.  The road between each zone is littered with random encounters, from conversation set pieces to shoot-outs, from graverobbing to surviving stampedes of undead animals.What makes this game brilliant is it is the perfect balance of risk versus reward.  Low on food? You could scavenge the surroundings while multiple zombies approach, but if they catch you, it could be all for naught.  Can your station wagon survive until the next zone, or should you stop in no-mans land and attempt to repair it? How long should you keep a valuable companion alive that has been bitten by the undead?  Should you blast through that zombie horde, or wait for it to disperse while your supplies dwindle?  And should you push your vehicle faster, to save on food and get to Safe Haven? Or would you go at a more leisurely pace, and risk running low on supplies?It's important to note that this game is a fun diversion, a full playthrough taking no more than a few hours.  The mini-games are varied but very basic, as are the graphics - don't get this expecting anything more than crudely drawn Amstrad style animations.  The companions that accompany you are also nothing more than the name you give them.  It's best, then, to go into this game with a wild imagination, rather than a massive expectation of an epic zombie survival thriller.Finally, a shout-out must go to the gorgeous music, which is capable of inspiring terror and elation in equal measure.  It perfectly encapsulates the beautiful-yet-irrevocably scarred landscape that you must cross to reach your goal.For the price, definitely recommended.			"

												As a child I played the Oregon Trail on those, now ancient, Apple II computers while in the computer lab of my elementary school. back then the thing to do was die of measles, snakebite, dysentery, typhoid, cholera, or exhaustion while moving along the historic Oregon Trail. I remember we had some good times trying to make that trip. My favorite thing to do in this game was to go hunting. It was so easy to point and click at the animal you wished to kill.In Organ Trail: Director's Cut hunting is not nearly as easy. You have to hold down the mouse button and pull back in the equal but opposite direction to the zombie you want to kill. Over complicated for no reason. This is my only complaint about this game though.I enjoy that this game brings back all of the old memories of my childhood while simultaneously including a modern spin on a post apocalyptic zombie outbreak. Each difficultly level is challenging but not so challenging that it is super frustrating. This is a great game that everyone can play comfortably without quitting in a thunderous rage.I strongly recommend this game.			"

												Alright. ThIs game is ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME!its a spin-off of the old classic Orgeon Trail, a game where you control a party of pioneers, and attempt to get them to orgeon.Organ Trail has the same premise, you control a group of survivors, and attemtp to get them to a safe haven across the united states.The Gameplay is great, gunplay's a bit strange (Inverted, but dont let that scare you off)The characters are great, becuase you can name them yourself, expect for clements, he's to awesome to be named by you.The Game is really fun, recommended by me, you should play it.

												This games fantastic and cheap, I usually write bigs reviews but i'll keep this one short.Its probably one of my favourites, if i had a top 50 it would certainly be in there, i believe its based on a game called Oregon trail for the Atari 2600 as well, it looks aged and feels aged but the gameplay is just so well done, you've to basically travel from one side of the USA to the other, lots can go wrong and lots can happen while traveling, theres a nice amount of randomly generated content to keep this fresh and the gameplay just feels fantastic.Its rather hard to talk about all the great things in this game without showing it to you, this game doesn't look like anything special at all, infact i only picked it up on sale because it was literally only about £2 and its been the best £2 i've ever spent, you won't get hundreds of hours out of it but you'll have an experience you'll remember strong, it feels good to play this game and even better to complete it, if i were to pick one indie game to give out to everyone for free for them to play and experience it would probably be this one, it deserves a sequel!

												Organ Trail is a game that is pretty much what you're expecting: Oregon Trail with zombies in it. The game takes care to explore the wonderful word of '80s graphics and user interfaces, but doesn't do the dumb mistake of going all-in on nostalgia in many aspects, opting for difficulty settings and WASD control methods. The couple of things it keeps from Oregon Trail are the basic structure of the game as well as the savage Murphy's Law ♥♥♥♥ery permeating the gameplay. And also it has zombies in it, but ♥♥♥♥ you, it's a nice reimagining.			"

												This is pretty much an adult version of Oregon Trail, as one would expect. It can be really fun, and is really easy to beat. Once you've completed it once though, it becomes a game about getting the highest score or collecting achievemtns. Even in the seeming amount of repetitive tasks that are utilized in this game, the game is still loads of fun. If you remember Oregon Trail fondly and have a few bucks to spend, this title may be worth your time.			"

												This is a game that was made for those of us who grew up on Oregon Trail... obviously. It is truly a faithful adaptation that has been infused with zombie pop-culture. It is a game that can be challenging, and will become repeatitive by the time you beat the campaign. I love supporting developers that revive games from my childhood and I loved every minute of gameplay, but it probably won't be a game you'll want to keep coming back to.			"

												I myself have never been a fan of zombie games.  Other than tell tales walking dead, I have not found myself very interested in most zombie games. I hated left4dead, and thought dead island was incredibly medicore. But this game is AMAZING. despite using an ""atari"" graphical style, and not exactually riviting in terms of music or dialouge ect, I found myself more emotionally attached to my own pixelated characters. Than any triple A zombie game out there.  As you progress, your resources get lower and lower, and things get tougher. The game gave me an odd sense of doom, but hope at the same time. And that hope is what kept me playing. To make it through.  I usually for the most part do not like indie games.  But with it's cheap price, and great replay value, I highly highly reccomended this.  I would hope for a sequel. But maybe it's better off being a stand alone game.  Whoever made this game, I commend you for the great amount of effort put into this simplistic but at the same time, complicated game.The game is primarly about resource managment, and going across the USA, in hopes of getting to your final destination, ""safe haven"" you have to survive zombies, bandits, and get supplies, fix your car, ect, it's based off one of my favorite PC game series, ""The Oregon Trail"" I might even argue that this game is a tad bit better than the original Oregon Trail games. I'd highly reccomended it.			"

												It's a good game, but flawed. The writing, theory, and graphics are all where they need to be and what you should expect from a zombie game based on Organ Trail, funny and dark. The biggest issue for me is the actual gameplay. Aiming is practically some sort of witchcraft, there's no way you complete some jobs, at least I couldn't. The other issue is the dullness of the AI. I beat the game and shot maybe 12 zombies, if you have decent left hand skills you will be fine, because even Pac Man had more challenging AI. So why am I recommend it? Because the game works, is fun and enjoyable, gunpaly aside, and at least someone is trying to freshen up the zombie safe heaven escape story line.			"

It's a passable Oregon Trail homage, with a heavy emphasis on gunplay. The problem is... the aiming controls are just plain AWFUL. In a game where nearly every problem is solved by shooting zombies or thieves, you NEED to be able to snap and aim quickly, and this cannot be done with this control scheme.			"

												Many of the encounters in this game require careful aiming. However, I found the aiming mechanic very difficult and unintuitive . As a consequence, I never could get into the game and it did not hold any enjoyment for me.			"

												After you get over the initial humor the game has to offer (and you'll probably get over it quickly), it just isn't a fun game to play.

												Organ Trail was an okay distraction but there's no real meat to the game.  Some events are reused constantly (I swear, if I have to avoid another biker gang...) and the basic gameplay is too simplistic to engage me even as a pick up and play game.

												My 4-ish hours are actually solely from farming cards. I won this game at a giveaway and I only participated on that because the store page reads ""full controller support"". I never had a problem with controller support not working in games when the store page says it's present (even if it's just partial), but it's practically non-existent for Organ Trail. Developers seem to have either abandoned the game or just can't be bothered to give information reagarding their mistake, as I'm not the only one (certainly not the first either) to complain about the lack of controller support when the devs went all the way to say it's fully supported. Thumbs down for the false information and absent developers who, despite the game's success (or exactly bc of it), don't even care to fix the information on the store page.			"

												Organ Trail is a parody of the classic Oragan trail, but is this a parody you want to try ? In Organ Trail you and your group are trying to get to Safe haven among a zombie apocalypse. So how is this game ? Its pretty great game apart from the difficulty. In the game youre going to point A to B. Its really hard to explain so ill try to summerize. there many thing you do so here we go nuber 1 you drive from city to city in those citys you trade for supplies to help you survive. Number 2 you can scavenge and collect supplies so you dont have to pay for them and there are many jobs rainging from getting something somoene lost to killing bandits. This game has much to do about strategy and rationing youre supplies which may become difficult when the game wants to cheat with ya. Overall this game is a good expierience if you want to feel like you are in a zombie apocalypse with rationg supplies and trying to stay alive also it adds a second campaing for free which is awesome so the final score im giving this game is an 8/10			"

												Wouldn't have expected that such a pixalated game would create so much drama and tension. Really enjoyable game if you like taking rough decisions and gambling for your survival and you are able to overlook the graphics and the sounds (of course if you are a retro fan like myself, you will love them). Even if randomness has a great part, skill is also needed and not only ""decision-skill"" (which implies some mathematician skill as well, to measure your chances good) or gambler skill (luck) but also aiming skill. Another nice part is the customization part. But my favorite part, with which maybe I should have started is: THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST TRADING  SIMULATORS DURING A ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE...EVER!			"

												""Organ Trail is a retro zombie survival game. Travel westward in a station wagon with 4 of your friends, scavenging for supplies and fending off the undead; Faithfully recreated it as if it were on the Apple 2. Packed full of zombie mechanics, themes and references; this is a must have for any zombie survival fans.""Truer words cannot be spoken. If you have a touch of nostalgia or want to jump in your time machine and go back to the time when floppy disks ruled the earth, then this game is for you. From the midi music to the graphics, the game is retro through and through.Total time it took me to complete it was set at around 3 hours, and by the first 30 minutes you already know the entire game mechanics and how to beat them.Like with any dubstep song however, you gotta wait for the drop:I would not recommend buying it unless you are feeling nostalgically retro, $5 is a bit steep seeming as you can get a host of golden oldies off of websites such as Abandonia for free and the only reason I came across this game was because it was included in one of the Humble Bundles.I say that just like zombies, the modern-retro era is dead and this game serves to merely show us what horrors lurked in the past in the form of 8 bit graphics and midi scores that leave your ears bleeding. The past was great but we have come a long way from it - no point in trying to resurrect it in the hope that it bites a gamer and sets off a retro gaming contagion.			"

												Organ Trail is a very fun game. And it's very comfy. But honestly, you're better off not buying this. The full game is riddled with bugs that'll make it freeze. I have never had that problem in the the flash game version. If you are seriously considering getting this, play the flash game first. If you still like that, consider if you're willing to wade through a heap of bull in the (pretty high) chance it locks up when you beat the game. This isn't even a rare occurence, this is a well known, reported, practically game breaking bug that has not been fixed in apparently months of it being known. And what does this version add over the flash game? Harder difficulties, but they're still pretty easy; Scavenging is absolutely overpowered even with the more difficult shooting controls. Extra content as far as picking what sprite your character uses, special buyable power ups, and unlockable starting vehicles. Plus, there's a minigame that's very similar to Spongebob's Boat-O-Cross. Not really a huge step up; the only major points are the new job system and being able to pick alternate routes at certain spots on the map. All in all, if you want to play, you should really just stick with the flash game unles you get this version cheap. Even so, be prepared to deal with lock ups.			"

												This is a zombiefied version of the 1980's Oregon Trail game, popular with schoolchildren in the 1980's. Apart from a chuckle and some nostalgia for Americans, this game offers very dated and primitive gameplay that could be easily accomplished in a web browser using Flash.The PC version of this game is simplistic pixel graphics that makes the NES look good (which, I suppose, is an homage to the 1980's game). Clearly if it's doing something your smartphone could do, or could be done in a browser, nostalgia aside, it's not worth spending any money on as it's not offering a genuine PC gaming experience.

												After watching countles videos of Oregon Trail in my life (Cr1TiKal basically), and then finding out about this little game; I just had to get it. Made to be retro design and built just like the obvious game it's modern day zombifying. And the little reference to Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland with the party members made me laugh. Point and click pointy shooty oh my god yes. I highly recommend this as it's cheap, and enjoyable fun. Blah blah blah friggyaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh			"

												Organ Trail is a very fun game. And it's very comfy. But honestly, you're better off not buying this. The full game is riddled with bugs that'll make it freeze. I have never had that problem in the the flash game version. If you are seriously considering getting this, play the flash game first. If you still like that, consider if you're willing to wade through a heap of bull in the (pretty high) chance it locks up when you beat the game. This isn't even a rare occurence, this is a well known, reported, practically game breaking bug that has not been fixed in apparently months of it being known. And what does this version add over the flash game? Harder difficulties, but they're still pretty easy; Scavenging is absolutely overpowered even with the more difficult shooting controls. Extra content as far as picking what sprite your character uses, special buyable power ups, and unlockable starting vehicles. Plus, there's a minigame that's very similar to Spongebob's Boat-O-Cross. Not really a huge step up; the only major points are the new job system and being able to pick alternate routes at certain spots on the map. All in all, if you want to play, you should really just stick with the flash game unles you get this version cheap. Even so, be prepared to deal with lock ups.			"

												This is a zombiefied version of the 1980's Oregon Trail game, popular with schoolchildren in the 1980's. Apart from a chuckle and some nostalgia for Americans, this game offers very dated and primitive gameplay that could be easily accomplished in a web browser using Flash.The PC version of this game is simplistic pixel graphics that makes the NES look good (which, I suppose, is an homage to the 1980's game). Clearly if it's doing something your smartphone could do, or could be done in a browser, nostalgia aside, it's not worth spending any money on as it's not offering a genuine PC gaming experience.

												A zombie-themed spoof of the classic, Organ Trail is a terrificly addictive survival strategy game with a dash of action for good measure. This game puts you in a charge of a group of 4 other survivors of a zombie apocalypse, the goal being to get yourself and your comrades from Washington, D.C. to a safe zone on the West Coast. You'll encounter bandits, zombie hordes, bike gangs, and other perils along the way. There's multiple skill levels, and every game is random, making sure that you never know what will happen on your dangerous journey!			"

												This is an interesting game. I feel as though it is a bit to easy however. I had no problem beating this on my first try in about an hour. Its very anoying to randomly have a character wonder off and die with no input from you. I would like a minigame to try and save them like you do with the bandit. Its also anoying that everything you do up until the end doesnt matter other than a point tally at the end. I would have liked to see the amount of supplies I had or medkits or ammo or anything make a difference. I dont think I will be playing much more but it was good enough to warrent buying it when it was on sale for 99 cents.			"

												I liked this game alot, The graphics are poor and alot of the gameplay is just mini-games strung together, but heyI found that the minigames constantly changed up the game and the rouge-like elements to it made me panic whenever I ran out of somthing. I felt by naming all the charactors people I knew I felt slightly more invested in saving them. Overall the gameplay is samey and repetitive after you see most of the mini-games it has to offer but, there are harder difficutly levels and that keeps it interesting. far better suited for a tablet but i could see myself playing this for hours on my down time.I liked it but you may not if you wanted 200 hours of gameplay like in fallout you are out of luck, its a good 2 hours of gameplay and after that its used up its bag of tricks, however the bag is pretty cool to look at for a bit.

												Good money well spent.  I had to change my review slightly after playing it more.  But...Organ Trail can still be a nice divergion.  I feel like the choices you make while on the road don't quite make a big deal in the long run.  The differences here between this and Oregon Trail is that Oregon trail gives you different paths to take with positives and negatives associated with them plus a mini game to complete the task.  Organ Trail has this too (if you buy the dlc) but the differences are very minute and you don't get to really experience doing the different path.  Your car just keeps milling about on the road without any input from you.  Most of the time I just skip all the messages that pop up because it's all RNG.  You have no input in whether you lose a bunch of ammo or food.  The game just does everything for you while yoiu auto drive.The different paths you take just means a faster route plus more hazards, like radiation sickness.  The towns are all the same. Some have trainers and others, upgrades for your car.  Thats really the only BIG difference in choosing a different path.  Scavenging gets old REAL fast.  If you buy the dlc, you can fight off humans as well as the undead.  All in all, it's a decent waste of time.  You just wont be coming back to it over and over.  It's more of a 1-2 hr time waster when you're really bored.			"

												So, I didn't really have fun with the game as much I thought I would. I love zombies and I love surving and managment, but the game just got dull after a while. It was the same formula over and over, get to a town, scavenge, take jobs, bob and weave to the right to get what the guy who hred you wanted, fix your car, rest trade, then leave. This happened again and again, witha few variations on the road such as getting attacked by radiers on bikes. But soon those got dull as they were repeated again and again, and I had figured out and beat them before with ease minus a few hickups. Only very interesting thing that happened was when the friends I put in game would mess with componets with a car, which I could completly see them doing, and y most clumsy friend in real life consitently kept on breaking bones, which I thought was pretty funny. Oh and a random event when one of my friends got captured by a bandit and I missed the shot to save her so she got her head blown off. That and the soundtrack and some of the art in game were the only fun moments, as everything else became a dull repeat. Maybe it was just not for me.			"

												This is a pretty cute, simple and inexpensive game. If you remember any Oregon Trail games and you enjoy shooting at tiny pixel-zombies, this is worth a try!Several of my characters have had dysentary but they didn't even die from it. Amazing!I only have one complaint about the game: shooting is really difficult to get used to.			"

												Well what to say about this quirky little title.Its fun, the music is genuinly creepy for the atmosphere it provides.If you can look past the ""iOS"" graphic scheme you will find a fun parody of Oregon Trail (old ""learning"" game) that will give you that casual game fix your looking for.The price is a bit steep though in my opinion (4 bucks)  this should be a 2.50 value selection as the gameplay while fun on an iPhone in the doctors office really loses alot of that value on your computer at home (where you can play stuff like CS:GO, ArmA, etc)Overall not too bad though6/10			"

												It's the Amiga II version of the Oregon Trail but with zombies. That's about it. They added a bunch of cheevos & social integration garbage but nothing else really noteworthy. Combat is frustrating, random events are repetitive (haha omg XD <insert friend's name> got bit by a zombie while he was peeing soo randum XD), and it's a straight line from beginning to end. Worth a playthrough or two but I don't see why this costs money.			"

												This game is awful.finding a car battery damages your party.finding food damages your party.stopping for any reason damages your party. (And you can't control when you stop.)The only actual gameplay is a handful of boring minigames which are very similar and the reward for completing them seems to have nothing to do with the ""Missions"" difficulty.  The rest of the game is either driving which rarely gives you a choice, and, I repeat, EVERY SINGLE EVENT, REGARDLESS OF OUTCOME, DAMAGES YOUR PARTY. this is the order of gameplay:1. drive2. damage party and car.3. car breaks down, takes tons of time, supplies, and PARTY HEALTH to fix it. (I'm not even kidding. The car broke down 5 times in one hour of gameplay.)4. reach town5. do a maximum of 2 missions.6. repeat.There are only 3 different weapons. And only 3 different enemies. And all party members are interchangable, (they have no unique skills.) except yourself, who can gain skills in towns, only you can only have 3, they have a very small effect, and you'll never be able to afford one. I requested a refund an hour after i got the game.			"

												If you're looking for a game where your energy is directed towards the task of making touchscreen controls work with a mouse with a splash of Apple II nostalgia thrown in, go for it. I paid $1.99 for this game and I want my money back.The shooting controls are meant for a tablet, and the developer seems to be more interested in making excuses for being too lazy to adapt the game to PC controls than actually doing work to fix it. Sure, I could waste time practicing such a stupid mechanic, but I don't consider it fun. Maybe the rest of the game is fun, but I don't feel like finding out. The game isn't witty enough or interesting enough to grab me and get me to fight past such a glaring flaw.The excuse used for not having keyboard controls for shooting is that with a keyboard you can only aim in 8 directions. If they honestly believe that, they are terrible programmers. Even if that were true, it would be a thousand times better than what exists currently.			"

I checked online and nobody seems to have a fix for this. I even tweeted the developers and they couldn't help. So, in review, this game is great when it works, which is never anymore.

Emotions don't come from having pretty graphics.It comes from choosing between your best friend's life, and those of five innocent strangers. It comes from watching your sister be executed by a maniac when you miss the shot that would save her. It comes from watching your boyfriend get infected, and wondering if you can keep him healthy and alive during the trip.And all that was just my first play through...			"

												Organ Trail is a beutiful game which allows you to take care of your own fellow survivers. The game mainly takes place in a station wagon in a zombie epidemic. You have yourself and a few other party members to take care of as random events take place in the game. There are also checkpoints at every so distance where your party can relax and look at the local market to see what they have for sale, fix and heal a few things/people or you can look and trade items with others. But if you don't feel like relaxing there are quests you can do for extra items. The game can be buetiful in a 8-bit way, but the game isn't very grabbing. It is a type of game where you would play every so often, just because you want to, theres no real story or campaign.The game is stunning overall, but isnt very grabbing for your attention.                                                                               5.8/10			"

												This game is simply brilliant, a different experience each time you play it. Things happen that didn't happen the last game you played, and this game has to have the best soundtrack i've heard since Assassin's Creed Three. Organ trail doesn't have 3D graphics, and doesn't need them. The game is perfect the way it is, it's a ten dollar masterpiece, and I HIGHLY reccomend getting this title.

												A very interesting take on the old ""Oregon Trail"" game.  A zombie survival game using the same template.  You need ammo, food, fuel, medical bags, etc....  You also need to maintain your vehicle.  You start at one end of the United States and have to make your way to the West coast.  Within each town you can find jobs or people to barter with.  There is still money, so you can just buy what you need, but it is expensive.  There is a bonus game after you finish the story.  A pretty interesting little game.			"

												Don't get me wrong, I quite like this game. However, it is brought down by a few game breaking glitches, such as not responding to the mouse or keyboard in menus, and blue shapes appering randomly. The worst one (spoiler) is when I was fighting the octopus, the screen all of a sudden went black and said ""You made it to Safe Haven. Click anywhere to Continue"" I click millions of times and mashed every key on my keyboard yet nothing happened. Then, I paused and unpaused, and the octopus reappeared in the middle of the screen and so did  my character. I fought it for about 20 minutes, but it wouldn't die, and the car had no health bar. I just sat there shooting its tentacles till I gave up and let it kill me. It gave me instructions for a stage, then showed a close up version of my character, but I could do nothing but pause and unpause. I now see the instructions and close up every time I load that save file. The game is still enjoyable, and these glitches don't occur very frequently, but I am incerdibly disapointed that these glitches have not been taken care of.			"

												What do you get when you combine flesh-eating monstrosities with a journey to the West? Organ Trail is a clever mash of the classic Oregon Trail with a modern take on the currently popular zombie craze. You and a group of friends must venture across the country, trying to survive the hordes of undead- from former friendly neighbors, to the local wildlife! The gameplay is relatively simple, and easy to get the hang of. You must travel between different safezones on the way to the west coast, occasionally dealing with random events such as zombie hoardes, bikers with a bone to pick, and the appreciated event of your companions not keeping their clumsy hands off your medkits. At each safezone (cities and the like), you can barter and do small missions for other survivors, such as finding their belongings in a small field, taking on bandits and the like, for small rewards.The only difficult part of the game is the aiming feature. It takes a little getting used to, but before long, you'll be blasting the dead...dead again, and blowing your friend's brains out when it's their time to go with your eyes closed. Overall, the game is a very relaxing, retro fun filled ride that's easy for any to get into. If you like zombies, traveling, the occasional case of dysentery, and cappin' a round in your friend's faces, what more can you ask for?			"

												This game is great, saw it on one of my friend's lists and bought it just because of the ingenious pun name and the hilarious preview.  I, like most people my age (I assume), played 'Oregon Trail' during recess in elementary school a bunch.  It's got the same basis, it's funny as Hell, and it's surprsingly exciting to play.Improvements?  It'd be awesome if this was multiplayer.  Also certain things don't make sense when you're the last one alive in your party...for example, if you try to blast through a zombie horde on the way out of town it still shows two other people firing their shotguns from your station wagon.  And if you're out of ammo...you shouldn't be able to select this option at all, yet you still can.Note to the creators: the HIGHLANDER achievement should be worded as it was in the show and the movies--""There can be only one,"" not as you have it on Steam, ""There can only be one.""  And in the explanation of how to get that achievement, Safe Haven is incorrectly mentioned as Safe Heaven...			"

												What is my opinion on Organ Trail: Director's Cut? Well for starters this game is a major parody of Oregon Trail, as well as other zombie movies and games. But this parody acually is very fun, and it also has you thinking about how much resources you are using, making difficult choices, always putting you in situations that you never wish you could be in. The journey is quite long, mainly because you are traveling cross-country in nothig but a station wagon, which can also mean that you have a ton of stops along the way. Stopping your travels and seeing a random event that that occurs can go 50/50 : You could either find a large amount of fuel for the station wagon, or you could come across a bandit who will shoot your friend while holding them hostege. Having the largest role in this apocolypse as the group leader, it's YOUR job to manage all of the supplies, as well as scavenge, drive, make choices, and fixing the station wa- really you are the one who does all of the work. Can you make it to Oregon? Can you keep your fellow survivors alive? What will you do if you run out of gas? Who has time to bury the dead in a zombie outbreak? Well I can't answer all of the questions that you may ask, that's up to you to decide. So: should you buy this game? My answer is yes.			"

												8/10Sold one of my group members to cannibals for 50 fuel cans.I always wanted to play the original oregon trail, but never had a chance to, I picked this up during the summer sale and was really pleasantly surprised! Exceeded my expectations. Poor graphics (unless retro pixelated graphics are your thing) but they defintely fit this game. Lots of good humor, and scavenging is pretty fun, which is good cause you'll want to do it a lot. arcade style 'combat' with a unique aiming method so you dont just click on the zombies/bandits to kill them, pretty good  once you get used to it. gets a bit repetitive after a while, but the amount of random events is quite large, in one playthrough the only thing that happened more than once was a character sitting on food or ammunition, 'ruining' it. I played on normal, and it was pretty easy (although fun), but I would imagine it could be quite a challenge on higher difficulty.Great idea, well made, fairly replayable, I'd reccommend it as a great timekiller if you can get it at a reasonable price (not sure what it normally sells for)			"

												I... really can't recommend this game, even for the low, low price for which I got it. I can be told that I'm ""missing the point,"" but frankly... I really recommend just playing Oregon Trail. It's a similar experience, but slightly more enjoyable.The problem is that most of the time, this just felt unfair to me, in ways that a game should not be. Allow me to elaborate: I was playing on EASY, because I KNEW this game would be hard. And NONE of the minigames felt like a DECENT challenge. They were either so easy as to be pointless, or difficult to the point of frustration (like the shootouts with bandits who never miss and barely ever pop out of cover... Time Crisis felt more fair to me, and that's a game that's designed to EAT QUARTERS.) Every now and then, an interesting event would happen, but more often something would just be taken from me for no reason, and I had to accept it. No strategy, no rhyme or reason. I literally once picked up 3 cans of fuel as a raandom event and IMMEDIATELY had 4 stolen from me by bandits.And these bandits are the scourge of the gods. They are always teeming, always a threat, no matter how many you strike down, and are seemingly unaffected by zombies and hold no valuables, even bullets, that do not disintegrate once slain. They can steal fuel from the tank of a moving vehicle. They can kidnap a party member (again, from a moving vehicle) and hold him at gunpoint to force a single shot rescue with no grace on the aim; you LITERALLY have to be PERFECT.The game just makes it feel like you have no control over... anything. And not in the realistic way. Shops and jobs rarely offer what you need, ammo and fuel are insanely overpriced, your party members are mentally deficient enough to break spare parts for the car on a regular basis... and unless you have an $80 perk, you can only find food, scrap, and (I believe, rarely) ammo while scavenging. And I was only ever able to learn the perk that allowed me to find medkits.In short... I found this game just frutrating and disappointing. Maybe if you're a ridiculously huge zombie fanatic, it'll be more fun. Otherwise, I think Oregon Trail is just better-designed, and all the little ""jokes"" and references can be read for just as much effect. The game has potential, but it just feels like it doesn't offer enough. Nothing bad that happened to me (okay, save one gunshot wound that I quickly patched with my dozens of medkits) seemed like it happened as a result of my input... that much lack of control, where you can (seemingly easily) lose through no fault of your own, just doesn't appeal to me.

												This is a hilarious and impressive game.  As someone who spent many hours in his elementary school computer lab playing Oregon Trail, this inspired twist is just as fun and frustrating as the original.  No longer are you worried about illness, but now you are worried about an outbreak.  It is an inexpensive game worth every cent - and if you get it on sale, you will have tons of fun with this game.  I recommend naming the survivors in your team after your friends, and sharing with them the adventures your group has.   "

												This game is fantastic.I could play this game for hours on end, given the range of choices you have in-game. This game will leave you excited, frustrated, exhausted, relieved, sometimes all at once.A satisfying and immensely refreshing take on a genre, or 'phase' perhaps, that is really beginning to overstay it's welcome.Organ Trail combines text-based adventure games with non-linear gameplay, leaving you definitely wanting more, or wondering why it's taken this long for it to happen.9/10.

												If I were to compare this game to anything, it would be FTL.Although they are different games they both have that Roguelike feel, trying to get to the end.I played this a lot on my cellphone before getting the Steam version, and my chief complaints were two things; it was too easy and wishing there wasn't an end.Well they addressed both those issues in a patch.There is now a harder difficulty (suicide) which I'm happy about, since the first time I ever played I played on Hard and reached the finale.And there's Endless Mode; for those who just want to play forever, or for however long they can last.This is a very fun game, and it's decently priced. I recommend it to those who like these types of games.If you're curious about the game but unsure, I'd recommend checking out Jesse Cox' videos:

It should give you a pretty good idea of what the game's about.Keep in mind though that he's playing on an older version before Endless, or Suicide mode.Good game for what it is, and lots of fun.			"

												This is pure MS-DOS fun. Me being a fan of MS-DOS, I was really excited when I saw this game. I had to buy it instantly. Man, was I not disappointed. This game follows in the vain of ""Oregon Trail"". You are stuck in Washington D.C. during the apocalypse. You meet a local man and he helps you get to your friends. You have to kill him as he gets bit but then you get to name your friends and you are off to go across to the country. The whole point of the game is to get to the Safe Haven; which is on the West Coast. You must balance your food and oil usage; while also making sure you have enough food, medkits, and ammo to survive. But for this, you need money. You can earn money or supplies by doing missions and cities or other pit-stops. This game can be challenging. So challenging that I haven't been able to make it to the end yet. But, it is a great experience. You will have fun trying to balance your supplies and the certain events you can come across can be challenging. You can choose how to deal with these situations but make sure you choose correctly; there can be some bad consequences if you don't. If you are fan of MS-Dos games, Oregon Trail, zombies, or challenging games then this is a must buy.			"

												For those that never experienced old Apple 2 style games, most of this game's charm and humor will be lost on you.  But for those that sat in the computer lab, mindlessly clicking away, this game is a rare treat and a crystal ball looking back into your childhood.  Many take to adding in names of their friends, but for me, I always added Spiderman, Batman, etc.  And it's very telling when Bruce Wayne crumples up money and destroys it out of boredom.  Rich b***ard.  While some of the key controls, IE shooting are bass-akwards, it didn't stop me from enjoying other parts of the game.While there is a working form of this game online, it doesn't have half the features of this game.  Do yourself a favor.  Get the full version and support the devs.  They gotta eat too.Pros:+Nostalgic look back at the old Oregon Trail game you played in school+Interesting easter eggs located at nearly every checkpoint (From Final Fantasy, to Last of Us, to Shaun of the Dead, and more)+Randomized events give high replay+Interesting Achievements add another degree of difficulty (Can you make it without any money?  What about no trading? etc.)+Good soundtrack mixed with old-school sound effects+Endless mode makes it so you can unlock new starter modes!Cons:-God awful inverted gun controls with no settings to change to normal-Glitchy counter, making certain achievements a course in futility -Zombie 'Boss Fights' are more of an exercise in running away than fighting off the undead.-Clements isn't around longer.Read all this way?  You deserve a treat.  Don't bring your friends to a zom-pocolypse.  Bring Chuck Norris.  Seriously.  Bring him.			"

												If you've played Oregon Trail, then you know what you're getting with the original Organ Trail; a pure parody of Oregon Trail set in a zombie infested post-apocalypic wasteland. Its gameplay is similar, its ideas are similar, and it's a lot of fun, just like the original source material.Here's the thing though, Organ Trail: Director's Cut is everything the original Organ Trail is, and much much more. Rather than just a parody - and I agree fully with what the creators say they intended the game to be - it is a game that stands above and beyond its own source material as a game in its own right.It's fun, it's dark, it's darkly funny, and it's honestly quite creepy in several places. The soundtrack is incredible and Ben Crossbones' musical talent lends itself perfectly, creating a wonderous, lonesome, tense and tragic air to the whole game. Rolling into a settlement (or the remains of a city), buying supplies and fixing/upgrading your Station Wagon, or learning new combat skills, trading and scavenging and talking with strangers was great before, but with the soundtrack it turns it into both wonderous relief and soul-crushing despair as you realise these are the few survivors left, and you should take what levity you can on your perilous road to a CHANCE at salvation.Be warned however. Easy difficulty may not be as rewarding but it is fun. If you want the extra points bonuses, rack up the difficulty, but be prepared for ungodly amounts of pain, because the jump from Easy to Normal is IMMEDIATELY visible. You will suffer at the hands of the game for your greed, so be sure you're REALLY good at aiming for a start.Total recommendation, totally worth every penny in sale or not. Get it, play it, love it. Just uh... don't play it late at night before you go to bed. You may have interesting dreams. o_o;o_o;;;the horror.... /the Horrorrr..../			"

No matter the preperation you may have, events may bungle you, and then camps with supplies you don't need to be followed can always end a journey to disaster.So what we have is a game that is part wisdom and big part luck.  The upside is that you can name people whatever you wish, and it hit me deep when I had to put Morgan Freeman down after he was bit.			"

												""Organ Trail: Director's Cut"" is a neat little spin-off of the game ""Oregan Trail"", takes the latter's core design elements and incorporates them into a zombie apocalypse setting where your goal is now to reach Safe Haven on the eastern coast of the USA and stay alive during the trip. Although it suffers from a lack of variety of the occuring events and randomness in the different playthroughs and the somewhat clunky controls, it is at its best when generating a story in which you and your friends try to survive the incoming dangers of the apocalypse. For the cheap price of 5€ (or your regional equivalent) and the addition of an endless mode, it is clearly worth your time and money.			"

												Organ Trail is a remake/parody of the classic Oregon Trail educational game from the late 70’s.  The premise is simple…travel across the nation from point A to B, foraging for supplies to sustain your journey while surviving the zombie apocalypse.  The gameplay is very straight-forward.  Outside of being largely a resource management game, it is mostly point and click shooting with the occasional scenario where you are given a set of choices on how to proceed.  The graphics and sound are almost painfully retro, but it does stay very true to the original which is a plus in my book.  The Director’s Cut includes an endless mode with its own set of “achievements” in the form of skulls you can unlock by performing certain feats within the game.  Unlocking these skulls opens up new modes which greatly increases the replay value.I was surprised I ended up sinking as much time as I did into this game (admittedly, some parts of the game were pretty boring).  But if you were a fan of the original Oregon Trail, I think you might enjoy this title.  I would also like to add that yes, even in post-apocalyptic times, you can still die of dysentery.			"

												Organ Trail is a beutiful game which allows you to take care of your own fellow survivers. The game mainly takes place in a station wagon in a zombie epidemic. You have yourself and a few other party members to take care of as random events take place in the game. There are also checkpoints at every so distance where your party can relax and look at the local market to see what they have for sale, fix and heal a few things/people or you can look and trade items with others. But if you don't feel like relaxing there are quests you can do for extra items. The game can be buetiful in a 8-bit way, but the game isn't very grabbing. It is a type of game where you would play every so often, just because you want to, theres no real story or campaign.The game is stunning overall, but isnt very grabbing for your attention.                                                                               5.8/10			"

												This game is simply brilliant, a different experience each time you play it. Things happen that didn't happen the last game you played, and this game has to have the best soundtrack i've heard since Assassin's Creed Three. Organ trail doesn't have 3D graphics, and doesn't need them. The game is perfect the way it is, it's a ten dollar masterpiece, and I HIGHLY reccomend getting this title.

												This is a really neat little game that is full of some truly gorgeous pixel art. It is worth beating at least once if only for the end credit sequence (which is probably my favorite of any game I've ever seen). But after having beaten it once, I haven't especially felt like trying it again, despite there being a lot more content I know I didn't experience the first time around.			"

												There's good and bad with this one, but I'm pretty happy with it. It's a really good re-imagining of Oregon Trail 1 (for those of us old enough to have played the hell out of that game back in elementary school), and it's got some nice updates to make it fun for an adult audience as well. Since it's aimed at adults with nostalgia value, it's also fairly difficult (at least compared to Oregon Trail).That being said, there are some downpoints. 1.) it's still fairy buggy -- right now my save seems to be stuck somewhere in the desert because the game stopped for an event that never came, so my care is just sitting there. 2.) shooting is very finicky, but once you get the hang of it (it takes awhile), it's not so bad.All in all, I'd definitely recommend it, especially if it goes on sale. Plus, you get the added bonus of naming your party members after friends and then pointing and laughing when they die of choler --- I mean, zombism.			"

												What do you get when you combine flesh-eating monstrosities with a journey to the West? Organ Trail is a clever mash of the classic Oregon Trail with a modern take on the currently popular zombie craze. You and a group of friends must venture across the country, trying to survive the hordes of undead- from former friendly neighbors, to the local wildlife! The gameplay is relatively simple, and easy to get the hang of. You must travel between different safezones on the way to the west coast, occasionally dealing with random events such as zombie hoardes, bikers with a bone to pick, and the appreciated event of your companions not keeping their clumsy hands off your medkits. At each safezone (cities and the like), you can barter and do small missions for other survivors, such as finding their belongings in a small field, taking on bandits and the like, for small rewards.The only difficult part of the game is the aiming feature. It takes a little getting used to, but before long, you'll be blasting the dead...dead again, and blowing your friend's brains out when it's their time to go with your eyes closed. Overall, the game is a very relaxing, retro fun filled ride that's easy for any to get into. If you like zombies, traveling, the occasional case of dysentery, and cappin' a round in your friend's faces, what more can you ask for?			"

												Although there might not be a lot of replayability in the campaign, Organ Trail offers, well, an Oregon Trail style survival system with zombies mixed in.

Since I did grow up playing Oregon Trail I found this game quite enjoyable since  it is just a modern simplified version of the game. I would not say the game is difficult being that I acquired all of the achievements in one day however it was a good time waster and made me miss the original Oregon Trail games. If you are looking for a quick game that may give you some laughs than this is a good game to check out but honestly it is nothing special.			"

												If ya like zombie stuff it can be a fun version of Oregon Trail.The controls in combat are stupid though (in my opinion anyway); in the name of trying to be challenging they made it less fun. Gotta click and drag where the bullet path goes other then just clicking and firing. It's reletively confusing and really slow - bad for what should be exciting.That aside it's sorta fun for a little bit. As the game goes on prices rocket and scavaging gets less fruitful. So it helps to gather as much as you can early on and hold onto it. Even if you think you have more then enough!			"

												Normally I give pretty good reviews, but sadly I cannot force myself to give this game a good review.First off this game at first seemed to be pretty intresting, but it lacked customizablity and the storyline was short lived. With it being an indy game, my hopes were not that high, but the 8bit soundtrack and low graphics really killed it.The game was fun, but too random. My group would be driving, and randomly break an arm or get cut. I do not see how that is realalistic. If you want to play a fun and realistic zombie simulator, this is NOT the game for you. However, if you want to play a cheap and fast zombie simulator or a game like Oragon Trail, this game is for you.			"

												Remember when you would play Oregon Trail in school, but simply spend the entire period playing the hunting minigame? Imagine if they made a whole game out of that.On the surface, Organ Trail seems like an absolutely brilliant concept: Oregon Trail set as a zombie apocalypse simulator where you must manage supplies and health of your party as you travel west not in a covered wagon, but a station wagon.The visual style earns every bit of this game's charm. The blocky Commodore 64-era graphics and music are spot on, and the combat and scavenging minigames are enjoyable to play whenever they come up.But after sitting down and playing through it several times, I discovered the same problems I've had with the original Oregon Trail: It's just too easy! Even on the hardest difficulty, I got through without any of my party members dying.

			All party members alive. Apparently this is supposed to be hard? I don't have any commentary for the first 38 minutes because I was capturing footage and wanted some pure audio to use.		

Maybe I've been spoiled by stuff like Binding of Isaac, Spelunky, Risk of Rain, or Super Amazing Wagon Adventure, but this game is just too easy to provide a challenge if you take it seriously at all.If you play through the game strategically and carefully budget your supplies and ammo, the game simply stops being fun and just becomes tedious. It's as much fun as doing a school assignment, but without the added bonus of going to Disneyland if you get straight A's.			"

												I love it, it reminds me of Oregon Trail but much more fair, at least to my luck. My party included me, Bob Ross, RNGesus, Bruse Lee, and Kenshiro. All though the trip RNGesus was like the magnet for bad luck, Bob Ross admired the scenery albit with a bit of paranoia, and Bruce Lee and Kenshiro were constantly stoic through out the whole thing. Bob Ross got bit by a zombie when RNGesus was supposed to be watching him and Kenshiro came back with a zombie bite, presumably after attack any nearby hordes, while Bruce Lee stayed far away from zeds, and I stayed behind in the car like a true hero. RNGesus got bit by a zombie three-quarters of the way there and suddenly stopped acting like an idiot, presumably because before the bite, I shouted ""Can't wait for you to get infected so I can shoot you after another stupid costly mistake"". We then made it to Haven relatively safe and sound.Definitely recommend this game if you liked the Oregon Trail games and/or zombie survival games. Also if you like roguelikes and such, you would definitely get a kick out of this.			"

												I enjoyed it for the price ($4.99), spent about 3 hours on my first playthrough. I played on normal, and it seemed like the secret was just waiting for trading until low zombie activity, then scavanging (easily getting tons of food, scrap, and money) and trading said supplies for fuel and other car parts. I ended with 40+ fuel, over 1500 food, 20 medkits, and 6 of every car part. The gameplay started getting repetitive, so maybe the expansion will help, but it would have to be on sale for me to want to get it.			"

												If I were to compare this game to anything, it would be FTL.Although they are different games they both have that Roguelike feel, trying to get to the end.I played this a lot on my cellphone before getting the Steam version, and my chief complaints were two things; it was too easy and wishing there wasn't an end.Well they addressed both those issues in a patch.There is now a harder difficulty (suicide) which I'm happy about, since the first time I ever played I played on Hard and reached the finale.And there's Endless Mode; for those who just want to play forever, or for however long they can last.This is a very fun game, and it's decently priced. I recommend it to those who like these types of games.If you're curious about the game but unsure, I'd recommend checking out Jesse Cox' videos:

How I play the game:1: Meet person I like.2: Game forces me to kill said person.3: Go on long trip through zombie filled America.4: Break arm in car.5: Reach safe haven.6: Complete L4D2 style finale.7: Fight giant zombie squid thing.8: Reach end screen.9: Ragequit because game won't let me go past the ""You entered safe haven"" screen.All in all: 9/10And now for the actuall review...Organ trail is a retro-style, post-apocalypipti... ♥♥♥♥ how do I spell this, game where you have to manage resources and occasionally shoot stuff.The game follows you and four people ""you can rely on"" as they head from Washington D.C. to the safe haven on the west-coast, the trip is longer than it sounds to avoid nuclear fallout zones.Many things can happen to your characters along this road, including breaking bones... IN A CAR!Sometimes you have to make difficult choises such as whether to put down a loved one who is about to turn*.There isn't too many bugs, but a major bug is the ""not being allowed past the end screen"" bug mentioned earlier, I had to fight that squid twice! Frickin' twice! It was quite easy actually.*Biten friends won't turn until they are incapped, after that, they're a walking death sentence unless you can use a first aid kit on them.Still, it's a really fun and intense game and good value for money, still a 9/10 though, bugs suck.

												Fun game but lots of really obnoxious bugs. Fix the issue where you beat the final boss and then get stuck on the 'enter safe haven' screen because you were still aiming when the last shot hit and I'll switch this to recommend.Achievements also don't fire properly and I believe the Halloween mode is glitched. Seriously, fix these bugs, they're months and months old. Other than that really fun game.			"

												If you've played Oregon Trail, then you know what you're getting with the original Organ Trail; a pure parody of Oregon Trail set in a zombie infested post-apocalypic wasteland. Its gameplay is similar, its ideas are similar, and it's a lot of fun, just like the original source material.Here's the thing though, Organ Trail: Director's Cut is everything the original Organ Trail is, and much much more. Rather than just a parody - and I agree fully with what the creators say they intended the game to be - it is a game that stands above and beyond its own source material as a game in its own right.It's fun, it's dark, it's darkly funny, and it's honestly quite creepy in several places. The soundtrack is incredible and Ben Crossbones' musical talent lends itself perfectly, creating a wonderous, lonesome, tense and tragic air to the whole game. Rolling into a settlement (or the remains of a city), buying supplies and fixing/upgrading your Station Wagon, or learning new combat skills, trading and scavenging and talking with strangers was great before, but with the soundtrack it turns it into both wonderous relief and soul-crushing despair as you realise these are the few survivors left, and you should take what levity you can on your perilous road to a CHANCE at salvation.Be warned however. Easy difficulty may not be as rewarding but it is fun. If you want the extra points bonuses, rack up the difficulty, but be prepared for ungodly amounts of pain, because the jump from Easy to Normal is IMMEDIATELY visible. You will suffer at the hands of the game for your greed, so be sure you're REALLY good at aiming for a start.Total recommendation, totally worth every penny in sale or not. Get it, play it, love it. Just uh... don't play it late at night before you go to bed. You may have interesting dreams. o_o;o_o;;;the horror.... /the Horrorrr..../			"

												Despite very dated graphics there is something charming about this game. The story, accidents on the way, pretty much all the things you could possibly encounter during your postapocalyptic east to west trip. There is a micromanaging part which I especially like about this game. It's about being smart when it comes to planning, to avoid being stranded or pushed against the wall. You can also name your companions after your friends or family and go for hardest level to enhance the mood. Will you sacrifice your beloved one if he's turning into a zombie? Will you swap your buddy for 10 gallons of gas and cart of food? And there's this special kind of ""8-bit atmosphere"" when it's middle of the night and you sit in glow of your monitor ekhm.. TV with the sound of crickets and digital bleeps :)			"

												For those of us who played Oregon Trail on an old IBM growing up, this game is perfect.  We grew up, and these guys helped the Oregon Trail ""Style"" of game to grow with us.  You could easily call this a OT Clone, but it's a bit more than that.  The gameplay/graphics are sentimental, but the content is rich and brings us an 8bit horror survival game.  It brings us a new story, and a new sense of urgency that it's forefather didn't.  Best of all, we get to trade in our covered wagon for a station wagon.  I would say that this is a great casual game, but I've not been able to play it casual.  Each time I load up, I have to play it start to finish. I might only have a few hours on (not sure how many), but this is definitely a great one when you just don't know what you want to play.  The only negative thing I could say negatively about this game is the irritating click, pull, aim method of shooting.  Of course, you could say this is the one thing that truly adds difficulty to the game.			"

												8/10Sold one of my group members to cannibals for 50 fuel cans.I always wanted to play the original oregon trail, but never had a chance to, I picked this up during the summer sale and was really pleasantly surprised! Exceeded my expectations. Poor graphics (unless retro pixelated graphics are your thing) but they defintely fit this game. Lots of good humor, and scavenging is pretty fun, which is good cause you'll want to do it a lot. arcade style 'combat' with a unique aiming method so you dont just click on the zombies/bandits to kill them, pretty good  once you get used to it. gets a bit repetitive after a while, but the amount of random events is quite large, in one playthrough the only thing that happened more than once was a character sitting on food or ammunition, 'ruining' it. I played on normal, and it was pretty easy (although fun), but I would imagine it could be quite a challenge on higher difficulty.Great idea, well made, fairly replayable, I'd reccommend it as a great timekiller if you can get it at a reasonable price (not sure what it normally sells for)			"

I have to take care of your friends and bla bla bla, but is boring, they don't do anything apart from dropping food, messing around with supplies and ruining them, you spend most of time waiting ( to get to place to place, to fix your car, to rest)Maybe this game would've been funny if i had ever played oregon trail. But no....justo no.At least is cheap, but i don't recommend, by a long shot.			"

												When I first saw the title, I immediately thought it was Oregon Trail only to find out it was a twisted variation of that original title. I have to say playing Organ Trail brings back a lot of fun memories of playing the original Oregon Trail on the Apple IIe some 30+ years ago. Organ Trail is a pretty cheesy rip off, but the developers did a great job in emulating an old school classic.They even threw in a few L4D references like a picture of the entrance to No Mercy hospital with Francis as a zombie, the L4D2 hand at grave sites, and an unforgettable finale providing L4D2 scavenge style gas can filling in 2D goodness. For what it is, Organ Trail is an enjoyable little adventure down memory lane.			"

The art style is a homage to very-hard old Atari 2600 games, the management part of the game is balanced well with the survival, shooting, scavenging, and job parts of the game. It's definitely more than just a reskin of Oregon Trail, and has a kick-butt plot to go with it. In memory of Dog, and Jefferey.			"

												The shooting breaks the game for me. I understand it's supposed to be hard but it's not even clear where you can go in levels (off the screen, that is), and you can't shoot zombies south of you when you are at the northern border of the map, because you can't drag your cursor off the screen. The difficulty, the occasional inability to shoot, and the notion that your character can't see farther than the 20ft box around him come together to really annoy the player and ruin the immersion.Also, I'm pretty sure I played this game elsewhere around when it came out. The memory of my first campaign is pretty vivid but it may have been watching a Let's Play, leaving me with only 0.4 hours into the game.			"

You're able to kill your travel companions, yep just pull the car over, pick on, aim and shoot.  Along the road you might see a shallow grave and the game will ask if you want to investigate, some times you find helpful items (bullets, canned food, car parts for the station wagon.)  some times a zombie will rise from the grave and once in awhile there will be a nice fat dead guy near the grave that you can harvest meat off of.

												(I have more playtime on an abandoned account.) I've taken a liking to Organ Trail's concept since I played the lesser version on Adobe Flash in my browser. I'm too young to have ever played Oregon Trail, which Organ Trail is based on. Others can tell you the pros and cons, because when I try to think of pros and cons, I can only think of personal experiences i've had playing the game.  Like the time Michelangelo from TMNT was bit by a zombie and I didn't execute him for experimental reasons. (Mainly because I wanted to see the effects of a zombie bite on a mutated turtle.) While I was resting healing up my party, he turned and bit the RED Spy from TF2 and infected him. After putting Michelangelo down, I heard the RED Spy in my head.""I don't wish to die and turn into one of those. Kill me.""Truly, it was a hard moment in that playthrough. I think that is what's so fun about Organ Trail: the personal experiences and stories that derive from the gameplay. Very, very few games can say that many stories and reviews about the game derive from the gameplay.To put it in a short way: It's an old school, road trip zombie game that can't be missed, even for just one playthrough.And I guarentee that most players will have many more playthroughs than just one.10/10 Would experiment with a zombie bite on a turtle again.

												Organ Trail is a knock off of the game ""The Organ Trail"" and honestly i like this one better. This game can actaully be quite funny. Having references from other video games like L4D2 and even Castlevania. This game is stylized as a retro RPG that would have looked like a game in the late 80's or early 90's. Lets start out with the game. There are two modes in this game.Campaign mode and endless mode. Im just going to ecplain the campaign. (since endless mode is self explanitory). You start off by meeting a priest name Clements (after shooting some zombies) then you go find your friends in Washington D.C. you get to name your friends as well as yourself (which is nice). Once you get to D.C. you have 15 or so hours to collect supplies because On the radio you overhear that there will be a nuclear strike. Clements finds your friends but then you have to put out Clements since he got bit by a zombie. So basically you are trying to get to your end destination and survive. On the way you can buy supplies, scacenge for supplies, and there will be mini games as well like avoidimg zombies while your in your car, killing bike gang members in your car and etc. there are also jobs you can do to get money and other misc. items. This game is very fun and i HIGHLY reccomend it. The only reason i wouldnt reccomend buying it is if your one of those people who talk crap about games that dont have great next-gen graphics. For me i love it, especially for its price ($4.99) Final Verdict:10/10 Go buy this game!!			"

												This is going to be a fairly tentative recommendation because this game actually succeeds a little too well in what it sets out to do, and it's somewhat detrimental to the whole experience. So it's the Oregon Trail but with Zombies, and it pulls that off expertly. A perfect parody/reimagining of the old edutainment classic that was on every school computer throughout the 1980's and 90's, and probably the most fun you were allowed to have in your school's computer lab before the internet became commonplace. You make a run from Washington, D.C. to a safe zone in Oregon protecting your band of survivors in the the post-Zombie-Apocolypse. You'll manage supplies for your survivors and your car, and play a bunch of minigames that allow for direct control over these scenarios, while having a metagame about time management and basic economics in order to excel at the scenario. The graphics are purposly lo-fi and retro, emulating the Apple II edition of Oregon Trail, and the music is actually pretty decent. It's not particularly difficult even on the harder settings, and any one run can be completed in an hour or two if you're quick about it and don't waste your resources. And therein lies the problem. Like with the original Oregon Trail, once you've done it once you've seen 90% of what the game has to offer, really. There are some extras, and there is an endless mode and unlocks in this now full version with all the DLC that add enough variation to the game to be a much fuller experience, but ultimately it's still the same Oregon Trail + Zombies game and it gets very repetitive very quickly (which is why the complete edition/DLC is so necessary - without the additional content the game gets overly repetitive within your first run-through). The advantage that the original PC hit had was an often captive audience: students who were bored in the library or computer lab had little else that might occupy their time, and so would load up another run to Oregon. But on your own time with thousands of other potential games on Steam to play, it's much harder to justify playing it again or repeatedly. I've gone through it twice now, and while I enjoyed my time with it, I'm doubting that I'll play it again for a year or so until I can remember that ""oh, yeah, another run might be a good time waster for an evening!""I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a short game with low replayability, who loves The Walking Dead way too much, or kids who never had to play the original so they can play a version that's actually a bit more fun than it ever was. Past that it's a tough sell, though at least it's cheap.			"

												This game doesn't just claim to be Oregon Trail. It literally channels the ghost of that game so perfectly, you might forget that you aren't actually playing it.It's not just a cheesy ripoff either. It is faithful to the source material but it still maintains it's own unique aspects and introduces new ""minigames"". You still have to manage resources and scarcity. There is plenty of scavenging and trading. You're still at the helm of a wagon, but instead of fording rivers you have to ford throngs of zombies. Instead of snake bites there are zombie bites. You still can't carry back all the food.Oh, and there's lots of dysentery.			"

												Load up your station wagon and hit the road in an incredibly old-school, Oregon Trail inspired zombie apocalypse adventure. Organ Trail's simple goal, cross the U.S. and reach the Safe Haven, is kept lively and fresh by various events, mini-games, and choices along the way. You'll make tough decisions, manage your resources, and fend off zombies and bandits alike along the road. In towns you'll trade, take on jobs for resources or cash, and have the opportunity to train yourself in various expertise to help along the way, all while maintaining and upgrading your vehicle. The game has great replayability and, on top of that, it's easy on the wallet!10/10 Would put down a friend for breaking one too many mufflers again			"

												This is going to be a fairly tentative recommendation because this game actually succeeds a little too well in what it sets out to do, and it's somewhat detrimental to the whole experience. So it's the Oregon Trail but with Zombies, and it pulls that off expertly. A perfect parody/reimagining of the old edutainment classic that was on every school computer throughout the 1980's and 90's, and probably the most fun you were allowed to have in your school's computer lab before the internet became commonplace. You make a run from Washington, D.C. to a safe zone in Oregon protecting your band of survivors in the the post-Zombie-Apocolypse. You'll manage supplies for your survivors and your car, and play a bunch of minigames that allow for direct control over these scenarios, while having a metagame about time management and basic economics in order to excel at the scenario. The graphics are purposly lo-fi and retro, emulating the Apple II edition of Oregon Trail, and the music is actually pretty decent. It's not particularly difficult even on the harder settings, and any one run can be completed in an hour or two if you're quick about it and don't waste your resources. And therein lies the problem. Like with the original Oregon Trail, once you've done it once you've seen 90% of what the game has to offer, really. There are some extras, and there is an endless mode and unlocks in this now full version with all the DLC that add enough variation to the game to be a much fuller experience, but ultimately it's still the same Oregon Trail + Zombies game and it gets very repetitive very quickly (which is why the complete edition/DLC is so necessary - without the additional content the game gets overly repetitive within your first run-through). The advantage that the original PC hit had was an often captive audience: students who were bored in the library or computer lab had little else that might occupy their time, and so would load up another run to Oregon. But on your own time with thousands of other potential games on Steam to play, it's much harder to justify playing it again or repeatedly. I've gone through it twice now, and while I enjoyed my time with it, I'm doubting that I'll play it again for a year or so until I can remember that ""oh, yeah, another run might be a good time waster for an evening!""I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a short game with low replayability, who loves The Walking Dead way too much, or kids who never had to play the original so they can play a version that's actually a bit more fun than it ever was.

												Though it's really short, this is a solid little adventure through a zombie infested america with a lot of potential replayability. The game only took me about 2 hours to go through but this really seems like the kind of journey you go through multiple times, with 4 difficulty settings and an endless mode this should be able to take a decent chunk of your time. It's not super amazing, but this game is worth a look if you like Oregon Trail and Zombie Games, you will like this.			"

												The game is fun and is a great nostalgic trip to the old Oregon Trail days of my youth. Plus, who doesn't shooting zombies? Bearing in mind that this game was made by two guys, it lacks polish. Somethings like the run to pick up lost items jobs are really easy. The ""boss fights"" where zombie deer chase your car is laughably easy while the zombie bear attack is terrifiying. The biker chase is also yawn. There are bugs galore with the achievements that were never quite fixed right and some of the ""unlockable"" content is actually not unlockable (Halloween mode). The music kicks♥♥♥♥♥though and the pixel art is a great throw back. Worth a few bucks for like 10 hours of fun.			"

												Amazingly fun, as addictive as the original ""Oregon Trail"".The graphics are basic but they are all that is needed. I was engrosed in 8bit story-telling and i love the messages that come up. ""Tanner went out for a♥♥♥♥♥♥and never returned"" or ""Abram was dicking around with the battery and ruined it"". Great time, enjoyed the game thoroughly.My only complaint was that money was EXTREMELY hard to come by when playing on normal version. This ultimately meant that I died because we ran out of fuel, even though I knew it was coming there wasnt much I could do to stop it. I scavanged 10 times in a row, traded every chance i got, and couldn't find fuel anywhere. I had a multitude of food, scrap, and ammo, but was always dying for fuel and money. I would love to try the combat training but at $80 I don't think I ever had that much money to my name the whole game, let alone have $80 to spare!Overall fun game, I put my friends' names in the spots and took pictures of the messages as I played and sent the messages to them over text. They got a kick out of it and consequently have all purchased the game. Good game, minor balance tweaks and it would be PERFECT!			"

												This brought back old, loathing feelings of playing the Oregon Trail in school. But this one is better, because it comes with zombies!  Much like the game this one takes its roots from, it is actually really hard to make it across the map with your whole party alive and well. I thought I was doing well; I was 2/3 the way across the map, and then bam-- one dead from thirst, another knocked out from fighting through the horde of angry bikers, and to top it off we were out of money!My favorite part was taking up random jobs for supplies or money. Even though the graphics aren't state of the art, I still felt engrossed in the missions. I also felt very much in danger. The zombies tend to pile up fast!If for no other reason, get this game for the satisfaction of taking out one of your own when they are infected with the zombie virus!			"

												This game is hella fun. It has all the classic Oregon Trail gameplay you'd expect, but this time its a zombie apocalypse with a station wagon instead of a gold rush with a covered wagon. The classic Apple II graphics and sound effects harken back to a simpler time, but also has some modern game mechanics and music to spice it up. And the game has a lot of humor as well. BUY THIS!

												Organ Trail is like the Oregon Trail. Not much to be said, really. Most people with gaming experience would know what this is like.Pros:Bringing back an old game for a newer market, with a unique twist and added featuresControls AREN'T bad, considering that this was also developed for tablets in mind as well as the PC version.Forces you to make choices that determine whether or not you kill your allies.It's like The Walking Dead, but 8-bit and less story driven.Cons:I understand the need to have a unique shooting style, but seriously? Clicking on the enemy and dragging to your character is a pain when scavenging.I have learnt things from combat trainers about 3 times. Not because their skill are useless, because they apparantly have nothing they can teach me.If you want to start with less than 5 people, you have to waste ammo (NOT A REAL CON).Overall, this is a great revival of a great classic. If it's on sale, grab this game. Hell, just grab the game anyway.~You've got red on you.			"

												If you get the references to the original Oregon Trail, Left 4 Dead, and any number of zombies movies or games, great. If not, then you have an entertaining (and you'd swear antagonising) resource management game in the graphic style of a brick painted by an 6 year old... if that kid had to use an 8-bit console to paint. Anyway, gameplay is great, the recent work on balancing the game was (subjective) much needed, and there's enough variety to keep you playing for a bunch of hours. Your best friend already has dysentery and your hanger-on will wander off to pee and come back hungry for brains.There are worse ways to spend $6CAD.			"

												Organ Trail is a knock off of the game ""The Organ Trail"" and honestly i like this one better. This game can actaully be quite funny. Having references from other video games like L4D2 and even Castlevania. This game is stylized as a retro RPG that would have looked like a game in the late 80's or early 90's. Lets start out with the game. There are two modes in this game.Campaign mode and endless mode. Im just going to ecplain the campaign. (since endless mode is self explanitory). You start off by meeting a priest name Clements (after shooting some zombies) then you go find your friends in Washington D.C. you get to name your friends as well as yourself (which is nice). Once you get to D.C. you have 15 or so hours to collect supplies because On the radio you overhear that there will be a nuclear strike. Clements finds your friends but then you have to put out Clements since he got bit by a zombie. So basically you are trying to get to your end destination and survive. On the way you can buy supplies, scacenge for supplies, and there will be mini games as well like avoidimg zombies while your in your car, killing bike gang members in your car and etc. there are also jobs you can do to get money and other misc. items. This game is very fun and i HIGHLY reccomend it. The only reason i wouldnt reccomend buying it is if your one of those people who talk crap about games that dont have great next-gen graphics. For me i love it, especially for its price ($4.99) Final Verdict:10/10 Go buy this game!!			"

												This game is incredible. Its simple graphics, and strong base of the Oregon trail makes it instantly familiar; it's scarily addictive, and thoroughly intelligent. I didn't know if it was purposeful, but towards the end I did notice my final two companions personalities coming through; with one having a bad habit of depressing everyone else with tales of what once was, and the other being a constant f**k up by sitting on food, playing with scrap, getting caught by bandits, and generally ruining our chances, but she was healthy enough that I couldn't justify putting her down. Also I know some people don't like the shooting mechanics, but when you're used to it, it feels way more natural than I anticipated.Seriously this game is fantastic, get it.			"

												The shooting breaks the game for me. I understand it's supposed to be hard but it's not even clear where you can go in levels (off the screen, that is), and you can't shoot zombies south of you when you are at the northern border of the map, because you can't drag your cursor off the screen. The difficulty, the occasional inability to shoot, and the notion that your character can't see farther than the 20ft box around him come together to really annoy the player and ruin the immersion.Also, I'm pretty sure I played this game elsewhere around when it came out. The memory of my first campaign is pretty vivid but it may have been watching a Let's Play, leaving me with only 0.4 hours into the game.			"

												my favorite zombie-survival to date! it's mostly text-based, but really intense, especially if you name your companions after your real life friends (insert joke about not having friends here). I was about to complain that any member of your party can get bitten at any moment without you being able to do anything to prevent it, but actually that's what would happen in a real situation, so props for that. also the plot and characters feature a good amount of references and (black-)humour, and the 8-bit graphics and soundtrack are beautiful as well. definitely a game well-worth playing if you like the genre.

Organ trail is a brilliant game for the short time that you play it around (2-3 hours) depending on how fast you travel.

												I... really can't recommend this game, even for the low, low price for which I got it. I can be told that I'm ""missing the point,"" but frankly... I really recommend just playing Oregon Trail. It's a similar experience, but slightly more enjoyable.The problem is that most of the time, this just felt unfair to me, in ways that a game should not be. Allow me to elaborate: I was playing on EASY, because I KNEW this game would be hard. And NONE of the minigames felt like a DECENT challenge. They were either so easy as to be pointless, or difficult to the point of frustration (like the shootouts with bandits who never miss and barely ever pop out of cover... Time Crisis felt more fair to me, and that's a game that's designed to EAT QUARTERS.) Every now and then, an interesting event would happen, but more often something would just be taken from me for no reason, and I had to accept it. No strategy, no rhyme or reason. I literally once picked up 3 cans of fuel as a raandom event and IMMEDIATELY had 4 stolen from me by bandits.And these bandits are the scourge of the gods. They are always teeming, always a threat, no matter how many you strike down, and are seemingly unaffected by zombies and hold no valuables, even bullets, that do not disintegrate once slain. They can steal fuel from the tank of a moving vehicle. They can kidnap a party member (again, from a moving vehicle) and hold him at gunpoint to force a single shot rescue with no grace on the aim; you LITERALLY have to be PERFECT.The game just makes it feel like you have no control over... anything. And not in the realistic way. Shops and jobs rarely offer what you need, ammo and fuel are insanely overpriced, your party members are mentally deficient enough to break spare parts for the car on a regular basis... and unless you have an $80 perk, you can only find food, scrap, and (I believe, rarely) ammo while scavenging. And I was only ever able to learn the perk that allowed me to find medkits.In short... I found this game just frutrating and disappointing. Maybe if you're a ridiculously huge zombie fanatic, it'll be more fun. Otherwise, I think Oregon Trail is just better-designed, and all the little ""jokes"" and references can be read for just as much effect. The game has potential, but it just feels like it doesn't offer enough. Nothing bad that happened to me (okay, save one gunshot wound that I quickly patched with my dozens of medkits) seemed like it happened as a result of my input... that much lack of control, where you can (seemingly easily) lose through no fault of your own, just doesn't appeal to me.

												This is a hilarious and impressive game.  As someone who spent many hours in his elementary school computer lab playing Oregon Trail, this inspired twist is just as fun and frustrating as the original.  No longer are you worried about illness, but now you are worried about an outbreak.  It is an inexpensive game worth every cent - and if you get it on sale, you will have tons of fun with this game.  I recommend naming the survivors in your team after your friends, and sharing with them the adventures your group has.   "

												As a child of the 80's I played a ton of OREGON trail during 'computer class' in Elementary & Middle school.That game was great for its time. But I wouldnt be to terribly excited to sit down and have to play it again (likely on a Commodore, for that authentic 1991 feel!).However, ORGAN Trail takes everything that made it's spiritual precursor great and leaves all that learning bologne behind.At its core, the game is a resource management Sim, but it's really so much more than that.It's an escape from the reality of the real world for a few moments.Are you a teacher who busts her/his butt at work all day? Name your party after your snot-nosed students and laugh heartily when they get torn to shreds.Are you a seasoned mechanic who enjoys gaming in your free time? Well now you can work on turning a pixelated station wagon into a Zombie Killing machine, complete with machine gun mounted steel reinforced windows.Are you a stocks and bonds broker who would like to see what happens when you corner the market on canned goods and bullets and leave everyone else to try and barter for your stash with weird green money from better times?WELL NOW YOU CAN!ORGAN Trail has all of this and more!I named my party after my family. Not only did they get dysentary, but they got shot by bandits, bikers attempts to steal car parts from them, and they were chewed up and spit back out by zombie bears in the woods!Seriously, this game is hilarious -- and the soundtrack is t1ts!

												The game is harsh. Very harsh. It is one of those games where you will play it for a good few hours only to realise you were wasting your time. It is similar to Crazy Taxi, no not because of the gameplay but because it is a game you will only play for a couple hours at a time but you will be determined to come back to it a lot and complete it on all of the difficulties. The game has good mechanics but the shooting just seems a bit overcomplicated which may have been done to prevent it from being too easy, but now the shooting could be considered a bit too frustrating...Overall I would reccomend the game because it is cheap, especially on sale, and it is worth the money, but don't expect an easy relaxing game, this is a very challenging and stressful game!+ Immersive+ Addictive+ Passes the time quickly- May get frustrating due to RNG- Some annoying mechanics "

												Have you ever played Oregon Trail and thought, ""Man. This sure could use more zombies."" Well, you're in luck! Presenting Organ Trail. A game that plays similar to the old classic but is still unique. Try to get you and your party to the supposed Safe Haven in the West without getting bitten, broken or dying to desentry. There are stops along the where you can trade, sell, buy and take jobs for things as well as stopping any ol' where to scavenge. Just be careful! Those zombies aren't too friends. Nor are the dear and biker gangs that sometimes chase after you. There are no oxen to worry about. Just a station wagon that has seen better days. It has a health bar so make sure you keep it in good condition otherwise things on it are more likely to break and cause you problems. When you find auto shops, try your best to get ahold of Upgrades. Those will work wonders on your car and help it and you make it across the land. Don't forget to rest up your party too! The lower their health, the more likely they are to break something or contract something, become incapacitated, and die. Sometimes they can be bitten by zombies and as long as you can keep their health up, they won't turn. I still kill them anyway though. I don't trust them. >_> All in all this game feels like the classic with a new twist. The graphics are old, the music is chiptune and the story is belovedly post apocalytic and fantastic. Play. This. Game! P.S. Anyone know what this game means when it says ""dicking""? As in ""Gertie is dicking around with 12 ammo and accidentally ruins it."" It sound sexual but I doubt it really is.			"

												TL;DR is at the bottom.First let me say that there IS a mobile version of this for slightly cheaper, If I knew this before I bought it I would have bought the mobile version simply because it suits mobile gaming better in my opinion.Recently I've found it pretty hard for games to hold my attention, this however, this was a pleasant exception.I've always enjoyed micromanagement in video games, so this looked interesting to me. This isn't really the same, and not just because it has Zombies. I doubt anyone is thinking this, but don't buy this JUST because you wanna play a game similar to the Oregon Trail. It's a fun experience that involves travelling across the country in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ car that falls apart all the time and causes you to break your legs for no reason. As you travel random events occur where you'll either need to make a descision or something happens which is out of your control. Things like losing health for a character or losing/gaining a certain resource. There are set towns that you go by and can stock up on supplies or upgrade your car or character. You can also do jobs, these usually consist of a minigame which can be different depending on the scenario. The minigames are quite fun in my opinion, but it's a little tough to get used to the shooting mechanics. The minigames also apear in other situations and some minigames even have suprises lying in them. I won't spoil the encounters but some are quite rare and may suprise you. This game is pretty cheap, but depending on your budget I'd wait for it to go on sale.TL;DR - If you like making descisions and playing some minigames, buy this. Maybe wait for it to be on sale.			"

												Hey it's Tanner from Steampunks, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfEBvwc4__gT8s65lnTwyhQJust finished my first run of ""Organ Trail"" and I couldn't be more satisfied. Like many Canadians I have fond memories of playing Trans Canada Highway (the Canadian Oregon Trail about truck drivers). This was a blast from the text based past, with enough humor and originality to keep anyone playing. A single run can last for hours and the game is built around replayability. There's always something to interact with, and it could mean life or death. I would recommend this to anyone who liked ""Oregon Trail"" or ""TCH"", and it's a no brainer purchase while on sale.			"

I highly recommend purchasing this becuase of the laughs you will have and the experiences you will tell your friends about. I'll give a short scenario during my gameplay experience.

												Oh man, this game is awesome.Together, with my trusty companions: Banana, Ann, sux, and <3, we went to travel from the east coast to the west coast, trying to get through hordes of zombies and the occasional jackass kids taking advantage of the situation. We didn't make it. <3 Died pretty early because she was bit by a zombie so I had to kill her before she became a threat to the rest of us. We also encountered like 4 towns with no ammo in a row. Bad luck, I guess.BUT, WHO CARES ABOUT THE LIVES OF THOSE FOOLS ANYWAY? The game is great. I'm sure you're familiar with Oregon Trail, a timeless classic of a family escaping to the west. Well this game is that game, but much more hilarious, with obvious nods to the original. I mean, there's a boss battle with a zombie bear for starters. You also need to fix your Station Wagon from time to time. And ♥♥♥♥ing tires are always getting stolen or broken. God. I lost like 8 tires in less than half the total route. The game is terrifically fun, though. Despite it not being super action packed, the game offers a lot of decisions. And it's decisions that make someone a good gamer at the end of the day, right? I mean, do you want to rest up your team or try to get along to the next town at 30% health? What if you get intercepted by a biker gang for the 30th time? That could be unfortunate. Oh, or what if there's a horde of zombies that you can't avoid because your tire broke again? You just never know what kind of sillyness can happen, so you have to be prepared. But don't be too prepared, because there's tons of bandits who like to steal mufflers which you stocked up on because it seems like something to stock up on... but you never did need to replace any. Oh yeah, and you should totally buy food, maybe you should sell those mufflers you got from that last town for helping a family survive a shoot out or whatever was going on, you didn't read the job description, you just wanted to get paid. Oh. You can't sell those? Oh. Oh. Oh...At least you get to kill zombies and survive until your wagon reaches the west coast somewhere.			"

												If you remember playing this classic game of migration, survival, and the dangers of the undead apocalypse when you were a kid (probably, if you're like me, on your school's Apple IIe or the like), you'll be glad to know this faithful recreation brings to life every single detail of this epic childhood favorite.  From foraging for food while shooting zombie bears, to trading on the open road, to putting down your best friend because he stole your food or tried to rip your face off, every second will bring feelings of nostalgia, as well as the pleasant feeling of having survived nightmares that would drive most men mad.  Will you make it to the promised land of Safe Haven, or are you just another tombstone waiting to happen?Don't forget to bring bullets, partner.  The Organ Trail awaits.In terms of playability, the game is very fun, requiring a very smooth learning curve (and it'll even give you a tutorial at the beginning), and providing a lot of easy selections.In terms of graphics, this is a recreation of an Apple II/iIe/similar game (that really existed, seriously, just ask my cousin here who has some real estate in Florida to sell you), so the graphics are going to look like that Apple IIe feeling.  That means 16 colors, strong contrasts, black almost everywhere, and great blocky pixel graphics.The sound even comes off feeling the same, beeps and bloops faithfully rebuilt using the highest of technology.If you want to recreate that seriously old-school feeling, and want to relive the great trials of these pioneers as they made their way from the eastern shorelines to the west coast, while avoiding the Nuclear Fallout zones and the hordes of ravenous undead, then I would not hesitate to play this game.

												It doesn't matter if you remember the original this game was inspired by, or have just come for the zombies, this game is great fun and has lots of replay value in it. Name your group after your friends (or whoever) and then try to keep them alive as you cross the country in a beaten up old station wagon.Simple, yet difficult at times, gameplay that keeps me playing until I've completed the game. Lots of variety to the mini-games presented so that not every event is the same.If you're still not convinced, here's a video I made covering the gameplay. Youtube link "

												There's good and bad with this one, but I'm pretty happy with it. It's a really good re-imagining of Oregon Trail 1 (for those of us old enough to have played the hell out of that game back in elementary school), and it's got some nice updates to make it fun for an adult audience as well. Since it's aimed at adults with nostalgia value, it's also fairly difficult (at least compared to Oregon Trail).That being said, there are some downpoints. 1.) it's still fairy buggy -- right now my save seems to be stuck somewhere in the desert because the game stopped for an event that never came, so my care is just sitting there. 2.) shooting is very finicky, but once you get the hang of it (it takes awhile), it's not so bad.All in all, I'd definitely recommend it, especially if it goes on sale. Plus, you get the added bonus of naming your party members after friends and then pointing and laughing when they die of choler --- I mean, zombism.			"

												Best zombie game I played recently. Very addictive and inmersive. Ok, if you are looking for pretty nice graphics, maybe it's not your game, but this 2-D graphics, old-schooled, are enough to achieve it's goal: entertaint, make fun, and cross the USA agaisnt the zombies. Maybe it's not as survival related as State of Decay, and some others. It's not a sandbox, but it's gameplay makes it totally replayable. Funny, and with a lot of random encounters. It's not a 10, but an 8 in almost every categorie.			"

												This game sits in an odd place. One the one hand, the mockery of the Oregon Trail is hilarious. It pays perfect homage to a game so many people played as kids.On the other hand, the shooting mechanic is confusing and annoying, making it just a little too frustrating to be a good casual game, meaning you may lose just because you can't slingshot bullets in the correct direction fast enough.7/10			"

												""Organ Trail: Director's Cut"" is a neat little spin-off of the game ""Oregan Trail"", takes the latter's core design elements and incorporates them into a zombie apocalypse setting where your goal is now to reach Safe Haven on the eastern coast of the USA and stay alive during the trip. Although it suffers from a lack of variety of the occuring events and randomness in the different playthroughs and the somewhat clunky controls, it is at its best when generating a story in which you and your friends try to survive the incoming dangers of the apocalypse. For the cheap price of 5€ (or your regional equivalent) and the addition of an endless mode, it is clearly worth your time and money.			"

												Oregon Trail got bitten by Zombie programmers and turned into something glorious.I jumped in my Shaggin' Wagon, hightailing it to Pittsburgh with my wife and 3 real life buddies. It was there that we found that the almighty dollar still carries weight in a world gone to poo. Rolling from City to outpost to city, making those critical little decisions as to whether it was worth the risk to scavenge supplies, use those medikits or barter off some supplies for fuel to get where we're going... a hell of a ride.A friend got nabbed by bandits and died because I missed my one shot, my wife and her friend got bit by people they thought were people dressed as zombies.  Everyone sat on some supplies a little too hard and ruined them, many held the map upside down and got us lost.   We were pursued by infected elk?, marauding bikers and at one point a Frankenstein's monster looking thing that wouldn't die.Dysentary and Cholera were ever prevalent amongst our group, the unfortunate death of a friend meant rationing was better (Mitchell, you died for the greater good).  But we made it from coast to coast.  Additionally, this game comes with a cool retro-physics mini game in the extras section.10/10 - Would Apocalypse again.			"

												I am having a TONNE of fun with Organ Trail; But just for like the past hour or so every time I have a random enounter on the side of the road that requires me to get out of my car and investigate there is a problem. The game only shows the green border but no text or events pop up; It just sits on that screen and I can't leave, it doesn't crash nor freeze, I just think it is not loading an event correctly... Has this happened to ANYONE else, or is it just a problem I am currently getting? Ive tried to restart the game a few times and it STILL has that problem.I think it just MIGHT be me, but does anyone know how to fix this problem or anyway to get in contact with the devs to take care of the problem that I currently am coming across.Besides this small hiccup (Not deal/game breaking for me because the saves happen after every event and until I get it fixed or it fixes itself, I can just choose to decline the offer) I recommend this game to ANY AND EVERYONE whom is interested in it. I HAVE NOT stopped playing since I bought it, its VERY enthralling! :D			"

I wasn't sure about it at first, and the aiming mechanic is a bit weird when you're used to RPG/FPS style.It stays true to both the ""Oregon Trail"" game and ""Kill Zombies!!"" theme in a fun way.Drive your (Station) Wagon across the US to settle in a new (uninfected) city. But be careful, perils and dangers lie between here and there: dystentary, typhoid, starvation, injury, (zombie bites), Indian (bandit) attacks, and more. Plan carefully, for you'll need food, fuel, med kits, and spare parts a plenty in your cross-country jaunt--and you may need them too far from the next landmark or city.Hint: A party member with a zombie bite apparently doesn't usually turn until their health zeros out... I didn't read that part and just... well I shot The Doctor in the face.Fun for all ages! :P			"

												When I was a kid, if you were lucky you got to spend a few minutes playing a computer game, in which you would die of dysentery almost immediately and start to wish you were playing something else.  And because of how the title of the game was pronounced, we called it ""The Organ Trail"".  And it was a classic game, and might have been for many the first introduction to computer strategy games and historical simulation.  This isn't that game.  But it's so close, it's as though that game rose from the grave to finish consuming our brains.  The Organ Trail take the same gameplay as The Oregon Trail, but changes the premise to an exodus of survivors during a zombie apocalypse, traveling the country in a beat-up station wagon while trying to reach a safe haven on the west coast.  It is a parody, but it also plays well with two exceptions.  The shooting mechanic is frustrating beyond belief.  I can barely remember how hunting was handled in The Oregon Trail, but here it is a mess.  And since shooting is now about survival against attack instead of gathering food, a good shooting system would have been welcome.  And the bandit minigame that comes up is awkward.  This game pretty much requires you play it with a mouse, no touchpads if you want to survive.  The achievements are also buggy.  Sometimes the counters reset randomly during a game.  But for those who remember playing the old Oregon Trail, and those with a dark sense of humor, or zombie fans, this is a fun game.			"

												This is a hilarious spin off of the classic game Oregon Trail. I loved it. With all the same danger that was in Oregon trail, but the twist that the danger comes from zombies and not... well... mother nature. It's a simple game where you just have to make sure you have enough supplies to make your way across the country to the safe zone with your friends. Often times friends will die and you will not be able to stop it. One time three of my people were dragged out of my car and eaten alive.  The random aspect of it can be annoying, but the game is also very funny. Stop and talk to people along the way and see what they have to say. They might surprise you.			"

												Pros: -Classic 8-bit arcade-style feel.-Awesome backdrop of a zombie apocalypse.- Has some of the same basic aspects as the awesome original game, “Oregon Trail”, with the main objective being to survive. However there are many differences.-Offers interactions for trading, scavenging, repairing your station wagon, training to acquire skills, and doing jobs to earn supplies or money. -There are multiple instances where your choices affect the gameplay.-Fantastically dark sense of humor.-Getting to name your fellow survivors after your worst enemies and watching them get bit by a zombie while going to the bathroom, then putting them down before they turn. Cons: -Somewhat challenging gameplay, even on the easy difficulty setting. Expect multiple playthroughs before you get the hang of it.-Annoying combat controls that usually result in getting attacked or wasting ammo until you get used to it.Overall, a really challenging and exciting game that is really fun to play and totally worth the buy.

												If ya like zombie stuff it can be a fun version of Oregon Trail.The controls in combat are stupid though (in my opinion anyway); in the name of trying to be challenging they made it less fun. Gotta click and drag where the bullet path goes other then just clicking and firing. It's reletively confusing and really slow - bad for what should be exciting.That aside it's sorta fun for a little bit. As the game goes on prices rocket and scavaging gets less fruitful. So it helps to gather as much as you can early on and hold onto it. Even if you think you have more then enough!			"

												TL;DR is at the bottom.First let me say that there IS a mobile version of this for slightly cheaper, If I knew this before I bought it I would have bought the mobile version simply because it suits mobile gaming better in my opinion.Recently I've found it pretty hard for games to hold my attention, this however, this was a pleasant exception.I've always enjoyed micromanagement in video games, so this looked interesting to me. This isn't really the same, and not just because it has Zombies. I doubt anyone is thinking this, but don't buy this JUST because you wanna play a game similar to the Oregon Trail. It's a fun experience that involves travelling across the country in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ car that falls apart all the time and causes you to break your legs for no reason. As you travel random events occur where you'll either need to make a descision or something happens which is out of your control. Things like losing health for a character or losing/gaining a certain resource. There are set towns that you go by and can stock up on supplies or upgrade your car or character. You can also do jobs, these usually consist of a minigame which can be different depending on the scenario. The minigames are quite fun in my opinion, but it's a little tough to get used to the shooting mechanics. The minigames also apear in other situations and some minigames even have suprises lying in them. I won't spoil the encounters but some are quite rare and may suprise you. This game is pretty cheap, but depending on your budget I'd wait for it to go on sale.TL;DR - If you like making descisions and playing some minigames, buy this. Maybe wait for it to be on sale.			"

												If you (like many people) grew up playing the classic Oregon Trail, this game will BLOW. YOUR. MIND. It manages to capture the graphics and feel of the classic 1990 version of the Oregon Trail and add zombies and a post-apocalyptic setting that works very well! It has the feel of a retro game and events are randomized so you never know what might happen. The only downside is the aiming controls seem very awkward, hopefully they'll get patched soon. Fantastic homage to a classic!			"

												This is one of those games that's great to read off what's going on with your friends on skype. Quirkyness is throughout the game and even poking fun at itself in a way that doesnt seem dumb as much as funny. When you have someone sit one 10$ too hard and ruined it, you laugh at the thought of your friend doing that. On the contrary you get angry when someone breaks a bone just from sitting in a car (Playful angry) Gameplay feels alright overall and seems pretty fun if you can be open minded to a game so retro. I'd give it: Zombie bite/5			"

												 With it's limited, repetitive gameplay, and being short, ""Organ Trail: Director's Cut"" is fun, for a while, but it soon gets boring, and therefore, I reccomend only for DIE-HARD fans of ""The Oregon Trail"" series...because it's basically the Oregon Trail...in the middle of a ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE! This game is fun for a while, but it's not very addicting. This is definitely one of the few DECENT indie games out there. For effort, I'll give this 6.4/10.

												A very interesting take on the old ""Oregon Trail"" game.  A zombie survival game using the same template.  You need ammo, food, fuel, medical bags, etc....  You also need to maintain your vehicle.  You start at one end of the United States and have to make your way to the West coast.  Within each town you can find jobs or people to barter with.  There is still money, so you can just buy what you need, but it is expensive.  There is a bonus game after you finish the story.  A pretty interesting little game.			"

												Zombies are IN for quite a while now and this game has been around for a few years as well. It was originally made as a parody of Oregon Trail, a really old game that had numerous re-releases (it was made in 1971 and had like 10 incarnations so far) that allowed a player to experience the settling in western United States. Organ Trail was a free flash/browser game that had a lot of fans, so the creators started a Kickstarter campaign to make a Director's Cut as a fully commercial title. After the funds were collected the game was made and is now available for Steam and mobile devices.As the game starts you are given a station wagon with some limited supplies (food, scrap for car repairs, a few spare tires, mufflers, car batteries, medical kits...) and 4 companions. Your goal: reach safe haven at the west and survive the zombie apocalypse. The whole game is set around random events that occur as you travel from one city/settlement to another while scavenging supplies, trading with other people, fighting off zombie attacks, escaping gangs that are after your supplies etc. Each hour that passes (in a matter of 2 seconds) is a possible trigger for a random event and they vary from simple weather changes that can slow you down to encounters with all kinds of people (these trigger classic text adventure kind of stories).Settlements offer a place to rest and trade and you can also get a job to earn some more supplies or money (arcade shootouts with zombies or bandits). Each city has a car shop that can upgrade your station wagon or a combat school to enhance your own abilities. Don't forget to refuel as well or you will get stranded in the middle of nowhere and forced to trade when you don't really want to.The game looks and feels as if it was made in early 1980s and that gives it a specific charm. But don't let it turn you away! Seriously, it's kinda cute to have such a game in 2014 (or 2012, when it was made), a game that relies on gameplay rather than on awesome graphics. It's a lot of fun with all those events that may or may not occur, but it does have its limits. I completed it 4-5 times and it lost its charm - once you figure out the best way to gather supplies, when and where to sell them and what to buy instead - it gets real easy. True, there are difficulty levels but even the hardest one is hard only at the start. As for the zombie combat, I'll give you a tip: when you want to shoot a zombie click on the zombie and hold the mouse button as you drag it towards your avatar. It's a direct hit in 95% of cases.I haven't played the mobile version (I got it as well, but I just never cared much for mobile games) so I can't say much about it. From what I saw online it's quite popular and people who own it love it! Give this game a chance, it's fun even though it's very limited.			"

												Despite of its graphic impact the game has really deep mechanic. Its highly addictive with mechanics taken from FTL and Papers, Please. The game is all about the survival of you and other 4 friends in a long coast to coast journey through a wasted by zombie State. The game takes also a little bit from the comic/tv series of The Walking Dead. Almost everything is random generated, except the main path in the campaign mode. Its a game about hard choices, you'll be forced to shoot your friends if bitten. Try to heal them if they get injured or leave them alone. For a small price it's a must have videogame.			"

												PROS:Great parody of Oregon Trail while adding new mechanics.Fitting graphics and music.Lots of tongue-in-cheek humor and zombie culture references. (can be hit or miss)Delicate resource management balance.Multiple difficulty levels.Secret interactions near Halloween.Good game for the price, even better when on sale.CONS:Luck of the dice at higher difficulties. May want to roll a new team if you get really unlucky right at the start.Steep initial learning curve, particularly with shooting.Achievement progress will reset randomly.A car repair action seems to happen -a lot- less often than stated success percentages suggest.Other thoughts:Shooting takes a minute to get used to. I find that dragging from the zombie's head to my character's belt buckle is the best option for me.Getting really good at shooting will allow you to dominate lower difficulties.You can complete 90% of the recovery jobs without shooting a single bullet, just go right!

The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ app style simplification of the original mechanics is not a sacrifice that should (or really needs) to be made.

												For those that never experienced old Apple 2 style games, most of this game's charm and humor will be lost on you.  But for those that sat in the computer lab, mindlessly clicking away, this game is a rare treat and a crystal ball looking back into your childhood.  Many take to adding in names of their friends, but for me, I always added Spiderman, Batman, etc.  And it's very telling when Bruce Wayne crumples up money and destroys it out of boredom.  Rich b***ard.  While some of the key controls, IE shooting are bass-akwards, it didn't stop me from enjoying other parts of the game.While there is a working form of this game online, it doesn't have half the features of this game.  Do yourself a favor.  Get the full version and support the devs.  They gotta eat too.Pros:+Nostalgic look back at the old Oregon Trail game you played in school+Interesting easter eggs located at nearly every checkpoint (From Final Fantasy, to Last of Us, to Shaun of the Dead, and more)+Randomized events give high replay+Interesting Achievements add another degree of difficulty (Can you make it without any money?  What about no trading? etc.)+Good soundtrack mixed with old-school sound effects+Endless mode makes it so you can unlock new starter modes!Cons:-God awful inverted gun controls with no settings to change to normal-Glitchy counter, making certain achievements a course in futility -Zombie 'Boss Fights' are more of an exercise in running away than fighting off the undead.-Clements isn't around longer.Read all this way?  You deserve a treat.  Don't bring your friends to a zom-pocolypse.  Bring Chuck Norris.  Seriously.  Bring him.			"

												I've played this game over and over and I can say, yeah, I would recommend it. Organ Trail has little polish, yet has personality and charm to it. It's highly replayable, so you can try out all the diffculties, which make the game easier for novices. You move from camp to camp, collecting supplies and shooting zombies along the way. Even though the shooting mechanic is difficult to master, and the game's tendency to get boring, I would recommend Organ Trail.			"

												Awesome game. Can become emotive if you put friends/familes names in for your group. The 8bit gfx allow you to use your imagination and it quickly adds to the atmosphere. I'm just gutted because a bandit creeped up on my Dad. I had one shot to save him and I missed and I've killed my own Dad. Get this game!			"

												I answered yes to this game, but only because I don't have a choice of ""Sort of"".When I was in elementary school, I played the game this was named after.  The ORIGINAL premise was you were on a journey, in your covered wagon, from the eastern portion of the United States to the western portion, avoiding the trials and tribulations of journeying to the Old West (you know, cowboys and indians times).This is not that game.  If you bought this game expecting that, you didn't read the description.This game has been moderninzed, in the sense it's modern times and it involves zombies.  If you bought this game solely because it's a zombie game, you'll enjoy it.  If you bought it because of the name and all the good feelings you have from playing it when you were a kid, you may be disappointed.(Note:  It just hit me that the name is ORGAN Trail and not Oregon Trail.  Wow, Fail on my part.)			"

												From what little I've played, Organ Trail manages to be a relatively complex game within effective and well-crafted, albeit simplistic, graphics and audio (that are so in order to remind of the original Oregon Trail). You could lose a lot of hours to it whether you're searching for a way to pass the time or a game that challenges your skills for things like planning ahead. Not a steep learning curve at all, and the little touches the developers add (i.e., Halloween mode, tombstones, various references to pop culture) are nice. I've only noticed a couple bugs, and none of them affected the gameplay enough for me to be seriously bothered.			"

Of course, this being a zombie game, you use it for pretty much every task. Consequently, playing feels more like an exercise in surviving the control scheme than trecking cross country with your gaunt, typhoid-ridden buddies.			"

												""Organ Trail: Director's Cut"" is a neat little spin-off of the game ""Oregan Trail"", takes the latter's core design elements and incorporates them into a zombie apocalypse setting where your goal is now to reach Safe Haven on the eastern coast of the USA and stay alive during the trip. Although it suffers from a lack of variety of the occuring events and randomness in the different playthroughs and the somewhat clunky controls, it is at its best when generating a story in which you and your friends try to survive the incoming dangers of the apocalypse. For the cheap price of 5€ (or your regional equivalent) and the addition of an endless mode, it is clearly worth your time and money.			"

												Organ Trail is a post-apocalypse version of the very old game called ""Oregon Trail"" back in the early 90's and so forth, albeit this game has a twist over the previous.Your objective is similar but is added with the fun addition of zombies and other variables, the objective of the game is to make your way across the vast USA wasteland collecting food and other resources, fighting through hordes of zombies, killing bandits, and to finally reach the 'Safe Haven' with hopefully all your team.The gameplay is quite linear although it is designed to be so, asides from being a bit linear it is quite a fun game on the first few run-throughs, and is usually better played with friends either IRL or on Steam/Skype chat as it gives a feeling to them being worth something in-game.The game can be quite brutal at times often making you lose resources and possibly lose team-mates, the random events can be quite devestating also leading to the unlikely death of you or your team-mates.Overall this game is a very fun game to play 8/10It has fair replay value but after awhile it gets quite boring but nonetheless something that'll keep you occupied on a streak without internet(Power cut, travelling, etc. )			"

												Organ Trail: Director's Cut is a nice little reimagining of the original Oregon Trail set in a contemporary zombie appocalypse. The story is to get to a settlement on the West Coast while managing gas, food, ammo, and the lives of your four party members. The graphics and sounds are very retro, but don't feel like they're just hopping on the ""because retro"" bandwagon. The controlls really suck (you have to drag your mouse back to shoot forward,) which is a cumbersome carryover from the iPhone version. If this sounds appealing to you, then definitely pick it up; it's only $5 at the time of this review and it's worth it for a lazy afternoon.			"

												PROS:Great parody of Oregon Trail while adding new mechanics.Fitting graphics and music.Lots of tongue-in-cheek humor and zombie culture references. (can be hit or miss)Delicate resource management balance.Multiple difficulty levels.Secret interactions near Halloween.Good game for the price, even better when on sale.CONS:Luck of the dice at higher difficulties. May want to roll a new team if you get really unlucky right at the start.Steep initial learning curve, particularly with shooting.Achievement progress will reset randomly.A car repair action seems to happen -a lot- less often than stated success percentages suggest.Other thoughts:Shooting takes a minute to get used to. I find that dragging from the zombie's head to my character's belt buckle is the best option for me.Getting really good at shooting will allow you to dominate lower difficulties.You can complete 90% of the recovery jobs without shooting a single bullet, just go right!

												One of those games, that decides to♥♥♥♥♥♥you over second-to-last checkpoint.Well.. Time to restart.Even if the graphics are minimal at best, the game still is very enjoyable. The first two difficulty levels are a tad too easy, but i think i just managed to get lucky. Two remaining levels are atleast a challenge. Zombies move faster and the targeting ""string"" is removed, this makes the combat a little more frantic.I recommend this to those people who enjoy roquelike games, since there are countless oppurtunities to get impaled by a fat zombie d**k.

												Organ Trail: Director's Cut is a surprisingly entertaining and fun game. It pays homage to the original Organ Trail and places it into the grime world of a zombie apocaplyse. The game consists of traveling across country and keeping yourself and your crew alive as long as possible. The plot is thus your own journey and your own interpretation of the visuals and events that take place. There are many unexpected events that can occur during a playthrough which gives this game high replayability (one playthrough can last a couple of hours). The gameplay is good, but it does require you to learn a lot of it on your own. It's also a bit of a hard game. Shooting your gun requires you to drag and click the mouse which can be difficult. The game doesn't force you to do certain tasks and the freedom was a nice change gaming wise. The music is entertaining and fitting. Like the game, it's a mixture of humor and even a bit melancholy. The graphics are pixelated and minimal, which seemed to go well with game's theme and origin. It's really good and original for an indie game. If you liked the original game, like zombie lore, or like games with strategy I would highly recommend.			"

												I... really can't recommend this game, even for the low, low price for which I got it. I can be told that I'm ""missing the point,"" but frankly... I really recommend just playing Oregon Trail. It's a similar experience, but slightly more enjoyable.The problem is that most of the time, this just felt unfair to me, in ways that a game should not be. Allow me to elaborate: I was playing on EASY, because I KNEW this game would be hard. And NONE of the minigames felt like a DECENT challenge. They were either so easy as to be pointless, or difficult to the point of frustration (like the shootouts with bandits who never miss and barely ever pop out of cover... Time Crisis felt more fair to me, and that's a game that's designed to EAT QUARTERS.) Every now and then, an interesting event would happen, but more often something would just be taken from me for no reason, and I had to accept it. No strategy, no rhyme or reason. I literally once picked up 3 cans of fuel as a raandom event and IMMEDIATELY had 4 stolen from me by bandits.And these bandits are the scourge of the gods. They are always teeming, always a threat, no matter how many you strike down, and are seemingly unaffected by zombies and hold no valuables, even bullets, that do not disintegrate once slain. They can steal fuel from the tank of a moving vehicle. They can kidnap a party member (again, from a moving vehicle) and hold him at gunpoint to force a single shot rescue with no grace on the aim; you LITERALLY have to be PERFECT.The game just makes it feel like you have no control over... anything. And not in the realistic way. Shops and jobs rarely offer what you need, ammo and fuel are insanely overpriced, your party members are mentally deficient enough to break spare parts for the car on a regular basis... and unless you have an $80 perk, you can only find food, scrap, and (I believe, rarely) ammo while scavenging. And I was only ever able to learn the perk that allowed me to find medkits.In short... I found this game just frutrating and disappointing. Maybe if you're a ridiculously huge zombie fanatic, it'll be more fun. Otherwise, I think Oregon Trail is just better-designed, and all the little ""jokes"" and references can be read for just as much effect. The game has potential, but it just feels like it doesn't offer enough. Nothing bad that happened to me (okay, save one gunshot wound that I quickly patched with my dozens of medkits) seemed like it happened as a result of my input... that much lack of control, where you can (seemingly easily) lose through no fault of your own, just doesn't appeal to me.

												This is a pretty awesome game for those who have made memories with Oregon Trail, those who are looking for retro graphics, those who like zombies, and those who enjoy satire towards any of those things. Pros-Great Humor: (If you are a zombie fanatic, and have watched every zombie movie, played every zombie game, and read every zombie comic book, then you will pick up on all of the excellent humor sprinkled throughout this game. On top of that, there are a ton of nods to just older games in general, which is always awesome.)-Retro Graphics: (A plus if you like them)-Replayable: (If you only play through this once, you will only see about 10% of the humor, challenges, etc. Each playthrough yields different things, such as events, and you can take a different approach everytime. You can stock up on different items, strive to do different things, and changing your sense of morality at anytime. The only really linear thing in this game is the path. You go from Point A, then Point B, all the way to Point Z, which is the safe haven you are trying to get to. It is what happens on your way to each point that makes this game interesting.)-Soundtrack: (This game has a really good sense of approach towards the situations you may be in, and one of the big reasons I say that is the soundtrack. The game always has fitting music, and good music at that.)Cons-Gameplay: (This is a subjective con. The gameplay is interesting in that it really is true to how an older game like this would play. But that doesn't mean it is easy. My only complaint on this is the aiming. Considering you must fight off the undead with a ranged weapon, you HAVE to be good at aiming it. On top of that, you can't waste ammo, as it could be out of reach due to price, or the shear lack of it in the zombie wastelands you explore. The aiming is...weird. I suggest looking up a video of gameplay so you can see if you can cope with it. I've gotten used to it, but at the same time I shouldn't have to. Gameplay should be fluid and creative, yet natural. Honestly, I would like just one of those, but aside from this one con, if you can overcome this one annoyance, then this game is definitely worth it.)Verdict Everything about this game is near-perfect, aside from one thing. Gameplay. While everything else is so good, this is a big thing to do deal with since without gameplay, it wouldn't be a game. At the same time, you have to see if it would bother you so I suggest looking at a video of the gameplay to decide. If, afterwards, you decide that isn't too bad, then nothing else should be stopping you from getting this game aside from lacking the funds to do so. Everything aligns almost perfectly for this game but one thing, so decide from all of this if you would truely like it.P.S. There is also a mobile edition available for Android and iOS, so if you want to try this game but feel playing it with a mouse is a deal breaker, then that is the next best thing. The one thing both editions have over the free, Facebook alternative is that they are much more complete, and have A TON of addition content that adds to the experience of this game. The developer did fairly well on this title, so I trusted the mobile edition would live up to the PC edition here. Long story short, there is no game that really keeps itself consistent across all the platforms it's available on so well like this one!			"

												It's a fun game for a cheap price. For those of us gamers around the 30 year old mark, we'll remember playing the Oregon Trail in school. This game does a decent job of reminding me of that game with a large emphesis on zombies and despair as well as many new features. Honestly, the gameplay is there, it has replay value, unlockables, and the randomness that'll have me playing through a few times.I read the negative reviews of the game before buying which was mostly complaints about the targetting system. I found it almost stupid-easy to use and I'm shocked that people find that difficult. I went through the whole game and missed a shot maybe 5 times total out of likely 1000 shots.... Click on the zombie, hold down the left mouse button, drag to your character's shirt and let go.. you've hit a zombie.I'd play it again..if I lost the game I'd buy it again..I'd recommend it.			"

												It's pretty much Oregon Trail with a zombie theme.  It's like a slightly more advanced version of the 1985 edition.  For all its faults, I think that the classic Oregon Trail is more challenging and exciting (and it's freely available online). Once I learned a few simple tricks, Organ Trail was pretty hard to lose, even on ""suicidal"" level. The end of the game is glitchy and has nothing to do with zombies. Still, it's good for a laugh. Inspirational moment: ""Eva is dicking around with 11 dollars and accidentally ruins it.""  Hmm.Update: Apparently the end is no longer glitchy.			"

But I keep playing it because it captures the elements of the classic Oregon Trail while implementing some great elements from zombie survival. The quirky graphics and chiptune music actually add to the atmosphere and overall the game doesn't just ride on nostalgia but manages to shamble on it's own merits. Beware the Zombie Bear.			"

												If you like zombies, text based (or text heavy?), and don't mind starting from the beginning in a game over and over, you'll like Organ Trail. I was never lucky enough to play Oregon Trail as a kid, so any puns that are from that game I've missed. But I a VERY big zombie fan, and have played many zombie games and watched many a zombie movie. Organ trail has a lot of easter eggs that reference zombies in pop culture, whether it's from the screens that show you what town you've made it to, or even within the text itself. Off the top of my head, I remember this game referencing The Walking Dead, Zombies Ate My Neighbors, and Resident Evil! The humor in this game is pretty light, which is needed because the random events can stress you out. It has with me, but once I get a pop up saying that 'someone farted', I smirk. Gameplay wise, it's pretty easy. Most of this is text based, with the exception of boss battles and side quests (shooting bandits, scavenging, grabbing forgotten items for people, and killing zombies for people). I have a wild imagination so this isn't a problem for me, but if you're the type that needs to see what's going on in a game, then that may not be so awesome for you. I have noticed spelling and grammar errors in the special events that are strictly text based. A little embarassing honestly. It took me a while to learn how to shoot right, and while it's not a horrible system for shooting, it really could be better. It's hard to shoot zombies when you're using a laptop mouse pad. It would have been cool to have melee weapons as an alternative to the shooting system, but that may be a part of Oregon Trail nostalgia/referencing that I don't get.I have spent way too much time playing this game, but that's not stopping me. This game really is worth the five dollars though. The replay value is pretty solid, as this is a solid game.			"

Cons:-Shooting can be difficult to get use to.-Had the game lock up. Not a big deal, close and open to continue story.-No full screen :(Pros:-Good amount of content to keep each trip new.-Keeps feel of old OT.-Competative with leaderboards.If you are a fan of great graphics the games not for you.

The game only shows the green border but no text or events pop up; It just sits on that screen and I can't leave, it doesn't crash nor freeze, I just think it is not loading an event correctly... Has this happened to ANYONE else, or is it just a problem I am currently getting? Ive tried to restart the game a few times and it STILL has that problem.I think it just MIGHT be me, but does anyone know how to fix this problem or anyway to get in contact with the devs to take care of the problem that I currently am coming across.Besides this small hiccup (Not deal/game breaking for me because the saves happen after every event and until I get it fixed or it fixes itself, I can just choose to decline the offer) I recommend this game to ANY AND EVERYONE whom is interested in it. I HAVE NOT stopped playing since I bought it, its VERY enthralling! :D			"

												This is one of those games that's great to read off what's going on with your friends on skype. Quirkyness is throughout the game and even poking fun at itself in a way that doesnt seem dumb as much as funny. When you have someone sit one 10$ too hard and ruined it, you laugh at the thought of your friend doing that. On the contrary you get angry when someone breaks a bone just from sitting in a car (Playful angry) Gameplay feels alright overall and seems pretty fun if you can be open minded to a game so retro. I'd give it: Zombie bite/5			"

												What do I have to say about Organ Trail? Well for starters I usally don't play that many indie games. The few I have played were bad so I have been turned off for them. But seing this game at 5 bucks and being a huge fan of Oregon trail (The game that this is based off of and a lover of zombies) I had to try this out. Over all I'm glad i got this. I love watching Frank West going to pee and never coming back and Duke Nukem trowing 30 bucks at a zombie. All these moments make this game sweet. If you love DOS looking games and zombies this is a must have and the price can not be beat  8/10 would be higher if there was more to do in the game you are pretty limited and once you have played it 2-3 times its just not as tense and you have seen every thing it has to trough at you. Any rate buy this game its fun to play with friends in the room and good tweet moments :D			"

												Who doesn't love a good zombie apocalypse? I know I do! And Organ Trail: Director's Cut delivers! The game play is reminiscent of Oregan Trail, a game where you ran a wagon across the Manifest Destiny? (been awhile since I played) to create a homestead for your family. This game is just like that except you and your family are going to a place called Safe Haven (I think, been awhile since I played this as well). Along the way you must manage resources and fight off the undead. This game can be very hard, and even though I logged several hours into this game I still haven't beat it. Gotta love the 8-bit graphics!			"

												The Organ Trail is a remake or Oregon Trail (that game everyone played in 4th grade computer class) with zombies, because everything these days must have zombies. The player manages supplies and health while rolling across America in a station wagon and making pit stops at settlements, where the player can do jobs for additional supplies. If you've played Oregon Trail, you pretty much know what to expect. It's a short game that can be completed in about two or three hours if you don't die, but you might be inclined to playthrough a few more times, though not much changes. The main difference from Oregon Trail is the zombie combat. It's simple and rather clunky, but it fits the style of the game well. The game is a fair challenge on normal mode, but should be manageable to most players as long as they are careful. For five dollars, Organ Trail is worth the money.			"

												Even if Organ Trail started as a parody of The Oregon Trail in its original form, this Director's Cut has seen it expanded in many ways that certainly make it stand out as a game by itself and not just a derivative parody, as noteworthy as that may be. Giving you control over a particular survivor and his additional party of four, along with your reliable Station Wagon, in the zombie apocalypse and tasking you to get from East  Coast to West Coast of the United States, Organ Trail lets you handle the minutia and logistics of such an endeavor - from managing your party's resources like food and spare car parts to determining how you will handle various events and people you run into, as well as the act of combat against the zombies themselves. Controls probably could've used some updating given the times, but that peculiar ""genre kitchen sink"" feeling that made the original game so interesting is largely untouched and still effective.

												STRONG LANGUAGE:""Mother ♥♥♥♥in god damn son of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥mother ♥♥♥♥in boss fights"" is exactly what it says on my first tombstone. I was feeling ballsy and went exploring again right after my first boss fight and ta-da, another boss fight. So I actually beat that one too, and thought, ""Sure enough I'm safe to go exploring now"" Nope. Boss fight. I died. Don't let that discourage you, this game is all kinds of fun and I plan to get all of the achievements for this one too. I finally got all the way to the end and I though it was pretty intense when I came across my own tombstone. It was so funny reading it though because by that time my death had happened a loooong time ago. This game is still awesome and this is 3 months after originally writing this!			"

												Organ Trail is a post-apocalypse version of the very old game called ""Oregon Trail"" back in the early 90's and so forth, albeit this game has a twist over the previous.Your objective is similar but is added with the fun addition of zombies and other variables, the objective of the game is to make your way across the vast USA wasteland collecting food and other resources, fighting through hordes of zombies, killing bandits, and to finally reach the 'Safe Haven' with hopefully all your team.The gameplay is quite linear although it is designed to be so, asides from being a bit linear it is quite a fun game on the first few run-throughs, and is usually better played with friends either IRL or on Steam/Skype chat as it gives a feeling to them being worth something in-game.The game can be quite brutal at times often making you lose resources and possibly lose team-mates, the random events can be quite devestating also leading to the unlikely death of you or your team-mates.Overall this game is a very fun game to play 8/10It has fair replay value but after awhile it gets quite boring but nonetheless something that'll keep you occupied on a streak without internet(Power cut, travelling, etc. )			"

												Organ trail is a fun parody of the Oregon trail, set during a zombie apocalypse. the gameplay is almost exactly like Oregon Trail, as in you and four others travel across the country in search of sacuary from the zombies. Along the way you visit trading posts and ruined cities to find food, ammo, car parts, and money to make your way to safe haven. the hunting from Oregon Trail has been replaced with a scavenging minigame to find supplies when you are out of cash to buy them. The game is not very long, beatable in around 3 to 4 hours, but the time is well spent as you wander through the wasteland reading humorous tombstones and finding references to other zombie media. The game is definitely worth the $5 and more than worth it any less than that			"

												I answered yes to this game, but only because I don't have a choice of ""Sort of"".When I was in elementary school, I played the game this was named after.  The ORIGINAL premise was you were on a journey, in your covered wagon, from the eastern portion of the United States to the western portion, avoiding the trials and tribulations of journeying to the Old West (you know, cowboys and indians times).This is not that game.  If you bought this game expecting that, you didn't read the description.This game has been moderninzed, in the sense it's modern times and it involves zombies.  If you bought this game solely because it's a zombie game, you'll enjoy it.  If you bought it because of the name and all the good feelings you have from playing it when you were a kid, you may be disappointed.(Note:  It just hit me that the name is ORGAN Trail and not Oregon Trail.

												Did you like the Apple IIe version of Oregon Trail? Did you REALLY like it? I mean, would you enjoy going to the Internet Archive and booting it up in your web browser right now?If you answered yes (or ""what part of 'yes' don't you understand? STOP ASKING ME ALREADY"") to these questions, just buy this game and start playing it. It's a professionally-made send-up: great pixel art, great UI, great mix of trek choices and side missions/mini-games..all mixed with the ridiculously random, unfair party happenings you expect from the journey. (Wait, did you say CRAVE from the journey? Weirdo...) As in, ""Dysentery AGAIN?! Come ON!""Also, it has gamepad support. I played this with my 360 pad, seated comfortably using Steam's Big Picture Mode. It was glorious. Oh, and it's a post-apocalyptic world full of zombies; no squirrels or rabbits to shoot. Didn't mean to bury the lead, I just don't usually write reviews and I'm not really focused right now. This game rocks, I'm gonna go play it some more...			"

												How can I explain how much I enjoy this game? I know! I bought it twice. Yes, bought twice. First time on iOS when it first came out, then again on Steam about a week after I joined. And I was glad to do it.Organ Trail isn't original; it's an homage. It's a bizarre, hilarious, utterly enjoyable take on the classic Apple IIe Oregon Trail. You remember: the one where everyone died of dysentery and you were left wondering just what the heck a ""wagon tongue"" was. Well, you trade in the Conestoga wagon for a station wagon (which bears a strong resemblance to Clark Griswold's Family Truckster, or possibly a Plymouth Reliant K) and instead of hunting buffalo, you're shooting zombies. The sound, graphics, and gameplay are all so close to the original Oregon trail that you're going to have elementary school flashbacks. (Since they have such a sense of humor, clicking in-game buttons has a sound effect: the distinctive CLUNK of a IIe keyboard.) The one and ONLY one slight ding against it is the repair minigame, but you know, that's totally forgiveable. Just because it's not my cup of tea doesn't mean it was a bad design choice or really a problem with the game. Every game has a feature or two you're not particularly fond of. Tremendous replay value, practically guaranteed hilarity, and outstanding minigames. And, of course, dysentery.			"

												I played the Oregon Trail with my dad a few times, and I've seen other spin offs from the game (especially Super Wagon Adventure) but this is my favorite so far. It's basically the graphics and decision system of the Oregon Trail mixed with the choices of The Walking Dead with some nice little interaction with the environment in a different way. I haven't played much (I'm planning on recording it for my channel) but I absolutely loved it. You really have to think and pay attention, and it's somewhat challenging.			"

												Don't get me wrong, I quite like this game. However, it is brought down by a few game breaking glitches, such as not responding to the mouse or keyboard in menus, and blue shapes appering randomly. The worst one (spoiler) is when I was fighting the octopus, the screen all of a sudden went black and said ""You made it to Safe Haven. Click anywhere to Continue"" I click millions of times and mashed every key on my keyboard yet nothing happened. Then, I paused and unpaused, and the octopus reappeared in the middle of the screen and so did  my character. I fought it for about 20 minutes, but it wouldn't die, and the car had no health bar. I just sat there shooting its tentacles till I gave up and let it kill me. It gave me instructions for a stage, then showed a close up version of my character, but I could do nothing but pause and unpause. I now see the instructions and close up every time I load that save file. The game is still enjoyable, and these glitches don't occur very frequently, but I am incerdibly disapointed that these glitches have not been taken care of.			"

												Pretty much what you expect it to be, survival - except shooting isn't like the original Oregon Trail. More emphasis is placed on shooting direction, how fast the shots are, and how fast your reloads are (passive). Game is fun for those who enjoyed the original Oregon Trail and zombies - the point is to get from Washington, D.C. to Oregon. Your job? To be the dictator... or Rick from the Walking Dead if you need reference. Only thing missing is a class system (banker?) but it isn't necessary. Helped started by kickstarter and it looks like a GameMaker game.			"

												I have put a considerably large amount of time into this game and I can say that it is worth the money you pay for it, unless you are charged £40 or something. The game is a zombie-fied version of the educational game classic 'The Oregan Trail' something I've only ever really heard about through other people, and not something I've had a great deal of experiance with. Even not having any nostalgia for the original version I still manage to derive an insane amount of enjoyment from this game. It's basically a simulation of you and four friends trying to make your way across a zombie infested America, starting in Washington DC and ending on the west coast in a place called safe haven.The gameplay is quite slow and steady for the most part, with a great deal of the decisions being based around how much time to put into different activities to supply yourself for the journey, however another equally large part of the gameplay is scavenging for resources in the wilderness and fighting of enemies in different styles of combat encounters. The game has a great sense of humor and has a lot going for it, especially when combined with the final cut expansion pack, which adds more encounters and bosses as well as more missions and an entire character skin system not present in the game originally. The only major issue with the game as a whole is that it can be quite buggy, some achievements tend not to work and getting the game to unlock certain bonuses can be a complete nightmare, but in fairness to the devs it was made by two people only and they really do try their best to get everything fixed and working for everyone. TL;DR:A great take on a classic title that suffers from a few minor bug issues.			"

												What if I told you there was a game that was a perma-death story game with retro graphics and is a remake of the classic Oregon Trail with zombies?  Well, this is it. Organ Trail is definitely for those who want to play single player with a hit of multiplayerif you've got friends sitting next to you.  With a linear story line and different choices to make moral or otherwise you'll find a limited amount of replayability. Imput you're friends names into the game for increased entertainment and suspense. By yourself or with some friends sitting there you can spend time having some awesome adventures!Pros:  A decient SinglePlayer Experience remenisient of Oregon Trail   Decision managment integral to your survival  $5 (Or less on a sale)   Interactive minigames when scavaging, doing a job, or by sudden event immerses you  Difficult, but in a well done way (Difficulty setting and your decision making)Neutral:  Limited animations. I know it's to match Oregon Trail, but they could have improved it as well.  Decient Sound effects and sound track. Matches the content well though.Cons:  Difficult aiming controls ( try click and hold starting at zombie head and pull and let go at your feet)  You don't need to do the extra event things happening off the road  Limited replayability due to praticially non-existant story and linear path.  Ending level is a joke, but what ever. . .Final Suggestion:  Get it if you like difficult and retro nastalgic games. Rating:  7.5/10 Scale:  1 =AVOID [-|-]  2-4 =Try Only if Free [-|-]  5 =Meh, Could be Better  6 =Below Average [-|-]  7 =Average [-|-]  8 =Get if it appeals [-|-]  9 =Get it [-|-]  10 =MUST HAVESee For YourSelf: Sorry No Gameplay From Me Yet			"

												As a child of the 80's I played a ton of OREGON trail during 'computer class' in Elementary & Middle school.That game was great for its time. But I wouldnt be to terribly excited to sit down and have to play it again (likely on a Commodore, for that authentic 1991 feel!).However, ORGAN Trail takes everything that made it's spiritual precursor great and leaves all that learning bologne behind.At its core, the game is a resource management Sim, but it's really so much more than that.It's an escape from the reality of the real world for a few moments.Are you a teacher who busts her/his butt at work all day? Name your party after your snot-nosed students and laugh heartily when they get torn to shreds.Are you a seasoned mechanic who enjoys gaming in your free time? Well now you can work on turning a pixelated station wagon into a Zombie Killing machine, complete with machine gun mounted steel reinforced windows.Are you a stocks and bonds broker who would like to see what happens when you corner the market on canned goods and bullets and leave everyone else to try and barter for your stash with weird green money from better times?WELL NOW YOU CAN!ORGAN Trail has all of this and more!I named my party after my family. Not only did they get dysentary, but they got shot by bandits, bikers attempts to steal car parts from them, and they were chewed up and spit back out by zombie bears in the woods!Seriously, this game is hilarious -- and the soundtrack is t1ts!

												The game is harsh. Very harsh. It is one of those games where you will play it for a good few hours only to realise you were wasting your time. It is similar to Crazy Taxi, no not because of the gameplay but because it is a game you will only play for a couple hours at a time but you will be determined to come back to it a lot and complete it on all of the difficulties. The game has good mechanics but the shooting just seems a bit overcomplicated which may have been done to prevent it from being too easy, but now the shooting could be considered a bit too frustrating...Overall I would reccomend the game because it is cheap, especially on sale, and it is worth the money, but don't expect an easy relaxing game, this is a very challenging and stressful game!+ Immersive+ Addictive+ Passes the time quickly- May get frustrating due to RNG- Some annoying mechanics "

												The trailer alone sold me (along with the screenshots)To be honest, this game is great!I have already spent way longer on it than I'd like to admit.It's funny, well-written, and easy to play. Also, when you finally reach your destination, there is a wonderfully inherent sense of satisfaction. I'd say the satisfaction is ALMOST as sweet as killing your stupid, stupid tag-alongs when they lose 7 gallons of gas (the only gas you have).It's cheap, and I'll bet you will have a good time with it, especially if you sank a lot of time playing Oregon Trail as a kid.

												An interesting premise and a fun romp. It's worth the few bucks I paid for. A single run doesn't take very long, but that's perfectly acceptable given the nature of the game. I wasn't super thrilled with the targeting for the firearms, but that's a throwback to the original, so I suppose there's no room to complain.			"

												I'm assuming that for most gamers, The Oregon Trail was a bit before their time. An early PC game about crossing America, many of my compadres died of dysentery  while uttering, ""What's so great about Oregon?"" (Sorry my Oregonite friends) Well, much like your standard zombie him (or her) self, the Organ Trail rises from the grave to pump new life into this old idea. For children too young for the rigors of Left 4 Dead or Resident Evil, this might be simple enough to sink their teeth into. And with zombie game & movie refrences galore, adults will get a kick out of it as well.			"

												Organ Trail is a unique throw-back parody type of the original Oregon Trail game. The idea behind the game is you are in a station wagon fleeing through the zombie apocalypse. It features everything an original Oregon Trailer game would have including trading, hunting and random events.The game does a good job capturing the old-school vibe but at the end of the day doesn't really hold up. It's an okay playthrough the first time but there's really no reason to go back. It's a good game for a ""goof"" or if you really love the zombie genre but overall the game could be a lot more.Replay value is pretty low and I wouldn't recommend the game.Genre Lovers: Skip itNon-Genre Lovers: Skip itTime To Beat: ~1 hour (low replay value)			"

												Even if Organ Trail started as a parody of The Oregon Trail in its original form, this Director's Cut has seen it expanded in many ways that certainly make it stand out as a game by itself and not just a derivative parody, as noteworthy as that may be. Giving you control over a particular survivor and his additional party of four, along with your reliable Station Wagon, in the zombie apocalypse and tasking you to get from East  Coast to West Coast of the United States, Organ Trail lets you handle the minutia and logistics of such an endeavor - from managing your party's resources like food and spare car parts to determining how you will handle various events and people you run into, as well as the act of combat against the zombies themselves. Controls probably could've used some updating given the times, but that peculiar ""genre kitchen sink"" feeling that made the original game so interesting is largely untouched and still effective.

												Load up your station wagon and hit the road in an incredibly old-school, Oregon Trail inspired zombie apocalypse adventure. Organ Trail's simple goal, cross the U.S. and reach the Safe Haven, is kept lively and fresh by various events, mini-games, and choices along the way. You'll make tough decisions, manage your resources, and fend off zombies and bandits alike along the road. In towns you'll trade, take on jobs for resources or cash, and have the opportunity to train yourself in various expertise to help along the way, all while maintaining and upgrading your vehicle.

As you drive from city to city, town to town, you encounter different activities. Such as choosing risky options or fighting zombies from the roof of your car. Along the journey you use up fuel, food, money and medical kits. These are essential for your survival. You can buy these items from shops in towns and citys. This add great depth to this game, because you can get to a point where you need to think ahead. This game is very interesting and fun to play!

It literally channels the ghost of that game so perfectly, you might forget that you aren't actually playing it.It's not just a cheesy ripoff either. It is faithful to the source material but it still maintains it's own unique aspects and introduces new ""minigames"". You still have to manage resources and scarcity. There is plenty of scavenging and trading. You're still at the helm of a wagon, but instead of fording rivers you have to ford throngs of zombies. Instead of snake bites there are zombie bites. You still can't carry back all the food.Oh, and there's lots of dysentery.			"

												Amazingly fun, as addictive as the original ""Oregon Trail"".The graphics are basic but they are all that is needed. I was engrosed in 8bit story-telling and i love the messages that come up. ""Tanner went out for a♥♥♥♥♥♥and never returned"" or ""Abram was dicking around with the battery and ruined it"". Great time, enjoyed the game thoroughly.My only complaint was that money was EXTREMELY hard to come by when playing on normal version. This ultimately meant that I died because we ran out of fuel, even though I knew it was coming there wasnt much I could do to stop it. I scavanged 10 times in a row, traded every chance i got, and couldn't find fuel anywhere. I had a multitude of food, scrap, and ammo, but was always dying for fuel and money. I would love to try the combat training but at $80 I don't think I ever had that much money to my name the whole game, let alone have $80 to spare!Overall fun game, I put my friends' names in the spots and took pictures of the messages as I played and sent the messages to them over text. They got a kick out of it and consequently have all purchased the game. Good game, minor balance tweaks and it would be PERFECT!			"

												I was on the fence about recommending this one, but in the end I decided to give it a thumbs-up.Pros:- Easy to learn. If you've played The Oregon Trail, you can play this.- Retro graphics. No need for a top-end video card.- Ability to give your party funny names.- Very addictive.- You have to allocate resources carefully or you're out of luck.Cons:- What the heck is Clements' Quest?- There's game-breaking bug at the final boss.- No ""back to menu"" button when setting up a new game.The game is also very random, just like the original Oregon Trail. Personally, I didn't have a problem with it.			"

												Did you like the Apple IIe version of Oregon Trail? Did you REALLY like it? I mean, would you enjoy going to the Internet Archive and booting it up in your web browser right now?If you answered yes (or ""what part of 'yes' don't you understand? STOP ASKING ME ALREADY"") to these questions, just buy this game and start playing it. It's a professionally-made send-up: great pixel art, great UI, great mix of trek choices and side missions/mini-games..all mixed with the ridiculously random, unfair party happenings you expect from the journey. (Wait, did you say CRAVE from the journey? Weirdo...) As in, ""Dysentery AGAIN?! Come ON!""Also, it has gamepad support. I played this with my 360 pad, seated comfortably using Steam's Big Picture Mode. It was glorious. Oh, and it's a post-apocalyptic world full of zombies; no squirrels or rabbits to shoot. Didn't mean to bury the lead, I just don't usually write reviews and I'm not really focused right now. This game rocks, I'm gonna go play it some more...			"

												Many gamers my age remember playing Oregon Trail in elementary school where most of us were massacred by natives or crushed by wagon wheels and 3rd world diseases. I pitty those who hadn't because such experiences have made such a game as Organ Trail even more humurous to play.Fashioned in the manner of ancient Atari games they don't interfere with the sheer absurdity players are sure to experience in this hilarious post-apocalyptic road trip across the United States in a station wagon. An obvious play on the caravans of Oregon Trail. Here, players can create several members of their party to tag along with during their journey through swarms of zombies, camps of survivors and trips through the wilderness for supplies.Don't hesitate to pick up this game if you're interested after my explanation because you will find near endless entertainment.

												Do you like Oregon Trail? Do you like Zombies? Do you like retro pixel art? Do you have a sense of humor? This game is perfect for you then! I love that you drive a station wagon instead of a stage coach/wagon *wink wink* Best moment I had went like this,  character named Eve died halfway through, so I wrote on her epitaph: Ribs are delicious. Biblical reference with the knowledge that zombies would eat my rib-woman. New character get's halfway through the campaign, & the game says, ""You see something off the side of the road, investigate?"" So I do & it's Eve's epitaph. My jaw dropped, & then Eve's zombified hand burst out of the ground! I had a matter of seconds to kill her. My mind was blown by having to have killed the zombie of my former character.			"

												I won't lie, Organ Trail might not be the best game you could grab for $5. But if you see it on sale, it's worth it. I'm not sure if my game time is accurate (almost positive it's at least double or tripple 1.7 hours) because I played it a lot offline.Anyways, as you probably already know, this is a zombie game where you manage a group and their resources. I could explain the game mechanics but honestly it would probably be faster to just watch a video or take a look at the screenshots on Steam.Overall it's fun, addicting, and challenging. Beating it for the first time was an enormous relief. Also, if you name the characters after friends/family, it adds a whole new level. You start getting attached to them and when one dies, it's actually a bit sad. It's crazy how this small little zombie game can actually suck you in and will quickly make you realize that a zombie outbreak would not be fun!			"

It's got more strategy, more things to do, and none of your party members will randomly die out of nowhere. Also has multiple difficulty levels: Easy (easy), Normal (easy), Hard (normal), and Suicide (hard). It has a couple of annoying bugs but is good fun overall.			"

Also, when you finally reach your destination, there is a wonderfully inherent sense of satisfaction. I'd say the satisfaction is ALMOST as sweet as killing your stupid, stupid tag-alongs when they lose 7 gallons of gas (the only gas you have).It's cheap, and I'll bet you will have a good time with it, especially if you sank a lot of time playing Oregon Trail as a kid.

Movement is spotty at best and you cannot shoot while walking, which is equally frustrating. The trade system is weirdly broken and unless the shooting during scavenging is fixed, you run out of med kits long before you get anywhere useful. The pause menu crashes the game half the time too.

												Very nice little game,  i tried it out the last summer on Android and it was friggin' awesome so i promised i'd get it on Steam. I'd absolutely recommend it if you haven 5 dollars to spare, but if you want you can get it on Android/iOS aswell. Pretty solid game.			"

												Did you like the Apple IIe version of Oregon Trail? Did you REALLY like it? I mean, would you enjoy going to the Internet Archive and booting it up in your web browser right now?If you answered yes (or ""what part of 'yes' don't you understand? STOP ASKING ME ALREADY"") to these questions, just buy this game and start playing it. It's a professionally-made send-up: great pixel art, great UI, great mix of trek choices and side missions/mini-games..all mixed with the ridiculously random, unfair party happenings you expect from the journey. (Wait, did you say CRAVE from the journey? Weirdo...) As in, ""Dysentery AGAIN?! Come ON!""Also, it has gamepad support. I played this with my 360 pad, seated comfortably using Steam's Big Picture Mode. It was glorious. Oh, and it's a post-apocalyptic world full of zombies; no squirrels or rabbits to shoot. Didn't mean to bury the lead, I just don't usually write reviews and I'm not really focused right now. This game rocks, I'm gonna go play it some more...			"

												Many gamers my age remember playing Oregon Trail in elementary school where most of us were massacred by natives or crushed by wagon wheels and 3rd world diseases. I pitty those who hadn't because such experiences have made such a game as Organ Trail even more humurous to play.Fashioned in the manner of ancient Atari games they don't interfere with the sheer absurdity players are sure to experience in this hilarious post-apocalyptic road trip across the United States in a station wagon. An obvious play on the caravans of Oregon Trail. Here, players can create several members of their party to tag along with during their journey through swarms of zombies, camps of survivors and trips through the wilderness for supplies.Don't hesitate to pick up this game if you're interested after my explanation because you will find near endless entertainment.

												Oh man, this game is awesome.Together, with my trusty companions: Banana, Ann, sux, and <3, we went to travel from the east coast to the west coast, trying to get through hordes of zombies and the occasional jackass kids taking advantage of the situation. We didn't make it. <3 Died pretty early because she was bit by a zombie so I had to kill her before she became a threat to the rest of us. We also encountered like 4 towns with no ammo in a row. Bad luck, I guess.BUT, WHO CARES ABOUT THE LIVES OF THOSE FOOLS ANYWAY? The game is great. I'm sure you're familiar with Oregon Trail, a timeless classic of a family escaping to the west. Well this game is that game, but much more hilarious, with obvious nods to the original. I mean, there's a boss battle with a zombie bear for starters. You also need to fix your Station Wagon from time to time. And ♥♥♥♥ing tires are always getting stolen or broken. God. I lost like 8 tires in less than half the total route. The game is terrifically fun, though. Despite it not being super action packed, the game offers a lot of decisions. And it's decisions that make someone a good gamer at the end of the day, right? I mean, do you want to rest up your team or try to get along to the next town at 30% health? What if you get intercepted by a biker gang for the 30th time? That could be unfortunate. Oh, or what if there's a horde of zombies that you can't avoid because your tire broke again? You just never know what kind of sillyness can happen, so you have to be prepared. But don't be too prepared, because there's tons of bandits who like to steal mufflers which you stocked up on because it seems like something to stock up on... but you never did need to replace any. Oh yeah, and you should totally buy food, maybe you should sell those mufflers you got from that last town for helping a family survive a shoot out or whatever was going on, you didn't read the job description, you just wanted to get paid. Oh. You can't sell those? Oh. Oh. Oh...At least you get to kill zombies and survive until your wagon reaches the west coast somewhere.			"

												Organ Trail: Director's Cut is a nice little reimagining of the original Oregon Trail set in a contemporary zombie appocalypse. The story is to get to a settlement on the West Coast while managing gas, food, ammo, and the lives of your four party members. The graphics and sounds are very retro, but don't feel like they're just hopping on the ""because retro"" bandwagon. The controlls really suck (you have to drag your mouse back to shoot forward,) which is a cumbersome carryover from the iPhone version. If this sounds appealing to you, then definitely pick it up; it's only $5 at the time of this review and it's worth it for a lazy afternoon.			"

												If you remember having fun hunting critters and getting dysentary playing The Oregon Trail on a clunky archaic computer a quarter century ago, you owe it to yourself to check out this reanimated take on the classic pioneer simulation!   There are laughs to be had with this game and it stands on its own even if you remove the nostalgia from the equation.  Even those who are too young to remember giant floppy disks can have a good time with this.  A good value for the money. 5/5			"

As much as it was nice at first that the dev was sticking around and seemingly fixing issues, it was soon left to die of a sore bitten thumb on the side of the road.

												Organ Trail is a game that revisits the classic Oregon Trail game, which was originally released back in 1971. This game takes  place in an Apocalyptic world, where zombies now rule after a nuclear war has struck most of America. Your goal is to make it to the west coast safe haven with all of your party members safely. This game's mechanics stay fairly true to the original Oregon Trail game, easily making it a point of nostalgia for those old enough to remember it. For those who are too young to have experienced this game, it is still very worthwhile to pick up. While traveling to the west coast you must monitor your car's health, your food supply and of course your friend's health. You can stop on the road to scavange for food while dodging between zombies, and meet various NPCs.While stopping at towns you can do jobs that will grant you more money or supplies. These range anywhere from going to retrieve an item in a field to defending another party from zombies. And of course no Oregon Trail like game would be complete without your party members getting dysentary atleast once! Luckily this game gives you plently of times to contract this disease. Overall I would definitely reconmend this game. It is really nice for those days when you are without internet and need something to do, or you're on a road trip with a laptop.			"

												How can I explain how much I enjoy this game? I know! I bought it twice. Yes, bought twice. First time on iOS when it first came out, then again on Steam about a week after I joined. And I was glad to do it.Organ Trail isn't original; it's an homage. It's a bizarre, hilarious, utterly enjoyable take on the classic Apple IIe Oregon Trail. You remember: the one where everyone died of dysentery and you were left wondering just what the heck a ""wagon tongue"" was. Well, you trade in the Conestoga wagon for a station wagon (which bears a strong resemblance to Clark Griswold's Family Truckster, or possibly a Plymouth Reliant K) and instead of hunting buffalo, you're shooting zombies. The sound, graphics, and gameplay are all so close to the original Oregon trail that you're going to have elementary school flashbacks. (Since they have such a sense of humor, clicking in-game buttons has a sound effect: the distinctive CLUNK of a IIe keyboard.) The one and ONLY one slight ding against it is the repair minigame, but you know, that's totally forgiveable. Just because it's not my cup of tea doesn't mean it was a bad design choice or really a problem with the game. Every game has a feature or two you're not particularly fond of. Tremendous replay value, practically guaranteed hilarity, and outstanding minigames. And, of course, dysentery.			"

												You should really play this game if you're a big fan of Oregon trail. I've only done a few runs and I can't decide if this is a ""must buy"" or not. The gameplay is quite lacking but it does carry a message behind it which I wont share. The zombie theme isn't doing the game much good but I guess its an alright theme. Its not a game for people who want a fast paced zombie survival game but instead some sort of reminder of what used to be the coolest thing ever.Buy this? I'd only buy this for adults who sometimes want to feel nostalgic but might need a change of theme. (If that makes any sense)			"
