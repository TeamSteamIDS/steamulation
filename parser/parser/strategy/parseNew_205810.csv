												After the failure of JA: Flashback, I came back to Crossfire to assure myself that not all JA after JA:2 were bad.And no, they were not. Crossfire (and it's predecessor) are good games.It maybe takes some time to get used to the new system (space stops time to let you plan your actions), but it works very well all in all.+ Combat is challenging+ a variety of weapons with different ammunition tomake the gun enthusiasts happy+ the graphic is quite okay for the time and the genre- the character portraits are awful, really awful- VoiceOvers are horrible (I could kill Fox over and over for that)I liked it back then and I still like it now, it is a new take on the JA franchise and it is not a bad one.

												I loved JA 1 and 2, so i bought JA:BIA.It grew up on me, ok. Not much like JA, but it's an ok game. But what really made me play the game for over 300 hours was not the difficulty.It was the bugs. An awful lot of them. And i don't mean cockroaches in boxes.Crossfire, is an expansion to that. A whole new lot of bugs, but a lot shorter campaign. And i mean a LOT shorter. I finished it in about half a dozen hours, with everyone hired, and every side quest finished.The rest of the play time was basically restarting missions or even the whole game because of... you guessed it.. bugs...And I didn't even get the bloody achievements, for some reason. From items that don't appear anywhere ( like the ring for two of the side missions ), gunshots that go through solid rock walls, guys that can head-shot my mercs from across the map , and my all time favourite: when telling my mercs to team up somewhere while crawlinga dn guard there, they decide to just keep on doing the horizontal mambo with each other. ""that's my spot"", ""no that's mine"".... Eternally. well, at least until they all get shot.Without all the bugs... it's still a really short game. A lot shorter than original jagged alliance: BIA.If they could only fix this, and make it decent in linux...			"

												Next BitComposer game on the same engine they used in the Back In Action. You can check my review on it there (http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/57740), if you are wondering how Back in Action connect with the previous titles, especially with the most praised and decorated Jagged Alliance 2.JA Crossfire is not taking us to Arulco. New country, now somewhere in Africa, but the drill remains the same – you are a leader of a mercs group, and you were hired to win a little domestic war, bring peace to the land… Well, but the sounding remained the same as well. For instance, if you hire a merc, he's saying something like ""see you in Arulco"". The devs certainly not overpaid for transferring parts of Jagged Alliance 2 into their games!The map of Arulco in the JA Back in Action was smaller than in the original. The map in JA Crossfire is only half of that we had in the JA BiA… Now you may finish the game on the 2-3 day of the game time, with all towns conquered (reads “liberated” in the western military slang).If you take that game as an add-on to Back in Action, in the bundle with “shades of red” and “point blank” DLCs, and with the price under 10 euros (75% discount) – only then it may count as somewhat fair deal. It is a new campaign, alright! Not the JA 3, but a new approach, so long-time-awaited! Still, I set the thumbs down, even agreeing that it’s a decent short game in the rather rare genre. What makes me so upset? Well, the bugs, of course! The moment when developers fix achievements (40% unobtainable now) and make quests in the game just a slightly more logically connected and polished – if that moment will ever comes, I’ll rewrite my review into praising one.Now, I just can say it is playable, but you don’t need to pay for this beta-release. Arrgh, hate those half-baked-offcuts on Steam, pretending, that they are complete games!Mark 5.5/10			"

												If you enjoyed ""Back in action"" you'll enjoy this more. if you thought back in action had afew too many problems, this is basically the same game but with alot of the issues patched. i also reccomend starting with only blood as your squad, he honestly works best alone and if you will level quickly like that, this should give you an easier start if you know how to sneak (The pistol isnt too loud even unsilenced, and you can ambush the enemies. just dont aim for the head, just the torso.) if you do that, the start should be fairly easy and you should be able to enjoy the game. if you go for a large squad of rookies that dont know what they're doing, you will find yourself screaming at the screen as your 5 guys get killed by one enemy, and the game will seem horribly unbalanced. so really, how you experience the game determines on who you start out with. blood was personally my top merc in BIA and crossfire, if you leave him as a solo squad, he is very versitile and levels quickly, and you can cap towns with him while hiring more mercs for permanent defense duty. after you do that, the game should go fairly well, once you figure out the mechanics. its a hard game to learn at first, think of it as the chess of the virtual world, easy to lose and misunderstand at first, but you love it and get better every hour you put into it. also, dont be afraid to restart the game, how you start determines your entire run, and losing a merc if you use a solo merc as your main rather than a full squad can be game-ending. that said, its a very under-rated game that can bring alot of fun to a patient man, and alot of pain to the players of modernday generic shooters. if you dont maind waiting an enemy out for afew minutes, this will be fine. if you're too impatient and need constant action, id suggest you pass on the whole JA series.

												Forewarning: this game has been abandoned by the developer, who is no longer in business.I bought it anyway because I thought it would be a decent expansion to Back in Action (BIA). Unfortunately it isn't. For the most part, the engine is the same, gameplay is more or less the same, but there are a few differences. Here's a list of points that I think are worth mentioning:1. The map is much smaller. In terms of sectors, it's maybe half or less than half of the sectors in BIA. 2. There are a few more mercs. The rival group M.E.R.C. merged with A.I.M. so there you get to choose from a few more but this doesn't really add much to the game. Although initially, you are so broke that some of the cheaper MERC soldiers can be useful. 3. Don't expect much, weapons-wise. 4. Money is hard to come by, early in the game. I had to take several sectors with just 2 mercs in my squad. As long as you have at least one medic and several first aid packs, you can heal after (or during) the battle.5. Travel everywhere is still on foot. This is so damned annoying, you just can't imagine. What I love about JA was the ability to move around by various means, not just by walking (which is stupid, not to mention slow). 6. There's often only one way to do things. e.g. if you have mines in front of you, you have to trigger them or defuse them, you can't blow them up (again, kind of stupid).7. My biggest peeve is, after you kill the head villain and take all the sectors, they make you start all over again (if you trigger the final quest) when ""reinforcements"" retake the harbor. SERIOUSLY?! And because you're halfway across the country, these reinforcements overrun several sectors before you can get into position -- meaning you have to plod through those sectors and re-take them ALL OVER AGAIN. Now this is just not how games or expansions should be designed. If you want breadth and depth, you make it a decent (larger) campaign with perhaps more side quests instead of getting the player to REPEAT what they've already done, just to increase replayability. That's just downright lazy.If you still don't mind all of this, I'd strongly suggest waiting till this game is dirt cheap before even thinking of buying it (think $2-$3). To me, Crossfire is a disappointing end to a lukewarm attempt at trying to recreate what was an outstanding game and franchise, Jagged Alliance.4.5/10			"

												What the hell is Jagged Alliance: Crossfire?Well, it's a turn based action, tactical game, similar to Commandos, Desperados, X-Com Series.... Once more you are in control of a Mercenary Organisation Killers for Hire :D, select your mercs carefully amongst many available to you, some will work well together others dispite each other so pick them accordingly. You mission (Campaign) if you accept it, is to liberate a country (somewhere in the Middle East) from a tyranic Warlord (terrorist, dictator, a threat to freedom...bla bla bla ), the country is divided into small regions which you have to free successively in order to gain access to the next region. Once liberated, the region will provide you with a monthly income to help you in your war effort...nothing is free...even freedom. You can then hire the local mob to protect the freshly liberated region, equiping them with guns, armors and training so they can eventualy repel attacks from the Warlord, in an attempt to recapture it.The concept looks interesting, but the implementations is terrible, game interface not intuitive at all, jerky characters, clunky movements, irresponsive commands (death guaranty during gunfights), dodgy enemy AI they see you coming from miles away even when you don't make any noises, some characters skills have apparently have absolutly no effects, enemies shoot at you from crazy angles in which you can't shoot back and many other annoying things like no way to accelerate time if not in World Map, team lose postions when you tab out of world map, 100 reloads because the game decided to save at stupid time, usualy just before i get crippled with enemy bullets.I finished the Game in over 30 hours, completing 90% of the side quests too short and too much frustrations to ever play it again. Shame really cose i kinda liked the concept.The game could have been so much better if devs have taken more care, no patch to fix many bugs.Also many achievements don't work.Overall, if you have Jagged Alliance 2 then stick with it, because JA crossfire isn't worth your time.

												I loved Jagged Alliance: Back in Action (as I did the old Jagged Alliance 2). The key is that you should not compare JA:BiA and JA:C to JA2 at all.The game is challenging. I played it at the highest difficulty with tactical mode on. I tend to save a lot (and reload a lot :P). Some people found the game extremely hard. Knowing what you do and frequent (separate) saves help this. Or you can play normal mode with tactical turned off.The game indeed has some flows (sometimes path findings is clunky or obstacles in your line of fire can be very disturbing), but all-in-all the game experience for me is great.If you like tactical games, and you're not afraid of a challenge this game is for you. Be warned, you better play JA:BiA first to learn the game mechanics (though it has /the same/ tutorial), as I really think this game is harder than the original one. For me it was a welcomed plus. :)There are new maps, new mercenaries (others have changes stats), new weapons (other weapons are missing). Now all the mercs are willing to work for you when the game starts, which is also a nice twist. People are complaining that they don't get some achievements. I am afraid that this is true, as I've checked, and I don't have the ""Bloody Snow"" achievement, though I've retrieved the suitcase full of money (about $40k) Others have been awarded. It is a bit sad as many of the achievements are linked with completion of quests. It would be really just notifying Steam about the achievement completion at the same time as they register the quest competed (which they do all right).Oh, and if you can get the game in a bundle, then don't miss out on it!

												First thing which get me into Jagged Alliance series when I tried it, and it was Jagged Alliance 2, was voice acting (Steroid - obvious inspiration and mocking of Arnold Schwartzenegger and roid guys, big, strong, stupid, you know), Dr. Q (stereotypical accent and B movie wise Chinese with proverbs), Ivan (stereotypical Russian accent, Communist, Steroid don't like Communists), Meltdown (remember George Constanza's bad date from Seinfeld or Howard's mom from TBBT?), Grizzly, Barry (stereotypical German accent), Fox (seductive voice), Grunty (look Barry, but funny) to name a few) which was incredible (example for anyone how should be done voice-over), beside somewhat complex gameplay (game is hard even on easy difficulty, at least for me), humourous, SF B-movie grade story to choose if you want it,  RPGish elements and interactions between different NPCs, immersive, it's like tactical Fallout 1 and 2.Sir-Tech knew their stuff.When I stumbled upon affordable box (about 13€ cheaper than on Steam) in store of JA ""remake"" or ""reboot"" of series, I was excited to see one of my favourite games with renewed graphics, how naive from me, because I was shocked by sterile, terrible voice acting, not to mention all those known mercenaries from previous series with lousy voice over. Yes, I read some reviews, looked up some gameplay, but it was more like skimming than detailed examination.This is a good game in its own right but it does not deserve carrying a name of legendary Jagged Alliance series.Jagged Alliance died with ""Unfinished Business"".I could recommend this game but not for fans of Jagged Alliance series made by Sir-Tech, if they expect gameplay and other little and subtle things mentioned above, which made those series classic and legendary.

												Jagged Alliance features a broken interface and that was enough to get me to stop playing. Good luck trying to figure out where you're being fired at from, good luck trying to figure out if all of your troops are doing as they're told (hint: they often don't and have no sense of self-preservation.) and good luck feeling immersed. Rarely have I seen an AI this unbelievably stupid, for some reason the AI does not seem to think it a priority to help out other AI when you're systematically murdering the lot. On top of that, the game drops you smack-down in the middle of a combat zone without you having a single clue as to what is going on. And why on earth can I not climb up buildings? I am fairly certain I was able to in Jagged Alliance 2.The whole experience just feels stunted. "

												Almost 130 hours spent on two back-to-back playthroughs says everything you need to know about this brilliant, maddening, flawed gem of a game.There is a trick to enjoying Crossfire. And that is trying very hard not to grumble throughout like some crazed octogenarian that ""it isn't Jagged Alliance 2"". Judge this game on its own merits. Try hypnosis, try alcohol, try beating yourself about the head, try anything to forget JA2 ever existed.Jagged Alliance 2? Never heard of it. There.The key combat mechanic - pausing the real time action to issue detailed orders - is spellbinding fun.Sure, the camera angles can be a pain, inventory management is clunky, and the cheating psychopath that passes for AI will produce regular howls of outrage.But none of this matters when you get to choreograph righteous carnage down to tenths of a second.Reminds me a bit of another game I liked...can't remember the name...

												An old one I had sitting in my library. Not the greatest of the Jagged Alliance series. Completed it back in 2012. Thought I'd go back and finish off the achievements. Ba Bow!The achievements are broken, whatever happened between now and 2012 has now made all the achievements, unachievable.From some of the forums I've found there are supposedly 9 that don't work, but I have found that none are now working.Also to note, in the game play you can zoom in and out but can't pan around. A total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if some goodies are under a walkway. You can see them but can't get them.Serve myself right I guess for going back on an achievement hunt.Although I didn't mind this game, I'm going to give it the thumbs down for the two reasons above.

												I could have looked past so many flaws in this game, even the terrible pathing problems (which are a big deal considering the plan and go combat system ) I really tried to like it, to justify spending actual money on it. No dice, uninstalled. The  game forces you into micromanaging every move, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, until you realize they've given you the ABSOLUTE WORST, MOST UNRESPONSIVE USER INTERFACE KNOWN TO MAN. If you tell me a right click will move my merc, I shouldn't have to click ten times to issue a command. If spacebar pauses, it should pause all, not most, of the time. My two year old follows commands better than this game. Frustration comes free in my life, I dont need to pay for it.			"

												Edit: I think I should mention that: I never finished the game. At the point, where my savegame was stuck on a map where the bots would insta snipe my mercs through walls, I knew I was doomed. It was a bug that would not go away, no matter how often I re-load up the game again. And my last save was like hours ago. So, that bug did not break the game for me, it ended it for me.This game ... where should I start? I would love to recommend it, because under the flawed, bugged, miserable game lies a decent strategy game that can be really great to play. I had great moments in my 13 hours of game time. Its a great feeling to plan every details of your assault and then watch it happen and - if you are lucky - succeed.But the bright side was just a small part of the game. The major part was frustration, reloading maps and correcting where the A.I. reaches its limits. There are so many downsides to this game that I decided to let it rest. I could overcome the missing merc creation feature. I could overcome the missing depth in the mercs characters. I could overcome the annoying UI. BUT I am sick of reloading a map that I cannot win, due to the fact that the enemy is simply broken. While I need to hit an enemy a dozen times, they tend to one-shot my mercs. They shoot my mercs through massive walls, cars, objects of your choice. They see my mercs through objects.. They shoot mercs they cannot see. One enemy killed my merc by hitting him with his riflestock through a wall. My mercs get killed because they cannot find a way to avoid colliding. If they collide during a firefight, they are goners. They will not find new waypoints to break free. Training milita is annoying, because all you can do is give them weapons you find. The list of flaws feels endless.Its annoying, nearly every part of this game is broken and annoying. Its like playing versus a bunch of hackers, while your mouse is broken and only half of your keys work. And then, beneath this pile of bugs, cheats, flaws, crap, lies a game that could have been awesome. A gorgeous little gem, massively covered in dirt.			"

												When I saw this on sale I went crazy and had to buy it. Since playing the early versions of jagged alliance I remember many hours of fun and enjoyment. I was similar at first with this game but the game is really really hard to beat. Its not simple and your opponents seem to somehow be much faster or better than you despite the fact you bought the most expensive weapons and armour. And even the best mercs tend to be almost impossible to hire early or middle of the game. I eventually had to forget about it since I was literally stuck and either that or start over. However, after awhile I went online and found out how to actually play this game. I then proceeded to replay the game and I actually started to make money and advance. The key is to use the pause and to direct fire to the enemies torso. Also is the importance of your characters stance. I finnally beat the game and was quite impressed. Also, I realized that there is a previous game to this one called ""back in action"" which I need to play.			"

												Maybe Unfortunately one of the best RPG's of its kind that can be played with windows 7. Definately the best Jagged Alliance that, once again can be played with windows 7 and once again 'sadly'. Tactics are farely simple but more advanced than most, one stratergy pretty well wins the game. Besides that quite fun, and dissapointing the game creaters never made one better.			"

												One of my favourite Strategy, Shooter games!!!I have spent many hours on Jagged Alliance Back in Action and Jagged Alliance Crossfire simply because they have the same engine, interface and are pretty much the same graphics. Crossfire is a standalone expansion that I have had a lot of issues with the main one being that when I leave the game (Alt and Tab or just going to the desktop using Windows Key and D) to do something and then go back to the game the screen is black and only the Cursor is showing.This problem is causing me to lose progress and take me away from the immersion of the game which is not very nice when your deep in a Strategy game trying to think of tactics to turn the battle in your favor.KIMBOF1's Score = 4/5Great game but could do with some bugs fixing !!

												For anyone who played the original Jagged Alliance installments, this is a huge jump forward.  I've heard plenty of complaints about poor voice acting and terrible headshots of the recruits, blah, blahhh.  Seriously, if you enjoy a turn-based quasi real time strategy game with a squad element then you should enjoy this.  I have played first person shooters where you couldn't go prone, this game you can ready your weapon (basic stand and aim) crouch to move silently, go prone to crawl or improve aim - oh yeah, and run right after you hear the click and plop of a grenade landing amongst your squad.Granted, it's not for everyone, nothing is.  If you like having a party and entering combat with a modern arsenal, scavaging and exploring for weapon and food caches, being able to control the flow of combat afforded in a turn-based environment...then yes, this is for you.  I stongly suggest playing ""Back In Action"" first.Enjoy!			"

												First I'd like to state that I'm not very familiar with the orginal JA series. My experiance JA started with Back In Action and as I understand it, it differs from the originals greatly. That being said, I really did enjoy Back in Action. JA: Crossfire plays exactly the same as the Back in Action era. It's all about taking over strategic points one at a time, managing resource, hiring militia and etc. There is a fair amount of bugginess to the game such as character response or shots that just don't make sense, but nothing that truely renders the game unplayable. At the time of this review I'm 30+ hours in and I got to say I've enjoyed it. I can't say I think the replay value is high, but it's personally not a game I'll forget about once I'm done with it. The biggest issues for me is the price and broken achivements. If you're thinking of playing this, pick it up on sale. The current 20 dollar price tag just isn't worth it. It's a fun game, but I'd only be willing to drop 5-8 bucks on it. The achievements being broken isn't a super big deal to me, but may be the deal breaker for many. I've had one or two unlocked so far, when I should have had far more by now. I've read that some others have had this problem as well.So overall, great game if you're into the newer JA series, but be prepared for some bugs here and there.			"

												I highly recommend this game as long as the 'realistic rebalance mod' by Killatomate is installed. It improves the game a great deal and my comments refer to the game with mod. There are only 2 major things  that bother me about the design.  The first is the militia. They are useless. Without militia you are forced to bounce back and forth between areas to retake them from the enemy. Again and again ad infinitum. You desperately need more mercs but money is too scarce. Of course you can do this until you save up enough money to buy mercs but it would take a long, long time  and I got tired of taking the same areas over again. My second gripe is the aiming timer. When you click on an enemy to fire at him you see a timer start letting you know how long it will be before your man actually fires. It is only a few seconds but that is long enough for your target, who has either no timer or a very short one,  to shoot you dead. Outside this is not much of a problem but in a building it is. Close combat is heavily weighted in favor of the AI. Your target will almost always spot you and fire while your timer is running regardless of your high stealth stat. Armor is very expensive and wears out quickly so you die and reload a save.Again. In spite of this I did enjoy the game very much. Graphics are very good. Pathfinding is good. Weapons, skills etc. all good. The quests are a nice idea and give you some much needed money.  If it weren't for the 2 points mentioned above I would rate this game right up there close to JA2. There are many more pros and a few cons I didn't mention but this game is certainly worth it at this price.			"

5/10I really, really wanted to like this game.Let me start with the good stuff so you can see that this was a worthy effort.When the game started up it felt like JA2. The look and feel, the music, all well done (even though I prefer the music in JA2, but that might be nostalgia).I liked:- The graphics- The Guns- The locations- The Music- The mechanics (mostly, getting to that)- Stability. I did not have one crash No for the bad stuff I disliked:- Artificial experience duration enhancers in general- Not having enough money to build a squad- Suicide Knife Joes- The way militia works in this game- No difficulty settingsI also would like to add this: If you are running on a tight budget, be it time or money and you fear your game will not be as good as it could be:Add an instant modding kit, aka cheats. Most of my frustration with this game could ave easily been solved with some basic cheats. Spoilers from here on out as I will go into some detailFirst bump in the road: I do not get to create my own Merc via Psycho-Test? Man, I loved that feature. Added so much to the game. Sad. But ok, let's see the Mercs. Ah, they have A.I.M., cool, all the guys I know are in there and...strangely look all the same. Well, that's graphic engines for you, some can do different faces, some (like this one) cannot. Second bump: Huh? I was hired for a fish-taco and two apples? Why am I starting with basically no money at all? As it turned out this is likely one of the ""artificial experience duration enhancers"" this game sports. The lack of money makes no sense in the game world, but keeps you from finishing this game in 4 hours, which otherwise would be very likely possible.You have to start with two Mercs. You only have money fro one mid-level or two low-level Mercs. So for me that meant: Going with two Mercs that can't do much. But it’s only the beginning of the game, right?First battleSo without further ado, without any more money and without any decent Mercs or equipment: Here we come.The battle itself I can best describe in a sequence of emoticons: :-),:-D,°-°, 0_0, :-|, :-(, :-), :-(((While I was able to win the first battle it was surprisingly difficult. I checked for a setting for that: There is none.So after the first battle I knew that I was in for a much harder game than JA2. With the hard restrictions on Money and the questionable tactical design ideas of this game, keeping my two Mercs alive was a real challenge. I guess some people like challenges in games. I only do if they are not stupid. This one was.Tactical AftermathSo, after the battle I spend some time thinking about what went wrong. I barely kept my Mercs alive, some civilians died and I wasn't able to salvage anything useful from my enemies or the Harbor itself. Why?Maybe it's the mechanics?No Quick Save / LoadThis one really bugged me. For a game that basically requires you to save and load every 5 seconds not having a quick save and load option seems unreasonable.No saving during combatNow THIS was bad. Combat is only ended after you killed everyone who wants to do battle with you. In a location like the harbor this means loosing half an hour of game time if you round a corner and are shot. I am sorting this under ""artificial experience duration enhancers"" as it adds nothing to the game but need to redo things you already did. Twice. Hit likelinessOther than in JA2, you do not have real rounds but rather a pause mode (which I did not think was bad). Therefore you do not have Action Points anymore and cannot define how much time your Merc shall put into aiming. (This is really sad as it enhanced the tactical options a lot)So now Instead of a nice ""12"" in a yellow circle in the middle of a red circle I get things like ""Likely to hit"". No numbers, just encouraging words. So what does this mean?For my first raid on he Harbor I came back with the following cheat-sheet:Likely: 25%Highly Likely: 50%Certain: 75%So basically you will usually not hit with ~50% of your bullets. Which is bad, as bullets are expensive and you are living on your parents pocket money.Also you only have two Mercs. Your enemies AI is...well, it's not. The main tactic your enemy will use is ""rush them with numbers"".Which works well, as you only have two Mercs and most of the time flip through collected handguns as you run out of Ammo.Suicide-Knife-JoeBut that's not all. I think I could handle that better, but there was that traumatic moment I call ""Suicide-Knife-Joe"".If you remember the Suicide-Bombers from Serious Sam: That's what I'm talking about.You hunker down, take your aim and are ready for a firefight, but you fail as you brought an automatic sub-machine gun to a knife fight - And the knife always wins.Suddenly Suicide-Knife-Joe, who has no regard for his own life appears and starts running straight at you. You may have a chance to survive this, if he's far of and you tell your two Mercs to empty everything they have at him, but otherwise he will storm through your bullet storm, take his knife and end you - with one hit.I blame most of the civilian deaths on me using grenades to stop Suicide-Knife-Joe.Oh, and you don't have knifes. Knifes are for pros. Portal of dropped gunsA lot of games have employed this, including the original JA and JA2. Your enemies have rifles and SMGs, you can see that and boy, you feel that.However, when they die they will leave things like...shoes, T-Shirts, Beer cans, Ammo for weapons you don't have.Their guns disappear into the Portal of dropped guns. Fortifying your positionAlright, stop your whining and settle down. You now control a HARBOR, let's make sure you stay there. Knowing how things worked in JA2 I assumed there would be a way to train militia and I was right. However in this case ""train"" means"" equip with one of the not-dropped guns"".The way this works deserves some detail, as it will become one of your biggest problems going forward and is one of the biggest ""artificial experience duration enhancers"".So you cannot simply tell your Mercs to ""train militia"", you need two things:1. Guns2. People who are ready to be Militia.The second part is actually the bigger issue, as you can gather and buy guns for militia, even though it's unnerving.There is, however, a big issue with none signing up to your rally.There are some locations with high value (like the Hydroponic power plant) which are rather hard to capture with just two Mercs with handguns and where you will find no more than 5 people ready to defend them.Which is not enough to hold the place against the enemy. Basically training Militia in these locations is a waste of time and money. Just keep your Mercs running between them to defend them, thus delaying your attack on the next target indefinitely. Thus ""artificial experience duration enhancers"".Thoughts for the futureI did not get past that phase. Running back and froth with my two Mercs I managed to capture the Power Plant, a small village with ruins and some houses along the road in the south.With the power plant secured things started to look up as I was finally making some money. A few weeks of this and I could hire Shadow! Yet, it wasn't to be. The enemy send wave after wave of increasingly well equipped teams of 6-9 guys against my power plant and once I had to send my second Merc back for ammunition and they attacked I had to loose. Simply no way for one single Merc (and the 5 Militia guys that died in the first 15 Seconds) to hold them of. So, after 14 hours of play I am uninstalling Jagged Alliance Crossfire. Maybe I'll do a quick sweep for the music, but that's it.  "

												I've had this game for a long time, but it has been sitting on the shelf.  I finally completed this game and now it is review time.  I still play Jagged Alliance 2 1.13 from time to time, so I am a seasoned JA player.  I also liked Back in Action, it was a refreshing modernization of Jagged Alliance, and I could only wish the developer took more time developing and polishing THAT game.  Then out comes Crossfire.  You would think that this stand alone addon would overhaul some aspects of this game that fell flat with BIA...but...*kerplunk*.  This game still has bugs, even with the rebalance mods that say they fixed it.  This game is years old and out of development, and the mod community is pretty much dead.  So newcomers beware.The character interactions are still terrible.  AI pathfinding is terrible.  AI strategy is too easy, just set up firing lines or ambushes and watch the dummies fall for your diversion every time, which is the same problem BIA had.  Increasing skill level only makes the enemy soldiers more bullet proof and you more bullet prone.  The story was terrible too.  The game wanted to feel like Afghanistan / Tibet, but the map was small and uninteresting.  For a JA game, it is short.  A decent player can finish in 12-16 hours, much quicker if you keep pushing your mercs to the limit.  The ending was garbage.  Just some flyers and weird colors that made me feel woozy and horribly written English.  The game was made by Germans, and they don't bother trying to use proper gramar, spell correctly, or match NPC text to speech.  Quite frankly, it's lazy.  The whole game had great potential, but it's obvious they had to cut corners and rush because of budget constraints.PROS:-You can finish the game.-Some fun tactical gun battles every now and again.-No CTDs in my play thru....-More maps to fight in-Feels like a JA type gameCONS:-I got weird video/monitor flicker playing on some maps.  Like, the video turned off and on.  My computer crashed once playing this game.  Unsure if it was me or them.-Broken quests-Grenade Launchers blow up your merc 90% of the time.  Like, standing in an open field and aim the weapon down range, and your merc blows up.-English localization is awful-Game needs the rebalance mod to be 95% playable-Story and characters are uninteresting-Maps aren't all that great.  The Harbor (first level) is a good map.  The other maps feel empty.-The game just feels rushed.Summary:If you absolutely love JA, and really liked Back in Action, you probably have this game already, but if you don't, try to get the game as cheap as you can.  It's old, unsupported, and not a complete game.  It's still fun to play if you are a diehard tactical combat fan.			"
