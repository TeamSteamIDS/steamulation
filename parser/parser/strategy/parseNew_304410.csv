												Help. I'm 8161 puzzles in and i can't stop. This is like minesweeper, but better. No randomness, way better mechanics, unlimited replayability. It's all about logic and stuff. Just the right level of challenge for me. I'm way too hooked. Also each puzzles takes me 1-4 mins. Just woke up? Time to sneak in one puzzle. Queueing up for LoL and nothing to do? Sneak in another few puzzles. Some one save me.Edit 24/09/2016: 10 000 infinite puzzles finally.http://imgur.com/a/NiiFCEdit: Cons: After you've gotten the hang of the game, it's not challenging anymore. In the infinite puzzles you can make as many mistakes as you like, no penalties, and if you solved them it's still considered completed. It's up to you to challenge yourself to make no mistakes and/or speedrun. But it's still very addictive. Minesweeper kind of addiction.			"

												Hexcells Infinite offers more of the same logic puzzle awesomeness that you find in the rest of the Hexcells series. If you were just going to get one of the trilogy, this would be the one I'd recoomend. The random and daily seed puzzles, plus the level editor and ability to download and share custom puzzles gives this third title in the series a replayability that the first two Hexcells games can't touch.I was a little hesitant in picking this up at first, since I found the difficulty jump between Hexcells and Hexcells Plus a bit daunting and couldn't imagine a similar jump in complexity between Plus and Infinite, but fortunately that wasn't the case. I found the difficulty level overall in Hexcells Infinite to be somewhere in between that of the first two titles. The game is a challenge, but not a frustration.I do still recommend the entire series, as it's one of the best puzzle games I've found on Steam (or elsewhere), but if your budget is limited, Hexcells Infinite offers the most for your money.

												Day 1: Just finished the game. Man, that was challenging. Hey, what's this? An infinite mode? Let me try it out...Day 2: These randomly generated puzzles are great, I'm having a blast.Day 5: Still playing this infinite mode. Maybe I should stop.Day 24: Had a nightmare where I couldn't figure out the solution to a Hexcells puzzle and had to guess. I woke up in a cold sweat.Day 57: Didn't...didn't I have a job and a life at some point? I think I did. Oh well, onto puzzle 1172.Day 133: I can solve forever...Day 376: My debate skills have dramatically improved. Every conversation now appears to me as a hex puzzle, with all the branching paths, dead ends and subtle nuances of social interaction reduced to pure rules and numbers. It's beautiful.Day 804: I have finished my prototype for four-dimensional Hexcells. Within this game will lie the answer to everything.Day 2755: My God, it's full of cells...Seriously though, buy this game "

												The Hexcells series are my favorite puzzle games.  It's true that minesweeper is an easy comparison, but also unfair, as it would be to compare a modern car to a Model T.  A bit of math, much more logic, an infinite puzzle generator, and you've got yourself a puzzle game that will last forever!  Buy it now!DISCLAIMER:  Forever is a really, really long time, and you won't be around to see it.  Rest assured though, that whoever is around will be able to enjoy Hexcells forever!  Just not you.

												This thing is intense and a marked improvement over its predecesor.  The packaged puzzles are mind-bendingly difficult.  I've played for six hours and I'm only 50% of the way through the game.However, there's also an ""infinate"" mode -- where you can use a random number generator (or today's date) to create a puzzle that is less imposing but still a lot of fun.  This adds the replayability that was missing from the first title.All told: I found it very enjoyable and recommended for anyone who likes Minesweeper, crosswords, and other such puzzles.			"

												Simply the best number matching puzzle game of them all.The generated puzzles are inevitably not a patch on the hand-crafted ones, but even there you can find the occasional gem.  The main puzzles are brilliant, with a gradual (though much steeper than previous versions) difficulty progression.All three Hexcells games are excellent.  New players should definitely play them in order (Hexcells, Plus, Infinite) to get the most enjoyment out of them though.			"

												The third and most likely final sibling in the Hexcells family, Hexcells Infinite, like its title suggests, provides an infinite game experience: in addition to another set of 36 hand-crafted levels, it includes a random puzzle generator!The hand-crafter levels are about as difficult as the ones in Hexcells Plus, or marginally easier (either that, or I'm just getting better at solving them.) I regret that only one of them provides special instructions (in this case ""each column contains an odd number of blue cells"") as I feel more of them would benefit the challenge variety. This absence is also partially responsible for the scarcity of satisfying ""aha"" moments, when several clues combine beautifully into a challenging part of the solution. Previous games had me complaining about the puzzles' less than perfect elegance: you usually have quite more clues than you really need. This is still a problem, even if it's now marginally less severe than it was. Another issue, especially for newcomers, is that nowhere in the instructions does the game direct your attention to the box at the top left corner, containing the number of yet undiscovered blue cells, even though it's an essential information for many of the puzzles. All of that didn't stop me from enjoying the 36 puzzles and feeling a real satisfaction each time I could perfect one. They are more missed opportunities than mortal sins.The real attraction of Hexcelles Infinite, of course, is the randomly generated levels. There are 100 millions of them, so there is no risk of running out before growing completely tired of Hexcells. You can let the computer choose or you can specify a seed yourself, so it's easy to share a level with your friends . There is an option to use the date as a seed as well, and have a ""puzzle of the day"", but don't expect a leaderboard for it, Ã  la Spelunky. The real question is this: ""Are the randomly-generated puzzles as good as the hand-crafted one?"" Predictably, the answer is no. Mainly because the elegance issue, that I mentioned above, is considerably worse. Random levels are chock-full of redundant clues, and lack any kind of the symmetry that makes a puzzle attractive. I find that a real shame, as it shouldn't be too difficult to devise an algorithm that gets rid of some of the redundancy, and maybe couple it with a difficulty setting. Are the random puzzles good enough to sustain interest? Your mileage may vary, depending on whether you play casually, or seriously. ""Serious"" players will lament the low difficulty. Most of them took me less than 4 minutes and I've yet to find one that I couldn't solve in less than 10. But that may be exactly what you're looking for, and as a way to relax and pass a bit of time, the random puzzle generator is serviceable. Nevertheless, my impression is that those that enjoy the kind of challenge offered by the 36 main levels, will find the random ones too trivial for their taste.Audio-visually, Hexcells Infinite is identical to its predecessors. You get the same white, blue and yellow colours, the same menu presentation, the same ambient soundscapes... It's all very nice and stylish, but a bit of variety, like selectable visual themes, for example, would have been welcome.Hexcells Infinite is the best Hexcells yet. It feature another 36 good, difficult puzzles and the random number generator has the potential to satisfy your need for casual puzzle solving during a great many hours.			"

												Ever played Minesweeper but ended up annoyed at the random element, being able to lose at any point because the 'puzzle' presented can't be solved using logic alone?Fear not, the Hexcells series is here to save you.As each game in the series will occupy you roughly three times as much as the one before it, this with its fabulous random-generated jolly puzzling (including forum threads where people list RNG seeds they found particularly difficult, enjoyable, easy, quick, whatever you want...) is by far the most value your money can get. Worth it even at the full $5 price; unbeatable value when on sale.It's also an extremely good game to 'local co-op' with any family members you have at hand.Rating: GET DIS! "

												One of the best puzzle games ever. Really makes you think. It's similar to Minesweeper that comes with Windows but much more complex. There were new ways to think about the puzzle added from Hexcells to Hexcells Plus and now even more into Hexcells Infinite. The reason this third release beats the previous games a million times over is the infinite play. You can endlessly generate random puzzles, making the game endlessly replayable. Puzzles are short, taking anywhere from 1:30 to 15:00 minutes depending on complexity, so it's a nice way to kill a short bit of time. There's not much else to say. The background music is relaxing. The game is easy to learn but still pushes you to think through each puzzle. And you can't beat a $5 price tag. I didn't even wait for a sale on this one after playing the previous games. No regrets.			"

												After a couple of hours playtime, I can honestly say that the game is everything I was hoping for.If you didn't like the first two installments, don't bother with this one either since it didn't bring anything new to the table gameplay-wise when compared to Plus. It's essentially an ultimate version with some _really_ hard levels, where you can stare at the board for ten minutes at a time before you have deduced the next possible step.The logic involved seems to me to be a bit more advanced than in Plus sometimes. There are for example more occasions, in which the puzzles require counting the remaining blues and determining by addition of unsaturated column-restrictions and number-blocks, that there is no possible way that some unrelated  cells could be anything other than blacks (or blues), often giving you the decisive hint to complete the puzzle.I'm three levels short of completing the game, but will pause for now, since it's getting late and sleeping during work hours is for some reason frowned upon at my job. But the level-generator is certainly great for long-term motivation and I can see myself going back to it every now and again, even if the resulting puzzles don't seem to be as challening or clever than the hand-made ones.In terms of presentation, little has changed compared to Hexcells Plus. Wouldn't have needed to anyway, in my opinion. Saving puzzles is nice though when you're stuck, and as someone who enjoys watching tv-shows or listening to music while playing, the option to turn off music and sound separately is great and much appreciated.In conclusion: Truly good successor with very well designed puzzles and another difficulty-increase. The level-generator is the icing on the cake, I recommend this game to every puzzle-fan. Though if you've never played any hexcell-game, you might as well start with Plus (or even the original, which I've personally found a bit too easy, but still makes an excellent tutorial to the series). Just play them all in order, and continue playing infinite for the random-puzzles once you're done with the handcrafted levels! :)			"

												Sequel to Hexcells and Hexcells Plus, Hexcells Infinite is more of the same in a similar package and with fairly similar ambient musical theme and abstract graphics. This is in no way a bad thing.Like in the originals, the game mechanics are simple but interesting: you have to find out whether all the hexes within the puzzle are blue or black with rules similar to Mine Sweeper and Hanjies. Baseline is that you can always deduce everything: no guessing is required. Though guessing is not punished either. Nevertheless, you need a near-perfect streak to acquire most achievements.The mechanics have not changed at all after the originals: black hexes contain a number that states how many hexes around it are blue, and blue ones might contain a number stating how many hexes in a two-hex radius are blue. In addition there are Hanjie-like column-numbers that state how many blue hexes are there in a given line.All 36 puzzles are new, so the owners of the original ones will be pleased. The difficulty curve is a bit steeper than in the original Hexcells but little less than in Hexcells Plus. In effect, it is great as a stand-alone title requiring no knowledge of the two games from before. For me it took 8 hours to complete all 36 hand-crafted puzzles.Thankfully, saving within a puzzle has finally been provided! I have to wonder why it wasn't featured in the originals. The other new, much-sought after feature are the random-generated puzzles that add a ridiculous amount of replayability: you provide a random number seed and the level is generated, there being supposedly 2 billion levels. Unfortunately, I found the random levels frankly uninspiring and underwhelming in difficulty when compared to the original puzzles. Curiously, the way the random seed is provided introduces a social feature: you can post the coolest random levels (i.e. their seeds) to public forums for others to try. With so many random levels, there are bound to be some gems in the flock discovered only by trying.With Hexcells Infinite, I'd wager this kind of puzzle game has pretty much been perfected as a concept. I would certainly welcome there being more of these cleverly crafted and well-designed puzzles. The graphics are as perfect as they can be for an abstract game and the ambient music fits the abstract theme splendidly.If you already played and enjoyed Hexcells and Hexcells Plus, this game is a must-buy. Otherwise I'd really recommend either Hexcells or Hexcells Infinite for their balanced difficulty curves.			"

												Some of the reviewers have said that this game requires you to make guesses. At first I thought this was the case too, but on my second playthrough I realized that every level is in fact doable with only logic (no guessing). These ones are a lot trickier than Hexells, but if you like that game then you should definitely attempt Hexcells Infinite.New to Hexcells Infinite is the ability to randomly generate puzzles. This offers literally infinite combinations of time-killing puzzles, however they are not as challenging as the real puzzles.			"

												After 20 hours of gameplay, I have completed the game, made more than 5 levels in the level editor, and won +100 randomly generated levels, and perfected every single level (the other hours are there because someone else is playing on slot 2), all I can say: this game is one of the best puzzle games i've played.Remember when you thought that Hexcells Plus was hard? Ha, Hexcells Infinite just laughs at that.The puzzles are so well made and most of the time you'll stare at your screen for a good 10 minutes until you see what you have to do for the next step, and often it turns out to be the most simple thing, the game hides its clues very well in the least obvious way possible, so I really recommend playing the first two games before this one to get you ready, but before you do that, i'll let you know, that no matter what, there is no need to guess in all of the Hexcells games at all, so try to think twice before you make your next move!And now, the new stuff! Randomly generated levels, I find them pretty enjoyable, they are all possible without guessing, which is impressing! The only problem I have with them is that they are kind of ""too easy"" compare to Hexcells Infinite levels, but I don't blame the creator for that, they are still very enjoyable to solve. And the last thing left, the level editor, yes you heard me, a LEVEL EDITOR, everyone likes level editors (Ri.. right??), however, the level editor does not come with the game and needs to be downloaded from the Steam Community, but I didn't really mind that, the level editor also has an auto-solver that tries to solve your puzzles to make sure they are 100% possible without guessing, and I find that neat, the editor is fun to mess around with, and will sure give you a few hours of enjoyment. And now for my final opinion:Hexcells Infinite is a MUST for any puzzle fan, it's great, fun, cheap, and has a great replay value because of the randomly generated levels and the level editor.*If you liked Hexcells Infinite you may also like:*- Hexcells and Hexcells Plus.- Squarecells.

												Hexcells Infinite is probably the absolute puzzle game in the Hexcells series (Hexcells, Plus). It feels like a new version of the previous two with new levels and a random generator for even more levels. Since this feels like a refresh of the series I will copy/paste elements from my review of the previous two and build upon them.Hexcells is a fairly simple game, much of it employing a combination of mechanics from minesweeper and nonograms (Picross) on a non standard 2D grid. It is a logic game were rules of the levels are defined by numbered brackets (minesweeper style) that give information on whether nearby brackets are false or true. This is sometimes mixed in with column markers that do the same, but for a column (picross style). To deepen the gameplay a bit more, you are sometimes also presented with special rules beside the numbers which frankly, in my humble opinion, make minesweeper look like a joke.The base levels start easy enough but the difficulty curve steeps beyond what was comfortable in the first game yet stays bellow the hellish fires of Hexcells Plus. This time round we are presented with a random level generator which definitely extends the game but sadly does not escape the dredge facing all random generated content. Even though Hexcells level are simple, they always feel like it is you against the designer. Where the designer tried fooling you with level symmetry, hiding some emotion in the puzzles. In contrast, random generated levels feel cold and somewhat uninviting. It's not a dealbreaker by any means but I would have opted for community designed level sharing instead.As with previous games, It kept me coming back. Infinite is challenging and fun. Cheap and as long as you'd like it to be. Took me 13 hours to get 100% achievements but I have 999,999,940 levels to go.			"

Minesweeper V34.0 - 10/10Introduction:Imagine Hexcells Infinite as a modern version of Minesweeper, only with hexcells, an increased difficulty and well thought out new game mechanisms. You don't need to have played the previous Hexcells games before (count me in), but it's the first Hexcells game, which includes a random puzzle generator, if I'm not mistaken. Therefore the prior titles are obsolete and Hexcells Infinite could be all you need. The objective is similar to Minesweeper: identify all blue fields (bombs) and reveal the whole stage. The hexcells themselves and the new game mechanisms like indicators, which will reveal, how many blue fields are widespreaded in one straight line or how many have to be in a certain area and in which order (in sequence or detached), are great innovations and can deliver a great and satisfying challenge for your brain, especially in huge levels, where you can easily loose the overview and have to count a lot. On average most levels can be solved in 7-20 minutes.The game has 2 modes: chapter mode (6 chapters with 6 levels per chapter) and infinite mode (generate random levels (8 digit seed number), share your level by sharing your seed number, import seed numbers from friends or simply use the date of the day as seed number)Pro:easy to learn, hard to master without doing one single mistakeno gameover if you've done a mistake (BUT you have to replay the whole level, if you want to gain 100% in every level and the related achievement)no time limit (time will still be logged)relaxing and zenlike atmosphere/music36 challenging predefined levels plus random puzzle generator = more puzzles than you will ever play, probablythe random generated levels can be shared with other peopleextremely addictingvery high replayabilitymid-level saving possiblepriceNeutral:you could get the ambition to punch someone or destroy something, if you did an unwary turn (again) and have to repeat the same level (again) for perfection (that's no contra, because difficulty is an essential part of logic games, but still....AAAARGH)Contra:surprisingly nothingConclusion:Hexcells Infinite is the perfection of an ancient logic puzzle game, simple as that. It's another useful game for a healthy brain workout and I have absolutely nothing to complain about. If you've played Hexcells or Hexcells Plus before and liked it, but you've missed a random puzzle generator, then here it is, the true INFINITE version! It's no problem, if you haven't played Hexcells before. You can learn it easily and have a great time staring at your screen until your eyes pop out of your head. The random puzzle generator guarantees a very high replayability and endless fun. You can get a lot of entertainment for a very fair price. Absolutely recommendable for logic puzzle lovers.

												The Hexcells series (Hexcells, Hexcells Plus and now Hexcells Infinite) has been an incremental polishing of a strong concept. The game base mechanics feel like a mix between Sudoku and the old Microsoft Minesweeper.One difference should be pointed out, though: Sometimes in Minesweeper, you would end up having to guess, because with the information available to you, there were more than one possible solution. Not so in Hexcells. There's always enough info to get you one step further. You just have to be able to process the information properly. Don't get me wrong - there are times when I've been completely stuck. Some of the later pre-made levels are monstrously tough to do flawlessly. The fact that you know it's all down to you and your abilities though, makes it more of a challenge and less frustrating.The ways the information about the board is communicated to you, has been one of the primary points of evolution in the series. To my mind, the developer has been extraordinarily clever in devising new ways give you hints. If you haven't played the earlier games, the major difference for you as a player, is that the boards are much more varied in this version, simply due to the developer having more tools available to play with. The earlier games are good, but this version truly shines.This latest iteration is called Infinite for a reason, though. He has finally been able to make a level generator, which only needs an 8-digit seed to produce a board. That means if you really want to, there are 100,000,000 boards to play. It's not really infinite, but for all intents and purposes, it might as well be. One of the fun things about this level generator, is that it gives you the possibility to challenge other players to complete the same boards as you do. All you have to do is tell them the seed for that board.In short, if you're a fan of abstract, number-type puzzles, this game should keep you occupied for quite some time.			"

												I bought the game because it sounded interesting and I'm a lot more willing to buy games now that I can refund if I don't like it. I tried it out and thought it was great, played it for a little bit, then went to bed. The next day, I look at steam and am surprised to see it says ""You have played 100 minutes""I was genuinely stunned - those 100 minutes flew by so damn fast, I swear I thought I had only played for like 15-20 minutes.If you like logic based puzzle games with clear rules, this is a must have.  Think minesweeper but set up such that you NEVER have to guess. You can always figure out the solution without guessing in any way, like sudoku. Sure, you CAN guess then just remember what the answer was, restart, and pretend like you figured it out with no mistakes, but the way you SHOULD play this game is to never ever click anything unless you are 100% certain you're right. It's much more entertaining and satisfying this way.Additionally, it's all broken up into fairly small, bite-sized levels, so you can spend just 10 minutes playing while waiting for something and still get through a level or two. Of course you can also do what I did and spend almost two hours playing without even realizing time is passing by...			"

												I read the (few) negative reviews because I was curious what could cause someone to vote negatively.  Most of the negative reviewers were down voting because they felt cheated that the ? cells forced them to guess.  Truth is that if I had to guess I would likely feel cheated as well.  Here's the thing:If you are guessing, you're doing it wrong.Hexcells is not about guessing.  You can complete every puzzle without guessing.  That has been my experience.  I have completed all three games (less two puzzles at the end of the third that I'm still struggling with), plus nearly a hundred on inifite.  Mind you, there are some puzzles that you have to spend a whole bunch of time trying to bend the logic to your will, but...That's the point, right?The question mark cells simply don't tell you anything not to force you to guess, but to keep the level of challenge up.  Which, IMO, I think is just about perfect.  Great job devs.tl;drNo guessing or cheating necessary.  Whole-heartedly recommend.Edit from six months later:  I have now completed all the puzzles in the main games, and over three hundred puzzles in the infinite mode.  Still looking for one where I have to guess.  In my top five favorite games of all time.			"

												A fun and challenging logical puzzle game similar to MineSweeper.Using the numbers to work out which tiles to mark.The big difference between Hexcells and Minesweeper is that you never need to guess at any point, there's always a way to work out where to click.Also, numbers can be shown on the outside of the grid and show a different symbol with the number to tell you how the tiles you need to mark are laid out.Unlike Hexcells and Hexcells Plus, Hexcells Infinite has a random level generator in which will allow you to play new puzzles all the time.It's also possible to make your own and share them with others or try theirs out.If you wish to save a bit of money then I suggest only buying HexCells Infinite due to the fact you can play an 'infinite' amount of levels giving you many more hours of playtime.

												Think minesweeper + picross and add a few more interesting rules in there. It's VERY fun.Many reviews say that some guesswork is required, but that is NOT true. Every single level can be completed without guessing (even the procedurally generated ones), and I suppose that simply speaks for the difficulty of the puzzles.			"

 Mine Sweeper x Picross = Hexcells? What would happen if Mine Sweeper and Picross had an affair after a few too many drinks?Hexcells would happen...Tired of Mine Sweeper's randomness?Not satisfied by Picross's excessive thinking?Hexcells takes the best of both worlds, and combines it in an easy way:no more gambling with weirdly placed mines, yet sometimes you might need to carefully analyze the board before clicking a hexagon... although here you won't die by misclicking.Compared to the other two Hexcells games, Infinite adds a level generator, bringing a million new levels.

												A brilliant puzzle game! If you play it properly and not just by clicking random cells until you finish it, then it is superb.In order to get the best out of this game (and in my opinion the only way to play it) you should challenge yourself to not make one single move if you are not 100% sure about it. As many have said before; the puzzles are supposed to be solved without having to guess or be in doubt whether the cells should be blue or not, so do not guess, do not think ""hm, maybe this should be blue"", ""this is probably right"" or anything along these lines. If you are not completely sure, then do not click. Improvements have been made since the last two games. One is that you can save your puzzles and then go back later and finish them (which is what I recommend you to do if you get stuck. Take a break, go do something else and then come back later and you will see new per,c  that you did not see before. It is so easy to get stuck focusing too narrowly on one area or staring blindly on a spot that might already be solved). The other thing is that a random puzzle generator has been added. Although the random puzzles are easy and does not require much effort and thinking they are still addictive! It is very relaxing to solve them and great if you just want to wind down a little bit. If you are already a fan of minesweeper or sudoku, then you will LOVE this game. Hexcells is the perfect mix between those two. In conclusion; I cannot recommend this game enough! I loved the first two ones, Hexcells and Hexcells Plus, and now with this one having a random puzzle generator just makes it the ultimate puzzle game.			"

												Hexcells Infinite: it's still the solid puzzle game I keep pointing out in Hexcells/Hexcells Plus, but this time it's on a slightly tighter engine and it comes with an ""Infinite"" mode where, in addition to the usual 36 handmade levels, there's now a seed-driven set of ""infinite"" puzzles you can go through. It literally turns the game into hex-grid Minesweeper. I will probably never uninstall this because of that. It's still only $5. HOP ON THIS GAME.			"

												Worth the asking price.  The premade puzzles can be quite challenging, especially the later ones.  For me, the real value is in the 'infinite' random levels, where they aren't nearly as hard -- the difficulty of these is usually right on the mark for me.  1500 puzzles later and 100+ hrs into this, I can confidently recommend this 'game'.  I play a few puzzles with my morning coffee now, the way some people work on jumbles or a crossword puzzle.Also, IMO, you don't need the entire collection of Hexcells games.

												Is Minesweeper a big thing for you? Do you enjoy cracking puzzles using logic? Do you want an endless amount minesweeper inspired logic puzzles that require 0% guessing and 100% pure thought to solve? Well Hexcells Infinite is just the game for you.Aesthetically the game is very minimalistic, clear and clean. The ambient music and the soothing ethereal piano keys played, when you unravel successive hexes, can be quite relaxing. The game has a finite amount of hand-crafted puzzles with a decent enough difficulty curve. The earlier levels are pretty easy to grasp and as more elements and guidelines are introduced the puzzles get increasingly harder. The last of the hand-crafted puzzles can be seriously challenging to beat using just your logic and not guessing without making any mistakes. But like I've said each and every one of these can be beaten without guesswork, just need to look at it in the right angle.After you've completed the hand-crafted there's the infinite puzzle generator. While I've noticed that the levels you get using the generator are usually a lot easier than the last of the manually created levels, so there's not that much challenge there anymore for me, but I still occasionally find myself popping back in to complete a few of them. It's refreshing to warm up your brain's logical thinking with them I suppose.All in all I have to recommend this title to any puzzle fans and especially to those who love minesweeper (because it's pretty much minesweeper but better). Great value for the price. Even more so if you can get it with a discount.			"

Game SeriesHexcells Infinite is the third game of its' series. Previous game: Hexcells and Hexcells Plus.Game Visual/AudioThere isn't much can be said about the game's visuals asides from that they're minimalistic. Pretty much the same thing can be said about the game's audio. GameplayThere is no difficulty mode option that's assigned. But each of the puzzles has their own difficult.Hexcells Infinite basically has same formula as its' predecessors Hexcells and Hexcells Infinite. So the objective remains the same. Which is to figure out which cells to make blue and which cells to make black.There are total of three slots with six worlds that has thirty-six puzzles to solve. The first world for each of the three slots are automatically unlocked. Completing one world will unlocked the next one. All of these puzzles can be replayed after the first go around. Please do note that the puzzles in the other two slots are the same as the ones in the first slot.There is a special feature bonus that Hexcell Infinite has. Right beneath the three slots, there's an option for continous gameplay of Hexcells. Henced why the game called Hexcell Infinite. The special feature bonus gameplay can be customized in many different ways that the regular gameplay of Hexcells cannot.There's no time limit in this game. Allowing the individual take as much time that they want to solve each of the puzzles.There seven achievements for this game. Each of these achievements has certain requirements before they can be unlocked.MiscellaneousFinal thoughts, it's an neat game to play and enjoy. As for the game's replay value it's low. I would recommend this game but not at the full price.Reviews for the games in this series:HexcellsHexcells PlusHexcells Infinite "

												If you had one of the older Microsoft Windows versions, than you might remember the game Minesweeper. You had to find the mines and avoid them by marking them. It worked with some clues, since numbers gave away how many mines are close by.The Hexcells games are very similar to it, but they are not working in square blocks, they come in hexagon shape and often remind of chemical combinations when you open the next level. These shapes make it sometimes hard to figure out what is going on and in later levels you get extra clues for the lines of hexagons and stuff like that.playing Hexcells is fun in a kind of weird way. Even if you don't want to make your math homework, you sit down to ""calculate"" the grids, but it is not that much math anyway, more like drawing lines from dot to dot.Later versions of Hexcells (Hexcells Plus & Hexcells Ininite) are basically the same thing on harder levels and Infinite includes an Endless-Mode that let's you play levels created by chance. Start with the normal game and get infected, this game is addictive and you should consider buying the complete pack right from start.10/10 I think I've seen more hexagons than a beekeeper did "

												A fantastic game. It has been called a cross between minesweeper and picross, and the description fits the basic mechanics. The game is soothing, with great sound and visual design, and with no time pressure. Although it doesn't end when you make a mistake, instead allowing you to continue playing, it does encourage you to keep mistakes to a minimum by giving you a score at the end of the puzzle, which is used to unlock furthur puzzles.As for the puzzle design itself, the puzzles that come with the game have a great difficulty curve, but one which works best if you've played the first two games. It starts off with a refresher on the mechanics, but quickly becomes devilishly difficult. I fully recommend sleeping on some of them and coming back with a fresh pair of eyes; this is something the game lets you do, as you can end a puzzle and come back at any time. One potential issue with this is that it forgets which clues you have highlit or dismissed, although you may consider that to be a good thing as it forces you to reconsider every clue when you come back to the puzzle.The automatically-generated ""infinite"" puzzles are much less difficult, but still fun for the most part. There is also a level editor that can be found on reddit, and a subreddit for user-made levels, which can be very fun.I heartilly recommend getting the complete pack and playing all three games in order, for anyone even mildly interested.

												Having now spent 30 hours on this game I think the time has come for me to finally write a review for this masterpiece. It truly is a complete masterpiece and I don't think anyone could come up with a better long lasting puzzle idea if they tried. Wheras I find most puzzle games loose there charm after a while of just doing very similar puzzles over and over again I find that hexcells has enough variation to keep it intriguing and fun to play for hours on end!So hexcells infinite is a follow up to the originals, hexcells and hexcells hexcells plus. They are pretty much identical games with a few differences. I will cover all of the games in this review because I think if your going to play them you should start from the beginning and play all of them. The original hexcells is a very easy concept version of the two later games. I say concept because this is what it felt like at this stage. Its as if he was just testing the water as to whether people enjoyed it. It was very simple and when replaying it, it only took me around 1 hour to complete. But then you go on to hexcells plus. This is a very large step up in difficulty and really does get you thinking. Infinite follows on with this step up in difficulty following around the same level of difficulty. Well what do you do in hexcells? It's basically an upgraded version of minesweeper. Having the field instead in a hex format makes for much more extensive gameplay. They have extra functions in around the hexes instead of just numbers. You have {} which say that the hexes are connecting each other. - - show that they aren't connecting each other. You have large orbits (Not sure what to call them so that name will do?) which show how many hexes are in a large area. And finally there are numbers above some rows that show how many hexes are in that row. So all of these new elements really make you have to think and utilize all of them together to complete a level without making mistakes.This newest entry series introduces a new feature called inifnite mode. It is a randomly generated field of hexes that is unique every time. There is said to be 999,999,999 different combinations so good luck getting through them all. I have currently done about 150 puzzles. This is where the real longevity of the game comes from. Although infinite mode isn't quite as challenging as the story puzzles it does make it so you don't have to keep playing the default puzzles over and over. I have found myself playing hours on end on this mode. There is one thing that makes this truly better than minesweeper. No guessing. Yes you heard that correct. There is no guessing at all in hexcells. The maps and algorithms are specially crafting so you never find yourself uncertain to whether there is hex there or not. This makes the gameplay infinitely more fun and makes it so it doesn't get aggrivating after a while. So if you are a fan of minesweeper or any puzzle game at that hexcells is definitely for you. You can currently buy the hexcells complete pack for a price of Â£5.99 which is an absolute steal for the amount of time of gameplay you can get out of it. It is an ideal game to spend 10 minutes or so on now and then whenever you have a moment. Really this isn't the kind of game I expected I would lose my life to but i'm glad I found it!TheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game. Maybe consider it on a sale. An average game.A good game that should definitely be considered.A must play! "

												Good puzzles with simple ideas that go up in complexty but are presented in a clear way. There are markers to help you see every clue more clearly.The regular levels are, as in previous games, very well designed in the sense of using every clue to advance and solve the puzzle. My only problem is with the ""infinite"" puzzles: they have no personality, have superfluous clues and are easier to solve. Therefore, I didn't get the same satisfaction from solving them. If you found Hexcells Plus just right in difficulty this is just more of the same (with small improvements) and I'd wait for a sale, but if you thought it was a bit too hard you might enjoy the infinite levels.

												Much like the original Hexcells and its sequel, Hexcells Plus, Hexcells Infinite is an updated version of the classic strategy game Minesweeper with a bit of added style: you play with hexagons instead of squares. The board starts with an oddly shaped field made of orange hexagons. Mines are marked by left-clicking a hexagon, turning it blue. Hexagons are revealed by right-clicking, showing the number underneath if you click correctly and shaking the piece and adding a tally mark to your mistake count if you're too hasty in your decisions.Hexcells Infinite expands upon the original two Hexcells games by giving players an additional thirty-six puzzles to complete that contain familiar gameplay elements for Hexcell veterans. Unlike the original Minesweeper, Hexcells is a much more complex game involving a board marked with various different types of clues that give the player hints about how many mines are in each column or in the surrounding area of the board. Hexcells also includes the dreaded ?, a marking that denotes a hexagon that has an unrevealed amount of mines around it, as well as numbered mines that indicate how many mines are in a two-piece radius surrounding the hexagon. These clues come together to create a thought-provoking experience that provides players with more depth and interaction than the traditional game of Minesweeper.Of the three Hexcells games, the original Hexcells remains my favorite. Both Hexcells Plus and Hexcells Infinite include a few gameplay elements that I find more frustrating than enjoyable (namely the addition of ? hexagons that make an otherwise well-balanced game irritatingly challenging and often cause the player to have to make risky clicks based off of luck and some logical guesswork). However, if one were to purchase only one Hexcells game, that game would have to be Hexcells Infinite. As the name implies, Hexcells Infinite is the only game in the Hexcells series to include a puzzle generator, opening up endless gameplay and increasing the value of the game ten-fold.Hexcells Infinite can be seen as an expansion to the original two Hexcells, adding thirty-six new levels for players to complete, or it can be played as a standalone experience, with the basics of the original Hexcells being explained in the earliest levels of Hexcells Infinite. This is the third and final game of the Hexcells series, with the developer not intending to produce more. After completing the set of levels contained in Hexcells Infinite, be sure to check out the original Hexcells games for more hand-created puzzles or continue on playing Hexcells Infinite with some of the randomly generated Hexcells levels.

These clues come together to create a thought-provoking experience that provides players with more depth and interaction than the traditional game of Minesweeper.Of the three Hexcells games, the original Hexcells remains my favorite. Both Hexcells Plus and Hexcells Infinite include a few gameplay elements that I find more frustrating than enjoyable (namely the addition of ? hexagons that make an otherwise well-balanced game irritatingly challenging and often cause the player to have to make risky clicks based off of luck and some logical guesswork). However, if one were to purchase only one Hexcells game, that game would have to be Hexcells Infinite. As the name implies, Hexcells Infinite is the only game in the Hexcells series to include a puzzle generator, opening up endless gameplay and increasing the value of the game ten-fold.Hexcells Infinite can be seen as an expansion to the original two Hexcells, adding thirty-six new levels for players to complete, or it can be played as a standalone experience, with the basics of the original Hexcells being explained in the earliest levels of Hexcells Infinite. This is the third and final game of the Hexcells series, with the developer not intending to produce more. After completing the set of levels contained in Hexcells Infinite, be sure to check out the original Hexcells games for more hand-created puzzles or continue on playing Hexcells Infinite with some of the randomly generated Hexcells levels.

												The third Hexcells game. Based on the same formula. Surely the welcome's been worn out, yeah?No. It's even better than the first two. And they were already great. This one starts out a little more difficult than its predecessors, and feels finely tuned throughout. You'll not want for challenge, especially towards the end. And still, it's not frustrating. It's always logical. Always. Even when you're convinced it can't be.The infinite mode isn't as satisfying as the handcrafted levels, but the base mechanics of the game are already very enjoyable, so I can see it being a fun every now and then kind of thing.It's such a good game. If you haven't played the first two, get the pack, right now. They all look kind of like the same game, but the difficulty progression from the first to the third is on point.			"

												Hexcells Infinite, like its predecessors, is a puzzle game which features minesweeper-like playstyle on a hexagonal grid. In it, you are given information about the number of specific tiles (and some context clues of where they lie), and must use logic to determine where the tiles are.Hexcells Infinite picks up where Plus left off and once more has an excellent level of challenge throughout. In addition to this, it has a random level generator with 1 billion (yes, you read that right) levels available. Furthermore, if you check the Steam forums, they're putting out a tool which lets users create levels then share the keys. While this isn't quite as nice as having integrated Steam Workshop support where people can rate and download those levels automatically, it provides nigh on infinite replayability within the game. I'd recommend picking up the whole trilogy, but if you're going to pick up a single Hexcells game, this is it. Tons of fun.			"

A Minimalistic Puzzle Game

+ The gameplay is very simple and mainly consists of flipping over tiles to find the correct pattern. Very comparable to Minesweeper as unactivated tiles will have a number which designates how many adjacent tiles connected to it should be flipped. By using this information along with info from other hex squares you are able to begin eliminating / breaking unneeded tiles and finding the correct ones to activate.+ Nice relaxing ambient background sounds that is very peaceful+ The game gets quite challenging later on and has plenty of stages to keep you content for hours- For me personally, this game feels a bit repetitive after a short while once you understand the mechanics. Every level is different and it does try to add a few new mechanics as you progress, but overall it was just a bit too simplistic visually.			"

												The thrid in the Hexcells series, Hexcells Infinite is a refreshing addition to this line of minesweeper inspired puzzle packs. The original Hexcells was refreshing and fun whilst Hexcells Plus was, at times, exceedingly tedious with some of the puzzle designs. The tedium of Plus--as generally caused by a little too much ""mucking around"" with the blue cell counter mechanics on some puzzles, is not replicated in Hexcells Infinite. Hexcells Infinite, unlike it's predecessors does have some capacity for random puzzle generation. Although, thus far, the randomly generated puzzles are not as complex as many of the prefab puzzles in the ""story set""--for lack of a better term--they remain fun and the seed system does afford sufficient depth of puzzles able to be generated to afford extensive diversionary and casual replay value.The soundset remains relaxed and in sync with the previous titles and the controls remain identical as well.My greatest irritation remains with perfecting each puzzle--which is to say, the instant one makes a mistake, to erase that mistake one must start the entire puzzle from scratch. This is perfectly fine, in terms of design overall, but I have found myself, at times, forgetting which button tags a blue cell and which uncovers a yellow cell--resulting in stupid mistakes and thus having to redo an entire puzzle from scratch. An undo function, allowing for a single mistake to be back-tracked once per puzzle would remove the occassional misclick irritation of having to restart a puzzle you already know how to do but were ""clumsy"" in regards to inputs.Overall, this is an excellent program, surpassing it's two predecessors in replayability, and would be enjoyed by any fan of minesweeperesque puzzle games. Definately worth a buy--especially when the full series goes on a sale.			"

												The best version of Hexcells by far.The simplest way to describe it is a mix between minesweeper and picross; and it adds even more puzzle elements.  Any fan of those games will certainly appreciate Hexcells.Infinite keeps all of the mechanics from Plus and adds a random generator so you can essentially never run out of hexcells puzzles to play.  The generated puzzles tend to be more simple than the handmade puzzles but it's better than nothing.  There is also a way to import user made puzzles using a code, so that's great too.Easily recommended for any fan of logic puzzles.  I really look forward to future creations from Matthew Brown.			"

												As a perfectionist, I find short, challenging games to be the best fit for me.Hexcells Infinite takes the hexagonal challenge to a new level. I found myself spending anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour on some challenges, without getting bored or wanting to give up.The challenges here are never unfair, but give you great satisfaction when you finally figure out what you were doing wrong. The main focus here is you, your mind, and your way of thinking, helping you evolve your thought processes and think more outside the box as you progress.This game also comes with ""Infinite Mode"" which generates an unlimited amount of puzzles once you are done with the ""campaign"" levels. Once you finish those levels, the Infinite Mode puzzles are quite simple, and I find that I am challenging myself to finish the levels as quickly as possible with no mistakes, like Minesweeper.Till now, I'm still enjoying this game and open it up every so often to pass some time.

												This is the third game in a series of addictive puzzlers (Hexcells, Hexcells Plus, Hexcells Infinite), and I would not recommend starting here -- go back and play through the others as the difficulty here is tuned assuming you've already taken the training wheels off. The overall idea is not that complex; like Minesweeper and Picross, you use partial information to slowly reveal whether a tile is ""on"" or ""off"" until you are done.  You never need to guess; the information is always there.  The magic here is in the ways the information is presented (at varying times you will learn how many tiles are on in a given column, row, or diagonal, how many tiles adjactent to a tile are on, how many tiles in a region are on, and whether the tiles that are on are contiguous or not).  Early in the game there is enough information to happily click through and solve the puzzles; late in the game, every bit of information has you trying to figure out how it can combine with existing information to yield one more ""yes"" or ""no.""The end result is incredibly satisfying, a well-earned ""perfect"" score.It also has replay value with a random level generator, but the real magic of the game is in the hand-crafted puzzles that force you to collate all the available information until the next logical action pops out.It's a thing of beauty, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys logic puzzles.

Quick Breakdown: A puzzle game in the vein of Minesweeper, but more complicated. Itâs the best of the Hexcells games, and the random level generator on top of the main gameâs levels gives it more gameplay.Length: 4-8 hours (Main game)Score: 7/10Full Review: For those not familiar with the Hexcells series, the gameplay is similar to Minesweeper in that you must determine which cells on the board contain blue hexes, and which are vacant. There are various ways the game indicates which cells contain hexes, and which are vacant.Vacant cells will often contain a number indicating how many adjacent cells contain hexes (though sometimes they merely contain a question mark). Simply left click to mark a cell as containing a blue hex, and right click to mark it vacant (the game will indicate if youâve made a mistake).As you progress through the game more ways to determine which cells contain hexes are introduced. Columns (even diagonals) will contain a number indicating how many blue hexes are in that column. Numbers (for both in vacant cells and columns) will sometimes be encased in curly brackets indicating that the hexes are all connected in a line. Numbers may also be surrounded by a hyphen, indicating that not all the blue hexes are in a line (so thereâs at least one break). Blue hexes may even contain a number, indicating how man blue hexes are in a 2 cell radius.The main new feature to this game compared to past games in the series is its random level generator. So after youâve completed the 36 levels in the main game, you have the option to keep playing as many randomly generated levels as you please, giving the game more longevity than past iterations.The difficulty of Infinite is greater than the first game in the series, but notably less than the second. The difficulty curve is much more natural, and lends itself well to players who are new to the series. Depending on if youâve played the past games or not, Infinite will probably take you about 4-8 hours to complete the main game.Hexcells Infinite manages to fix one of my main criticisms towards its predecessors, namely that you may now exit a stage mid-way through and save your progress, allowing you to resume playing later.Unfortunately, the game doesnât manage to the other main criticism Iâve leveled at the series. That being to introduce something akin to Picrossâ overlay feature, allowing you to map out a potential solution before applying it to the board. This would be especially useful in more difficult stages when you must look at how many different cells and numbers interact together to determine which cells contain hexes, and which cells are vacant.If youâve never played Hexcells before, this game is a good one to get. The series pack often goes on sale for under $3 if you want to get all the games. If you only want one game in the series, then itâs best to just get Infinite. It has all the features of the prior games, a reasonable difficulty curve, and the level generator should help keep you busy if you want more stages to complete. If youâve played the first two games then the decision really comes down to if you want more levels or not. However you choose to go, itâs worth giving Hexcells a chance.			"

												I can easily recommend this game if you like brain puzzles. The 36 main puzzles of the game are well made and very challenging, although some of the time you'll just be looking for that one piece of information you missed to progress forward. A lot of the puzzles are huge, and it takes some time to find that one tile you need to swap.The second part of the game doesn't shine as bright, though; the infinite levels. You input or generate a random string of numbers, and a puzzle is made from that. When you've passed through the crafted levels, you'll likely find these generated levels simplistic and more of a timesink than an actual challenge. It's mostly repetition from what you've learned from the designer's levels, and while there may be some golden nuggets among these numbers, there's an 8-digit string to generate levels from, which is where the ""infinite"" part comes from. This of course doesn't mean they're bad, they're just not as good as the designed ones.All in all, I can say that if you like brain training games that challenge your logical side, this one's worth it, and the infinite levels serve nicely as a filler for when you've got nothing better to do.

												More Hexcells is always welcome, and Hexcells Infinite delivers.  It includes more puzzles with Hexcells Plus-like difficulty, albeit with an extended tutorial section for new players.  There are no new puzzle mechanics, just a procedural puzzle generator capable of producing millions of potential puzzles.  This puzzle generator turned out rather disappointing, unfortunately.

												Hands down one of my favourite logic puzzle games of all time. I really enjoyed both of the previous games in the series, but I keep coming back to Infinite again and again. The game starts with quite simple puzzles, ending with very challenging, very fun ones. You can absolutely solve all the puzzles in this game without guessing. The randomly generated puzzles are a fun feature, but most of them are not very challenging. There is support for user-made ones, though, adding more content and replayability to the game. Sound design and visuals are excellent, just like in the previous games.			"

												More Hexcells is always welcome, and Hexcells Infinite delivers.  It includes more puzzles with Hexcells Plus-like difficulty, albeit with an extended tutorial section for new players.  There are no new puzzle mechanics, just a procedural puzzle generator capable of producing millions of potential puzzles.  This puzzle generator turned out rather disappointing, unfortunately.  Most of the puzzles it generates are very similar and can be blazed through very quickly due to lots of obvious clues.  None of them come anywhere close to the difficulty of the hand-made puzzles.

												My thoughts on Hexcells Infinite are essentailly the same as my thoughts on the original game and Hexcells Plus, so read my review for Hexcells to understand my stance on the gameplay and style. Hexcells Infinite is more or less a standalone expansion pack for the original Hexcells, but definitely more difficult and challenging. There are a few new obstacles and hints in the puzzles that have been introduced since the original game too, which can make problem solving a little more thought-prevoking. Hexcells Infinite brings an ""Infinite mode"" to the table, which is basically a random puzzle generator. This is a really nice addition that gives this game endless replayability, so you'll always have a reason to go back to this version if you're in the mood for it.If you enjoyed your time with Hexcells and Hexcells Plus, you will definitely enjoy your time with this too. There isn't much else to say here, this is definitely another one to pick up for puzzle fans of all ages.			"

												The puzzles in the main game are well crafted, the developer having put some real thought into how they're laid out and how the player may approach solving them, but there aren't really enough puzzles of this sort in the game. Even with the previous two games, there's less than 100 handcrafted levels, most of which take only a couple of minutes to complete. I also would have loved more puzzles like the final one in the game where additional rules were added, putting and interesting twist on solving it.The level generator on the other hand is somewhat disappointing, due to the seemingly limited number of puzzle layouts - how the puzzle initially appears ignoring all hints - though at 100 million possible puzzles, it does add an almost ""infinite"" number of levels to solve, which can serve as an interesting timewaster.The Hexcells Levels reddit at https://www.reddit.com/r/hexcellslevels/ must be mentioned though, since it is a community based on creating further handcrafted puzzles for Hexcells Infinite and I can't recommend it enough.With all of this in mind, I highly recommend Hexcells Infinite.

												(9/10) - Near PerfectionI had my hopes up a few months ago when i learned, that the third installment of hexcells will have infinite levels.I wish i could tell you that they were completly satisfied, but sadly i canÂ´t.DonÂ´t get me wrong: the puzzles are still fun and you really never have to guess. ItÂ´s funny seeing this game accomplish something with way more difficult rules that microsoft coudlnÂ´t (looking at minesweeper right now).But still, they are sadly too easy. They all feel the same and after a little while, i just got bored.No comparison to what this game still does perfectly: The actual game.The levels created by Mr. Brown are once again extremly well executed and with them, i would recommend this game to anyone enjoying thinking a lot and from time to time putting some numbers into the puzzle.Even with the ""disapointment"" of the level generator, this is still one of the best puzzle games on steam.

												Brilliant ""end"" to the Hexcells series - and those quotes are there because you'll never end playing the randomly generated puzzles here.You should definitely start with Hexcells, move up to Plus and then here to Infinite. The difficulty ramp does get steeper within each game, but it's nice and smooth across all three. Hey, sometimes they get discounted in a package deal - you should jump on that if you see it.The 36 main puzzles are excellent and a pleasure to solve. The randomly generated ones are clearly a notch below, but still very much enjoyable. The ability to exit mid-puzzle and keep your progress saved is probably the only thing this series was missing, and it's here now.Indispensable for puzzle lovers.			"

Counting, counting and counting.Hexcells Infinite is the third and probably the last Hexcells game.The only but huge difference here is that Hexcells Infinite has a puzzle generator which gives you countless puzzles to play.This game is basically an alternative to Minesweeper. Changing the shape of hidden block from Square to Hexagon doesn't make this game any special. Both games give you very similar gameplay experience.However, Hexcells makes the game a lot easier by giving you a lot of hints. I didn't have any difficulty to finish this game very quick. So, I have to say that the game is not that challenging comparing with Minesweeper.But still is a decent game and deserve your attention.			"

At the Time of WritingGame: Hexcells InfinitePrice: $5.49*Genre: PuzzleTime Played: 20 hoursPersonal Enjoyment Rating: âº âº âº âº âº (out of 5)GeneralFirst of all, I would strongly recommend buying the bundle of Hexcells games if you don't already own any of the previous two.I've had a slightly rocky road towards enjoying the Hexcells series because I've always felt they were too easy and too short. Hexcells Infinite addresses both of those issues, though with varying success. It has to be said that the concept behind Hexcells is fantastic, and my issues with the games truly stem from wanting more, more, more!As I said in my Hexcells Plus review, you'll get the most enjoyment out of the game if you  are disciplined and refuse to let yourself make a blind guess. Every puzzle is solvable without making a guess, even when you're absolutely convinced that there is no other option but to guess. You'll find (if you post on the forums) that you've inevitably missed some subtle piece of logic which will get you past the hurdle.Too EasyThis issue was addressed in two ways - later puzzles are harder, and community made puzzles - although I donât find my appetite for these puzzles sated yet. The later puzzles got quite difficult and took me a significant amount of time to solve, which I enjoyed and appreciated. The community made puzzles are a good way of getting some tricky puzzles to do. Lastly, I have to say that I was disappointed to find that the first few worlds were once again a too easy tutorial, and I wish that the tutorial levels had been put into a separate section of the game so that we could have had 6 full worlds of puzzles to exercise âthe little grey cellsâ to quote Poirot.Too ShortAgain, this second issue was addressed in two ways - infinite mode, and community made puzzles. Infinite mode generates random puzzles for the user to complete and it certainly satisfies the issue of there not being enough puzzles. However, whilst it delivers quantity, it fails at quality. By quality I mean difficulty, because the randomly generate puzzles are far from difficult. It seems like a great idea with potential, but it could definitely do with some difficulty settings so that you can request hard random puzzles. The community made puzzles offer some harder choices to do, but it will take time for the selection to be built up.Community PuzzlesI know this is getting a bit long, but this is an interesting new part of this particular Hexcells game. I will point you to the post that explains it and strongly suggest that you watch the two videos there because they do all the explaining (I originally didnât bother to watch them and was confused for it). It is very easy to play custom puzzles, you simply copy the puzzle to the clipboard, open Hexcells, and click the option in the bottom right to play a custom puzzle. Making your own puzzles is something I havenât yet explored. One note is that Iâve learned to mostly avoid any that have custom rules because the logic sometimes seems a bit sketchy leaving you to guess.Community Puzzle Links**Hexcells Infinite Announcement - Custom Level SupportHexcells Inifinite > General Discussions > Topic Details > âLevel Editor: Create and Play Custom Levels!âHexcells Infinite community shared levels on RedditGameplayThe concept of this game is wonderful. It adds a few levels of complication than Minesweeper and the solutions are all attainable through pure logic. No guesses are required, if they are sometimes tempting to do, so get in touch with your inner vulcan mind.Some of those complications I mentioned include:cells are hexagonshint numbers are quite varied, and form a set of logical rules in cellsat the top of columns/rowssignify that ""mines"" are adjacentsignify that ""mines"" can not be adjacenta larger hex area has a certain number of ""mines""ControlsVery simple - right click and left click. Plus, now featuring a button in-game to flip the button functions! Rejoice! This can also still be changed about in the options dialogue that pops up when opening the game.Although, by this time I've become entirely accustomed to them and didn't make too many stupid mistakes by hitting the wrong button. StorylineNo storyline, doesn't need one.SoundRelaxing gentle zen echoey noises. Also, when you click a cell you get nice tinkling chime-like noises. I don't know why that makes it more satisfying to click on cells, but it does! It's fun to go back to the really easy puzzles and click through like mad to get a cascade of tinkling noises.GraphicsVery crisp, clean, and clear. The numbers are reasonably large. Some puzzles form an interesting overall image or pattern, and overall, the puzzles come across as well designed. There is also an option in-game to make blue cells with numbers have a different outline effect.Pros+ crisp clean graphics whose job is to be functional+ simple controls to grasp+ more interesting concept than random old Minesweeper+ improvements over the first two games+ community made puzzles create more varietyCons- still lacking in really tough puzzles- the random puzzles are too easyHelp Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasnât helpful for you.

I started at the beginning, aced that, went on to the next one (Plus), didn't ace it, but moved on again to this... Now it's my daily ritual. The core game is the best it's ever been, with a gradual difficulty curve. The difficulty can get to the point where you'll say, ""This level is broken."" even though it's not, it's just You. Then, suddenly, you'll speedrun up until the part that stumps you; get every achievement, speedrun your ""Use today's date"" in Infinite Mode, and you'll find yourself with a new daily ritual like me.

I personally enjoy this more than sudoku.As a bonus, completing a level will create a pattern, which is interesting to look at sometimes.			"

												As much as I was charmed by the very first Hexcell, I did not appreciate this one. I was just so bored by the concept when I got to Infinite, considering how I beat the first two games right before. However, I'd still recommend it, because the level generator is excellent and provides almost infinite replay (you get where the title comes from ;) haha). In fact, I'd recommend this one over Hexcells Plus; the first one introduces you nicely to the mechanics, the third one (this one!) has much more complex level and the aforementioned level generator, but the second one brings nothing to the series apart from a set of new levels. Really, just buy Hexcells Plus if you can't get enough of the two others.			"

												This series is criminally overlooked.If you enjoy games like sudoku, you will find logical puzzles here that work your brain for hours. While a naive comparison, the game plays similarly to a very advanced Minesweeper. By the second act, though, you'll have discovered the futility of that comparison; this game is on an entirely different level and has an elegance in the solutions that random Minesweeper puzzles cannot ever hope to achieve.A couple of the puzzles stumped me for more than 90 minutes, and my roommate rapidly grew tired of me talking the solution out loud as I moved my mouse around. There's a brilliant simplicity to the gameplay and yet, while playing, one must keep a large amount of logic in their head. It's easy to get overwhelmed by logic in one area of the puzzle while overlooking the simple move forward in another area, and the feeling is intense when you slap your forehead in stupidity on discovering it.The soundtrack is quite relaxing, and even after working on the same puzzle for an hour it did not grow tiresome. It's really fun when you get on a ""roll"" of solving the puzzle, too, because you generate little ditties as a reward.The only negative of Infinite compared to the rest of the series is the randomly-generated puzzles. The developer added these so that he could put a bow on the series and call it done and, while they do indeed fill a gap, you can tell they're a far different experience than the handmade puzzles (don't worry, Infinite has the same number of handmade puzzles as the previous two). Sudoku has this issue, too, and it's just the nature of puzzle generation algorithms. Still, if you're dying for a new puzzle, they might hold you over, otherwise I'd just play them for the achievement.At any rate, I've found if I step away from a puzzle or play others, I forget a solution, so you could probably revisit the entire series in a few weeks' time and have a whole new game.The entire Hexcells series contains puzzles that are among the greatest I've ever solved. I highly recommend the entire collection, and also very strongly recommend that you start with Hexcells. It is easier than the other two, this one included, by far. Definitely, though, work up to this one. Absolutely worth your purchase.For perspective, I am not the greatest logician, and I invested about 13 hours solving this campaign -- for 13 hours of gameplay, this game is a steal.			"

A Paladinâs Steam Review: Hexcells, Plus and Infinite. Cheesing in the Cells.Genre: Minimalist Casual Atmospheric Number PuzzlersDeveloped & Published by: Matthew BrownPlatform: Windows, Mac and LinuxBusiness Model: Base GameCopy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review about the entire Hexcells Series on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]Overall Gameplay ThoughtsHexcells is a minimalist puzzle game that I like to think of as a combination of Minesweeper and Sudoku. A comparison that has probably been made elsewhere. Every level is basically the same. Youâre presented with a variable number of cells with a number in the top right corner telling you how many blue cells there are in the puzzle. The challenge is figuring out which cells are blue and which are numbers. If you guess incorrectly, itâs counted as a mistake that will affect how many points you get at the end of a level. The numbers on or adjacent to cells are telling you how many blue cells are connected to them. Itâs up to the player to figure out the pattern by examining the numbers. In general terms, if there are two unknown cells connected to a cell that has the number â2â on it, theyâre both blue cells. There are several different mechanics used to confuse the player and make them logic out the solution. Upon completing a level, youâll be rewarded with points that are used to unlock additional groups of levels. As such, this does requires you to complete most of the puzzles with a minimal amount of mistakes in order to progress forward. Hexcells: Infinite FeaturesHexcells Infinite is the fully fleshed out title. It has Steam cloud, the most challenging puzzles (36 new ones) and a random puzzle generator. It also has the ability to change the mouse buttons. The random number generator has the same pluses and minuses as most randomly generated systems do. Itâs a lot of content but the quality of those puzzles will be all over the place compared the developerâs handcrafted ones. Still, thereâs a neat level here and there. Additionally, the player is able to save their place in the puzzle and quit the game if they need to. The other two games do not.My Main Issue With HexcellsHereâs the problem I have with the entire Hexcells series. Itâs a pretty good puzzle experience, if you play it how itâs intended to be played. However, I feel that they have a problematic design flaw: all of the puzzles can be cheesily completed. If youâre stuck at a certain sequence, you can just click through the rest of the puzzle making as many mistakes as you like. (I had some puzzles at 50-60 mistakes). What about the points you would get from a near perfect completion? Well, once you nearly finish the puzzle, take a screenshot and then instantly replay the level with your own personal guide. Itâs possible to win all three games this way without much effort on your part. PC Settings & Audio/VideoItâs a minimalist game so there really arenât many settings to change. Since its running on the Unity engine, the Unity launcher menu pops up when you start the game every time. It allows you to change resolutions and turn fullscreen on/off. The graphics quality is set to beautiful and canât be changed. However, I was able to play this on a basic, five year old laptop running Linux Mint and there was absolutely no trouble running it. Alternative keys can be changed here as well. Hexcells Infinite was the only game of the three that allows you to swap the left and right mouse button functions. Final ThoughtsOverall, I think the Hexcells series is a decently executed puzzle idea with plenty of content. I take issue with the lack of anti-cheat but it's not enough to make it an anti-recommendation. (Thanks to a friend for making a case to change my mind on this). Itâs a fun logic number puzzle series. And I did play the three games how it was intended too, with a few exceptions. I had quite a bit of fun deducing the my way through the levels and had several âaha!â moments despite itâs more casual nature. Additionally, it maintains a mellow and atmospheric experience that I can appreciate. While there is the less honorable part of myself thinking âyou can just easily âcheatâ this game and not spend hours on itâ, that doesn't disqualify it from being a decent puzzle game. So, if you can avoid cheating yourself, get the Hexcells series. But if you canât restrain yourself from looking up help on even the slightest bit of challenge, I probably wouldn't get it. Otherwise, that's my thoughts on this series. Read this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me] "

 Review  Pros   Unlike most logic puzzles Hexcells puzzles maintain actual difficulty levels and continually present challenges without ever involving guessing to arrive at a solved puzzle. Albeit in saying this I've found some Custom Puzzles so difficult I almost disregard logic and brute force a solution... Whilst the number of levels is limited to an extent (Each Chapter contains 6 Stages, ergo 36 levels/stages total). Hexcells has a Random Puzzle Generator function aswell as the ability to access Custom Puzzles of which are obtainable from  Hexcells Subreddit . Cons  Generated Level(s) complexity, from all the puzzles I've attempted to solve using this function/feature have all been relatively simple to solve. I believe the developer mentioned the complexity bottleneck is a consequence of the AI solver he uses to check whether a problem is solveable. However this is almost a non-issue as a result of the Custom Level Subreddit, there are some very difficult puzzles on there and there is such a large quantity of puzzles already in existence and that will be; you'll be more than occupied for hundreds of hours before you even contemplate using the Random Generate Function. Conclusion This along with the other two Hexcells games are well worth the pick-up @ their respective price points. Theoretically infinite playability as you'd be able to play Randomly Generated Levels and or Custom Levels obtained from the Subreddit as aforementioned. Rating: 8.5/10  "

												Start with Minesweeper, remove the guessing: this is Hexcell. This is a brilliant puzzle/logic game. The hand crafted levels are beautiful, and will challenge you for a few hours. If you want more, Hexcell infinite introduces a puzzle generator. Computer generated levels are less interesting than hand-crafted one, but still a welcome addition to this 3rd episode of the hexcell franchise.			"

												This game was recommended some time ago by a streamer who named dropped a dev he knew working on this. I started at the beginning, aced that, went on to the next one (Plus), didn't ace it, but moved on again to this... Now it's my daily ritual. The core game is the best it's ever been, with a gradual difficulty curve. The difficulty can get to the point where you'll say, ""This level is broken."" even though it's not, it's just You. Then, suddenly, you'll speedrun up until the part that stumps you; get every achievement, speedrun your ""Use today's date"" in Infinite Mode, and you'll find yourself with a new daily ritual like me. I can't recommend this unique puzzle game enough.			"

												Think of minesweeper crossed with sudoku.Hexcells Infinite is basically that with a few extra gimmicks added in.When playing, I feel like I'm using sudoku logic, but in a binary way, where each square will be either blue or black.Despite the simplicity of how it looks, this is actually a fairly challenging game.Apparantly you never have to guess on any level, even if it is a procedurally generated one, but sometimes, I'll be looking at the puzzle for a while, oblivious to what I'm supposed to do next.This is a fun game if you enjoy thinking things through logically and enjoy puzzles such as sudoku. I personally enjoy this more than sudoku.As a bonus, completing a level will create a pattern, which is interesting to look at sometimes.			"

												This is the third game in the Hexcells trilogy, and I definitely recommend that you play the first game (Hexcells) and then the second game (Hexcells Plus).  If you don't, jumping into Hexcells Infinite is going to be extremely difficult.As the final game in the trilogy, these are the puzzles that separate the men from the boys (or the women from the girls).  They are big, they are complex, and they are at times seemingly impossible.  However, every puzzle does have a solution (with no guessing required), you just need to look at more than just the immediately obvious information, and start looking at the bigger picture.Even if you finish the set puzzles, you now have the option of playing an ""infinite"" number of generated puzzles.(Okay, not infinite, but more than enough that you could never possibly play them all in a single lifetime.)And if that isn't enough, you can also upload user-generated levels (from various parts of the web) and give them a try.If you've played the first two games in the series, I can't imagine that you wouldn't want to play Hexcells Infinite.This game, and the whole trilogy, are definitely worth playing.

												This is a very fun puzzle game, a cross between Minesweeper and Picross/Nonograms. It has great relaxing music and visuals, and the puzzles themselves are designed to be fun and relaxing.That first paragraph is the one I copy/pasted between all of my Hexcells reviews. Hexcells Infinite continues the trend the others set, but is FAR more polished with more features.Firstly, along with the standard 36, there's a new puzzle generator using 'seeds'. Seeds is just a random string of numbers used to generate something, in this case a puzzle. You can choose for the Puzzle Generator to either randomly generate a seed for you(and therefore a random/new puzzle), or use the current days date, making it a sort of daily challenge. Either way, you can share the seed with friends and compete to see who does better.Secondly, there's far more sounds and music tracks to listen to while you play, all of which are wonderful and relaxing.And lastly, theres some customization options now. For those who have played the other two Hexcells, you know of the mechanic/clue thats a blue cell with a number in it that tells you how many blue cells are in the area, and that you can left click it to make it highlight its 2 cell radius. In Infinite, there's an option to make that highlight flash, or to make it not flash and have a black border. Either way improves visibility in the way you like it. Next is that you can switch which mouse button does what, so instead Left Click for Blue Tiles and Right Click for Black Tiles, you can reverse that so it's Left Click Black, Right Click Blue.Anyway, if you like Hexcells and Hexcells Plus, then Infinite is a absolutely must have. If you haven't played any, and can only afford one of the Hexcells games, then I recommend this one, as it has the Standard 36 Puzzles, Puzzle Generator, More Music/Sound, better Customization, and just generally better overall. And for those who don't know, each Hexcells has little text tutorials that does wonders for teaching and isn't invasive/hand-holding.Each new Hexcells DID introduce new mechanics, and while Infinite does explain it properly, I'd say get the Hexcells Complete Pack since it's such a great Puzzle game. But again, if you can only get one of them, get Infinite, I definitely recommend to any Minesweeper/Picross/Nonogram/Puzzle fan.			"

												Having played a lot of this game (and its predecessors) I have to say that this is one of the best puzzle games I have played on the PC in a long time.While the 60 randomly-generted puzzles is a bit of a stretch (they do seem to all follow quite a similar pattern), the regular ""campaign"" provides a huge wealth of variety and depth. While at some points I found myself cathartically whizzing through swathes of blue and black, at others I was stumped for ages.Two thumbs up, and a hearty call for more HexCells in the future!			"

												Note: This review is for both Hexcells, Hexcells Plus and Hexcells Infinite, because they're basically a single game divided in three parts.The Hexcell games are a series of brilliant crafted puzzles that at first glance may seem like a six-sided minesweeper, but the logic used to solve them is closer to sudoku. As you progress through the levels, you are also introduced to some new mechanics accompained by a tutorial level to make sure that you understand them. Because the puzzles are carefully and wonderfully designed, you never have to guess your next move, but finding it gets hard in the later puzzles. The interface is clean and the sound effects are cool. Hexcells is easy, Hexcells Plus gets harder in the second half and Hexcells Infinite steps back a little at the beginning, but in the end offers the most challenging puzzles. It also comes with a seed-based puzzle generator, adding 999,999,999 additional puzzles (even if they aren't hand crafted, they're still good). My recommendation is that you get and play all three games in order, but if you can only pick one, pick Hexcells Infinite, it's main levels difficulty is nicely spread not to mention the puzzle generator.

												(9/10) - Near PerfectionI had my hopes up a few months ago when i learned, that the third installment of hexcells will have infinite levels.I wish i could tell you that they were completly satisfied, but sadly i canÂ´t.DonÂ´t get me wrong: the puzzles are still fun and you really never have to guess. ItÂ´s funny seeing this game accomplish something with way more difficult rules that microsoft coudlnÂ´t (looking at minesweeper right now).But still, they are sadly too easy. They all feel the same and after a little while, i just got bored.No comparison to what this game still does perfectly: The actual game.The levels created by Mr. Brown are once again extremly well executed and with them, i would recommend this game to anyone enjoying thinking a lot and from time to time putting some numbers into the puzzle.Even with the ""disapointment"" of the level generator, this is still one of the best puzzle games on steam.

												As much as I was charmed by the very first Hexcell, I did not appreciate this one. I was just so bored by the concept when I got to Infinite, considering how I beat the first two games right before. However, I'd still recommend it, because the level generator is excellent and provides almost infinite replay (you get where the title comes from ;) haha). In fact, I'd recommend this one over Hexcells Plus; the first one introduces you nicely to the mechanics, the third one (this one!) has much more complex level and the aforementioned level generator, but the second one brings nothing to the series apart from a set of new levels. Really, just buy Hexcells Plus if you can't get enough of the two others.			"

												Logic puzzle game, similar to minesweeper but without the need to guess any moves and latest entry into the Hexcells series.Hexcells Infinite adds several improvements to the series the biggest of which is the puzzle generator giving you access to 1 billion generated puzzles alongside the usual 36 main puzzles. Difficulty wise I found it overall a easier then Plus but there were a few puzzles in it that were on par with the harder ones in Plus.Again like the other entries into the series every puzzle is fully solvable buy logic alone and again it is forgiving with no punishment for guessing or making mistakes.The one main negative from the previous games was not mid puzzle saves, which thankfully are in Hexcells Infinite allowing you to leave and return to puzzles without having to start over.One thing I did notice is that the generated puzzles lack a certain polish and feel that the hand-made puzzles had, they do lack a certain air of quality in comparison.Hexcells Infinite is worth its price for puzzle fans, it has any easier curve then Plus so it would be a good entry to new comers if they only wanted to get one of the games, it is the best one.The complete collection itself is easily worth its price aswell, providing 102 hand-crafted puzzles over the 3 games and 1 billion generated puzzles from Infinite itself. I had no technical issues with Hexcells Infinite. "

												Brilliant ""end"" to the Hexcells series - and those quotes are there because you'll never end playing the randomly generated puzzles here.You should definitely start with Hexcells, move up to Plus and then here to Infinite. The difficulty ramp does get steeper within each game, but it's nice and smooth across all three. Hey, sometimes they get discounted in a package deal - you should jump on that if you see it.The 36 main puzzles are excellent and a pleasure to solve. The randomly generated ones are clearly a notch below, but still very much enjoyable. The ability to exit mid-puzzle and keep your progress saved is probably the only thing this series was missing, and it's here now.Indispensable for puzzle lovers.			"

												More of the same; play the other 2 first. This one gets even harder, but not unsolvable. If you enjoyed the first 2 and want it to keep going, by all means get this (perhaps on a sale).The same uncomfortableness around carelessness is still here; the game's only mechanism for punishing failure is making you feel bad, which makes making mistakes incredibly frustrating, because now you know something you're not supposed to, and you only option to avoid ""cheating"" is to restart and come back later when you've forgotten the information.This one's titular feature is that it can make random levels, but the random level generator is incredibly unsatisfying. It makes puzzles that have no consistent difficulty level; so for many puzzles there will be one hard thing to figure out, and 100 things you can find out via multiple clues, so deductions aren't as satisfying. Compared to the handcrafted levels, the randoly generated ones feel incredibly sloppy/poorly designed.			"

												Simply one of the best puzzle games I've ever played.  I completed all the regular levels and close to 800 random ones, and I still enjoy it.[Edit: just completed random puzzle #1000, still no sign of boredom.][Edit #2: puzzle #1337 solved, I'm retiring with a smile on my face.]One particular thing that I love about this game is that there's NEVER a case of flipping a coin, like you can get from Minesweeper.  If you're taking minutes to figure out your next move, then keep at it or take a break and come back with a fresh mind.  Often when that happens to me, it's because I made the mistake of marking a hint as solved when it actually wasn't.  This game is all deduction, no guessing.

												This is the first time I'm reviewing a game on steam. I absolutely ADORE this game. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys crosswords/sudoku type puzzle games, and casual math. I am a crossword junkie (I even make them) and this is RIGHT down my alley.During the summer 2015 sale, I bought the original Hexcells and blew through it  in 2 hours. I wanted, nay, needed, more. I purchased both Hexcells Plus and this game, and have spent many many hours enjoying the games. If you are going to buy just one hexcells game, BUY THIS ONE. It is challenging, but still gives tutorial as a stand-alone game. It also has something the other two games don't have - the random level generator. The only thing I don't like about the game is the mechanic of the numbers within the blue hexes (hard to explain unless you play). It would be cool if you could filter out certain mechanics (especially this one, which requires more counting than the other mechanics) in the infinity mode.Overall, 9.5/10!!!			"

												Hexcells is a logic game that plays like a crazy version of Minesweeper. The core levels have been specifically designed so that there are no 'guesses' required and that if you figure out the logic correctly, all moves are 100% certainties. I love logic games and figured I was quite good at them - but this one humbled me. Lots of times I got stumped and it was a relief when you cracked the next move. Embarrassingly I had to resort to youtube a couple times to see how other people figured out the logic chain. This version of Hexcells (this is the third I believe), also has a random puzzle generator (hence the 'Infinite' part of the name) which is also fun, but not specifically designed.Basically a great game for anyone who loves figuring out logic puzzles. One small improvement that I personally would have liked was a hint on where to start a given level. Some levels, especially the later ones, have so many cells that it takes so long just to figure out where to start. That's not very fun to me, but who knows, the game has proven I am a simpleton.

												Basically it's just more of the hexcells plus, but this time most of the level design is great. It has a good ballance between challenge and dumb basic math grinding. Though, 2nd and 3rd levels from the end are so big and grindy â you start to lose your focus and make dumbest mistakes near completion. New infinite mode obviously feels artificial, compared to the main ones, and lacks any ""story-logic"", due to generation nature, but sometimes it can give you utmost bizzare linear-puzle levels, sending you all acroass the board with every step. Those are good enough to combine into 7th zone in the main campaign.			"

												--Revised Review--So, after getting some other replies commenting that I wasn't giving fair review to the game, I've decided to give  another shot before revising the review. I brewed some coffee, have some nice cookies on plate. Clicked the game, headphones on, play time. Things that I noticed, is that this game is incredibly logical. Horsemedic (guy who commented) was right, this game is entirely made out of logic, to the point of ridiculousness. One of the rule, ""-#- means that blue numbers of panels are NOT connected"", sounds quite simple, but when you think about it, this phrase DID NOT say ""ALL blue panels are NOT connected"". Which means, there is at least one panel that isn't next to each other, but has no guarantee in -3- as this can have 3 blue panels that are not connected, or have pair that is next each to other and have one separated. While this only make the game confusing, it still is, following the rule of the game.Further that I played, I noticed that this ""hole"" of the rule isn't conflicting the game at all. If you get stuck, you can look for other clues. Eventually you'll hit the spot you were stuck on, but with more clues to help out. I've already said in the last review but the graphic and music are top notch. I like the color use of this game, it's gentle and comfortable to see it for long time. Music is very relaxing, good soothing sound.I guess, the only complain that I can make at this point is that I wish there were spread sheet of set of rules instead of explaining it beliefly and let you try it out during the gameplay. (which helps too but isn't very clear sometime) As understanding the set of rules become the most crucial part of this game I think developer could have spent a little more time for it. Maybe, on the first Hexcell, it might have been more user friendly. I haven't tried it yet.As a last note, this is NOT a minesweeper. Who ever said it is, did not think enough through like me. The format is very close to it, I agree, but the minesweeper somtime takes you to a gamble while Hexcell can make ""educated guess"" to clear without making single mistake. So let me say it again- this game, is NOT a minesweeper. It is more like a Sudoku. Don't expect be like one; this game has no timer, nor any score system for it. Take your time. Grab coffee or tea. Rewind your brain and take the challenge. I recommend this game.			"

												Hexcells Infinite, like the other hexcell games, still follows the same gameplay. Basically a mix of minesweeper and sudoku. The game has nice background music like the others and this particular game has an added feature where you can play custom puzzles. However, where this game fails for me is itâs made the same mistake as hexcells plus. While the original hexcells had a nice difficulty curve, this one's all over the place. I actually enjoyed playing the first hour and I thought they'd redeemed themselves from hexcells plus. I was getting stuck, but still progressing which makes the game fun. But the levels difficulties are all over the place. For example one level introduced a new concept and gave you an incredibly easy puzzle to make sure you understand it. Then just the level after it throws you into this massive puzzle with numbers all over the place and I'm just sitting there thinking, I can't be bothered with this. It becomes more of a grind and loses its fun. I think it would have been nice for the dev to add a mid-level save so you can come back later; some of these levels are massive and will take a long time.I'm also very disappointed that they added a ? cell. It's so cheap because it forces you to solve the puzzle in only one possible way. It can also be so disheartening; you might spend a solid 5 minutes to find a cell you can make progress on only to uncover it as a ? so you can no longer progress any further down that route.However, do I think this game is worth buying? Yes! Solely because you can play custom levels. It offers more than the other hexcells games. So, although there are some things wrong with this game I can still say it's worth buying. "

												The second addition to the original Hexcells game.AddendumIf you love Hexcells that much, that you can't stop playing it, then I have a solution for you and you are sitting right in front of it: Hexcells Infinite. Not only does this game add new puzzles for you to solve, it also adds a random generator for you to enter a random seed and get solving! Too much time on your hand? Don't worry, there are many, and I mean MANY, puzzles waiting to be solved by pure logic and process of elimination. Happy Solving for infinity and beyond!Here is my original Review for ""Hexcells"".Originally posted by Enix:A compelling puzzlegame, as an obvious big brother of Minesweeper.ContentMany puzzles await your solving. Go through different levels of difficulty and solve all of the puzzles to get to 100%. Can you get every one with no mistakes?Hexcells (apparent from the name) adds new dimensions to the classical game of Minesweeper: More adjacent fields to one hexagon as well as border numbers, which indicate how many fields of the pattern are in a line/row/diagonale. Each boder number can indicate different things, everything is explained within the game. No need to rush things. You are now thinking outside of hexcells.Sound & MusicShallow but fitting background soundtracks and sounds. Nothing special, but that wasn't needed here. The soundtrack and soundeffects change every once and a while when you complete a puzzle.GraphicsDon't expect anything here. The game is primarily a puzzle game, so no high end graphics or effects. The design does its deeds and fulfills its task. Visuals are never irritating and do what they need to do.WeakpointsSometimes, portions of the soundtrack are a little too high-pitched in my opinion. This can get annoying, if you are not used to hearing the same sounds over and over again. They are adjustable ingame though, from soundeffects only to completely mute.Concluding ThoughtsGreat puzzlegame, compelling, challenging, tricky but fair. Nice soundtrack, nice sounds, simple gameplay yet sometimes mindwreckingly hard. Don't worry, if you are the enthusiastic puzzle type of gamer, you will get used to loving this game! "

												The Hexcells games are a wonderful little puzzle series that I have enjoyed playing thoroughly. It's easy to understand, its art style and design is very fluent, and I find it very satisfying when I get the smooth responses after I click on a hexagon and the little orange particles fall down to reveal the black underneath or the blue fades in from the centre. The price is very reasonable, so if you're considering purchasing this series, there's nothing stopping you.Pros:- CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP- Easy to learn, a little hard to master but hey, there wouldn't be a point in playing if it wasn't- Well-made, fluent design- THIS GAME HAS A LEVEL GENERATOR- Addictive, takes quite a bit of energy for me to not play just one more puzzle- Can also be a casual and soothing experienceCons:- Why do you pan the sound effects oh my god I hate it so much - *mutes sound and just listens to youtube playlists*- The other two games didn't have level generators :cSolid 10/10, really liked this puzzle game.

												One of the games I keep coming back to in my free time. I like a good puzzle with simple rules. I've played both of the previous titles in this series, which I really enjoyed. This particular game takes it up a notch and has definitely provided more or a challenge. The random puzzle generator provides an almost limitless number of games to enjoy, although the depth and complexity aren't quite as deep or difficult compared to the pre-generated puzzles. Still a good game to come back to when you're just watching something on the side and need something to click or to keep your brain going.			"

												This is the third in a series of puzzle games, with this one being the clearly superior production out of the three.  I say this because, like the first game, it gives a short tutorial level for any of the gameplay mechanics that are necessary to play the game.  However, unlike the first game, which developed these aspects much more gradually with several easy levels, this game starts applying these ideas at more advanced difficulty and application quite quickly.  This is a good thing in my view, since like all of the other games in the series, each one only has 36 designed levels for you to solve.  If too much time is spent walking the player through the gameplay, not enough time can be spent on levels that challenge all of the aspects the player had to learn to make it that far.  The last few levels were quite challenging, and I was happy to tackle and master them.  All of them could be solved logically without guessing, but it took me some time working out what combination of information available to me would let me click or destroy the next block.  One aspect I was immensely thankful for was that the developers put in a level save feature, so whatever progress you made already could be saved for later, giving you a chance to take a break and come back to the place you had got stuck on.  You could jump inbetween levels, making progress until you hit a roadblock, and then switch your focus somewhere else.  It helped me tremendously.  What ices the cake for me and gives this title the most value out of the others is that there is a puzzle generator for this game.  Very similar to how you can find websites to solve nigh infinite combinations of Sudoku puzzles, you can generate all of the puzzles you could ever want to do for this game.  The only flaw is that the puzzles are immensely easier than the ones with a human touch, and there's no way to select if you want a smaller, easier puzzle or a larger, more difficult puzzle.  It's all randomly generated with no way to set parameters for the puzzle you get (unless you look up specific codes, if there would be any of those listed somewhere in the first place).  Either way, I have enjoyed the trilogy, and can always come back to this one in the series if I want to play new puzzles.			"

												Fantastic game to flex your mind. All puzzles are solveable, unlike minesweeper. No guesswork! Once you've done all of the puzzles present in the game, you can either do randomly generated puzzles (fun for a bit, but, eh, not the most important bit here) and, fantastically, custom levels! Would for sure reccommend buying pack for all the games as they all have different, intersting puzzles.			"

												Hexcells Infinite is a nice ending to the Hexcells trilogy.  It builds on the mechanics of the last games by adding in a new tile type and a level generator that gives the game its name.(technically there are a finite number of puzzles in the generator, but it's more than any player could need)  My one issue with this game is that some of the main-game puzzles seem to require guessing.  The original Hexcells allowed you to beat all of the puzzles simply by reasoning out the information they give you, but some of the puzzles in this game simply don't give you enough information to do that.

												Really enjoy playing this game, the levels get really challenging really fast and if you want to beat them with 0 mistakes and not restarting a lot, you have to buckle up and think hard! The random level generator, and the ability to share the random generated levels, will make you come back to this title and keep playing it! I also made a  Video   about it.

THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 | 2 *3*] = ~88% (75%-100%)I recommend that you buy the Hexcells Complete Pack with all 3 games - that's why this review text is identical for all 3.It's a great puzzle game series that strongly reminds of Microsoft Minesweeper, but not only is the grid hexagonal (meaning 3 instead of 2 axes), the games even go well beyond mere neighbor-field estimation.The levels eventually get very hard, and the procedural mode in ""Hexcells Infinite"" that exists in addition to the hand-crafted levels all three games have is a bit too chaotic (and hard) for my personal taste - well, it's procedural, its levels are not nicely designed and organized like the other levels.Anyway, since I wanted more of the easier puzzles and especially of the feature that numbers at the grid's periphery say something about the grid's content, I made a (very crappy) puzzler[dreamspace-president.com] in a few hours after finishing the Hexcells games that helps a bit with those needs.Hey, Matthew Brown, if you ever make a game like this again, I'm very likely to buy it, and I bet there's a bunch of people out there who think alike.For those who like this kind of puzzle game, I can't recommend the Hexcells games enough.

												Easily one of the best puzzle games on Steam. Unlike some reviewers have said, all of the puzzles can be solved by logic only and there is no need to guess.The hand-crafted puzzles are more challenging than the randomly generated puzzles, which is somewhat unfortunate especially as you quickly start to notice certain patterns repeating in the generated puzzles. Despite that the randomly generated puzzles are fun and you can always play fan created levels for extra challenge.			"

												It's pretty much minesweeper but instead with squares it's with hexagons along with other hurdles and mechanics into the mix.Good puzzle game. Base and Plus are good too as they basically Easy and Medium, respectively, and get the bundle for all three. Worth the money.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.			"

												Traditional Rating - 95/100Recommendation - The Best Hexcells Yet!Remember the free old Windows game Minesweeper? Remember how fun it was finding those hidden mines, and how you could feel your brain scream ""NOOOOOOOOOOO"" whenever a mine would pop its stupid head up and kill you? Remember how immensely frustrating it was when it was entirely impossible to solve levels without guessing?WELL, NO MORE! Hexcells to the rescue. Hexcells is very similar to Minesweeper in that you have to use various clues and reasoning to find the hidden blue cells on each level, but unlike Minesweeper, Hexcells' soultions can ALWAYS be reasoned, and if you're doing it right you will never have to guess.The levels start out easy, with simple rules and puzzles, but new tricks are added just regularly enough to fully grasp, and before you know it, you'll find yourself scanning through 15 different criteria to find the 1-in-100 blue cell to start a level off. It's very satisfying.Speaking of satisfying, the puzzles here never seem overwhelming or too tricky. Take my opinion with a grain of salt (since I have always loved games like this), but the level of difficulty in these puzzles was just perfect, and while some levels did force me to stare at them for a while, the solution was always there somewhere just waiting for me to grab it.The Hexcells series is really 3 games: Hexcells, Hexcells Plus, and Hexcells Infinite. They each have different puzzles, and they are each worth getting, but Hexcells Infinite is the one to get if you're on a budget. It has the most advanced puzzles, and it includes a random level generator, so you can literally play to your heart's content. All 3 of them will slowly progress you through the mechanics of the game, though, so don't feel like you will be overwhelmed if you jump right into Infinite.It's worth mentioning that the random levels in Infinite are mere pale shadows compared to the premade levels (they are often quite easy), but for fans that cannot get enough and don't want to go back to the guess-fest Minesweeper, they can be a lot of fun.I highly recommend this game. If you're a fan of logic-based puzzle games, you can't go wrong with any of these 3 games. The prices are cheap, and the series is rather unique. If the devs could have just tightened up the infinite level generator ever-so-slightly, this game might be the only game I've rated to pass Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons.Scratch that Minesweeper itch, my friend!

You might like if: You lost far too many hours playing Minesweeper back in the day - and want that all over again.Not a bad game (but could be more fiendish). Imagine if Minesweeper met Nonograms and had hexagonal babies... then you're close.Pure deductive logic. The solutions are unique and reasonably tricky, but fair. There's no trick questions or guessing. If you're used to Japanese deductive puzzles (like Kakuro or Ken Ken) then ignore the previous 2 iterations and jump straight to this one.Unfortunately the 'infinite' puzzles are a bit inconsistent. Many lack much of a challenge, meaning you can kinda mindlessly click through them, akin to Minesweeper: relaxing but not overly taxing. Whether that's a bad thing ultimately depends on what you're looking for. If you want something quite gentle, this'll tick it perfectly. If not... how much are 36 puzzles worth to you?If you want to up the ante and hit a really fiendish puzzler; a game called 'Patterna' has surfaced on Greenlight (funnily enough, inspired by Hexcells!) - A demo is freely available, so I'd recommend giving it a peek:

PROS:+ satisfying gameplay+ really nice UI & menu+ relaxing soundtrack+ more chalenging than original Hexcells+ infinite level generator in Infinite modeCONS:- you have to guess what to do next in manycases- can get a repetitive feel when played for a longer whileComment:An okay game that makes you think more and more as the levels progress. And think infinitely when playing the random levels that are generated. Overall it is a good ""time waster"" when you have a couple of minutes to play. Hexcells had a couple of points where you would more or less just guess what tile to choose. Hexcells Plus had a lot of this and it can be really frustrating. Hexcells Infinite is a middle ground netween the two. They fixed most of the complaints I had before, a level can be exited and continued later and there is as many levels as you dare to play. I very recommend this to anyone who likes logic games. Also worth mentioning are two prequels, all three games can be bought in a nice bundle.			"

												Hexcells Infinite is the third and last game in series, with new 36 mind boggling levels which will keep you preoccupied for quite a while. No new mechanics are added compared to previous games, if you played them you know what to expect but that is not necessary in order to enjoy this one.It is Minesweeper-like game where your goal is to decipher the pattern and mark the blue cells by gradually eliminating empty ones. They contain numbers which show how many blue cells are adjacent to them. New rules are introduced which add to game complexity, such as number of cells in columns, clusters of cells that must be separated from each other or adjacent to one another and blue cells with numbers which show how many of them are located in a 2 hex radius. I completed the game in slightly less than 8 hours. Much of it were spent in staring at the screen in order to find which cells to eliminate. Ending levels are really big and spotting sometimes obvious solution can be quite tricky.The biggest change is introduction of an Infinite mode, you can play as many random generated levels as you want. Your brain cells will be happy, your free time surely will not.			"

												Without a doubt the best puzzle game available on steam right now.Hexcells Infinite is just that: infinite.I did the math. It would take a player about 1,141 and half years (with a 6 minute per puzzle average) to exhaust every available puzzle, and that's assuming that they never eat, sleep, or take any breaks. If you were to buy just one installment of the Hexcells franchise, it would be a mistake not to get this one. It simply has the greatest value per dollar spent. (roughly 228 years of gameplay per dollar if you were wondering, and that's not even when it's on sale.)Numbers aside, this game is an absolute masterpiece. From the minimal sound effects to the tranquil soundtrack, the sound design is spot on and keeps the player engaged. The gameplay is heavily influenced by japanese logic games and minesweeper, but it still manages to feel completely original and unique. More importantly, the concept is easy to learn and it only takes a few minutes for a new player to get used to the gameplay and environment. And that's not even the best part - the best part is that it NEVER feels impossible to solve. More often than not, when a player makes a mistake, they immediately realize what they did wrong. Even if you feel like you're stuck, there's always that one number you missed that tells you where to look. This game is like a great magician, in the sense that a great magician leaves nothing to chance despite how wildly impossible their act may seem. If you love puzzle games, Hexcells Infinite is a must for your Steam library.I give this game a 9.8/10.Not a perfect score for the following reasons:- Highlighting an external grid number underneath another highlighted external grid number works OKAY, but I'm sure there are better options than white on white lines.- You can make any number of mistakes on the infinite puzzles without facing any sort of penalty. Maybe I'm just being nitpicky at this point, but it just seems like a loose end in an otherwise flawless game. They could at least have it set up in a way where the puzzle doesn't count as completed if you make 3 or more mistakes.Suggestions:- Themes! I'm talking unlockable themes, different hex colors, player-created backgrounds, custom cursors, and so on. This game would certainly benefit from workshop access and, dare I say, skins. It'd be nice to have a change in scenery after playing with the same background and color scheme for hours.			"

This series goes beyond your normal Minesweeper in the fact that clues will often involve more then the directly adjacent tiles  i.e. columns, diagonals, non-continuous, continuous only, double spaces, etc... If you get Infinite, it boasts an infinite puzzle generator that was some estimated 999,999,999 random puzzles to try so, good luck with that.

												This is a fun little puzzle game where you basically play as a minesweeper in a world of hexagons. You have to figure out which spaces have a bomb thingy (the game doesn't say what it is) from the numbers of the spaces around them. If a space has a one, it means there's one bomb thingy. It's kind of hard to explain, and the game will do it anyway. In my opinion, this is the best Hexcells game out of the three. It brings the trilogy to a satisfying conclusion. Once you finish all of the main puzzles, you can just play with the randomly generated ones for hours and hours. This game is totally worth it on sale. I bought it for $1.49, and it's well worth it.			"

												If you don't like this game then you're stupid.  I mean that in a literal sense -- your IQ must not be high enough to understand it.Years ago there used to be this board game ""Mastermind"".  It was hard as hell, you had to deduce the colors that  your opponent had chosen and was hiding behind a tiny screen.  To make it more difficult, you could have blanks.  You had a limited number of guesses to deduce what the colors were.Flash forward 20 years to the game ""Minesweeper"" included with Windows '95.  In that game, as many of us remember, you had to figure out which of the hidden squares on a grid held a mine and which did not.  You were told, given an empty square, how many mines bordered that square.Hexcells Infinite is a wonderful combination of both.  It requires focus, patience, and some abstract reasoning abiliity.  Some evenings, after a long day at work (or working two jobs), I actually find it pretty relaxing to be able to focus my thoughts on something else.  My mind never shuts down, it is always thinking about something.  Other thank alcohol or other illicit drugs, this game is one of the great ways to derail my thinking from all of the stresses in my life.I've played about 15 hours so far and have not solved the game.  This is because you need to achieve a certain level of perfection on each level.  For every error you make, you earn fewer points. You need a certain number of points in order to ""open"" a different, more complex level.  You will definitely finding yourself approaching levels over and over trying to achieve perfection.  But it doesn't feel like grinding, not one bit.The numbers that you reveal can be coded in different ways.  One way means that there are that many mines bordering that hex.  Another means that there are that number of mines bordering the hex, but they are in sequence (for example, -2-).  Another means that there are that number of minuntes bordering the hex, but they are not next to each other (for example, [3]).  There are several other different notations and on many levels the game gives you just enough (JUST enough) information to deduce the layout of the hexes.Thoroughly enjoyable.  There is also a daily randomly generated hexcell grid that you can generate, but even without this the replay value will be medium to high if you give yourself enough time to forget the layout of the grids.A wonderful little game, high recommended.

												Hexcells Infinite is not really a full game, it's basically just a level pack. That doesn't stop it from being awesome, though, this game is worth it's price just in the audio alone. The game might remind you of Minesweeper, but unlike that luck based ""puzzle"", you will never have to guess what's under any of the hexes. If you don't know what to do, then it's all your own fault. If you haven't played Hexcells or Hexcells Plus, then I would recommend that you try those first. The difficulty curve is much steeper in this last one. If you have played the other games, this one adds a pack of even more challenging levels, and an amawing level generator that adds virtually infinite replayability.If you want a good puzzle game, buy this, now. Buy the whole series. You wont regret it.			"

												I absolutely love this. It is similar to minesweeper in that there are bombs and numbers, but this game leaves minesweeper in the dust. Some info says how many bombs in an area, in a line, or if the bombs are consecutive. Also, they have the awesome question mark cell that doesn't give you any info for an extra challange. Each cell has up to six adjacent cells. Every puzzle is solvable without guessing but I didn't believe it when I first started. There are 36 designed levels and an infinite number of randomly generated cells. I will admit, I wish the randomly generated cells were harder. Sadly, it is random and you are much more likely to get a puzzle you can solve in 6 mn than the best ones that take over a half an hour. If you want proof how awesome this game is, here are some numbers from the achievements. 32.9% of people solved all the designed levels on perfect and 26.2% played over 60 randomly generated games. Obviously everyone else loves this too given how many people just kept playing it.			"

												Most of the puzzles are genius and solving them purely through logic is a joy. On top of that the deisng and music is a realy pleasure.That being said, there are two elements that completely spoil the fun of puzzle solving. One is accidentally guessing, the other is being forced to guess.By accidental guessing, I mean when you click a cell and it tell you you're wrong. Well, there's only two choices, so being wrong is the equivilent of using a hint button. There is no alternative in the game to solving the puzzles this way, and I often spoiled a puzzle by simply mixing up which button was which.Accidental guessing is forgivable, what really bothered me about this game is that certain puzzles cant be solved without guessing. Which is a real let down after spending a couple hours working on something only to discover that the solution can't be parsed without using the 'hint' feature.			"

												Okay, so this is basically where the fun stops entirely for me at this point. Have played through Hexcells, loved it. Played Hexcells Plus which was just a more bloated version of Hexcells with dumbly increased puzzle sizes and no extra creativity or requirement to thinking added and this one is no different. Compared to the original you just have stupidly large puzzles that's only purpose it is to keep you busy searching for an opening instead of actually requiring you to think. That's just plain stupidâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥Call it out as what it is, garbage. Cheap. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. Definitely no recommendation for this one, although they finally took some MUCH needed fixes to this version of the game. Smaller puzzle sizes with cleverly thought out connections would have been a big improvement but no, instead we get about 300 tile big puzzles in every level again. Save yourself the money, it's not worth a single cent.			"

												Hexcells is, on the most basic level, a more sophisticated version of Minesweeper. You are given a layout of golden hex tiles, possibly with one or more of them already highlighted or flipped. Flipped tiles have numbers on them, and also labels indicating whether or not adjacent tiles which should be highlighted are continuous or non-continuous (or no designator at all). There are also row and column labels which allow you to see how many tiles need to be highlighted in any given row or column.Each puzzle mixes these up in a unique way to push you to solve it.Thinking about this game as a more sophisticated version of minesweeper is, I think, fairly ideal, because that is more or less what it is, and the function it serves. It is something to throw away a bit of time on, not sit down and play continuously.It is about as fun as Minesweeper is, and Iâd basically consider it filling that role in your game library.The sequels get steadily harder, and unfortunately, I'm not 100% sure all the puzzles are solvable without guessing - there were a few points where I got stuck and the only way forward seemed to be taking a guess. That happened on only a small fraction of the puzzles, but I'm not sure if I was simply not good enough, or if they are legitimately ambiguous.My advice? Pass. It isnât a bad puzzle game, but it isnât anything remarkable either. If you did get it as part of a bundle or something, it isnât a terrible thing to install and just screw around with when youâd mess around with solitaire or minesweeper or whatever, but I wouldnât go out of my way to buy this.

												The first and most obvious comparison of Hexcells is to Minesweeper, with two extra sides, and that's what you're going to get. Minesweeper is great for killing a few moments, from the basic versions in Windows 2000 and XP to the shiny new ones in 7 and 10. Start menu, ""mines"", press Enter, and away you go. Even when the hardest difficulty defeats me time and time again, I still find myself looking for it over Solitaire or Hearts.So why does the ""ambient logic"" of Hexcells annoy me so much? Well, if you've picked up on how pretentious that quoted phrase sounds, you're riding the same wave of boredom that I am.To put it plain, this game feels more like a tumor growing on Minesweeper than any real advancement. It's slow, it's overcomplicated, and it's not really about puzzles. It's about processes of elimination, like Sudoku, and with the pressure to complete every stage without error, you will feel discontent when you have to guess what's behind that next orange tile.Don't kid yourself on this point: if you're looking for any shred of entertainment you'll have to guess. Life is too short to work out every combination and deduce if you're about to â¥â¥â¥â¥ up the tantalizing ""Mistakes: 0"" in the corner when there's regularly 50+ tiles and 10+ column hints to combine. Math majors aside, I don't know who could find that fun.But enough of taking potshots at my humorless peers, let's take potshots at the developer instead. This game really is dead-set on monopolizing your time and attention. Minesweeper is a game to be played for a few minutes, preferably with the ability to quickly background it when something more important pops up (e.g., your boss rounds the corner). You're better off playing it on mute anyway; the audio is annoying and the interface is minimalist to a fault. Quick, exit to the stage select screen without touching the mouse (you can't) and without waiting for the pause menu to fully scroll into view (good luck). On OS X, this game disables every normal exit strategy to simply access another window - Cmd+Tab and Mission Control - and for what reason? Both Microsoft and Apple go to great lengths to disallow this behavior because even with the best of intentions, no application is so important as to block access to everything else. Yes, you can exit with Cmd+Q, yes, you can play it in a window by guessing at keyboard shortcuts, but disabling the ability to use my system as I see fit while it is running is really what made me cross over from indifference into irritation. And with gameplay this shallow, that's the strongest emotion this game musters up.			"

												I enjoyed the original HexCells to an extent, but when I uncovered my first ? hex in Infinite, I felt a bit cheated. A good logic puzzle should not require guesswork to solve, and that annoyed me enough to make me not want to play anymore. Instead of feeling challenged, I saw the ? hex as laziness or a means to suck up more of my time needlessly. For several puzzles, there is no way to solve it without taking a leap of faith. Good puzzle games shouldn't have that.			"

												I was enjoying the game, until world 3-4. At that point, the rules were violated twice in the same puzzle (-3-). This drove the point home of an earlier puzzle where there was an entire solid block of ? cells, requiring me to randomly click and memorize the pattern for the replay. I suppose it would be possible to map the entire puzzle out and model it based on how many pattern cells are remaining, but for a ""casual puzzle game"" I wouldn't be expecting something like that actually be required to proceed.The game is created fairly well, the principles and mechanics are great, but the world puzzles are badly planned out.I did not try the Infinite portion, and since it is the biggest advertised part of the game, perhaps that is the key feature. But I can only imagine that something procedurally generated will be pertinent to the other issues experienced.Edit:As mentioned in the discussion below, I did not understand the mechanics of the game.I will leave this review negative purely on the basis of requiring the developer to more consisely explain the various facets of each rule. No one enjoys having to fail at a game because there was not complete instructions on its mechanics. This remains my only caveat with this game, as my review states in the introduction, I was having fun.I humbly ask the people downvoting this review to reconsider based on the additional pertinent information.

												While Hexcells Plus still is the best of the 3 Hexcells titles(featuring the most balanced puzzle set) more Hexcells is never a bad thing and Infinite is certainly worth picking up. Though having said that, while most definitely recommended, it is not without flaws either.In Infinite there is a difficulty jump in some puzzles, unfortunately in such a way that you feel rewarded by guessing more than in Plus. The obscurity of or mental notation required for some late game ""hints"" without any method to make notations in game(ie: Minesweeper question marks or Sudoku progams often having multiple number entry ""scratch paper"" type options) can feel overwhelming, and hurts the general relaxing ambiance of the series as it introduces an element of frustration not present in the previous two games.The Infinite puzzle generator is also a bit of a bust. While a wonderful idea, the unfortunate truth is that random generated puzzles in this sort of game simply can't compare with hand crafted(and the developer does an excellent job at that). And as there is no difficulty option when generating the puzzles, you are often thrown a near endless parade of fairly simple(and overly large for that simplicity) boards. Rather than the random generator, being able to access player designed puzzle might be a better option for extending the life of the game, be it through workshop integration or simply allowing a puzzle editor that would provide a sharable code as the random seed generator does now.Anyway, bottom line is this: Any Hexcells is amazing, but if you have to choose between one of the three go with Plus still. The original is far too easy and Infinite simply isn't quite as elegant as Plus's puzzles.			"

												The whole Hexcells series is great, but Infinite really completes the trilogy perfectly. The basic Minesweper-like premise of uncovering and filling in hexagons based on numerical clues remains, but the premade puzzles are more well thought out than ever. You are able to save your progress and come back later, a welcome addition, as well as restarting without having to exit the level entirely. The infinite puzzle generator is the real draw of this game, and it does not disappoint. The algorithm doesn't generate puzzles that are quite as clean and stripped down as the main game; there are often redundant clues. This also means they tend to be easier, though, which comes as a relief to me after spending an hour unsuccessfully wrestling with a level 6 puzzle. I was a little apprehensive about the procedurally generated levels; I was reminded of Minesweeper's frequent guesses and subsequent frustration. There's no guessing required, though, at least in the levels I played. Really, having played the other two games in the series, I should have known better. There are daily puzzles (specifically, puzzles using the current date as the seed), and you can also play random puzzles. If you like, you can use the seed of a given puzzle and share it to challenge your friends.All in all, if you like this sort of puzzle game, you should pick up Hexcells Infinite. It's worth it at full price. I'd recommend getting the others as well. Hexcells seems fairly easy to me in retrospect, but Hexcells Plus is every bit as hard as this game.			"

												If you liked the first two games, then this game is an easy buy!Unlike the past two games, this one is most assuredly going to stump you (especially if you're going for Perfectionist - no mistakes in the campaign) and frustrate you. This one will definitely challenge you, and they definitely did their best to deliver a truly deserving finale.As an addition, there are an 'infinite' number of additional games (past the handcrafted campaign ones, these seem a bit computer-generated, even using a seed). These puzzles are easier - you dont need to worry about making mistakes since those aren't being counted and just click away - but in a way, I can appreciate the option of having a load of extra puzzles to enjoy after having gone through the entirety of the game.This one will last you longer than the other two combined, either because of the increased difficulty or the increased number of puzzles to go through. All in all, a good way to end the series.			"

												Another great addition to the hexcells line! The acceleration of difficulty in the puzzles is not quite as steep as in Hexcells Plus, so you could start with Hexcells Infinite without first playing Hexcells. (I recommended practicing with Hexcells before diving into Hexcells Plus.) This edition comes with a really neat feature to generate puzzles randomly (hence the ""infinite""), which provides endless hours of puzzle-solving fun! My only complaint is that the randomly generated puzzles seem to be relatively easy, for the most part, due to a lot of duplicated/unnecessary information provided. I don't know what sort of algorithm the authors use to generate the puzzles, but if the algorithm is flexible enough, it would be nice if the amount of information provided could be customized so that players could choose their difficulty level. Otherwise, Hexcells Infinite is a great puzzler that I'm sure I will be enjoying for a long time to come.			"

												The main point of this final entry in the Hexcells series is a random puzzle generator and the ability to play custom levels. The generator does OK, but the generated puzzles are a bit easy. To make custom levels, you must use the third-party Sixcells level editor.The content in this game is a level pack for Hexcells Plus. I found the earlier levels to be a little easier than in Hexcells Plus, and the later levels to be a bit harder.Unlike Hexcells Plus, Hexcells Infinite doesn't add any new mechanic, but it does make a welcome UI tweak to the numbered blue cells, by making the border of the guide easier to see.

												Hexcells Infinite adds what the first two games most needed; a level generator. Hexcells and Hexcells Plus each had 36 AMAZING hand-built puzzles of ever-increasing difficulty, but once you completed the puzzles with no more than 1 mistake each, that was it. The game went back on the shelf.Hexcells Infinite also has 36 well-crafted hand-built puzzles, but once those are done you can keep playing with randomly-generated levels. If you buy only one of the trilogy, get this one.To the developer(s): There are a couple things I'd still like to see improved.1 - The randomly generated levels vary widely in difficulty and in how long they take to solve. I like to play Hexcells during a 15-minute break at work, and I'd like to be sure I can solve a puzzle in that time. So I'd like to see some size and difficulty settings when generating levels. It would also be nice to be able to disable some of the mechanics, like line clues and blue cell clues, when generating levels.2 - Just a small UI annoyance. When you go to the Infinite screen to start a random level, it always has 000000 as its seed. You have to click ""use a random seed"" and then ""start"". I almost always want to use a random seed, so just pre-populate it with one and save me a step.3 - Eventually I'd like to see player-built levels (and even worlds/series of levels) be an option. Random maps are great, but I bet some of your players could come up with really awesome, brain-wrenchingly difficult, beautiful puzzles. Steam has tools (Community Workshop) that make sharing user-created content easy. If this has to be done in a 4th title, then I'll be happily buying another Hexcells game when it's finished.			"

												Hexcells Infinite does it again, marking yet another great entry in the Hexcells series. Just like its predecessors, it features fantastic Minesweeper-like mechanics that are supplemented with different methods of revealing information about the solutions to its well-designed puzzles. It also features that same ambient-style soundtrack that leaves players both relaxed and focused. One small but appreciated addition is the ability to quickly restart puzzles and save progress on the current puzzle. It's especially great for taking a break from those bigger puzzles.The difficulty here, save for a puzzle or two, felt slightly easier than Hexcells Plus. I'm not sure if this is actually due to the hours of practice I've put into the first two games, but regardless I'd recommend at least playing through the original Hexcells before taking on Infinite.My reviews of the previous games contained complaints about having a limited replay value and, even as well-crafted as the game's pre-designed puzzles are, this is still an issue. But now the game tries to counter that with its Infinite mode, creating randomly generated puzzles to provide an infinite amount of content.The only problem with this is that many of the puzzles generated are nowhere near as satisfying to play as the ones included with the game. Few of them approach the challenge and cleverness of these pre-arranged puzzles. Playing the randomly-generated puzzles makes one appreciate the care the designer took to make the pre-built puzzles enjoyable. In spite of this, it's hard to complain: Infinite mode is just icing on the cake and is something that will likely make me keep this game installed for quite a while even though I've mastered all the built-in levels.The bottom-line is that Hexcells is a brilliant game series and Infinite is, while not the most challenging entry, the best entry yet. It's easy to recommend for anyone who enjoys logic-based puzzles.			"

												Hexcells Infinite is easily my favorite logic puzzle game at the moment. I strongly recommend it to both casual and hardcore puzzle fans. While I've never played the two previous games, I've also never played a puzzle game that so elegantly turns simplicity into difficulty without any sort of contrived pressures such as time limits or fail states. You'll go from feeling like Aristotle to agonized trying to faultlessly solve later levels.Some describe it like Minesweeper, but I have no attachment to minesweeper. I never even understood it until a friend explained it to me in my 2nd year of college. You just deduce (and in my experience, with enough thought you'll never need to guess and check) where blue and gray hexes are in a field of uncovered, yellow ones. It's simple, but grows fairly deep as new mechanics are added.Between the 36 handmade levels and the practically infinite levels, Hexcells Infinite packs more than enough content for me to recommend it at a full price. While it begins easy and ends quite hard, there's no fail state, so you can play as carelessly or cautiously as you wish. It also has some of the best puzzle mechanics for such a simple foundation such that it doesn't need to necessarily increase the number hexes to increase the difficulty of a level. The designers deserve a lot of praise, as the later levels are able to both hide and provide information, cleverly entwining hints and further complexity into one hex. It's casual, for sure, as it doesn't pressure you. I like this, because some of the levels truly frustrate me. If anything, it actively tries to sooth you with its clean and calm ambiance.			"

												The best, most brain-busting game in the hexcell ""trilogy""... at least for the main, ""campaign"" puzzles. If you're looking for is many hours spent staring at yellow, grey, and blue hexagons, wondering for five straight minutes where the next move is, then this is made for you, but if you're hoping for perpetual puzzling potential, then move along.Be aware that the problem with the infinite mode is my only complaint. This is still a great game, but since the infinite mode is such a big part of the game that it's in the title, it has to be addressed.The campaigns through all three games have a good number of memorable puzzles, some of which employ excellent variations in implimenting of the game's hint mechanics, but no such thing can be found in the infinite mode. Infinite puzzles are all bland, unmemorable blobs, and they offer no surprises in how they combine various hints. After playing about 15 infinite puzzles, you can be fairly confident that you have seen everything infinite can offer you in terms of challenge--even if it can challenge you at all. If you've managed to complete the entire campaign honestly, working to understand complex chains of hints, then most infinite puzzles should be trivial to complete.A trivial puzzle is not a fun puzzle.So, yes. If you love puzzles, buy this game, but don't expect to be playing it for months and remain entertained.			"

The game is also very polished with smooth graphics, and a nice touch of having sound effects for clicking squares synchronized with the background music.Overall maybe not a revolutionary game, but similar to patience, mahjong, minesweeper etc. it's a nice game to play from time to time.

												Get all three and Squarecells! Some of the best puzzle games I've ever played. Great for casual gamers and 'hardcore' gamers alike. Each puzzle is lovingly crafted and a really well done tutorial. I love this game, can't stop. The seeded runs aren't as well done as the actual levels, but no one can expect someone to make over 9 milion perfect levels. Perfect way to pass time.  Matthew Brown is an amazing puzzle game maker, and he has proved that he deserves my money for his games. No bugs, no real patchs, the biggest problem is that there isn't a big settings menu, but this type of game doesn't really need one. With the seeded levels, any arguments of lack of content are completely null. If you need to get more proof of how good it is, look up Nerdcubed's video on it. His video caused me to buy all three. I bought Squarecells when it came out and I can say it's great as well.After you buy these games, you can thank me.			"

												The last and best in the Hexcells series (so far, in case it's going to be continued) provides the same kind of gameplay as Hexcells Plus did, but gives you now 3 crucial features:- Steam cloud lets you continue your progress where you left off on another computer or after formatting- Continue puzzles in progress (instead of having to go at it again from the beginning)- Puzzle Generator: after ""beating"" the preset levels you can now play levels generated from one of 1 000 000 000 seedsAlthough there are no new mechanics introduced and I think the proximity mechanic (which at least for me takes a decent amount of time for counting and double-checking) is overused, this is a solid game with the Puzzle Generator giving it a lot of replayability if you just cannot get enough of the basic puzzle principle. I recommend picking it up in a bundle along with the other 2 in a sale.			"

												For the uninitiated, Hexcells Infinite is a game where you improve your logic and extend your patience as you purge through cells of impurities by discovering where the âminesâ are with the help of numbers. In short, this is the minesweeper of the new generation.Hexcells Infinite provides enjoyment for both newcomers and veterans alike. Newcomers can enjoy the slow romp of increasing difficulty that teaches you the mechanics of the game. With veterans, they can immediately jump right into the tougher puzzles via Infinite Mode, which gives you difficult random generated puzzles, without concerning themselves with finishing the easier ones (that the newcomers are meant to finish).Having Hexcells Infinite invalidates the existence of the 2 previous Hexcells games. The previous 2 titles end up only existing as a way of gifting to your friends and supporting the developers. This is absolutely fine because Hexcells Infinite is the next step in its evolution as a game sequel. Everything you need and more is in this definitive sequel.Ultimately, this is game that is an expertly made for the expert to be. It has evolved in the right direction and should be played & kept by many for generations to come.			"

												Nice and ""pure"" (minimalistic) puzzler.Hexcells Infinite is the latest and best of the Hexcells-triology.The puzzles are much harder than in the very first Hexcells (IMHO).But, some nice features made it in: one can save the state of a puzzle at any given time, and restarting a puzzle is easier too (no more going back to the main-menu).Additionally, there are tons (1.000.000) of random puzzles.While the random puzzles vary in difficulty and are (obviously) not hand-crafted as the official levels, the random challenges still add some more hours of fun.PS: The whole series is a good example on how one idea evolves over time and the game becomes better and more fine-tuned.

												Best of the Hexcells series! Still a glorious twist/evolution of the minesweeper logic puzzles this one presents the most brainbending of puzzles. This is complemented by an awesome infinity mode giving close to unlimited randomized puzzles. Even though these seldom are as interesting as the crafted ones the addition is really nice. Highly recommend starting with the first one and playing through the entire series (Hexcells, Hexcells Plus and Hexcells Infinite).5/5			"

												Possibly one of the best puzzle games of all time. The hand crafted puzzles offer are a challenge and will no doubt make you think logically. If you just want to finish the game, then it might not take you that long, but I personally believe that the game is meant to be played like a perfectionist. It is far more fun and rewarding to attempt to finish every puzzle without making a single mistake. That will take you a few hours, if not more. After finishing all of the puzzles, you can then move onto the infinite mode, where there are enough puzzles to last you a lifetime. As one might expect, the puzzles are in no way superior to the hand crafted ones, but they still offer a fantastic challenge and will challenge you in similar ways to the HexCell puzzles you are used to. If you are a fan of puzzles in any form you can possibly think of, there is no doubt in my mind that HexCells Infinite would be a great game to add to your collection. "

Pros:- Good game for a break- Easy to understand- Challenging, but logical- Every puzzle can be solved without guessing- You can save your progress and return to it later- Nice ambient music and sound effects- Gives you the option to either keep all sounds on, turn off just the music, or turn off all sounds- New infinite option gives you ""infinite"" puzzles to solve I'm going to assume 100,000,000 different puzzles since you can input any number from 00000000 to 99,999,999- The game allows you one mistake without losing pointsCons:- Instead of having an option where you continuously get randomized puzzles, you need to go back to the menu screen and hit ""randomize"" every time you want a new puzzle.- You need to complete 1,000,000,000 puzzles to unlock the final achievement...All things considered:I recommend it.

 all in all cool to have more math and less guessing compared to minesweeper    My explanation:  my computer didnt come with minesweep so now i have this. its cool not really difficult though. correction i searched my computer and it does have minesweeper but after like 4 games of trial and error and reading directions the game is still a guess no matter how right you think you are the mines could be there and could not be there. with this game i was able to win my first randomized game without reading rules (but a general idea to the number indications) and only make like 9 mistakes.

												Hexcells is an expertly-crafted mind-bending game of deduction and observation, reminiscent of two great classic puzzle games, Minesweeper and Picross.Pros+ Fresh gameplay from familiar concepts+ Puzzles do not require guess-work+ A good amount of puzzles - each more challenging than the one before it+ Good difficulty scaling for puzzles+ Includes a procedurally-generated puzzle mode+ Concept is simple and easy to pick up, with good tutorials incorporated into the levels+ Clean minimal UI design keeps the focus on the puzzles+ Good sound design gives the game a tranquil ambienceCons- Tutorial on -#- notation (World 2-1) is a little unclear and misleading (see below)- Dat hidden menu buttonThe -#- Notation (You can skip this if you want)The tutorial in World 2-1 explains that a cell with a notation -2- has 2 blue cells around it that are NOT connected, leading players (or rather, me) to think that NONE of the blue cells around a cell with such notation may be connected.Whereas the -#- notation really means that there is at least one space between the blue cells surrounding this cell - some of the blue cells may still be adjacent, such as in the case of -4-.According to the tutorial, if there is a cell with the notation -3-, it means that there are three blue cells surrounding that cell, each spaced out from another. In truth, the -3- notation means that that are three blue cells surrounding that cell, where at least one of them is spaced out from another. Meaning, it is possible that two out of three of them may still be adjacent.The tutorial did not give false information, it just wasn't clear.Overall9/10			"

What makes Infinite so much better, however, is that unlike the two previous titles, this one has a puzzle generator that will let you replay puzzles that you like, share them with friends, play the day's date's puzzle or generate one randomly.  You can play the game for forever.  It adds so much to the scope of the game.			"

												The third version of this game, following Hexcells and Hexcells plus.Again the basic puzzles are a bit harder than with plus and a LOT harder compared to the first Hexcells.Where plus gave us additional new rules for the puzzles, this sequel doesn't do that. It only perfects the difficulty of what the previous parts had to offer.But why the name ""infinity""? It comes with a Random Puzzle Generator, offering no less than 100.000.000 puzzles. This is where the true replay value shines. Want to share a certain puzzle with a friend? Just give the puzzle grid number to him and he can load it no problem. You can even save a puzzle midway, Something that is lacking in the standard puzzles.All in all a very valuable addition to an already great game. As with the previous two parts, ALL puzzles can be solved by using simple (and sometimes not so simple) logic. You never have to guess to solve something there's always a ""if this needs this, then that must be so or so"". Highly recommended if you enjoyed the previous parts. If you found 'plus' too hard, the random puzzles are a bit less difficult sitting somewhere between the original and plus.			"

The idea of ""infinite levels"" is a nice farewell touch and does not take away from the core game. Still, the randomly generated levels cannot match the brilliance of Matthew Brown's handiwork.

												This is one of my all-time favorite puzzle games! I love all of the Hexcells games, but this is definitely the best, because there's an ""infinite"" category where it will randomly generate puzzles for you. Because of this, you've got the standard amount of puzzles in the game (somewhere around 60-65, I believe), but then you can just keep playing new puzzles forever.It's really great during finals week - I've already procrastinated my way through the main game and 100 of the additional puzzles!13/10, HIGHLY recommended!(I once played this game for 4 continuous hours. I dreamt of little blue and yellow hexagons that night. I don't know if I recommend playing for that long.)			"

												It seems from Hexcells to H. Plus to H. Infinite the games keep getting harder. I consider this a good thing, but I feel like this would be poor place in the series to start. That said, if you're willing to jump into harder puzzles right away, then this is probably the best in the series. It has a mode with infinite or more accurately ""more puzzles than anybody has time to play"", which allows you to keep playing new puzzles for as long as you want after the main puzzles are done. The downside is that the puzzles have differing difficulties and there's no way to say ""generate a medium level puzzle"".As far as gameplay goes, there are no new mechanics from the other games in the series, but I consider that a good thing. The core gameplay was fun, so I'm glad that it wasn't changed. That said, some may feel that this game is essentially the same as the others but with things mixed up a bit. I think if I had bought this first, the other games would feel like more of the same since this offers the 'infinite mode', but since I played it last, I feel like it's a good way to end the series.

All levels can be solved with no guessing, though some of the later levels can take a while to whittle down.  If you're going for perfect scores, doesn't hurt to take screenshots if you mess up so that at least you can get back to where you were.  Feels satisfying when you get those large puzzles down.

The previous two versions, Hexcell and Hexcell Plus are good but only have a set number of static puzzles with little to no replayability. Hexcells Infinite has the same static puzzle game but with an added random puzzle generator. The randoms aren't quite as good as the statics, but still better than nothing new. Plus it has a very relaxing soundtrack.Certainly worth at least $4.99 or even $8.99 for all three. "

												I really like it, but I have a few problems with it I'm gonna list off in hopes that they're corrected in the sequel (if there is one).1. Allow the player to make markings.This is really annoying on larger puzzles when I can't get my bearings correct. Sudoku puzzles and Picross puzzles usually allow one to make markings to the accord of ""maybe something's here,"" or something like that. Really wish for something like that in this game.2. When highlighting numbers in blue hexcells, show blue cells contained within the radius shine brighter.Or something like that. Hard to tell which ones are within and which ones are out due to the lighting. I usually have to click the blue cell a few times.3. Allow the player to undo a move.Not for wrong clicks, no, but sometimes I misclick and end up with a right answer. That just happened to me and I didn't want it to happen. How can I get rid of this damn blue hexagon? Nothing, nothing I can do. And it's really frustrating knowing that I solved a puzzle through a misclick.Other than those dang frustrations, game is great. Scratches that Picross itch and Infinite has a good amount of content.			"

												Third installment of the series.  Nothing too much is different, same idea, another layer of difficulty added halfway through.  I will say the hardest of the series by far, so if you want the challenge and don't want to buy all three games, this is definitely the one to get.  It has the most difficult challenges, and the added benefit of the puzzle generator, so there are endless seeds to play.The nitpick is, however, the random generator is largely puzzle difficulty of the first one, so if you really enjoyed how hard they were in the set stages, the generator may be a disappointment to you.  It may also feel that way after playing the harder ones, then coming down to easier ones just made them feel like a breeze, but many were being solved between 2-10 minutes, compared to the main stage puzzklles that would some take me 2 hours.I absolutely recommend playing them,but I would also recommend waiting on a sale.  I got the three bundled for very cheap and felt like a solid deal.  If you wanted all three games, I couldn't imagine paying for all three full price.			"

												This 3rd version of hexcells is genius. I thought it is just a hexa version of minesweeper, but later on I realized the game has its own unique mechanism and makes it much more interesting. Now I keep playing this mini game to release stress. I recommend to only buy this 3rd version of hexacells but not the first two (Hexcells & Hexcells Plus) because the first 2 versions are just subsets of this version.			"

												The main point of this final entry in the Hexcells series is a random puzzle generator and the ability to play custom levels. The generator does OK, but the generated puzzles are a bit easy. To make custom levels, you must use the third-party Sixcells level editor.The content in this game is a level pack for Hexcells Plus. I found the earlier levels to be a little easier than in Hexcells Plus, and the later levels to be a bit harder.Unlike Hexcells Plus, Hexcells Infinite doesn't add any new mechanic, but it does make a welcome UI tweak to the numbered blue cells, by making the border of the guide easier to see.

												Another great addition to the hexcells line! The acceleration of difficulty in the puzzles is not quite as steep as in Hexcells Plus, so you could start with Hexcells Infinite without first playing Hexcells. (I recommended practicing with Hexcells before diving into Hexcells Plus.) This edition comes with a really neat feature to generate puzzles randomly (hence the ""infinite""), which provides endless hours of puzzle-solving fun! My only complaint is that the randomly generated puzzles seem to be relatively easy, for the most part, due to a lot of duplicated/unnecessary information provided. I don't know what sort of algorithm the authors use to generate the puzzles, but if the algorithm is flexible enough, it would be nice if the amount of information provided could be customized so that players could choose their difficulty level. Otherwise, Hexcells Infinite is a great puzzler that I'm sure I will be enjoying for a long time to come.			"

												If you liked the first two games, then this game is an easy buy!Unlike the past two games, this one is most assuredly going to stump you (especially if you're going for Perfectionist - no mistakes in the campaign) and frustrate you. This one will definitely challenge you, and they definitely did their best to deliver a truly deserving finale.As an addition, there are an 'infinite' number of additional games (past the handcrafted campaign ones, these seem a bit computer-generated, even using a seed). These puzzles are easier - you dont need to worry about making mistakes since those aren't being counted and just click away - but in a way, I can appreciate the option of having a load of extra puzzles to enjoy after having gone through the entirety of the game.This one will last you longer than the other two combined, either because of the increased difficulty or the increased number of puzzles to go through. All in all, a good way to end the series.			"

												This game is a very good time killer, think of minesweeper except you take the guessing aspect of minesweeper out and replacing it with logic. Also unlike minesweeper the graphics look sharp and clean. The thing that sets this game apart from the previous two is the random generation aspect in which you essentially means unlimited fun. I'll give this game a 9/10, the base price is still worth the game but if you can get it on sale it's an absolute steal.			"

Pros:- Good game for a break- Easy to understand- Challenging, but logical- Every puzzle can be solved without guessing- You can save your progress and return to it later- Nice ambient music and sound effects- Gives you the option to either keep all sounds on, turn off just the music, or turn off all sounds- New infinite option gives you ""infinite"" puzzles to solve I'm going to assume 100,000,000 different puzzles since you can input any number from 00000000 to 99,999,999- The game allows you one mistake without losing pointsCons:- Instead of having an option where you continuously get randomized puzzles, you need to go back to the menu screen and hit ""randomize"" every time you want a new puzzle.- You need to complete 1,000,000,000 puzzles to unlock the final achievement...All things considered:I recommend it.

												Very enjoyable casual puzzle game. It has various aspects of several games, but I think it mostly resembled minesweeper in that sense, except that it's on a hexagonal grid. The ""random puzzle"" feature is very nice, so you can keep playing this even when you've solved all custom levels. The game is also very polished with smooth graphics, and a nice touch of having sound effects for clicking squares synchronized with the background music.Overall maybe not a revolutionary game, but similar to patience, mahjong, minesweeper etc. it's a nice game to play from time to time.

												In a nutshell: Hexcells Infinite is Minesweeper on steroids. Long story: Just like in Minesweeper, sometimes youâll have to guess (which may or may not annoy you), but unlike Minesweeper, Hexcells allows you to make as many mistakes as necessary in order to complete a map, and THAT is my major beef with the game, because it detracted a lot from the challenge. Thatâs right: There is no *significant* reward for completing a map with zero mistakes, and there is no punishment for literally guessing every step of the way and finishing with 20+ mistakes (other than barring your progress through the blocks of preset levels, but unlocking all puzzle groups doesn't really pose much of a challenge, i.e. you can do that even if you finish each map with a few mistakes). On the bright side, extra points go to sound design, as every correct click results in a soothing, oddly satisfying sound bit; however, there is no volume control in the game, only an ON/OFF switch, which I suppose is aligned with the gameâs minimalistic design, but itâs a feature I missed nonetheless. All in all, the game is reasonably priced, and certainly a step up the challenge of playing Minesweeper. If youâre looking for some casual distraction of the âminesweepingâ variety, Iâd say go for it.			"

												Buy them all!  Got the bundle on sale, paid less than three bucks.Hexcells won't fry your brains, but it offers some nice challenges, and every puzzle can be solved logically!  If you get stuck, just keep looking, you'll never need to guess.  Great mashup of sudoku and minesweeper, hours of entertainment.If you're only going to get one Hexcells game, go with Infinite.  It adds  pause, save, and restart features.  That last one matters, because, in the previous games, restarting meant backing out through two menues, then reloading the puzzle, which is annoying when you want a perfect run (or the achievement for perfection).  And, of course, the random puzzle generator, a la ""infinite"" means you can throw the rest of your life at clicking on Hexcells.			"

												If you're on the fence about the series or played one of the earlier games and aren't sure if you want to pick up the new one let me sum it up for you: This is the one you want to buy.Hexcells Infinite, to me at least, is a big improvement on an already fun series. For those not in the know, Hexcells is a puzzle game that's similar to mine sweeper only with 6 sides instead of 4 and an error counts against you but doesn't end the game. Also you never have to guess in Hexcells, there is always sufficient evidence given to correctly select the next move (though you may find yourself pulling out your hair until you find it). This game has the same clean graphics and soothing atmospheric music as the previous 2 games but does have some improvements. The biggest of which is you now have the ability to save and come back to a puzzle. This is a huge improvement and especially helpful as some of the levels in the base game are larger and more complicated than levels in previous games. You can also now set which mouse buttons you want to use to mark a square as blue or not which is a bonus to us lefties.  Where Hexcells Infinite really shines though is in the Infinite part. In addition to a set of given puzzles you can there's also an infinite mode where a set of 8 numbers (selected randomly, shared with friends or based on the date) will bring you a specific puzzle for you enjoyment. These puzzles tend to be shorter than the 'main' puzzles and are a great way to pass the time or give yourself a quick mental warm up for the day. And yes, you can save you progress on these too!

												The last and best in the Hexcells series (so far, in case it's going to be continued) provides the same kind of gameplay as Hexcells Plus did, but gives you now 3 crucial features:- Steam cloud lets you continue your progress where you left off on another computer or after formatting- Continue puzzles in progress (instead of having to go at it again from the beginning)- Puzzle Generator: after ""beating"" the preset levels you can now play levels generated from one of 1 000 000 000 seedsAlthough there are no new mechanics introduced and I think the proximity mechanic (which at least for me takes a decent amount of time for counting and double-checking) is overused, this is a solid game with the Puzzle Generator giving it a lot of replayability if you just cannot get enough of the basic puzzle principle.

Hexcells Infinite has the same static puzzle game but with an added random puzzle generator. The randoms aren't quite as good as the statics, but still better than nothing new. Plus it has a very relaxing soundtrack.Certainly worth at least $4.99 or even $8.99 for all three. "

To me that need for perfection to earn the badges is what drove me. Not needing the near perfection allowed me to lazily run through the random puzzles to get the badge. Basically highly suggested puzzle game (get all three!). My only issues are on a personal level with the last acheivment.			"

												When I reviewed the original Hexcells, I was rather hesitant with praise.  It's a great idea, but there were a number of things I had issues with in the first game.  Hexcells Infinite fixed pretty much all my issues, and is a fantastic game.This game is a terrific logic puzzle, along the lines of Macross/Nanograms/Griddlers/Pic-a-Pix - whatever you call them.  It's more complicated than any of those, however, bringing in some ideas that seem almost Minesweeper-esque, without the guesswork of Minesweeper.The first two games in this series feel almost like tough tutorials for this third game.  This one has much more complex logic puzzles, but not a single one needs any guessing or significant backtracking to solve.  The 36 main puzzles take a lot longer than the first two games - one of my biggest complaints about the first Hexcells is that it seemed rather short.  Hexcells Infinite not only takes longer to solve due to the tough puzzles, but it also has a random puzzle generator, with almost one billion puzzles in it.  They're all easier than the hardest of the Infinite puzzles, but there are some that require a bit of work, and it's great to know you'll never run out of puzzles.My other large issue with the previous two Hexcells was the lack of any save function, which Infinite added (thank goodness).Overall, Hexcells Infinite is a fantastic game for anyone who likes logic puzzles.  I can't recommend it enough, especially at the cheap price.  Buy it in a package with the other two Hexcells if you can afford it, because the other two ramp up the difficulty much more gently than Infinite does.  But if you can only afford one of them, definitely get this one.Since I've seen a lot of reviewers do personal scales, and it's helped me a lot to decide what to buy, I put my own here. I give Hexcells Infinite a 5 out of 5. Additionally, I usually only give a thumbs up if I got at least two hours of enjoyment out of it for every dollar I spent, and this game did that. 5: Amazing game, easily worth the full price.4: Good game, solid addition to the genre, might want to wait for a discount.3: Pretty entertaining game, but some issues. Buy at a discount unless you love the genre.2: More cons than pros, a lot of issues. Only buy with a strong discount, and only if the game truly sounds like something you'd enjoy.1: Don't get this game unless it's free. Even then, consider spending your time playing something decent.			"

You can grab only just this Hexcells Infinite and play forever. (It would be better if they are all released as DLCs on top of the main game.)			"

												A delightful and zen little puzzle game for lovers of logic. Worth every penny. The time shown is the time it took me to get every achievement. A lot like minesweeper with hexagonal tiles but it adds in elements from other logic games for a whole new level of depth. A must buy when on sale.			"

												Possibly one of the best puzzle games of all time. The hand crafted puzzles offer are a challenge and will no doubt make you think logically. If you just want to finish the game, then it might not take you that long, but I personally believe that the game is meant to be played like a perfectionist. It is far more fun and rewarding to attempt to finish every puzzle without making a single mistake. That will take you a few hours, if not more. After finishing all of the puzzles, you can then move onto the infinite mode, where there are enough puzzles to last you a lifetime. As one might expect, the puzzles are in no way superior to the hand crafted ones, but they still offer a fantastic challenge and will challenge you in similar ways to the HexCell puzzles you are used to. If you are a fan of puzzles in any form you can possibly think of, there is no doubt in my mind that HexCells Infinite would be a great game to add to your collection. "

												Having played through the previous two entries, I was delighted to find that most of the tutorial levels--in addition to swiftly establishing mechanics that I had already learned from the previous entries--included at least one pattern requiring a multi-step inference that I didn't recognize from previous puzzles. After three games, I could not only understand this odd language Matthew Brown has invented, but I could appreciate the subtle cleverness of the puzzle construction and recognize the discovery of a new turn of phrase. That he has managed to create this connection upon a foundation of clicking hexagons is a testament to his mastery of this subject.The addition of an automatic puzzle generator is perhaps the most compelling evidence that this format has been exhausted by the creator. While the puzzles are good in a perfunctory way, I'm happy to wait for more hand-crafted levels from the next game, whatever that may be.			"

												Very enjoyable casual puzzle game. It has various aspects of several games, but I think it mostly resembled minesweeper in that sense, except that it's on a hexagonal grid. The ""random puzzle"" feature is very nice, so you can keep playing this even when you've solved all custom levels. The game is also very polished with smooth graphics, and a nice touch of having sound effects for clicking squares synchronized with the background music.Overall maybe not a revolutionary game, but similar to patience, mahjong, minesweeper etc. it's a nice game to play from time to time.

												A good puzzle game but nowhere near as good as the original. You could always use logic in the first game to complete a puzzle with no mistakes but many of the later puzzles in Infinite rely on luck to pick the right hex, which took some of the enjoyment out of it. Towards the end, I didn't care about getting it wrong whereas in the first game, I made sure to 100% everything. Still worth playing though.			"

												The definitive best of the three Hexcells games. They got rid of the flickering issues, amped up the puzzle depth in my opinion and added automatic progress saving so you can drop a game and pick it up later. Hexcells is such a serene break filler that requires little commitment, yet keeps you involved.I demand a volume slider for the ambient music, tho. Give me my volume slider!Edit: The random puzzles are filler, though. No-brainers that have nothing to do with the finely hand-crafted main puzzles. The main puzzles themselves are where it's at.

												I have played many puzzle games. The hexcells series is simply, in my humble opinion, the very best. It avoids the pitfall of so many similar games: trial and errror. While interesting games like Lyme, Quell, Kami, Unium, etc. are asking you to think ahead, sure, but mostly to try, end up in a dead end, try something else, get stuck, try again, etc.  this is not the case here. The only real way to play for me is to accept no error. In any case, there is never a reason to guess or play the probabilities. There is always a solution and it's always certain.Clever, just challenging enough without being frustrating, but also soothing. This last opus is even infinite...			"

I would highly reccomend this game regardless of whether or not you've played the prior two.  Like the previous two, it begins quite simply and progresses in difficulty and complexity through the introduction of more and more complex elements.  What sets this game apart from the past two is twofold.  The first is the difficulty ramps up much more quickly and to a much greater degree.  The second is the ability to randomly generate puzzles, which are solveable and add a near infinite replayability factor.If you like puzzle games, this is the best one you're going to get on steam.

												Get all three and Squarecells! Some of the best puzzle games I've ever played. Great for casual gamers and 'hardcore' gamers alike. Each puzzle is lovingly crafted and a really well done tutorial. I love this game, can't stop. The seeded runs aren't as well done as the actual levels, but no one can expect someone to make over 9 milion perfect levels. Perfect way to pass time.  Matthew Brown is an amazing puzzle game maker, and he has proved that he deserves my money for his games. No bugs, no real patchs, the biggest problem is that there isn't a big settings menu, but this type of game doesn't really need one. With the seeded levels, any arguments of lack of content are completely null. If you need to get more proof of how good it is, look up Nerdcubed's video on it. His video caused me to buy all three. I bought Squarecells when it came out and I can say it's great as well.After you buy these games, you can thank me.			"

												So I took the plunge during the sale and decided to grab this as part of the Hexcells package. Definitely a worthwhile spend. This really is a pretty straightforward puzzle game. It's not going to set your world alight with graphical excellence or gimmickry. Instead, what you get for your time is a very well thought out series of logic puzzles, and that 'oh-so-elusive' thrill of joy when you finally 'get it'.A good and cheap little gem to while away some hours.Update: I have now nominated this game for the ""Just 5 More Minutes"" award - it really is just that addictive!

Like all the best puzzles, the levels start off simple and gradually add layers of complexity, until you get completely stuck. Then you realise a new way of working out what each cell should be, and suddenly they are easy again, until a new wrinkle arrives.Highly recommended!			"

												Infinite has to be the best of the Hexcells Trilogy.  It may not be as hard as the hardest levels in Plus, but it is nearly so.  What makes Infinite so much better, however, is that unlike the two previous titles, this one has a puzzle generator that will let you replay puzzles that you like, share them with friends, play the day's date's puzzle or generate one randomly.  You can play the game for forever.  It adds so much to the scope of the game.			"

												The third version of this game, following Hexcells and Hexcells plus.Again the basic puzzles are a bit harder than with plus and a LOT harder compared to the first Hexcells.Where plus gave us additional new rules for the puzzles, this sequel doesn't do that. It only perfects the difficulty of what the previous parts had to offer.But why the name ""infinity""? It comes with a Random Puzzle Generator, offering no less than 100.000.000 puzzles. This is where the true replay value shines. Want to share a certain puzzle with a friend? Just give the puzzle grid number to him and he can load it no problem. You can even save a puzzle midway, Something that is lacking in the standard puzzles.All in all a very valuable addition to an already great game. As with the previous two parts, ALL puzzles can be solved by using simple (and sometimes not so simple) logic. You never have to guess to solve something there's always a ""if this needs this, then that must be so or so"". Highly recommended if you enjoyed the previous parts. If you found 'plus' too hard, the random puzzles are a bit less difficult sitting somewhere between the original and plus.			"

												A good puzzle game but nowhere near as good as the original. You could always use logic in the first game to complete a puzzle with no mistakes but many of the later puzzles in Infinite rely on luck to pick the right hex, which took some of the enjoyment out of it. Towards the end, I didn't care about getting it wrong whereas in the first game, I made sure to 100% everything. Still worth playing though.			"

												Possibly one of the best puzzle games of all time. The hand crafted puzzles offer are a challenge and will no doubt make you think logically. If you just want to finish the game, then it might not take you that long, but I personally believe that the game is meant to be played like a perfectionist. It is far more fun and rewarding to attempt to finish every puzzle without making a single mistake. That will take you a few hours, if not more. After finishing all of the puzzles, you can then move onto the infinite mode, where there are enough puzzles to last you a lifetime. As one might expect, the puzzles are in no way superior to the hand crafted ones, but they still offer a fantastic challenge and will challenge you in similar ways to the HexCell puzzles you are used to. If you are a fan of puzzles in any form you can possibly think of, there is no doubt in my mind that HexCells Infinite would be a great game to add to your collection. "

												Heads up: this is the final game in the Hexcells series. If you haven't played any of the previous games, I highly recommend buying the original Hexcells before buying Hexcells infinite. While this game can be played without the previous two games, it's much harder to comprehend the scenarios and best moves without the original game as a guide/starter.If you've played the previous two games, Hexcells Infinite amps up the difficulty. As a personal analogy, I didn't have much trouble with the first game until somewhere around World 6. On the second game, I started running into trouble about halfway through World 4/beginning of World 5. In Hexcells Infinite, I'm running into blocks around late World 3/early World 4.The random puzzle generator works as intended; all puzzles that came up for me were all unique solutions. On average, the puzzles seemed reminiscent of Hexcells Plus in their difficulty; I think the main levels in Hexcells Infinite were, on average, harder than the randomly-generated puzzles.Hexcells Infinite delivers on it's promise and is a satisfying last game of the series. I highly recommend this game and its predecessors to anybody who likes puzzle games.			"

Unlike the other titles in the series, this one comes with a random puzzle generator, allowing you to continue playing even after you have completed all of the 36 set puzzles. If you love minesweeper, give this a go.Note: Change mouse buttons around if you're used to playing minesweeper, as the default mouse buttons are the reverse of minesweeper.			"

												You should think twice before purchasing this game. The price is quite high - and I'm not talking about the actual money but about time it drains... I was going to mention more levels would be fine, more achiements would be great but no... it is so simle for our protection. After day or two you manage to get all achievments and you can peacefully go to bed and get some sleep...Anyway, unlike windows minesweeper all levels can be solved without guessing. So, if you get stuck then you just missed something. It's always about the brain and you don't have to rely on luck - that feature may not seem to be important, but it is, as you are never going to click randlomly and you always know there is solution, you are just not seeing...

												The original Hexcells and this one should have been the same game (Infinite being an eventual free update or DLC). This is the definitive version of Hexcells, but it's missing the easy beginner levels from the original.  It also has a different set of sound effects to it.  If you played Hexcells Plus, Hexcells Infinite is just that with slightly different puzzles for the stages and a random puzzle generator for those who need more content.  The only problem I have with this is the puzzles sometimes require a bit of guessing, so mistakes aren't always your fault but a lack of information being conveyed to you about the empty hexes.  I personally think you should play Hexcells first, skip Hexcells Plus, and play Hexcells Infinite if you simply like the original.			"

												I feel the same way as many other reviewers, it is one of the best puzzle games out there and even projected on all games easily one of my top 5, which you can check seeing the (a little inflated) hours I played it.At first I didn't like it at all, because especially in the first few levels it seemed like a hexagonal minesweeper, in the way that only the early conceptualizing phase is fun, but this phase just keeps coming with new features and of course there never is this 50:50 tile in the end.That's all for the main game which ""plus"" and to some extend the original version also had.Additionally, Infinite has the new addition of the eponymous ""infinite"" randomly (aka algorithmically) created levels, which to be honest are not that amazing, granted I played less than 0.01% of them all, but like 90% aren't challenging in any capacity. You can get a few good ones, but generally the only fun aspect would be speedruning them (I would recommend having fewer levels and then a leaderboard for the respective levels).The feature of the game that I used 90% of my time on, is one that you may not have even seen at first or second glance: custom levels that you can copy into your game and create yourself (no creator interface thus far though).https://www.reddit.com/r/hexcellslevels/ has 100+ posts of levels and level packs that are all amazing that is why this is  in my opinion the only game of the trilogy you really HAVE to get. I got all three for like 2 bucks, but this game is easily worth the 5 it costs normally.The game of course doesn't get worse the longer it's out it gets better, so you might aswell wait for a sale, unless you've really tasted blood now.

												This review is written for Hexcells, Hexcells Plus, and Hexcells InfiniteHexagonal PuzzlerReviewed after completing all achievementsGameplayHexcells plays like an average 2d puzzle games, you click your mouse to solve the puzzles not hard.  Untill you get to the later puzzles that is.  This game has one of the most ingenious puzzle systems I've played to date.  It isn't so complex that you're left scratching your head at what the rules that these puzzles follow are, but it isn't so simple that it becomes boring after you've completied a few of them.I will say that while trying to %100 this game I looked up a few of the solutions after completing them once.  This is because this game has a 'perfect' rating, in which there must be no missclicks on a puzzle to actually complete it for the achievements.  And while I did mess up sometimes when solving these puzzles, most of the time these missclicks were due to me acidentally resting my fingers on my buttons while trying to solve a hard section, or right clicking when I should have left clicked that time damn it!GraphicsThis game has a great look to it, but playing it at night will strain your eyes due to the brightness of it.VerdictThis is a great game and well worth your time if you're looking for a puzzle game to play.  Though the achievement in Hexcells Infinite where you must complete some of the random puzzles just takes far too long. 8/10  "

												The third part of the Hexcells series is definitely its peak. There are no new game mechanics. The tutorial aspect is handled better than in the first game. There is a nice progression between easy and challenging levels and the game felt much more balanced than the first two rather one-sided parts. The pre-made levels took me about 10 hours to complete as a seasoned logic puzzle player and featured a few really nice stages.Arguably its main selling point is the titular infinite mode. Finally Hexcells allows you to generate millions of levels and thus offers near infinite gameplay. The levels are usually much easier than the pre-made levels, which is completely fine with me and makes this an even better casual game for inbetween. My only gripe with this mode is its large randomness. Generated levels take anywhere between 3 and 20 minutes to complete. I would have liked a little more control over length and difficulty.The interface is much improved compared to its predecessors. Finally you can mute the music independenty from the sound effects. The game lets you save levels mid-progress, visibility of areas can be improved and you can swap mouse buttons more easily. It is such an improvement that it makes you wonder why the previous two games weren't patched to this UI. Like with the other parts I've never encountered a bug, error or crash.Due to the infinite mode this game as a stand-alone is worth full price. I recommend picking it up as part of the compilation or during one of the frequent sales which make this brilliant game a real bargain.			"

Hexcells makes it easy to block out the rest of the world for a few minutes while focusing completely on the logic of a puzzle, without distracting noises, animations, or time limits demanding attention - exactly what I want most from a puzzle game. The standard levels do a good job of teaching and exercising the mechanics, and the infinite generated levels mean that the game is never exhausted. Doing a puzzle or two makes a good break to reset your brain when you're stressed.			"

												Simple. Logical. If you enjoy playing Minesweeper, Hexcells is the next level. The previous two versions, Hexcell and Hexcell Plus are good but only have a set number of static puzzles with little to no replayability. Hexcells Infinite has the same static puzzle game but with an added random puzzle generator. The randoms aren't quite as good as the statics, but still better than nothing new. Plus it has a very relaxing soundtrack.Certainly worth at least $4.99 or even $8.99 for all three. "

												I've 100 percented all three of the hexcell games and it was amazing, my only issue with this one is that the 'infinity' badge doesn't require a one mistake or less completion of the randomized puzzles. To me that need for perfection to earn the badges is what drove me. Not needing the near perfection allowed me to lazily run through the random puzzles to get the badge. Basically highly suggested puzzle game (get all three!). My only issues are on a personal level with the last acheivment.			"

												Very nice continuation of Hexcells.  Same rules to go with, just more difficult puzzles.  All levels can be solved with no guessing, though some of the later levels can take a while to whittle down.  If you're going for perfect scores, doesn't hurt to take screenshots if you mess up so that at least you can get back to where you were.  Feels satisfying when you get those large puzzles down.  Custom puzzles are also nice for replay value.			"

												(9.5/10)This is the most Hexcellist Hexcells, far more hexcelling than the previous hexcells could ever hope to hexcell.  Truth in a name for sure, you can now run essentially near infinite seeded puzzles, daily puzzles, etc, in addition to another batch of cleverly constructed main-line puzzles to work through.While the seeded ones often don't have the depth/complexity/strategy of the hand-built ones, they do offer quantity, and prevent the game from ever truly being over, which if you like clever puzzle games (and I do) is a very good thing.

												It seems from Hexcells to H. Plus to H. Infinite the games keep getting harder. I consider this a good thing, but I feel like this would be poor place in the series to start. That said, if you're willing to jump into harder puzzles right away, then this is probably the best in the series. It has a mode with infinite or more accurately ""more puzzles than anybody has time to play"", which allows you to keep playing new puzzles for as long as you want after the main puzzles are done. The downside is that the puzzles have differing difficulties and there's no way to say ""generate a medium level puzzle"".As far as gameplay goes, there are no new mechanics from the other games in the series, but I consider that a good thing. The core gameplay was fun, so I'm glad that it wasn't changed. That said, some may feel that this game is essentially the same as the others but with things mixed up a bit. I think if I had bought this first, the other games would feel like more of the same since this offers the 'infinite mode', but since I played it last, I feel like it's a good way to end the series.

												Infinite has to be the best of the Hexcells Trilogy.  It may not be as hard as the hardest levels in Plus, but it is nearly so.  What makes Infinite so much better, however, is that unlike the two previous titles, this one has a puzzle generator that will let you replay puzzles that you like, share them with friends, play the day's date's puzzle or generate one randomly.  You can play the game for forever.  It adds so much to the scope of the game.			"

												the âinfiniteâ mode made this one last a lot longer for me than the original hexcells.  it also didnât have the problems of too-slow start and then ending as soon as things got interesting.  the blue cells with numbers of what was in a 2-cell radius were a nice addition, but i ran into more situations where it seemed there was no possible way to determine whether any remaining cells were blue or black.  i feel like especially for pre-set puzzles this shouldnât happen, but maybe iâm actually just not as good at the game as i like to think i am.it improved upon the original (i havenât played hexcells plus) and provides more hexcells, so definitely worth it if you enjoyed the original.

												More of the deceptively simple looking Minesweeper-esque puzzle game. Infinite might be my least favorite of the trio (with Hexcells & Hexcells Plus), but it is everything you would expect from the third game. The idea of ""infinite levels"" is a nice farewell touch and does not take away from the core game. Still, the randomly generated levels cannot match the brilliance of Matthew Brown's handiwork. While this is the last of the Hexcells games, I look forward to Matt's future work (the latest being SquareCells)  "

												I really like it, but I have a few problems with it I'm gonna list off in hopes that they're corrected in the sequel (if there is one).1. Allow the player to make markings.This is really annoying on larger puzzles when I can't get my bearings correct. Sudoku puzzles and Picross puzzles usually allow one to make markings to the accord of ""maybe something's here,"" or something like that. Really wish for something like that in this game.2. When highlighting numbers in blue hexcells, show blue cells contained within the radius shine brighter.Or something like that. Hard to tell which ones are within and which ones are out due to the lighting. I usually have to click the blue cell a few times.3. Allow the player to undo a move.Not for wrong clicks, no, but sometimes I misclick and end up with a right answer. That just happened to me and I didn't want it to happen. How can I get rid of this damn blue hexagon? Nothing, nothing I can do. And it's really frustrating knowing that I solved a puzzle through a misclick.Other than those dang frustrations, game is great. Scratches that Picross itch and Infinite has a good amount of content.			"

												Third installment of the series.  Nothing too much is different, same idea, another layer of difficulty added halfway through.  I will say the hardest of the series by far, so if you want the challenge and don't want to buy all three games, this is definitely the one to get.  It has the most difficult challenges, and the added benefit of the puzzle generator, so there are endless seeds to play.The nitpick is, however, the random generator is largely puzzle difficulty of the first one, so if you really enjoyed how hard they were in the set stages, the generator may be a disappointment to you.  It may also feel that way after playing the harder ones, then coming down to easier ones just made them feel like a breeze, but many were being solved between 2-10 minutes, compared to the main stage puzzklles that would some take me 2 hours.I absolutely recommend playing them,but I would also recommend waiting on a sale.  I got the three bundled for very cheap and felt like a solid deal.  If you wanted all three games, I couldn't imagine paying for all three full price.			"

												The final entry of the trilogy of Hexcells puzzle games this is the best of the lot - the 36 developer designed levels are better than ever, really getting you thinking of where the next move is and what piece of information you have overlooked each time you get stuck, and the great moment when you finally realize what it is and wondering how you could have missed it all that time.The main bonus compared to the previous two entries is that after the 36 levels it isn't all over, you can move onto the seeded ""random"" levels. This obviously gives the game replayability which the designed levels don't really have, however the down side is that the random levels have a tendency to be feel fairly samey after a while, and it rare to find anything really challenging. But still it is a nice option to have and no doubt some relatively fun levels have been picked out by the community by now, so of the three this is definitely the one to get - although I think the entire trilogy goes on sale for a very reasonable price regularly enough, giving the advantage of easing you into the game more progressively, as well as having a bunch more of the excellently designed levels to challenge yourself from the two earlier editions to add to the ones in this edition.

												While I have only played a short bit so far, I can say that the puzzle aspects of this game are fairly interesting. Gameplay is (as others have noted) reminiscent of Sudoku and Minesweeper. The puzzles themselves arent very hard, and to my knowledge have no life system other than the fact that you get rewards based on how few mistakes you make. This system works very well and is very easy to understand the mechanics of the game with its ""do it to learn it"" tutorials.This game has my praise as being a simple brain teaser, and I recommend it for this reason. It does its job and it does it well. Everything else below this is annoyances I have however, as this is a game about following the limited rules, and trying to do as well as possible. Some of the rules introduced, however, limit your ability to use your brain however and this peeves the hell out of me.An annoying point for this system is that 1 mistake might be no lost points in some levels, while other more difficult puzzles might be that 2 mistakes is 2 lost points. Another issue I have with this is the need for guessing, in a system that gives its credits based on mistakes made. This game REQUIRES you to guess all the time, even in the first few levels even. And what I mean by guessing is that instead of intellectually plotting out your course, you are required to take a stand and say ""well at least its just 50/50."" And this is exacerbated by the ""?"" buttons. There is a level where there are ROWS of these unknown buttons, making it impossible to go around and therefore impossible to know how to move on without guessing. Turning this puzzle game of intelligence into a bit of aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ And then theres the fact that the blocks you fill in as correct dont have numbers on them too. Meaning that if you are in a choke a couple blocks wide and you only get fillers then you have no way of moving forward, yet again forcing you to GUESS!			"

												A logic puzzle that is like a combination of Minesweeper and Kakuro. Simple design & graphics, fitting music. You have numbered tiles that tell how many adjacent mines there are. And later on there are numbers outside the grid that tell how many mines are in that column and numbers inside mine tiles that tell how many mines are within a two tile radius. You use the information given to get through tiles and eventually uncover the whole area. There are no game overs (so you can continue on despite guessing or making mistakes) but you can do the puzzles without guesswork.The controls are pretty simple (left click to mark as a mine, right click to reveal). You can also right click on column numbers/mine numbers to hide them. It's not very obvious but you can access the menu/restart the stage by clicking on the word MENU on the top left corner.I enjoy logic puzzles and these kept me entertained for a several hours (I spent a good amount of time just thinking about the problems and eventually got hints from people on the forums).The Infinite version finally allows for saves so you can safely take a break during puzzles (which I often did to reset my mind and try again later).It also introduces randomly generated levels (based on seeds) so you can keep playing after you finish the campaign. However, from my limited experience, the randomly generated levels are usually not as satisfying as the dev-selected campagin levels. The generated levels don't usually require thinking about more than one layer of information at a time and have a good amount of simple cascades. I didn't really think about or appreciate the developers' puzzle design skills until I started playing the generated puzzles.The most polished and, in my opinion, the best of the three Hexcell games. The difficulty curve isn't as steep as Plus (they offer more levels that help show needed concepts) but I'm not sure if Infinite is a little easier than Plus or if Plus' puzzles conditioned me and helped me solve these faster.If you like logic puzzles like Sudoku/Kakuro you should try the original Hexcells first. If you enjoyed Hexcells and are looking for a new and harder challenge, this will probably be your cup of tea.			"

												This is the best puzzle game on Steam. Definite improvement over the previous two games in puzzle design with helpful little tweaks to the UI and the randomly generated puzzles give it unlimited replayability.I have been playing this game every day since I got it.

Bullet points  ""Minesweeper on steroids""  All puzzles solvable with pure logic (no guessing)  Infinite replay value due to procedurally-generated levelsFull reviewThis review is for the third game in the Hexcells trilogy: ""Hexcells Infinite"".  The gameplay across the series is essentially the same (which is why the Curator links for the first two games also point here), but I'll cover the important differences between the three titles.  In the interest of full disclosure, the ""infinite replay value"" bullet point above only applies if you have ""Hexcells Infinite"".Let's just get the elephant in the room out of the way first; the parallels with Minesweeper are obvious.  That said, calling this a ""Minesweeper clone"" is like calling a Lamborghini a ""Honda Civic clone"" because they're both cars.  Even so, taking a Honda Civic around the block will still give you a decent idea of whether you like driving cars or not, so it's a starting point.The Hexcells games will most appeal to people who like Minesweeper, but thought the game mechanics got a little bland and are irritated by the fact that some blind guesswork is almost always necessary on the harder boards.  Here, you've got a wide variety of ""cell types"", but arguably more importantly: no guesswork ever.That's not to say Hexcells isn't tough; the first game may lull you into a false sense of security, I'll admit, but by the time you're solving the latter puzzles of ""Plus"" or ""Infinite"" you'll realize that this is a Dark Souls[www.gamesradar.com] of cell-logic puzzling.  I lost count of how many times I got stuck for minutes at a time, just staring at the screen looking for the next clue, finally seeing it, getting excited at the prospect of homesteading another swath of the game board...only to find that the logic train derailed after a single cell or two.  But it's not just that it's hard, it's that -- it's hard to describe without playing the game, but it's a common theme in people's comments -- you can tell that the author did it on purpose.  He knew you were going to be at that exact spot, thinking that exact thing, and he deliberately pulled the rug out.  It's just something about the way the puzzles go: there's a devilish humor in some of the dead ends.The first game (""Hexcells"") definitely has the easiest of the ""designed"" levels, and introduces most of the game mechanics.  It's a solid game on its own, and I would certainly recommend starting with it, but if you're only going to buy one of the three, skip it (but don't...buy the bundle).The second game (""Hexcells Plus"") features much harder ""designed"" levels (although they do start out pretty easy as well), and again I would certainly recommend playing it in sequence as part of the trilogy...but if you're only going to buy one, skip it (but don't...buy the bundle).The third game (""Hexcells Infinite"") has ""designed"" levels on par, difficulty-wise, with ""Plus"".  If you're only going to buy one of the three, this is the no-brainer choice because in addition to the manually-designed levels, ""Infinite"" also has a randomized level generator (the pedants in the audience will point out that it's really just a set of 10,000,000 procedurally-generated levels, but...yeah).  It's also the only one of the three to support user-created levels (the support is clearly a bolt-on in all its kludgy glory, but bless its heart it does work and kudos to the developer who went back in and added it in an update at the community's request).The generated levels aren't nearly as hard as the lovingly-crafted ""main campaign"" levels, but they're difficult enough to give you a bit of a think and personally I like the fact that I can chew through them a few minutes at a time with a lot of action-packed, exciting clicks and right-clicks.  I've even encountered a few that had ""gotchas"" that almost looked deliberate.As a last parting shot, just in case there are any of you out there who are thinking ""I liked Minesweeper's gameplay perfectly fine thank you very much...but yes, the forced guesswork was annoying"", check out Simon Tatham's ""mines"" implementation[www.chiark.greenend.org.uk].  In my opinion it's not nearly as much fun as Hexcells (sorry Simon!) but it does scratch that specific itch.If you like this game, check out...

												Absolutely fantastic game. In terms of logical effort, this game, in my opinion, is harder than the Portal games. This game made me use logical thinking in ways I've never used before hence the game actually made me feel genuinely smarter. The puzzle designs from the main puzzles are beautifully and very cleverly designed. I would say that in terms of the cognitive difficulty, this game is more difficult than Hexcells Plus.The interface is minimalistic and along with the calming and soothing music, encourages you to think more clearly and in a way, calmly.For those who want a challenge and who want to feel more confident in their intelligence then this game is simply a must buy. If you are willing to buy the game, try not to make any mistakes since it'll effect the amount of satisfaction you get sometimes from solving it. And yes it is true, the ENTIRE GAME can be completed using logic only, no guess work is required at all.			"

This one adds some mechanics on top of those presented in the other two games, and best of all includes a random puzzle generator for when you complete the game for added hours of fun.			"

SummaryHexcells Infinite is a puzzle game that shares some similarities with nonocross. It the sequel to Hexcells Plus, which was the sequel to Hexcells.+ Plesant graphics, sound and music+ Challenging+ Easy to understand+ New infinite modeRecommended for those who like nonocross or puzzles in general.ReviewThe game is simillar to the previous iterations. It is a game simillar to nonocross but with hexagons. The gameplay, graphics and sound remain almost the same as previous games but with a few tweaks. One nice tweak is that levels are saved when you exit the game. The infinite mode is new and allows to continue playing the game after you finish the campaign.It's a nice puzzle game.			"

												Minesweeper with hexagons 2: enter the eyestrain+great design+great click noise. It's satisying to click in any hexcell game-didn't enjoy the 2 ring puzzles towards the end. it's not always easy to tell which cells are in the 2nd ring and which ones aren't due to the often weirdly shaped and separated (but still sometimes supposedly adjacent) globs of hex honey. This ended up hurting my eyes and the overall experience wasn't relaxing anymore.			"

												Well...I bought this game because I had 5 dollars just sitting there on my account and I didnt know what to do with them.This mini puzzle kind of a relaxation game really worth it.This game can be hard sometime (if you dont have a brain). however, you can take your time, relax, and think what is your next step. with a lot of built-in levels and unlimited very fun seed levels Im sure that you can pass the time in a really good way.So... lets talk about the game...You need to mark the orange cells as blue or black. Every black cell showing you how many blue cells are around the currnet black cell. you can't mark more blue cells than the black one showing you. But this is just the basics. during the levels you will discover more rules that will make the puzzle harder.In conclusion, a really good puzzle game, desined very well, just mark the orange cells while listening to the relaxing in-game music or just play it while listening to your own music (recomended). train your brain and clear your mind.btw, sorry for bad English.

												I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone & everyone including those that may not know how to play Minesweeper style games. The Hexcells games involves a much improved and varied Minesweeper style gameplay compared to the standard Minesweeper clones that are nearly everywhere (including the standard Minesweeper installed on most Windows computers). Hexcells improve on the basic Minesweeper format in quite a number of different ways that change up the Minesweeper gameplay by adding different alternative ways on locating the mines. I won't spoil the fun of working them out for you though.Speaking about the new and different ways of locating the mines, the main campaign of pre-defined set levels slowly introduce these new mechanics to players while explaining the methods you can use these to solve the puzzles. This starts with the basics so that even a novice easily start to play and goes all the way up to some really challenging tests towards the end with the final puzzle taking hours to complete. Luckily this game auto saves constantly so you can ways come back to where you left off.Hexcells Infinite is probably the best of out the 3 current Hexcells games due to the new Infinite mode (that wasn't in the previous 2 games) which randomly generates new levels so there's always something to come back to or continue on after the main campaign is completed. As you can see in the screenshots on this store page it has a nice minimalist look with both light & dark setting so that you're not blinded by that white blackground all the time. It runs very well on any PC that I've had no matter the specs low or high. Variety of resolution settings which all seem to work great and a nice window mode setting so you can play while doing something else (like watching a movie or TV show, etc). The only improvement I could think of was if the Infinite mode had some more generation settings so you can generate a puzzle more to your liking rather then it being nearly completely random.9.5/10			"

												The 2nd best puzzle game I've ever played after Talos principle.Yeah, different ends of the spectrum, but I wanted to 'rate' Hexels on the grand scheme of things.To address some of the other reviews criticising the random level generator, they do not seem to acknowledge the level editor. You can get replayability from going over the old reditor submitted levels if you need more. Some reddit submissions are as good as the Hexels levels. Well, perhaps not that good, the Hexels main levels are superb.			"

It is challenging, each game gets harder and Infinite also got a random generate mode which gives it a huge replay value. TL;DR: Buy it! It's awesome! More of this please!			"

												Minesweeper with hexagons 2: enter the eyestrain+great design+great click noise. It's satisying to click in any hexcell game-didn't enjoy the 2 ring puzzles towards the end. it's not always easy to tell which cells are in the 2nd ring and which ones aren't due to the often weirdly shaped and separated (but still sometimes supposedly adjacent) globs of hex honey. This ended up hurting my eyes and the overall experience wasn't relaxing anymore.			"

												While I have only played a short bit so far, I can say that the puzzle aspects of this game are fairly interesting. Gameplay is (as others have noted) reminiscent of Sudoku and Minesweeper. The puzzles themselves arent very hard, and to my knowledge have no life system other than the fact that you get rewards based on how few mistakes you make. This system works very well and is very easy to understand the mechanics of the game with its ""do it to learn it"" tutorials.This game has my praise as being a simple brain teaser, and I recommend it for this reason. It does its job and it does it well. Everything else below this is annoyances I have however, as this is a game about following the limited rules, and trying to do as well as possible. Some of the rules introduced, however, limit your ability to use your brain however and this peeves the hell out of me.An annoying point for this system is that 1 mistake might be no lost points in some levels, while other more difficult puzzles might be that 2 mistakes is 2 lost points. Another issue I have with this is the need for guessing, in a system that gives its credits based on mistakes made. This game REQUIRES you to guess all the time, even in the first few levels even. And what I mean by guessing is that instead of intellectually plotting out your course, you are required to take a stand and say ""well at least its just 50/50."" And this is exacerbated by the ""?"" buttons. There is a level where there are ROWS of these unknown buttons, making it impossible to go around and therefore impossible to know how to move on without guessing. Turning this puzzle game of intelligence into a bit of aâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ And then theres the fact that the blocks you fill in as correct dont have numbers on them too. Meaning that if you are in a choke a couple blocks wide and you only get fillers then you have no way of moving forward, yet again forcing you to GUESS!			"

												Fun game for those who like Mine Sweeper or other logic solving games.  Slightly more complicated rules for hints, there's the rows/columns hints that isn't present in Mine Sweeper.There's also pleasant ambiance music, soothing and easy to listen to while solving.  Doesn't mesh well if you're in the hasty mind pushing yourself to beat best times.  But when you're just playing the game and relaxing, it is wonderful.I recommend the Hexcells Infinite version because you can generate random puzzles to play.  The other versions in the Hexcell series (including this one) all have pre-made maps for you to play that are deliciously complicated and ramp up in difficulty.  But once you've beaten the premade's, you've beaten them.  You'll get your money's worth on each game, but you may not want to go back to the premades for some time.  Having a huge amount of random generated puzzles to tap whenever you want to play a fresh game?  Delightful.			"

												With an overwhelmingly large amount of time in this game, and 720 of the random levels completed as of this review, I can assure that this game is one of the best ending games to a series of games. There isn't a single level you can't complete with guessing as you'll always have one move you can logically make, though it can be obscure. As always, even the 36 ""story"" levels prove to have an equal difficulty curve, albeit steeper than the previous two games. For anyone who wants a well-made puzzle game that can also prove calming, I suggest this one as well as the previous two. Though, this game allows you to change the controls, so superior game goes to Infinite.			"

												The Hexcells series has been a fun and relaxing way for me to pass the time. The calm ambience and minimalistic structure of the games makes it easy to keep coming back to whenever you have a little time to kill. Infinite makes things far more convenient with the save feature, especially once you start getting into the really meaty and challenging puzzles later on. That was my only real complaint about its precessors, and it makes a world of difference in Infinite. While the randomly generated puzzles aren't quite as challenging as the expertly crafted stages, it's a nice feature that adds more playability to the game. I find that I spend more time testing speed over accuracy, whereas the main puzzles really encourage you to fill your cells in carefully (if you want to get the completionist achievements, anyway!). I think the only thing that has given me trouble is just how easy it is to misclick, particularly when you're on a roll. Luckily, the game doesn't penalize you for errors and allows you to finish each puzzle regardless of how many you make. Overall, a fun and simple game does what it sets out to do: scratching that puzzle itch in a quick and conveninent manner. I really appreciated the amount of creativity and challenge that was put into some of the game's main puzzles and I think it'd be worth playing them through again sometime.			"

												I love hexcells, but this new version has cells that you cannot deduce, you have to guess. Being able to deduce the answer without guessing is what makes a puzzle game a puzzle game. So I cannot give this product a positive review.EDIT: I just realized there is a box in the upper left that says how many blue squares are remaining in the puzzle. This is very important to realize,as the puzzles are not solvable without the box.			"

I can't decide what's more impressive about this, the third offering in the series: that they managed to make a smooth and fair learning curve leading up to some of the most mind-bending ""casual"" puzzles you'll see in your life, or that they managed to make a procedural generator that gives you a vast (not truly ""infinite,"" but close enough!) number of further puzzles that are still generally satisfying to solve.

												One of the best logic puzzles I've ever played. I do the ""today's date"" random puzzle everyday, and often more than that. It's a relaxing game for the most part--sometimes it's frustrating when I don't see what I need to see.Some people are comparing it to sudoku or minesweeper. It's sort of like they hooked up and had a baby together and the result was Hexcells.I played the previous Hexcells games and recommend those as well, but if strapped for cash this version of the game will last a long, long time.
