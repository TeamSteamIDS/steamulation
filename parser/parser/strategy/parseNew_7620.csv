												This was a great game when released, but now it's showing its age. It's satisfyingly challenging, especially on the higher difficulty settings.It's fun laying out your railway and you get a good sense of getting better at the game the more you play it, as you get involved with the more advanced functions, such as personal wealth and the stock market. The differing goals on each level, the changing emphasis depending on the year and the big shift between difficulty levels are easily enough to hold your interest over the long-term. While there's some luck involved, particularly with the economy, success is mostly a case of skill and planning. The economic model is good enough, if not spectacular.On the downside, the user interface looks and feels like it was designed in 1998 (as it was). It can be hard finding some of the more important functions (or even the existence of them in some cases). I would recommend at least scanning through the manual.The graphics are perfectly functional - as an isometric rather than a 3D game, they've aged better than most of this vintage. The intra-level cutscenes set the scene for the level quite well. I enjoyed the bluegrass music, even though I'm not a fan of the genre - it fits the pace of the game exactly.As in common with many games in this genre, there's a ""tipping point"" at each level where you're sure that you'll be successful. The game has ten speed levels and this comes in very handy at that point.If you're having trouble deciding, ""Railroad Tycoon 3"" is definitely the better game, particularly the economic model and user interface. However this can be difficult to get running on modern systems. ""Railroads!"" is almost a different kind of game, much easier and less in-depth - I didn't like it.If you like management sims, you should get a lot of enjoyment out of this, particularly as it's so cheap. If you're not sure, or haven't played that style of game much, you'll probably be better off buying something more modern.			"

												$5? You wont go wrong buying this! I've been playig since it was originaly released way back in 1998, I belive this is the greatest stratagy/train game (board or PC) ever. The graphics arn't REAL bad, I sure wish they would redo it with improved 1920 x 1080 high resalution graphics, those old trains would really look great! As it is though, they still look ok imo. But if you can get past the grapics, you will not be disapointed. Nice atmosphere too.10/10 as it sits.Windows 8 with intel i5 and gforce gpu. Works great!			"

												Railroad Tycoon 2 is in my opinion the best railroad company simulator there ever was.It is reasonable in difficulty, graphics did not age too terribly and while it is simplified a bit, the corelations between products and different buildings spawning on the map through time give it endless replayability.It is on par with Transport Tycoon, so If you liked that one, you will also love this game.It is obviously very old, so approach with caution, If you never actually heard of it before.

												This game is kickass!  It engages your brain - memory and planning are paramount - while also having an excellent American folk soundtrack of guitars and harmonicas.  Daft numbers of scenarios & campaigns, all with inherent replayability, can be boosted to astronomical proportions (https://codeload.github.com/oseparovic/RRT2Maps/zip/master << that's a metric f*ck-tonne of extra maps & scenarios).  I have a thing for older games - they tended to be more demanding and more mentally stimulating than modern games - and this fully lives up to those ideals.  The game consists of competing with AI or human-controlled opponents (or not, if that's what you want) to connect trade resources on a map, against the backdrop of a potentially lethal economy and advancing technology.  The right scenarios (in the zip I linked to above) will let you go for >150 years - some are even without a time limit - but you typically are presented goals - specific things to achieve by a specific time, in order to get a bronze, silver or gold medal (these goals are usually along the lines of ""Connect point x to point y, move twelvety tonnes of cargo K between those two points and amass $------ personal fortune by date z"").  I give you fair warning, the graphics aren't going to blow you away, not by a long shot, but the complexity, detail and the intense addictiveness of the game should tickle you if you're prone to being tickled by a game of this type.

												If you are an analytical, logistics-oriented person who can coalesce money and talent around you to achieve ambitious goals, please submit your application to Railroad Tycoon 2 platinum.I played this game when it first came out, it's still as solid a title now as it was then, and the mechanics and controls have aged well. While some of the campaign can be quite merciless, I hardly see how that's a problem (considering today's trends towards easy instant satisfaction games).The AI on the map can leave something to be desired. They build weird routes, and often never expand beyond their two city connections for many years. However, what they lack in physical construction prowess they make up for with their brutal manipulation of the in-game stock market. Which is a peeve, because the market can be very hard to keep up on while you're trying to build a route through rugged mountain terrain, only to find that the dickhole AI has bought out your company, repossessed all of your assets that you put up to start said company, and then locked you out of your office so they can take a big dump on your desk. But I digress. For the price of the game on the Steam marketplace, you will get a solid return on your investment. hours of fun. Hours of mind numbing track laying, split-screening market trading, and maxing out your profit by alternatively trimming routes and tuning the makeup of the various trains that ply them.			"

												Ahh, Railroad Tycoon II. Another game resurrected from the mists of time and childhood memories of playing this game as a starry-eyed child with my train-obsessed father. Once the shine of nostalgia had worn away a little, however, I found myself able to give a more..objective review of the game. The positives? Well, the music is great, the attention to detail (particularly with the trains and historical aspects) is pretty impressive, and the gameplay, at its core, is quite addictive. As you play, you find yourself eager to expand your railway, to explore the map and find out what locomotive will be unlocked next. There's also an impressive array of scenarios/maps to play, and an amusing level editor. However, one drawback I found is that the game can be rather confusing. There are no proper tutorials, none that I could find anyway (occasional hint boxes hardly count), and it's scarily easy to run out of money, which in turn annoys your investors and nets you a game over. The interface can be rather confusing, and at the risk of sounding stupid, I don't really understand the financial side of the game (bonds and stock, etc) and how that all works. All that being said though, if you can wrap your head around the confusing mechanics, this is still a timeless classic of a game, and very enjoyable. Not the best, but definitely recommended as a cheap time-waster.			"

												An old classic, filled with nostalgia and train steam. The game ranges from simple difficulties where you just relax, transport goods around and build new tracks, to full fledged industry operations where every dollar must be spent wisely, you can compete with the AI or other players at both the train stations and the financial markets, and the goods must be delivered from and to specific locations to get enough profit out of it.On the wrong side, the UI  would have needed way more tooltips, and the game is generally obscure in what does what and why.Overall, a good choice if you like trains and that old game vibe.

I have played this game from the CD for many hours, just bought Steam version. You may trust my review.This ain't yo mamma's kind of game. No this ain't. Railroad Tycoon 2, in my opinion the best of all train games new or old, is one that'll make you frustrated by all means whilst keeping you up till all hours of the night. Let me explain why. The rail building is not easy. You must pick your terrain carefully and stategically. Mountains will cost you more, and slow your trains down. Plains are cheaper and don't require heavy-duty 3-Truck Shay trains. Deciding which cities to connect together via a rail also takes thought. The larger the city, the more passenger and mail revenue is to be had. The maps in this game are realistically made (Alaska map looks like Alaska). But when you do finally get your rail system figured out, it's time to turn to the Stock Market. Very useful in making lots of personal cash, issuing stock for some extra company cash, or merging with another rail company. Invest wisely, the AI in this game were created intelligently. For example if you see Jay Gould in your game (look him up:) watch your back, while other tycoons may not even utilize the Market at all. Every tycoon Character in this game has a different personality. So in conclusion, this game is 17+ years old and out of every rail game out right now, I still choose to play ol' RRT2. Yes max res is 1024 x 768, maybe an HD version would pop up someday? This game takes time to learn, but once down you will definently need a better office chair and a comfortable mouse pad. Also there are websites out to download user created maps/scenarios, and a map editor to create your own (this comes with game). Much replayability.			"

												While some parts of the interface feels outdated, and the graphics are poor by todays standard, this game still has some life and joy to share with the player. If you like these tycoon games, this is definitely one to try, if for no other reason than to have tested this old classic.The simulation is satisfactory, and buying a brand new train model and putting it to work on new laid tracks up the mountains gives a sense of achievment many new games fail to instil in the player.A safe buy for tycoon fans, even though it's old.

												Fantastic, underappreciated gameThis is the best of the 3 in the seriesBuild a railway company, and make money by transporting people and goods. You must lay track, and build bridges This version weighs supply and demand, so you shouldn't just send passengers to the same destination, but to as many destinations as possible. You have to spend your profits to add new territory you can operate in. You can buy industries or producers and make money by getting their goods to markets. New engines become available according to the date, and you can upgrade to diesel or electric trains. The game has depth, replayability and accomplishes the 'fun factor' The game is just a a tonne of funScenarios have interesting and challenging victory conditions and award bronze, silver or gold depending on how well you can do. Does not work in Windows 8, sadly. I love Railroad Tycoon more than I care about anytihng in Windows 8. I wish I could go back to 7 for Railroad Tycoon 2, I would totally do it.			"

However resolutions changed and I was wondering how all these people were able to play this game when my screen was zoomed in too much. I finally got the correct resolution for the game running on a 4k monitor. The problem seems to be due to display scaling. So finally heres the secret if you are having problems with screen size. Go through your steam folder to rail road tycoon, find the exe file, RT2_Plat, right click, go to properties, click compatibility tab, and select ""disable diplay scaling on high DPI settings"" and wholla it should work. If you have a ""failed to find steam"" error make sure that your steam.exe file (can use the one on desktop) is set to ""run as adminstrator."" All you high resolution, large display scaling peoples, youre welcome. Please bump for people who need help. Cheers.			"

The first time I bought it off of the game rack at Wal-mart. I've logged over 100 hours, and I still love to play it.

												I've played Railroad Tycoon since the first version, not great at it, but have fun. Thought I'd relay this story.I started a passenger/mail train running from Minneapolis to Seattle in the late 1800's. Jesse James robs the first run, I'm annoyed, but figure OK, it's a one off. The next one will surely give me the big payoff. Second run takes off, Jesse James robs it again, wondering where the US cavalry are and why they aren't protecting my assets. Third run, this one has to make it, Jesse James robs it again! Who the hell do I have to bribe in the government to get some protection here?!Finally, the news arrives! Jesse James has been caught, yay! I will finally see that route pay off the way I expected from the start. Fourth train takes off from the station, steaming along, no Jesse James in sight, woohoo! Then Indians attack it! 10/10 Would set up the Minneapolis/Seattle run again!			"

As a little kid i rememeber watching  my grandfather play this game, and got addicted on just running trains on the tracks. i had no idea what i was doing, then i got bored and never touched it again. After some years i found it in one of his CD stacks, and actually learned how to play. My grandfather moved things around and i could never find the disk again, and then i find it on steam. This game takes time to understand but its worth trying it out. By far a must play for a tycoon style game. The game as you progress keeps you entertained. there is hardly ever a dull moment.  "

												I love this game! This is my go to when I am at school waiting for class to start! It reminds me so much of roller coaster tycoon. I love that it is strategic. It takes a lot of thought to get profit from each train. You do not want to run trains that are not making profits. Very fun and entertaining.			"

												Although this is an older game I still found it to be a very interesting and fun game. If you like games such as Stronghold HD, Age of Empires, Rollercoaster Tycoon, or similar simulation/strategy/management games then you will very much enjoy this game.One very important thing I want to state is that this game is a challenge. You can pass each level with a bronze, silver, or gold medal. If you want the gold medal in the mission you really do have to understand and plan out the level in order to get it. It is not like Rollercoaster Tycoon where you can just build up a park and have it generate money. The objectives are much harder in Railroad Tycoon than in similar tycoon games. You can still complete the levels with the minimum requirements and get through the campaign, but in order to get all the achievements you must understand how the game works.Another thing I really want to mention is that there is a narrator who interacts with you in the mission selection screen. If you end up leaving the screen idle the narrator will actually yell at you and tell you to pick a level because you are taking too long to select something. This is a really great touch, and it reminded me of Stronghold HD where if you play for hours on end the narrator will ask you if you are tired - or if you play past midnight the narrator would tell you that you need sleep because it's getting late. I really love additions like this in games.Overall, this is probably my favorite tycoon game. Period. It's both very simple while being extremely complex.			"

No, although there are lots of optional scenarios and higher medals to earn, I didn't find the core gameplay appealing enoughBest part – Creating a nice, efficient rail system hauling cargo from raw material to final product and selling it all at the end of the line for a tidy profitWorst part – Stock market system is very boring and unfortunately necessary on some scenarios			"

												Awsome game i really enjoy playing.  I remember the first Railroad Tycoon that was on 3.5"" floppy disks and you had to look in the manual to identify the train that was shown in order to login to the game (which was a neat way to do DRM i thought).Anywho the whole point is that i like this game the most out of all 3, with the first iteration coming in a close 2nd behind this one.  The third tycoon game i really didnt enjoy at all sadly.  The only thing about this game that i do NOT like (the steam version that is) is that i can't seem to get it in window mode at all.  when i select window mode in game it says to change your desktop resolution (which is normally 1920x1080 but gets scaled down to 1024x768 when the game executes) however obviously it cannot be changed as when alt+tab'ing out of the game to change it it switches back to native 1920x1080.  Also adding the '-window', '-sw' or '-startwindowed' monnicker does nothing as well to the steam startup options.That minor quibble aside though, if you like trains and you like simulation games i would recommend this.

												My only dissapointment with this game is that having played the original game on my CMD64 its clear that the developer has decided to 'dumb-down' the network management aspects of the game.In the original game the player was required to design and manage their rail network and by providing signalling solutions at every network junction.  This meant that the player had much more contol over the flow of traffic, and was not assisted by the 'ghost train' system used in RT2 and subsequent releases.You had to plan your schedule to avoid conflicts not just rely upon trains to lass magically through each other.  As such getting it wrong resulted in actually train crashes and loss of reputation, drop in customers, and a fall in the share price.I miss that level of immersion in the game, and it means that TTD now has the edge as far as this type of game is concerned.

It's 1700 so your train will go slow and hills are difficult to come over. You need to make money to can get connected to another town. You need to consider what you can offer and what the other town needs. When you can't provide what the other town needs you will make no money. it's a time consuming game but i like it.			"

So I’m in the impossibility to evaluate it…Then the last one, and the only one which work perfectly, a game of 1998… “Railroad Tycoon 2”, what to say… A bit old fashioned form the graphic point of view but really complete.I hope this evaluation will help you.Oh a last thing, I’m not writing in my own language so… be indulgent!

												Very fun game.If you were into SimCity,SimFarm,SimTower and even the dreaded SimEarth you will love this game.Its very addictive to play,never gets tiring,and is easy on the eyes graphically for a old school game. Almost wish I was into tycoon sims back when this came out but glade I got it now.Also to add...its packed full of different resources,train engines, and complex gameplay to keep the intelligence levels great for all difficulty types. You play from the early 1800s to the 1900s in the vanilla, then in the 2nd Century (its included expansion) you play from bout the 1850-2000 + or so.Game has sandbox mode that you can set when you start and a good amount of replay value.Only nagging point I have about the game is the mechanics behind setting up your trains routes.The trains you have to put specific cars on so that they can pick up or drop off an item,problem is sometimes a place might not have what your train needs , so you would want to set the station to only give you what the station has.However doing this (despite having the cars already) puts new ones on which takes loading time. Since this game is a race against the clock and pausing can hold up lines, you understand how this can be annoying.Other than that love the game.If you looking for a more hardcore simulator this one is not it.Its a strategy game first and fore most with sim elements.I suggest * OpenTTD (f2p)[www.openttd.org] ,* Simutrans (f2p)[www.simutrans.com], or * Transport Giant Gold Edition $9.99[www.gamersgate.com] "

With all the addon maps fans have made there is lots of possibilities on real railroads or just plain what if routes.. The sound track is easy to listen to and works well with game. Graffics are alittle out dated but still looks good as well as game runs on win10 64bit just fine. lots pure fun building and becoming a rail barion tycoon..  And if you want to do a what if? play in the future maglev trains.So grab the game and have some fun  :)  It's just that simple .			"

												The game that came out prior to this one, Railroads!, has since been given a mighty makeover and is by far the better game.  This one simply reflects the era in which it was created, when people still used Windows 3.1, and the game engine consisted of square tiles and sprites.  This one stutters quite badly, even on high spec systems, and a lack of options means you can't turn off the really annoying music.  It's like a ""demo"" version of Railroads!  Animations are terrible, with trains jacknifing on single tracks, and the control GUI takes up way too much oif the screen (a common problem in those days).  A shame Sid Meier's organisation didn't makeover this one too while they were at it.  It doesn't look like an update is coming anytime soon.  Go for Railroads! instead.			"

												I have fond memories of this game from when I was younger.  I enjoy a good strategy sandbox game and I loved this game as well as the original Railroad Tycoon when it first came out.  I'm not overly concerned about graphics so I figured this game would stand the test of time. Unfortunately in my opinion it doesn't.  What I originally remember being a fairly complex and challenging simulation turns out to be a pretty easy strategy game that gets very tedious very quickly.  Multiple times in my 12 hours of game play I started a new game on the most challenging settings hoping to get a good tough scenario.  Each time very early on all challenge was gone and i was able to build at will, buy up all real estate, and have no concerns as to the ownership of my company.  Just pick a starting place with a few decent cities near by, watch the needs of the city, and build accordingly.  Not a lot more to it than that.			"

												I wrote a long review and Steam decided not to save it. Screw you, Steam.Suffice to say: Random economy changes can screw up your entire level at the drop of a hat (they can also help you, but you shouldn't have to keep restarting or reloading a level just to win it from randomness), and, MORE IMPORTANTLY, the computer AI cheats, getting several times as much profit as you from identical trains, and when they decide to actually use that money early on, before you're able to get ahead, there is no possible way to win the level. Terrible design.I had a lot of fun with this game growing up (the Gold edition, at least; it feels like they changed the AI going to Platinum), and a lot of nostalgia involved with it, but I'm very glad I didn't pay more than $5. I won't be playing this game again.			"

												Brought back some fond memories. I played this game to death when ti was new. Today, not so much. The graphics are too dated for it to be playable. I gave it a half hour and just couldn't keep going, compared to playing Sid Meier's Railroads!. There's some nostalgia here if you can put up with very poor graphics (for instance, train cars will ""step"" up and down hills rather than rotate, and shading is done with hatching rather than alpha). It was more fun before I got spoiled on newer, better versions. I recommend Sid Meier's Railroads! instead. This isn't worth even a couple bucks.			"

												Why would I ever think the steam version would do any better than the disk version is beyond me. After spending the better part of an hour trying to get the steam version working with display fusion treating it as a full screen app, nothing works. Only thing good about this is that I only wasted $1.73. Even following the suggestions for W7x64 nothing works.			"

												Let me get this straight: I LOVE this game. It's an awesome title about managing trains, building new railroads, trading, stock market... seriously, it is fun.Then why don't I give a reccomendation?This game is hardlocked to 800 x 600. And full screen. You cannot get out of fullscreen mode, which is REALLY a shame.I doubt that the bug will ever be fixed (Because it says you need to have a resolution of 1024 x 728 or higher to play in windowed mode, but that doesn't work), but as soon as the bug is fixed, I will change my review.

												I really, really like trains. I bought the 3 pack of RR Tycoon 2 & 3 + Sid MEIERS RR. I don't recommend any of them.This one of cource has very low graphics since it's an older game, but I can forgive that if the gameplay is good. Unfortunatly it is decent at best. No one thing to point at, just not much help ingame as to what all you can do, or what everything does, but you can figure out most of it. There was just no much that impressed me. Overall slightly more fun than SID MEIERS, which relied mostly on graphics, but still not worth my money, or yours.			"

												I played this game quite a bit in spite of it's many flaws.  It has improvements over the great original Railroad Tycoon, it's more realistic, there's more stuff to do, they've of course improved the graphics in the intervening the years but I don't know...it's just not fun.  I haven't played this game in some time so can't go into many details.  One thing I do remember being annoyed with is that there's a limit to how many computer players you can have on each map.  There's no reason for this.  It's not a memory issue.  On some maps you can have 32 players (or something) but on others, you can only have two.  There's no rhyme or reason.  It's not really related to map size or anything like this.  Also, on the maps with 32 or whatever players, more than half of those players NEVER BUILD ANYTHING.  They just put all of their money in the stock market trying to get rich that way.  Kind of stupid.Anyway, hopefully they've made better railroad-building simulation games since this.  Don't bother looking at Railroad Tycoon 3 or Sid Meier's Railroads, though.  They're total crap.Pwninator score: 5/10			"

												TL;DR: This is one of my favorite games for all time. It is definitely worth checking out even today. Where to begin with Railroad Tycoon II? I could start with both the campaigns. The Platinum edition has two campaigns: The ""Original"" Railroad Tycoon II campaign and the Second Century campaign.  Both cover a wide swath of history and geography, ranging from building the Trans-Siberian Railway to the introduction of railroads in the United States. While some of the scenarios in these campaigns are just simple train-routing puzzles, most of the campaign scenarios are quite meaty, taking a good half-hour to two hours to complete. I could mention the vast number of maps that this package includes. In addition to the campaign, the Platinum edition includes 50 other maps of varying quality and a map editor if you're interested in making more. Like the campaign, these can range in playtime from a half hour to several hours per map. However, since this is an older game, I'm not sure how many other folks are making new maps for this game these days. I could mention the replay value of all of those maps. The game has a semi-random distribution of industries at every map start, which makes each play-though subtly different. I could mention the nearly two hours of blues music that is the game's soundtrack, or the attention to detail in the game's artwork. While it is stuck in isometric view, the game's graphics don't feel particularly dated to me. The only quibbles I've got is the lack of support for wide-screen resolutions (which didn't really exist when it was made). But, overall, I think the core gameplay as a logistics puzzle and business game is Railroad Tycoon II's strongest element. The gameplay is truly 'easy to learn, difficult to master'. The idea of ""Deliver one iron, one coal to a steel mill, then take that steel to a Tool and Die factory which produces one goods to take to a town"" is simple, but actually delivering it all, at a profit, is a real challenge. The player gets all sorts of interesting decisions along the way: From where to route track to how to finance the whole operation to what locomotive to choose.			"

												A classic strategy game that anyone who enjoys strategy should play. Start a company, build tracks and stations, buy trains and set routes, invest in industry and the stock market, and even perform hostile takeovers of other companies. No other railroad game, including RT3, has such deep and fun gameplay.			"

												Blast from the past, circa 1998! This is truly one of my favorite PC games of all time. I’m happy to see it works great on my Win 7 x64 system. As far as the game itself, it’s a plain and simple railroad manager with dated graphics and horrible sound (as compared to current games). However, the gameplay is fun and it can be a challenge at times not to go bankrupt. What I've always liked about this game, was the ability to customize it. You can customize your in game character by typing in a new name and selecting a new portrait. You can customize your company by changing your logo, renaming it, and by renaming your trains & the cities/towns in which they serve. The game also sports a map/scenario editor for further customizations. As far as the ""tycoon"" aspect goes, the gameplay allows for the issuance of stocks & bonds, setting dividends, hiring and firing of managers, and instigating mergers and hostile takeovers. This game was one of the best - if not the best, in the Tycoon series back in the day. In my opinion, it still is today! Recommended +10 for nostalgia, and for fun!			"

You have to prioritize seriously limited resources, play the stock market as an insider (insider trading is required in order to maximize your outcome in certain scenarios).

												It's probably the best semi-modern railroad tycoon-type game. It lacks for me, though, the sheer joy of the first one. While the graphics and interface are crude by today's standards, your company's actions had real impacts in the game world, and that is something I don't always see in this one.  It also annoys me in the campaign that I meet certain requirements (like connecting New York to Chicago), but the game chooses not to recognize it.  Ugh.			"

												Got this game when it was first relased in the late 1990s. Came back to it on Steam and remembered why I liked it so much to begin with. Lots to do and lots to learn while the same scenarios will play out differently each time thanks to radomized map resources and random events.There is much strategy to had - certain resources require other resources to make them even more successful (bring grain to a cattle farm and then send the cattle bounty to the slaughterhouse. From there, food is generated that you can send on to a city demanding it. There's nothing like seeing the massive payday of a cross-country haul reach its destination. Or stay out of commodities and simply set up a passenger/mail route between to major hubs.Different cities/towns require different resources. Routes will vary as you pass through mountains and over rivers as will cost to build your track network and bridges. Your opponents will do what it takes to bring you down, including set up profitable routes in your backyard, buy stock in your company, or buy local businesses that you helped to become lucrative - beat them to the punch and buy those steel mills, factories, and cattle farms before they do. Buy stock in your company or a competitor's company. Deal with economic swings, advancing train technologies, and the judgement of your Board of Directors - it's all here.The graphics are surely dated by 2010s standards but I can look beyond that limitation to recapture the fun I had with this classic title - even now I get lost in this title for hours. Of all of the strategic railroad sims out there currently (in 2015), I still feel that RRT2 is the best of the pack.			"

												Build railroads, invest in the stock market and become RICH, VERY RICH!This game is great, I played it long ago, and when I saw that it was published on steam, I bought again and got back to it.Although quite old, the game still runs fine on Windows 7.I only had to switch to the power saving graphics card to play it smoothly. With the performance graphics card the game is playble but the videos don't show and at times you have to unlock it with mouse clicks.There are two campaigns and a number of scenarios, ranging from the pionnering days of the railroad in the 1800's to futuristic scenarios in 2050. There are scenarios for all continents (even Antartica!) and lots of countries.But the real goal of the game is to become rich, very rich, beyond your wildest dreams!You can do that investing on the stock market, but take care because you can also endup penniless! In the hard levels there is cut-throat competition and the AI can make you sweat.I liked this game better than its successors (Railroad Tycoon 3 and Sid Meier's Railroads), even if the graphics are not as good, but the game is more balanced, RRT3 is to complex and SMRR is to simple.

												They just don't make in depth tycoon games like this anymore and it's a real shame. If you like games with deep management simulation, this game is for you! (If you can get over the fact that it is an old game) I recommend this more than Railroad Tycoon 3 for modern gamers because the appearance and interface are much sharper than its sequel. One of the more interesting aspects of this game (that many don't like) is that it focuses on your personal wealth as manager as well as the company wealth. Again, this is more of a management sim than a transport sim, and from the management standpoint this is a very unique aspect of this game that I find enjoyable. (Yet another aspect to manage)Pros:In depth economy (issue stocks/bonds, buy up your competitors, buy the industries, etc)Industries are randomly generated inside map regions, makes gameplay less repetitivePay your competitors to use their railsStations have various addons to improve revenue and maintain trainsCities grow as you supply them, and new industries appearCons:Old (It is 2D, the interface was designed with efficiency in mind, but it is a later 2D game)No mods (Such a shame)AI do become repetitive after many, many hours of gameplay (a mod would be nice)			"

												I like a good commercial simulation game. Set up supply chains, deliver products, make money! Railroad Tycoon 2 does that, and does a pretty good job of it. Things I like Flexibility: you get to decide where your tracks go, how you load the trains and even though you can program routes to do what you want over and over, you can micromanage if you want. Historical Trains: The game tells a bit about the historical context behind the different scenerios, which is fun. The trains are based on actual trains that were used. The cargos that you can carry evolve as the years pass (Oil doesn't become an useful cargo until after a certain year, for example)Worldwide settings: With scenerios set all over the world, any place that trains were important you get to try your hand at setting up your own empire. Things that bothered meI never really got the hang of the mechanic for driving your opponents out of business by buying them, or investing in them. Maybe I just wasn't paying close enough attention or something, but it seemed really tough to figure out what to buy, and when, and whether doing so would have the desired outcome. Sometimes putting a track down at just the place you want can be fiddly... that's probably unavoidable, but I found myself spending hours on pause just sorting out the best way to lay track between Germany and Italy, and I haven't yet figured out how to get track laid effectively in Japan. Overall, this game was totally worth it for me. I have easily gotten my money's worth.			"

												Railroad Tycoon II despite its age is a great game. Gameplay wise it is perhaps the best Railroad builder game ever made. Large maps and randomly generated cities and industries offers alot of replayability. I've played this game since it came out and it is definetly worth the few dollars to pick up the Steam version. Graphics are typical of the era not great by todays standards but it gets the point across. If you like railroads or just a well made Tycoon it is worth picking up.			"

												One of those ""Marmite"" games. It satisfies my need to build things in a somewhat meaningful way. That part of my brain that get's satisfaction from laying mile upon mile of railway track with that wonderful hammering of metal sound effect and the pure joy of hearing the loco's pull out of thier respective stations to thier respective destinations.You can be a pioneer of the rails or become a power-crazed, lunatic of capitalism.Simple one minute and the next scenario it can become devilishly complex.Nuff Said - buy it :D			"

												A fun game that is for the serious simulator. This trian sim is better than Sid Meier's RailRoads, i know becaouse i have that one. If you've played that game, this is for your inner rail road robber baron/tycoon. Sid's RR game is for the child... and yes the complexities are that different.  Old, but still fun 90%			"

												This is one of the greatest simulation games ever made. It gets so many things right, and for those willing to put up with the occasional graphical glitch or clunky UI, there is a great level of depth here and tons of replayability. It's satisfying to just sit back and watch the money roll in.			"

												Railroad Tycoon is a really funny game. But its also a relict of an other era. Build Stations and trains, decide which kind of waggons will be rolled from/to a station and eran money. Thats the simple goal. Its fun to build the different routes, the maps support all kinda terrain and nations (aka a european, UK, Asian or American scenario).Pro: -Lots of Possible Scenarios       -Different Trains       -If you are old enough it takes you back a coupkle of Years...Cons:- Hard to play         -Old Graphics         -not comparable to modern games			"

												This game still stands up as a great in the strategy genre. These days people are spoon-fed victories and achievements. This game can, at times, be impossible to achieve Gold if you don't get the right start. It makes it actually worth playing for the Gold. Works great on Win8.1 and 10 in my experience. Thanks for bringing it back!			"
