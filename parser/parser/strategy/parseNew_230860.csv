												Cannon Brawl is a unique mixture of RTS and Action with a fun campaign as well as great local and online multiplayer. In Cannon Brawl you choose one of a number of different airships, each with their own pilot and special attributes, and you build turrets to destroy your enemy as well as defend your main building as well as towers and gold mines.+Nice 2D graphics, very colourful+Simple and easy-to-navigate world map where you can find the game's missions and challenges+Unique gameplay, you can build towers anywhere on the map (as long as you have a nearby territory balloon) but choosing your tower locations strategically is very important+You control each tower individually when firing and the aiming system is very good+A wide variety of unique, as well as familiar, towers each with upgrades that can be purchased during missions to make the towers more powerful/more effective+Five different airships to choose from+Maps are fully destructible+Good variety of map size +Has singleplayer, online multiplayer and local multiplayer gamemodes+Has challenges which can be completed to earn EXP and level your profile up+Towers have reasonable/fair cooldown times+Lots of explosions+Has achievements and Trading Cards+/-You can only equip five towers in each mission which can sometimes be quite annoying as you need good variety in your roster while keeping a good balance of tower costs +/-It is clearly intended that you use a controlle-I found it the singleplayer got repititive very quickly when playing singleplayer-Some of the airship attributes are far more useful than others which effects the balanceVerdict:7A great RTS/Action game that delivers a great multiplayer experience but gets boring quite quickly in singleplayer, get it to play with friends.El K.

												Very fun, highly recommend for same-screen competitive battling.  Sort of a light RTS mixed with tower-trajectory style gameplay.  It's not super deep but I easily got my time and money's worth.			"

								A very addicting and well crafted game.There aren't a lot of players online, so if you try to do ranked you will be mathched up vs either Gort or Watson, two ranked bots programmed into the game.At first ranked will be easy as you climb the ladder, you only get a tiny amount of points for winningm but you lose billions of points for defeats, so If you play for an hour straight and only won, ONE DEFEAT WILL TAKE ALL OF IT AWAY.Ranked needs to be fixed and ballancing might have to occur. Overall, there needs to be more players.BUY THIS GAME but do yourself a favor and stay away from ranked until more people are active and the elo system is adjusted.			"

												Nearly 200 hours in this game and if you look through my steam games, that doesn't happen too often.This is a great game for competitive RTS, the down-side is the community is rather inactive but does have its moments when it can get really busy!Basically, think a game like the Worms game in RTS form with ""towers"" that you can upgrade. Although there could be more of a selection of weapons to use, the limited amount keeps a good balance and still gives a good variety mixed with all the types of characters you can choose from. Lots of strategies, lots of fun, but limited community.. join in guys, and help it grow. I'm currently rank #2(The first guy.. has wayyy too many hours in this game among other things.) and need some real competitors! Only a few people that still play on occasion are my only challenge. Others are questionable or use spammy techniques, I strive for real opponents!			"

Product received for free
I've received a key in order to review this game, however, this has not affected my personal opinion. First Sight The game looks like a fusion between the Worms franchise, the turn based system though being eliminated from the ecuation, resulting into a RTS.  Gameplay You are given an array of offense, defense, economy, utility and most important your ship which will give you an advantage granted if you know how to use it to said advantage.Offense is made out of laser, cannon, drill, freezing, missile, flamethrower, grenade launcher towers and even nukes! Defense is composed out of shields that can deflect incoming laser or take the damage may it be cannon, freezing or the missile tower, et cetera. Using the shield's perk of deflecting can prove of good use in the case of lasers. Utility has various tools such as the platform, bank, territory balloon, terraforming tower and I recall there being an aerial building that gives a speed boost to the buildings. Economy has mines and can be used on diamond or gold deposits.Campaign has quite a solid story for the genre, with boss battles and it covers the basics and advanced topics of the game. Competitive is quite a challenge, since it's not balanced at all, you lose your rank way, way too fast and it lacks a player base.It's a really good game for casual playing, the AI is satisfying in my opinion since ranked is not really optimal for playing.You can lay all sorts of tactics on the battlefield, but be swift and merciless as every second matters in this game. Graphics The 2D environment is really fascinating, I love the sorta cartoony way all the textures have been designed and how they blend into the gameplay, the campaign's map is a really nice adding as well. OST & SFX Soundtrack is always a must and will set the game's ambience and in this case it's a good choice along with the sound effects. No complains on this one. Should you buy it? I don't recommend buying the game only for yourself but get the 2 pack so you can play with a friend, multiplayer isn't active so you'll encounter problems in multiplayer. If you have only the possibility and the mood to play only single player, then go for it, you'll face some difficulty from the AI, being able to enjoy the game thoroughly for complete hours.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:  Follow Original Curator Group  "

												I will recommend this game but cautiously. It is fun, it does come with a large selection of tower choices, has controller support, it is local co-op (with controller support) and it does have two parts to it's campaign. It does fall a bit short in keeping the gamer's attention. Cannon Brawl brings a new sort of game style to the table. Similar to Castle Storm (which is also a good game), Cannon Brawl's purpose is to destroy the opponents castle. Unlike Castle Storm (which has it's own rooms to upgrade weapons), CB doesn't allow you to see into your castle or upgrade a javelin like device to take out your opponent. What you are working with though is a hero (of your choice after completing a bit of the campaign) where each hero have their own special ability (such as one hero heals towers when in proximity). The approach the game has taken towards commanding ones towers is quite admirable. In fact, it's what probably separates the game from being another boring Castle VS Castle type game. Unlike Castle Storm where you can summon and control your hero, you are ALWAYS in control of your hero. The hero flies through the air to either build new structures or command a tower. Before building anything, the hero needs to grab territory VIA using hot air balloons. When these balloons are placed, the player may build within the vicinity. The balloons also provide extra protection as they can take a hit instead of a bullet or bomb hitting your tower. Gold is the currency used by the game to build new towers on the landscape. To acquire gold (or diamonds), the player must build a gold mine on top of either element. Diamonds may not be available to build on and the player may have to shoot away at the ground to properly expose them. Upon acquiring enough currency, the player may build a tower. These towers (to name a few) come in form of a simple cannon tower, a rocket tower (which shoots out a grouped rocket which then spreads out), a shield tower (to protect from nasty air assaults), a laser/rail gun tower, a bomb tower that launches a walking bomb, and a bank tower that can bribe one of your opponents towers to take it over. I haven't mentioned all the towers but there are quite a bit to choose from. There is a key combination I found that usually leads me to victory using the gold mines, shields, rocket and laser tower accordingly. Some towers have adverse effects such as using a laser tower against a shield tower. If the laser does fire onto a shield, the shield will rebound the laser in another direction. If you fire in the wrong direction or angle, you can expect a shot going back your way eating away at the ground and dropping your tower from an obscene height leading to destruction. All towers are available for upgrade and make the game even more interesting. I have mentioned that the ground can be blown up as seen in Worms Armageddon. This is a great feature to the game and really makes you think of the locations regarding gun placements. Visuals are suited to the games cartoon atmosphere. The effects after something blows up or when something hits a shield is visually apparent. The sounds are equally as good as they reflect exactly what you are doing whether it's flying, shooting, or defending. The music is enjoyable and the menus are presented extremely well. If you can find local co-op easily, you know you've got a good interface. Navigating the campaign mode is done on a giant map. There two levels to choose from as you progress : the next mission and puzzle levels. Puzzle levels can be survival to trick shots. Overall, a good game but not worth it's stated price. Even when it was on sale I was still on the fence. I do enjoy the game and come back to it here and there, but once you've had your fill or have beaten all there is to beat, you may not like it anymore. I definitely enjoyed my time playing it.RATING : 7/10 Gameplay B Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  B- "

												This is a really solid game that mixes the artillery and RTS genres together perfectly. It cuts out all of the wait time normally associated with an artillery type of game and replaces it with RTS elements. This makes for a much more fast paced and enjoyable experience that still retains the fun of angling shots over long distances to hit enemies.			"

There is a slight unbalance in terms of the weaponary, and i feel is lacking the amount of sheer insanity that Worms has as a similar game. That aside, I urge you to purchase and support this game. Very well made, very well managed from what i can see from the devs taking on feedback, and very well executed.			"

												Cannon Brawl is a  2D real time action strategy game that is fast pace while still allowing you to relax and have fun.The game features a range of game modes and features such as;*Campaign*the kings evil uncle is filled with rage and has decided to rage war upon your farther, the king. Its  the princesses (you) job to stop the war!This battle now starts allowing you to control a huge airship to dock, aim, fire, build, sell, upgrade and BLOW THINGS UP. While this game makes great use of the space bar (really it's the arrow keys to move. space bar for everything else) you quickly get the hang of the rules and game play.  You can also key bind to suit your needs. *Multiplayer and  ai battles*-- Your standard Cannon Brawl matches and experience. The multiplayer is smooth, lag free and easy to setup. The AI battles offer a range of difficulty settings  allowing for a  a great way to practice  the game.*Armory*-- While playing the game you will earn experience points, the armory is a simple shop where you can spend those points to unlock new towers and pilots.You will quickly get other pilots, each with their own powers, towers such as  the frost tower or the warhead tower. After you complete campaign don't stop there! You can replay the whole thing over on night mare mode! And you can always just vs. AI in battles. However the fun starts when you hit MP and start climbing up the leader boards!This game packs in 15-25 hours of game play before you have 100% percent it.			"

												Pretty solid game to spend a few hours on, well worth buying during a sale.

Can start to feel a little easy when you get the hang of it, but rewarding when you fight back from a close defeat.			"

There's Cannons, Strategy, corny humor, time challenges for trophies, etc.  Plus, there's Trading Cards, and I'm a sucker for those. ;P  But, seriously, this game feels like a mix-up of a simple tower defense and a Worms-like weapon system.  You place your weapons like a Tower Defense, but you also have to select them, aim them, and fire them yourself... no automatic firing with makes this one more unique.If you want some awesome mashed-up strategy, tower defense, and cannon shooting gameplay, this one is a must buy.

Posted: February 3, 2016
It does so much right, but became an exercise of frustration for me.The game is mostly the traditional ""artillery"" game, but with a nice twist -- you set up a number of turrets and the main goal is the opponents castle.  This game has a lot of charm, and a neat little mechanic of having to travel to the turret in order to operate it.  It also has pretty good use of a variety of turrets.While the game started well and was quite enjoyable, the game's mild annoyances for me become too annoying in the later levels; I completed up through Level 13 and accomplished some of the Puzzle levels.The Good:+ Charming game and I really liked the early levels+ Good graphics, art style, and animations+ Nice campaign and looks like quite a few levels+ Nice twist and adds something new to the ""artillery"" games+ Has multiplayer  (I've only done the solo player campaign, but seems like a great option)The OK:~ Tower selection Cooldown.  There are cooldowns even before you can select the next tower to build from the Castle.  Why?~ ""Actions Per Minute"" Star Rating?  I understand and agree with beating a mission by a certain ""Time Limt"", but that's a different Star Rating, and I like that one.  But if I beat the mission in a certain time, why does it matter how many actions I did or DIDN""T do ?   APM simply measures how ""busy"" you are; which has nothing to do with how well or effective you played.~ Tower Placement.  The placing of the buildings to be built which dangle beneath your airship as if you are transporting them to where they go.  This isn't intuitive for placement selection and is mostly problematic when trying to place ""territory expanding sky-balloons"" which I kept having to settle for ""close enough"", yet end up NOT being close enough after all...~ Every level is something new.  A new tower this level, another new tower next level.  A dozen levels into it there's just all sorts of stuff -- just seems too quick; no time to enjoy the turret you just got.  It's like they couldn't decide which towers to include in the game so they through them all in, or they didn't want to make enough levels to support gradually introducing them.  They should either remove some tower types or create more levels so as to introduce them at a better pace.The Annoying:- I apparently stink at this game. I shouldn't have to TRY this hard to complete some of these levels...on NORMAL...and I don't mean ""complete with a 3 star rating"", I mean ""just-crawl-your-beaten-down-carcass-across-the-finish-line"" complete.  I'm clearly doing something wrong.  If I wanted a greater challenge that's what higher difficulty settings are for, and puzzle/challengs maps, and getting all Star Ratings.  Not simply trying to complete a level and having my ""castle"" handed to me...   again, I'm clearly doing something wrong on this game.  (My point is, I shouldn't have to watch 'How to Beat' youtube videos or strategies or anything...that might be for playing harder difficulty levels, or finding easter eggs, or seeing how people beat challenges, etc...not just for simply how to get past Level X on NORMAL)Overall this is one of the few games I really want to like but can't recommend because it got annoying and frustrating for me to play.  6 out of 10.

The only negative is that there are not that many players and sometimes you may not find a multiplayer game quick enough. I highly recommend it though!			"

												It's like a Tower defense but based on micromanagement. Really fun and easy to play.The game propose different way to play with different tower you can choose yet i think that the basic one are really more powerful than the others. The game lake probably of deep strategy, and it must be based on speed if you would like to play it at a competitive level, and that's quite disrupting.Yet, it's a great game for casual play, but you won't spend a lot of time on it.

If you can get it on sale, then that’s even better! If not, the original price of $14.99 is still pretty reasonable considering how fun the game truly is. So yeah, I think it’s worth your time.VERDICT: YES, GET THE GAME!			"

												Cannon Brawl.It's a good game. Soundtrack is really good, art is fine as wine, and playableitiy is good. Runs okay, game is capped at 60, but setting menu leaves a lot to be desired. For resolution, you get fullscreen on/off.That's it.Game does provide a nice portion of challenge and it nicely guides into it, through the campaign.The story, or what is there of it, is fairly nice, for me it seems like there are even some gurren laggan references? Though that might just be me.in the end, it's a very nice tug of war. And my only complaint is tat 15E is a bit much. More like 10E.			"

They've done a great job of creating a game that really mixes the traditionally more turn based projectile game with RTS elements that keep 100% of your attention focused for the whole game.Even though it didn't really need it I enjoyed the single player campaign as a great way to learn about all the different towers and had fun writing.

Cannon Brawl feels like a combination of tower defence, Worms and RTS, with quick rounds and enough strategic depth that it's interesting but not overwhelming.

												Imagine Starcraft: The Tower Wars 2D.I say that because this game is weighted with real skill in how you want to balance your economy (rush the crystal? or build attack towers?), how fast you can move (APM!) and your tower composition for each map.There are definitely paper rock scissor strategies revolving around tower builds in more advanced levels of play, but the great balancer is APM. If you can move faster, position your cannons better, etc. Overall this game ""towers"" over many other Indie games.			"

								This is probably one of the best surprise indie games I've played all of 2013. It's essentially a Worms RTS. You build buildings on a Worms-like landscape and the goal is to use towers to destroy the enemy base. It is a brilliant game with a fun story that makes you want to keep playing, as each new level is a new challenge and not some repetitive nonsense to increase story length.Also, if you guys didn't know, this is the game that won Activision's $100k game concept contest. Activision did a terrific job picking this game out and these devs are every bit deserving of that funding and your money. Buy this game if you like Worms or RTS games.			"

								I'm not sure I've played a game quite like Cannon Brawl. It feels like a twist between Worms & Defense Grid. It's campaign is quite lengthy with three objectives per mission, puzzle missions and a series of balanced unlocks to explore new pilots and towers; each with their unique abilities. The art style is cohesive and the pefect amount of cartoon fantasy for the loose story that it presents. Gameplay elements like bombs that walk to their destination after being fired to lasers that bounce off of shields (including a player pilot shield on one pilot which can be used to bounce the laser in otherwise inaccessible angles). The gameplay is very quick and the AI is competative & enjoyable to play against. After around 4 hours of play, I'm near the end of the campaign but after that there is still nightmare mode, multiplayer and AI skirmishes. This is a great value @ 15$ and is extremely polished for an early access game. Would recommend trying it out for sure!			"

								This game is a lot of fun. The campaign begins as a sort of tutorial but doesn't hold your hand. The beginning is easy on you as you learn the basics but it's still fun because it's gameplay is just inherently fun. The campaign gets a lot harder as you progress and the enemy has new buildings you have to fight against before you get them yourself. It also has an XP system where you finish challenges and can compete online to obtain the XP which buys updated buildings and new pilots. All I wish is that more people (such as yourself) buy this great game so I can fight you online. I've never had trouble finding a match but I seem to play the same people a lot and get my♥♥♥♥♥kicked and I want to kick some♥♥♥♥♥myself so go ahead and buy the damn game. It officially comes out in a few weeks so just do it.			"

Early Access Review
								I previewed the early access version for ScrewAttack, and, despite minor flaws, Cannon Brawl was solid. The stages were unique, the units were interesting and the selection of characters helped keep the game fresh. I did have minor gripes about the online play because some units were far too easy to spam, which crippled the game's deep learning curve and threw strategic direction out the window. That aside, the single player was a load of fun. The game is far from perfect, but it's worth the price tag. Get it!			"

								I have been a giant fan of Cannon Brawl for years, and I think it's the ultimate game for people who love the IDEA of Starcraft but want a quicker, more active take on the real-time strategy genre. It's very easy to learn, and in spite of the game's rough edges right now, it's already a balanced blast. Cannon Brawl wins at indie gaming competitions and judging events again and again, and for good reason. Get on this.			"

												A very unique game (to me at least).A side-scrolling RTS with destructible terrain where you construct and control your buildings indirectly via a craft that you fly. You basically use offensive buildings to try and shoot your opponent's buildings and ultimately blow up their HQ. There are also non-offensive buildings such as mines (mining income) and shields. For each game you get to choose 5 building types and 1 pilot.Positives:Novel and fun.Feels pretty well balanced.Fairly complex gameplay.Negatives:No mouse. It's designed to not need it, but I still think it would be better.Needs more and bigger maps.Non-aesthetic upgrades are bought with XP (not real-life money thank god). This is OK for the campaign or solo play, but IMHO unfair in multiplayer.Matchmaking is buggy (but usable).8/10.It's pretty cool as is, but it really cries out for a sequel.			"

								This game is real-time Worms with a ton of strategy.  Like most RTS games, you gather resources and build things.  Unlike most RTS games, each individual unit or structure will only attack if you directly control it, unable to be used again until its cooldown expires, but your enemy has the same limitation too.  Land is destructible, so you might choose to destroy that rather than attacking the enemy directly.  You get to choose from a selection of commanders that have different buffs or special abilities.  The campaign is charming, but fairly easy.  The ""nightmare"" campaign afterwards is where you'll have a real challenge, but mostly because the computer cheats.Multiplayer is where this game really shines.  Get a couple friends over and alternate playing some 1v1 matches (the only kind that the game supports), and that will keep you occupied all night.  This game is so accessible that after only a few matches, a new player will be able to compete with someone who's been playing for hours and hours, and the various strategies you can use keep it from feeling stale.  I love this game.			"

								This game is an interesting mix of RTS and Artillery genres.  I also like the XP system...that is, you'll unlock more towers/structures as you play.  It's a bit like CastleStorm in that it's a 1vs1 experience, though you don't get to build troops and send them off across the battlefield.  Rather, you can continue to build structures and fight for control over territory...something you couldn't do in CastleStorm.  Pretty fun, overall.

												More Reviews @ TheVideogameBacklog.comPlaying is believing. In gaming, those words are so true. Even if a game doesn’t quite do it for you aesthetically or something about it kind of bothers you… if you play it, maybe then you’ll realize the truth of the game. Cannon Brawl hit me much the same: a basic, simple RTS-type game. (It’s unfortunately hard to truly capture the essence of a videogame in videos at times.) Then I got my hands on Cannon Brawl at PAX and my eyes were opened. There is a lot of fun to be had here and there is quite a depth of strategy to go with it!So every map starts out much the same. Two players or you and an AI each control a base on opposite sides of said map. Your objective is the blow the other guy’s base up. There are plenty of tools at your disposal with which to do that. Maybe you’re a direct approach guy/gal and love how lasers dig straight at your opponent’s base giving you an easy in. They can trump you with Shield Towers to deflect those lasers back at you. Then you could choose the Bomb Bot Blaster tower to send Bomb Bots to walk through their shields, but then they dig a ditch and your bombs are rendered somewhat mute. There are multiple weapons and all of them serve their purpose well. For me, the exception to the rule is the Missile Tower. To note, all of my friends use the Missile Tower well and like it. However, I’ve just found it to be an indirect approach to victory and that’s not my “thing” most of the time. I want things to do more damage, not a spread of lesser damage. It’s hard to pin-point an attack with that weapon.The story, while feeling like it’s setup to give you an introduction into the world of Cannon Brawl, does more than that. The campaign serves as a way of unlocking multiple towers and characters to use in multiplayer battles and while doing that, proved to be rather fun. Players who don’t want to get their feet wet in the world on online competitive multiplayer games should defeat the single-player campaign and unlock Nightmare Mode. Some of the early levels will prove simple if you’ve picked up a few strategies and tricks along the way, however some of the levels are just plain brutal! I remember watching my bud play a level called Laser Defense and the enemy would quickly amass about eight to ten lasers all pointed at my friend’s base. The rounds didn’t last very long, but man did he get close a few times… to living longer.Cannon Brawl also brings back something that I miss: sitting next to your friends and playing games. I know that some people have arrangements where this isn’t an oddity to them. For myself, a lot of games that are Versus or Co-op are all online. We can feel connected all we want with Raidcall or your preference of communication, but nothing beats sitting next to some buds all yelling and cheering while playing the same game on the same screen. Cannon Brawl provided a lot of fun at a bud’s recent bachelor/LAN party. It was one of the highlights of the night other than playing some TF2!There is plenty of content and multiple mash-ups of levels and weapons to be had. So much so that you’ll have to be quick on your toes to best the people over the net. Coincidentally, that’s also where my one fault with the game lives. The map variety for Versus play is good. It’s not great, but it is good. It would be better if there were more maps to play on. More could be added in later, that’s not the issue, but I think this may be enhanced by allowing users to create maps. Open up the size of the maps as well so that you could have small, medium and large settings for some truly epic, if not way-to-drawn-out matches! I think this would also be a way to make some of the other tower options one takes into battle a little bit more desirable. Suddenly the Mountain Maker and the Floating Platform seem like great ideas to get to the other side or higher up for a better angle.Score: Tasty!Cannon Brawl is a frenzied, strategy RTS that is tons of fun with or without friends to play with. The single player campaign is fun and interesting enough to make you want to play through (aside from it also giving you towers for free). The only complaint I have is with the multiplayer. There are plenty of ways to play whether you want to play with a friend locally over a LAN, or challenge them directly over the net, against a computer AI or online against others. The issue is in the levels. I love the levels that are there, but there isn’t as many as I’d like. Cannon Brawl’s battles can get real repetitive aesthetically even though the battles are fun. Maybe they could give us more maps or allow players to create levels themselves. With the numerous amounts of variations you can pick with the towers, I just wish I had more places to blow up.			"

												It was an okay game with rough edges until they decided to forget about fixing the rough edges and instead added a completely stupid new ""feature"" that punishes the player for doing well. Who the hell came up with that crap? Too many whiny losing players wanted a Deus Ex Machina to make it ""fair"" for sucking? And the devs decided to give it to them? Well, almost nobody is ever online anyway, so it's just as good, if they want to cater to the bad players, then no one good will want to play. Or pay. $15? Really? For this sort of gameplay? It's not all about graphics you know. It's called ""games"" for a reason, not ""pretty moving artwork.""			"

												Cannon Brawl is a swift, tactical and tide-turning game, with many types of characters and towers that can keep the battle entertaining, one can do incredibly well for the first half, then lose half his defence in a matter of seconds.there is many types of strategys, such as a manipulating strategy where you have shields, lazers, (sometimes) repairs. quickly nab close by gold deposits on your half of the map, put up a lazer, then a shield, with 1-2 shields at the end of the towers, and 1-2 at the back, the back shields aiming up, the front ones aiming up-forward or down-forward, using the lazers, aim at their gold deposit, if it is high up destroy it's ground to destroy one of their gold mines, if they have shields don't worry, have a shield so there's a small gap between yours and theirs, fire a lazer into it so it bounces back and forth alot of times, then the shield is destroyed easily by the refined lazer damage, and continue to gradually move forward, with alot of shields on the battlefield where you are.some weapons and strategys can become lethal over time, or have a advantage over a cirtain tower, but yet again they might have something to counter what you have, ex. if you use knight's ability on the base throughout the match, and the fight goes on for maybe 6+ minutes, your base health gradually increases to a huge amount, but if they have lazers they can fire from across the whole map stright to your base, once i even had 4 repairs and my base which has 60 hp when things went down and land was running out, with repair towers healing each other and the base (like medic chains), then my health went to 120hp and for around 15minutes i sat there soaking up damage. The only issue i find with the game is the nukes and ice towers are WAY too op, where someone can sit at their base, defend with just shields, and then fire 3 lvl 3 nukes directly at the enemy base without anything stopping them, and the ice towers are literally a ugraded version of the cannon, exept what makes it too powerful is when it hits it has splash damage, and with all damage it freezes anything hit, temporarily disabling them, the part they have to nerf is how with a single lvl 1 projectile it can freeze 2-4 shields, and when a shield is frozen the effect of it is gone. ex. 3 lvl 3 shields is active, with protection from them adding to 12, then a single lvl 1 projectile hits the centre of them, all get's frozen, protection is GONE, please nerf because i've seen people with this and they really don't have to do much just to win, 90% of the games i play has this kind of thing every time and i can't even enjoy it anymore, really does takes the fun out the game.

												This is a fantastic game.  The concept is quite unique among RTS games.  The gameplay is quite fast.  It is easy to learn, but still difficult enough to keep you interested.  The game controls are quite clunky, and would definitely be better if a mouse could be used to control the airship, but this is a minor gripe.  All in all a fantastic game.			"

I had to wait to get some money. Now that I have the game, I'm gonna play it forever (well maybe not forever)!			"

												Reasonably solid little game that's kind of somewhere between an RTS game and a time management game (as you dash around the map to build and maintain little bits).  Felt some lack of variety while going through the single-player campaign, and sometimes felt that persistence/quickness/endurance sort of overwhelmed strategy - but still, I enjoyed my time with this.

								Great game, and the art style goes in a different direction than most real-time strategy games. This makes the game incredibly fun, since it's harder to take it as seriously as some other real-time strategy games. I'm not saying this is bad, it just makes the game more fun.			"

												If you enjoy strategy games, this is a game I can't recommend enough. It is a fresh take on the RTS genre that removes all the layers that usually distracts the players from focusing on the strategy aspect while giving you very precise, direct control of the units. Jumping into the game for the first time, or even just watching it, you *get* the game very quickly because the art and the sound do such a great job of communicating what is happening. You can see literally everything that is happening in the game with one glance. The game is elegantly designed to allow FUN for all skill levels ( even for a filthy casual noob like myself ) with depth of complexity that I will probably never unlock. The art is also spot-on and helps to make every action feel almost tactile and satisfying. I get bored with games in general pretty quickly but this is a game I never hesitate to play when I have the chance.			"

Cannon Brawl, by Turtle Sandbox, is an RTS, or Real Time Strategy, in the view of what I would think Worms would be if it wasn't turn based. In this game you will have to be quick, vicious, and courageous. You will have to defeat the Evil Uncle that seems to have imprisoned some of the finest sky pilots there are as well as the King. You will have to deal with his trickery, and of course his ever growing collection of buildings/weapons that are there to try to stop you. Will you be able to win back the kingdom, or are you destined to be shot out of the sky.Graphically the slightly cartoony look fits this game like a glove. Its not too graphic intensive, but at the same time it looks good, and holds up well to the speed of the game. The 2D sidescroller feel definitely scream to my days with Worms, especially when it comes to the landscape, though part of me want to lean towards scorched earth. Anyways all the buildings have their own look and all fit their abilities to the letter. If you want a rocket launching building, well they have one of those, and not only that but the upgrades to the buildings definitely bring some of the weapons from puny to world destroying, in their appearance.The sounds of the game are basically what you would expect from firing off your weapon, having an attack hit your buildings, or your shield, and of course your victory or your defeat.The controls for the game scream, ""PLAY ME WITH A GAMEPAD"", but have no fear if you do not have one, this is still a very playable game. You are going to be using WASD, space, and X most of the time, when you are not using a gamepad. You are also going to find that you need to be secure with your control scheme quickly, otherwise you are not going to last long enough to save the kingdom.Alright so lets get to it. There are several different modes that you can partake in. My main focus, of course, was on the campaign, where you set off to try to save the King. Now of course you will have to wage many battles, and rescue others before you can get to the king, but I will tell you this right now, you are going to have fun doing. Throughout the campaign mode you will unlock new, sometimes more ""your style"", buildings that will enhance your ability to survive the game going forward. Some of the buildings are as follows: Rocket launcher, shield, repair, bomb, nuke, freezing/disabling attack, and much much more. Oh and to make things interesting you get awards for each level. The main one is for winning, but there's also awards for doing so many actions per minute, and of course the other one is trying to defeat the level in a set amount of time. Don't worry though, you can still progress through the game if you aren't able to complete the other two.Now of course you have to be wondering, well how hard can it be to just throw a bunch of weapons down and just let them go to town on the enemy. Well here's the deal, you are going to have to mine gold or crystals to get the money that is needed to build the weapons, you are also going to need the space to place the weapon, oh and it will have to be within your influence area. You see you can't just throw a bunch of stuff right next to your enemy, you will have to fortify what you have, or try take over what is not your's that will in turn help you take down the enemy all that much faster.You will also have the chance to unlock new pilots as you are going through the game. They all have different abilities that can help you win battles. My personal favorite is the driller, there's nothing quite like seeing your enemy setup all nice and cozy on a rise, and then using the driller's special ability to dig the ground from under the building. Then of course there's the magnificent falling of said building, and then the triumphant crash. Speaking of unlocking characters and weapons, there's also quest or goals that you want to strive for, if you get those you get extra points that can be used to unlock new characters and weapons in the armory section of the game.Now of course there is more to the game than just the campaign, but if you want to survive the battles against AI opponents, or live opponents, you might want to play through the campaign just so you have choices when it comes to what you will be using against your opponent. I will fully admit, I'm pretty sure a live opponent would wipe the floor with me, my downfall is focusing on upgrading a couple buildings and then the next thing I know my opponent has down the arsenal, and its all coming at me at the same time.Now I think it is clear what I think of this game, and that of course is that it is crazy, fast, fun, and sometimes frustrating, but I want to keep coming back to it. Once you've played around a little, and you are ok with having the game speed set to a brisk running pace, you will find that one level or two just isn't going to satisfy you, you are going to want to destroy your enemy and take on all that you can. So with that I give this game a 9.3 out of 10.			"

There are few games that I've played that have me cringing/hoping for the victory at the end when both players are so close to annihilating their opponent.Additionally, as a Linux user for my primary computer, it's awesome to see this available on my preferred platform since that is where the majority of my good hardware is located.

								This Game is awesome. I got a chance to play this game at gaymerx 2 and after the convention I just had to buy the game. Have you ever had the feeling of trying a game and then sitting at the panel for that game several hours to continue to want to play that game. That is what I did and may have even bugged the developer but it was so worth. This game incorporates the Rts into simple elements that anyone can understand. The campaign works hard to teach you all the aspects so you do not just get stomped in multiplayer. If you ever played starcraft and loved it then this is the game for you.Do you love having fun?Do you enjoy local matches?Do you enjoy competition?THEN GET THIS GAME!!!You will not regret it if you do feel free to bug me.

The main one is for winning, but there's also awards for doing so many actions per minute, and of course the other one is trying to defeat the level in a set amount of time. Don't worry though, you can still progress through the game if you aren't able to complete the other two.Now of course you have to be wondering, well how hard can it be to just throw a bunch of weapons down and just let them go to town on the enemy. Well here's the deal, you are going to have to mine gold or crystals to get the money that is needed to build the weapons, you are also going to need the space to place the weapon, oh and it will have to be within your influence area. You see you can't just throw a bunch of stuff right next to your enemy, you will have to fortify what you have, or try take over what is not your's that will in turn help you take down the enemy all that much faster.You will also have the chance to unlock new pilots as you are going through the game. They all have different abilities that can help you win battles. My personal favorite is the driller, there's nothing quite like seeing your enemy setup all nice and cozy on a rise, and then using the driller's special ability to dig the ground from under the building. Then of course there's the magnificent falling of said building, and then the triumphant crash. Speaking of unlocking characters and weapons, there's also quest or goals that you want to strive for, if you get those you get extra points that can be used to unlock new characters and weapons in the armory section of the game.Now of course there is more to the game than just the campaign, but if you want to survive the battles against AI opponents, or live opponents, you might want to play through the campaign just so you have choices when it comes to what you will be using against your opponent. I will fully admit, I'm pretty sure a live opponent would wipe the floor with me, my downfall is focusing on upgrading a couple buildings and then the next thing I know my opponent has down the arsenal, and its all coming at me at the same time.Now I think it is clear what I think of this game, and that of course is that it is crazy, fast, fun, and sometimes frustrating, but I want to keep coming back to it. Once you've played around a little, and you are ok with having the game speed set to a brisk running pace, you will find that one level or two just isn't going to satisfy you, you are going to want to destroy your enemy and take on all that you can. So with that I give this game a 9.3 out of 10.			"

								Looking at the big picture, Cannon Brawl is a fast-paced and compelling adventure that turns the average real-time artillery genre on its head. It’s a tower defense game on acid whose goofy, loving best friend is permanently stuck to its hip. It’s elegantly unique, and opens up an entirely new door for indie games.With your war machine and defenses in tow, your job is to start claiming land. By using your war machine to drop buildings and weapons, you’ll slowly start taking over different parts of the island — claiming your stake not with a flag, but dastardly war devices. Of course, these buildings don’t come cheap! You’ll have to set up mines to claim gold or destroy land to mine for diamonds. This takes some time, and you can bet your nerdy butt that your enemy is scheming up their very own plan of attack.The real magic of Cannon Brawl rests in its non-stop action. It’s taken all the best things about real-time battle strategy, and thrown away all the boring bits. It’s a constant game of critical thinking, and you’ll need to keep your eyes on the prize every second, lest your enemy float through your mass of defenses. And trust me, that battlefield can easily become an awesome cluster of madness.This is definitely a game destined for all collections. With a nominal $14.99 fee, it's worth every single penny. It's easily one of the most enjoyable indies I've played in the last few years. The team at Turtle Sandbox is so incredibly passionate about this game, and it's no secret why. TL;DR: buy this game.

To get started the adventure(story) is decent(I'm halfway through played that about 20 minutes), but continuing on the only way you will be able to play multiplayer is if any of your friends have the game, or you are sitting directly next to them playing local multiplayer.  most of my time spent on this game was battle vs. AI which is fun but not as fun as when you are competing for a trophy with your friends.adventure(story): 7/10battle VS.AI: 8.5/10multiplayer: 4.5local multiplayer: 10/10With all this said I give Cannon Brawl a 7.5/10			"

												There are more 2D RTS and ""Artillery"" games every year, but I generally don't see one that has brought anything new to either genre. Cannon Brawl has improved upon both. I haven't played much more than an hour but its experience has immediately brought to mind Swords & Soliders, Worms.... while already securing a place for itself in my memory.The game is quick but that is part of the charm for anyone who doesn't have time for lengthier or more competitive RTS games; the actions-per-minute goals (APM) attached to the early levels are easily attainable and pragmatic. That is, when the game says it expects at least 13 APM, you find yourself nodding in agreement instead of shaking your head in exasperation that anyone could play that fast and not be a professional gamer. There are smart details in user interface as well, with cooldowns being explicitly shown, and previous flight paths of your artillery being logged each time you come back.$14.99 might be a bit much for some people for the length of game you get - on sale it is an immediate must buy. Regardless, I recommend it in either case.			"

												Cannon Brawl is a lot of fun, but I can't recommend buying it.  The multiplayer is dead, and you'll only get 3 to 5 hours out of single player unless you want to play the levels over again.  It is one of the best tower defense games I've played.  There is an economy to manage and a fairly large variety of towers.  The game throws new towers at you constantly, and I'm not sure I would call that a positive.  Many of the later towers seem completely useless.  The frustration factor for some of the stages can be high, although all the levels are easy enough to beat if you keep your wits about you.  It is fun, but pass unless you can get it for an amazing price.			"

												I got this game for me and a friend while it was on sale and for the price i must honestly say it's worth it a lot.This is sort of like a platformer starcraft that doesnt require you to be korean.Playing this with my friend we always have new strategys and respective couner strategys coming up along with a lot of funny moments. The thing is that you don't have to put hours of practice into this (like one might have to do with starcraft which is the reason i don't play it anymore) as long as you have a good understanding of how RTS' work you're basically settled. I have yet not played vs random opponents in the multiplayer. The campaign is fine although not very challenging most of the time.My only complaint is that the menu is slightly clumsy at times and you can't use the mouse. Also some of the pilot artwork is really weird (especially the driller she looks like she has ♥♥♥♥ing down syndrome). The story of the campaign is really plain but it works to give it purpose and a rich lore is not what you're playing this for.Solid 9/10 if it's your kind of game. Lovely Graphics.			"

												Great Game! I'm really just a casual gamer that likes to hop online with my friends and play some genuinely good games, and this is one of the games we can't put down. I'm not getting into the grits of it but the game has room for improvement. But overall, its a really good game to play!			"

												I really recomend this game to battle your friends in a face-paced arena RTS. It runs great on my not-so-great computer. There are plenty of weapons and strategies to choose from to keep gameplay fresh. So far the features I'd like to see added is more maps/mapmaker and more than 2 player games.			"

												I stopped playing this game but it was awesome! The towers are so cool the characters and I can imagine that battling with your dad or someone would be cool I only played with one of my friends but he gets in your head. The game requires quick thinking and movement of your floating vessel to place down gold/diamond mines and shields or offensive towers.The terrain is 2-D but it's awesome your towers are able to destroy the land giving you advantages for placing towers and just more space. Have fun blowing up the enemy's castle!			"

												Cannon Brawl really just has the perfect combination of old-school simplicity and charm and enough mechanical depth to keep you interested.  The simple pieces fit together in a way that gets you imagining different strategies and how you might couple together different pilots and loadouts.Having to configure what buildings will be available to you provides a really satisfying set of constraints.  And even when the whole plan doesn't work, like only healing, cooldown reduction, and lasers, it's still super satisfying.I suppose this is what it feels like to allow yourself to love again.			"

												Great game.In most strategy games you never get to that later tier stuff in a real game. But in this game you need that max upgrade to even reach the enemy castle.highly recommend. P.S. Controller needed!			"

												This is a good, fun gamemode. Definitly not like anything I've seen before. Even when you lose or are losing, you're having a great time. There's a lot of different ways to play the game, with multiple pilots, towers, and strategies, allowing you to play your way. Truly an amazing game.			"

												It's a nice game for everyone. It doesn't matter if you have bad reflexes, you'll eventually end up winning. I like the game since it's a nice mix of puzzles, leveling up, combat. Someone I know might even like it since it isn't turn based. 9/10			"

												I like the game, I think it is alot of fun.  However it needs a bigger player base.  Keep in mind that is not the developers's fault.  Another thing that could do with some tweaking is the pc controls; space is to place and use buildings shift is to upgrade and x is to cancel which puts you hand in a wierd cramped position.  Despite this I like the game alot.			"

												Cannon Brawl is suprisingly fun, with a unique art style and intersting mechanics. Cannon Brawl is loads of fun for dualing your friends and just playing through the entertaining campaign. I feel that there should be an optional mouse feature though, and Cannon Brawl feels like it was designed for consoles. 15$ is also a little bit of a steep price, but if you can get this on sale I would recommend. I think this would be a great mobile game.			"

												I can only strongly recommend this game. It had a quick and fun campaign with an extra challenge mode, local multiplayer, online multiplayer, ranked matches and so on. The game itself is fast paced and has an intuitive and easy learning curve to it. There are multiple viable strategies, however, they are mostly based around the terrain of the map and every strategy has unequal chances different counter strategies. Overall, it is pretty balanced though. The only critique point I have is, that it takes way longer to unlock all towers and characters than it really should.!Important: If you want to enjoy the full game experience, make sure you have at least one friend who has a competetive mind set and is willing to play the game with you. The game is only fun if your opponent tries equally as hard as you and doesn't give up after the first loss.			"
