												Easily my #1 game of 2014. Everything is superb: * The story stands head and shoulders above what gaming usually offers us these days. Whereas I wasn't going out of my way advertising Dead Man's Switch with all its pitfalls to my friends, in Dragonfall's case the story was my main selling point in word of mouth propaganda campaign I unleashed on acquaintances. The case where main plot is an awesome gripping action thriller that doesn't involve saving the world. Lord knows I'm tired of messianic melodramas.* Solid RPG experience with alternate ways to complete runs and extensive use of skill checks.* Gorgeous art by Unity engine's standards, cyberpunk eye-candy. The environments are crafted with care and  meticulous attention to details.* Top-notch diverse music, fitting the setting perfectly.* And now with Director's Cut - finally crisp and utterly enjoyable combat.One major caveat is the delivery. The game has no voice-over or cutscenes. It uses text to a great effect. But it uses A LOT of text, so much so sometimes it almost feels like reading a novel. If that is not your thing... you're missing out. :)10/10			"

												Just buy it.Shadowrun: Dragonfall was probably the best expansion campaign I've seen in years - it took about everything which was wrong with the original Shadowrun Returns campaign and improved it; Director's Cut takes an already good product and pushes it even further into excellent territory. It's improved on every level from UI and mechanics to character development, soundtrack, plot, and mission design, plus a whole horde of improvements in between.I said Dragonfall was worth it at full price, and it is. Director's Cut would be worth it at full price again, but it's free to all owners of Dragonfall; a classy move from HBS. There are a couple scripting bugs which need to get ironed out but I wouldn't let that stop you. Almost all the new content is excellent stacked on top of a full campaign's worth of excellent content. I can't think of a single part of Director's Cut which is a step backwards; HBS did an excellent job identifying ""where can we make this even stronger?"" and then doing it.There's just one flaw: Still can't steal that vase. >:[			"

												Disclaimer: This review was written when Dragonfall was a DLC and will be updated to better reflect Director's Cut in the future. If you are already familiar with the DLC version, skip to the end for my initial thoughts on the new features.When Shadowrun Returns came out there were numerous complaints. Rather than ignore them, HBS listened to the fans and fixed many of them when they released Dragonfall. That wasn't enough for them, wanting to better address the players suggestions they re-released it as a stand alone game and freely upgraded everyone's existing copy.In Dragonfall you are the newest member of an established runner team in Berlin. Through the course of events you end up leading the team and hunting a dragon. I could go into more detail, but the story is so well presented you are better off experiencing it for yourself.Rather than repeat the linearity of the Dead Man’s Switch campaign, Dragonfall uses a hub approach. There are a series of missions which advance the plot, but in order to unlock them you need to earn nuyen from other sources. You have a computer which lists all available jobs and its up to you if you accept them or not. Do you do every mission possible and postpone the final battle? Or do you rush through to complete it as quickly as possible?I recommend taking your time since this is a campaign which focuses on setting. Each of your team members has a strong back story and distinct personality. I spent much of the campaign trying to learn what drove Glory to use such ancient cybertech and trying to get Eiger to stop questioning my leadership. I helped Blitz with his relationship problems and helped Dietrich find his path. You also get to know the community. The hub is not simply a collection of vendors and quest givers, each character has their own personality and needs. The depth of detail means you actually care what happens to the hub, its more than a means to an end (unless you want to role play a heartless mercenary).On top of the strong story, Dragonfall is currently the definitive source for official modding assets. It includes all the assets from Dead Man's Switch/Seattle, the Berlin DLC, and more newly added for the Director's Cut. All the props can be used together yet have a distinctly different flavor. The prop selection is strong enough that I can recommend Dragonfall over Dead Man's Switch on their merit alone. Enjoy working with exploding barrels, drakes, new portraits and much more. My only complaints are that the Dragon prop is limited in its re-usability and existing fan made content will need to be migrated to the new workshop. If you enjoyed Dead Man's Switch, you will be amazed by Dragonfall. If you were disappointed by DMS, Dragonfall fixes a lot of the common complaints people had. If you haven't played DMS, but like cyberpunk and turn based strategy, Dragonfall is an excellent place to start. I strongly suggest giving the game a try!Edit - 5 hours in - DLC vs Directors CutBased on my initial impression, I am pleased with the enhancements.The combat interface has noticeably changed, making combat much easier to understand. The weapon interface is much better than the up/down scroll list in SRR and you can easily see what each attack does. Items and 'ware are equally clear. As for the flow of combat, I now know exactly when I am in cover and when I have an exposed enemy. Each successful attack tells how much damage was dealt and why. We are told if we have flanking, if cover blocked an attack, and probably more information that I haven't realized yet. I am not yet sure how I feel about the new armor system though. The new content seems to be carefully worked in, I am not actually sure what is an addition and what I simply missed in my previous play-through (with the exception of the new face I've met). I look forward to seeing what else is there and will update this review when I have more to say!Lastly there is the new NPC advancement system. I'm very happy with this and hope it is easy to incorporate in my own mods! Yes, we only get two choices per level, but it is easy to understand and use, and seems to provide distinct tactics options. It also makes it clear exactly how they level up when previously it was a bit of a mystery.			"

Posted: January 3, 2015
												I greatly enjoy tactical RPGs when they're done right. I'm a big fan of the Tactics Ogre and Final Fantasy Tactics series, and that plus an affinity for cyberpunk novels are mainly what drew me to Shadowrun despite never playing the original SNES or the tabletop RPG.I played Shadowrun Returns and enjoyed my time with it save for a few key complaints, mostly around the pacing, shallow combat, and characterization. I'm pleased to say that all of those issues are cleared up with this game, and that it's an utterly fantastic title. I went so far as to recommend that people skip Returns completely in my review of that game and proceed onto this one instead. It's that much of an improvement.The pacing problems I had with Returns often caused me to lose interest in the game and stop playing it for weeks at a time. Those issues are completely alleviated here. The game seems to have taken some inspiration from the Mass Effect series, as missions are structured in a similar manner in Dragonfall. Something happens in the first mission of the game that creates an overarching plot, and you're gradually working towards the solution of that by taking odd jobs to build up your bankroll. You're also conversing with your regular allies--something else that Returns lacked that I disliked--and completing missions specifically regarding their background. It worked excellently in Mass Effect, and it really works well here.The combat has taken even more inspiration from XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and it now feels far more fleshed out than it did in Returns. Each class has far more depth than it did in Returns, and there are more opportunities to utilize the environment in interesting ways. Some of my favorite missions in the game involved the opportunity to have your computer hacker operate in the Matrix, simultaneously fighting a tactical battle in a cyber world with the aims of unlocking doors and disabling or even turning the security systems to your teams side while they proceed with a battle in the real world. There are some incredibly compelling race-against-time type missions in this game that require that sort of thing. It creates a ton of suspense and allows you to take combat in exponentially more directions than the first game did.The characters and the story in this game is the largest improvement over Returns, though. Your squadmates have obviously been crafted with a caring touch, and they feel like well-rounded human beings (or metahuman beings), which is a far departure from the hire-a-mannekin system that Returns did. They've got their own motivations and their own reasons for being there, and they're not always going to agree with the path you're taking. I even feel like I got a deeper roleplaying experience out of my player character than in Returns. I felt like I had more opportunity to inject my own desired personality into him, which I hadn't realized I was missing in Returns until playing this game. Even the minor characters are compelling, from the civilian engineer dwarf roped into a job she has no interest in doing to the loving Grandfather who works as an accountant but also moonlights as an assassin for a loanshark named Meat Grinder, who he hilariously refers to as ""Mr. Grinder"". Writing is the strength of this game, and it would have compelled me to continue onward and finish even if I didn't really like the combat.I should also mention the music, which was of quality in Returns but seems improved here. I read somewhere that the composer for the music in the original SNES game did this one as well, which was interesting to me. It's very good, and it properly encompasses the mood of a world that's caringly built as an homage to William Gibson's in the Sprawl Trilogy.Gibson, for those who have never heard of him, is to cyberpunk what Tolkien is to fantasy. His novel Neuromancer, released in 1981, inspired a great many of the ideas included in this game, particularly the Matrix, which is nearly unchanged from those novels. I'd highly recommend the fans of this game pick up a copy of Neuromancer and immerse themselves in the grassroots of the cyberpunk subgenre.The only real gripe I can think of is the way the game depicts corporations. It's utterly cliche, uninteresting, and tiresome. Look, I'm no fan of stodgy, bureaucratic, inhuman multinational corporations. But not every company is Comcast. Literally every corporation in this game is depicted as maliciously evil and self-serving to the point where the player is dealing with atrocity after atrocity. The one ""good"" CEO in the game is promptly fired for not putting the bottom line first. That's just boring storytelling. There's great value in turning the cliche on its head, and it would have been nice to see a depiction differing from norm since the writers did such a good job of that otherwise.In conclusion, this is an excellent tactical RPG set in a well-crafted world. It's beautifully presented, beautifully written, and just a hell of a lot of fun. Hairbrained Schemes has met all of the potential set forth by Shadowrun Returns, as this is probably the best RPG I played in all of 2014.			"

												I've played it just after finishing Shadowrun returns (http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/234650), and want to warn everyone: don't start from Dragonfall if you intend to play Dead Man's Switch as well!Dragonfall is such a major improvement to all the game aspects that basic game seems very bleak and rigid one. During very thorough game scenario they even improved the weakest segment of the whole reincarnated Shadowrun game base - a decking process. As I played Dead Man's Switch, I felt ripped 'cause of absolutely intolerable concoction of the decking (hacking) part, which was made as simple shootout almost on the same terms as other fights in the game.In Dragonfall, though, I felt much more decking stuff because of many themed situations, dialogs, skill checks and so on.Another ray of light shines above magic part of the setting, which was also improved, by good scenario and thorough paperwork.As of the combat part, surprise! - it improved as well! While I've made it through all the Dead Man's Switch on the very hard without even dying once, in the Dragonfall battles became more complicated, to the point when I needed a reload sometimes! Although in general game's still not able to rough you good, even in the way that modern XCom does.So! Let's summarise:Pros:- Decent cyberpunk story, fitted in the Shadowrun world as a sock fit to leg. Just as the Dead Man's Switch, Dragonfall is much like a good book you'll be enjoyed reading- More than just a story, this scenario based in the 2054 anarchic Berlin, with broth from politics, corporations, dragons, loosen AI, street gangs and syndicates... I can not vouch for the taste, but it will be hot!- Get me right: it is not an animated story, it's a solid party rpg, one to be memorized after finishing and catching all the way through-Team-based gameplay improved a lot after Dead Man's Switch, as you get your own crew of anarchists. Your decisions will be questioned every now and then, and the more trust you gain, the more powerful your team will be.- Comparing to the first game, all the game aspects were noticeably improved, that includes visuals, audio, game mechanics and general logic. No one can calculate fun-from-the-game, but my guess, they improved that too.Contras:- game become more unstable, it freezes sometimes, and more you play, more you facing an interference (I don't remember stability issues playing Shadowrun Returns)- even with all improvements, 1) shootouts still not too hard (I've played only on the hardest, and only two times was forced to reload). AI behavior not amazing, to say it politely. Good level design and scripts helping, but not completely fixing an issue. 2) elves is such an imbalanced gap, which obscures every other races! They got more dexterity (and the best way of fighting is still a bigger rifle). They got more charisma - and that means - more etiquette (more successful skill checks). To put it shortly - if you want the best shadowrunner - get an elf! I'd added more race-connected quests and perks next time, if you ask me.3) ""Matrix runs"" still not fitting such a great otherwise cyberpunk game one bit. Good decker should be flowing over the network unnoticed, and not shooting the ices and bringing buddies to cover flanks. That feels like a bull in a china shop every time I'm switching...Overall: it's the best Shadowrun game on the PC at moment. And one of the best cyberpunk games in existence. And pretty solid Party-RPG. My score 8.1/10			"

												So if you have already been fortunate enough to play Dragonfall, you may be wondering if this is worth playing again. I can quickly and confidently reply: YES, CHUMMER. I beat Dragonfall about a month and half before Director's Cut released. Other than Earthbound or some Elder Scrolls games, I have never replayed an RPG all the way through again. That won't be an issue here. The devs have added some pretty awesome new missions that serve to flesh out Berlin even more. New characters have been added and now you may learn more about your party members past. Speaking of your fellow Runners, they can now pick new abilities and level along with you. (choose between 2 advancements a level) This was something I found to be missing from the original.There is also the matter of the music. The new music is amazing. The achievements help add more goals to draw you into another play through, but that is just a bonus. There is enough here to bring any fan back. Rare thing for a dev to make a ""Director's Cut"" with so many improvements and features. Rarer still, one that doesn't charge for existing owners. New Players: If you are a CRPG fan or Shadowrun fan, please skip the original release until AFTER Dragonfall. Think of that as a treat or really good UGC. This really is one of the best games of the year and turn based rpg fans deserve a great game like this. Great characters, story, and fun.			"

												From cyberpunk lovers, for cyberpunk lovers.First of all, Shadowrun setting is not just an ordinary cyberpunk setting, and ""ordinary"" is a lightweight word when it comes to cyberpunk. Setting presents elves, orcs, trolls and even dragons among humans. But not consider this setting as a high fantasy. All these creatures live in our world and they adapted well to the cold, rigid future of this cyberpunk world.For those not played the Shadowrun Returns, Dragonfall is a old-school looking RPG and it presents a tactical turn based  battle system, similar to the X-COM, but less detailed. And for those who played the Returns, Dragonfall campaign is great way ahaed of Shadowrun Returns' campaing, Dead Man's Switch. Game is much longer, it took my 30+ hours in the hardest difficulty. Story is much more interesting and the free flux state of Berlin is surely a cool place to be in. Dialogs and the descriptions are fantastic once again, and it makes you feel like you are reading a well-written cyberpunk novel. When I played the DMS, I felt the short comings of a kickstarter game. Dragonfall is at it's best to make you feel that the game is developed by a more experienced team, and being a product of a hard and detailed work. So, I know the developers will go for a third game. They are much more experienced now. And from my  humble point of view, I would like to write the issues that should make the game better:- Soundeffects: Unfortunately, both DMS and Dragonfall have very weak soundeffects. The sound of guns are poorly. When it comes to RPGs, I think the environmental sound effects add a great deal of atmosphere to the game. Look at the old Bioware and Black Isle games. When it rains, put a proper raining sound effect. Also when it snows, when it is windy. Add many other exterior sound effects. The sirens of police or security cars outside the kiez, the flames of a barrel, gunshots of a distant gang war... These are minor and not expensive features, but they will greatly add to the game.- Battle System: For the third installment, I think a much more detailed battle system is requiered. Without any changes to the current system, game's success may be undermined.- Magic system: Somehow, magic system needs a lot more work.- Matrix system: Even in the Dragonfall, the matrix sequences were dull. This system clearly needs to be shined.So, this is my review about this wonderfull game. Dragonfall is a very good experience. Most of the game, I felt like a I was reading an interactive cyberpunk comic book, and that is wonderfull thing. "

												As much as I loved Shadowrun Returns, Dragonfall as a DLC was superior. Dragonfall as an enhanced standalone, with a much sexier interface? Shut up and take my mo--... Wait, I already own it. Hats off Harebrained Schemes. I've only just started playing, but the fact that you gave  copies of this to the folks who'd already bought this title potentially makes you the coolest company on the face of the planet. You already had a solid fan in me, but now it's cemented.Now that the licking is over, on to the game! I'll probably add more to this review when I actually finish it, but I played for a spell, and having already beaten DF as a DLC I can see it is a remake, but very well done. The UI is much less clunky and there's far less guess work involved. The combat flows a lot more smoothly and the status effects (Eg Bleed) are much more evident from the word go. They have done a graphical polish as well, and everything looks a lot more smooth. I'm also looking forward to seeing if they've fixed some of the minor graphical issues from SR:R, but assume that they have on the grounds of awesomeness. For those of you who've never played this title, it's a definite buy. When in DLC form it was already a much more comprehensive and enhanced game than the basic adventure (Which was still enjoyable) and has a lot more to offer in terms of plot, depth of characters and a general feel of the universe. After playing this title obsessively I was actually able to walk into Shadowrun, the RPG and actually know the world a lot better, making me seem like less of a N00b, so it is true to the IP.As a game? Tactical and awesome. Is it mutable? YES. You COULD hardcharge the door... But honestly my character is a high charisma hacker and I make out like a bandit. Does it actually have a story and character development? Yes, Yes, YES. And apparently even that had some additions in the stand alone. Totally worth it. Pick it up, settle into the gritty world of Shadowrun, and remember this; There's no such thing as a milk run.See you, chummer.			"

												Great game all around. Would definitely reccomend.Did you like XCOM? Buy this game.Did you like Wasteland or Wasteland 2? Buy this game.Did you like Fallout 2? buy this game.Pros:-Deep story. Lots of twists, sidequests, and alternative emdings. Make sure to talk to your companions! (for instance, Gloria has an awesome sidequest.) At one point I rescued an enslaved cyborg troll who had an ax and a chain gun for hands.-The combat is very well done turn-based style. The diversity of spells, guns, body modifications, classes, and companions allows for many styles of gameplay. Also, the inclusion of spirits makes for really fun battles when the enemy is deeply entrenched.-Runs fast, even on bad computers. On my 2010 macbook I managed to pull 55-60 fps consistently without overheating.-Good graphics. Definitely not top of the line, but it works well for the cyberpunk atmosphere and isometric view.-Doesn't hold your hand very much. You have to figure out the puzzles and where to go. But not as open world as Wasteland 2 or Divinity Original Sin.-Steam Workshop has amazing alternate campaigns and add-ons. Seriously, a few of them are better than DMS which was the original campaign for Shadowrun Returns.-Console is easy to use and gives opportunities to play with the game to your liking. Big Heads, movespeed, changing sprites, free money, etc. -World editor is very intuitive. If you want to mess around with making new content, it is pretty simple to understand and grants a lot of depth and freedom.Cons:-Map for Kruezbar is annoying. Trying to find all the available merchants and running around took me a few hours to get used to and I still can't find the damn cybernetic place sometimes.-A few freezing bugs. At one point I had to restart a level because the combat system got stuck on an enemy turn. Not a common occurence but definitely frustrating when it does happen.-Fighting in The Matrix isn't nearly as cool as I was hoping for. A bit repetitive and sometimes overwhelmingly difficult.			"

												Okay, so I've never played Shadowrun Returns (although I may because of this game), the reason I got this one was because of Rock Paper Shotgun's review of this game, which said this is a strong game and worth being standalone. I wholly concur. This is an incredible game with a great story, wonderful attention to detail, and meaningful choices. There are very few other games that offer such an excellent experience, and at 15 dollars for my approximately 30 hours of gameplay, it is quite cheap.Gameplay simply works. Think XCOM: Enemy Unknown and you've essentially got everything you need to know. It's a small squad strategy game with quite a bit of RPG elements. I would have preferred a first person shooter with tactical elements, but I would also have preferred that the developers had a billion dollar budget and a 300 man team, as they would have made it damn near perfect. What we got, though, is a mean and lean game that runs on an engine which allows the developers to create assets and missions efficiently on a tight budget.I loved the aesthetics and even enjoyed the techno-magic setting, which I thought would be somewhat silly, it is pulled off quite well here. Much of the setting seems to be taken from the novel Neuromancer, although this could be partly because I focused so much on being a decker (hacker) and dealt quite a bit with a certain artificial intelligence.All in all I really do love this game, and I recommend to anyone intrigued by this review as well as to the people who like a good story in their games. Seriously, get it; this is a great game.			"

												Easily one of the best CRPGs that I have ever played and critically acclaimed to be the best cyberpunk turn-based game thus far, Shadowrun: Dragonfall surprises me at how good it allows you to weave your story.Dragonfall has a simple premise and a generic story. HBS masterfully provide a myriad of ways to complete each quests, connecting each story and welcoming you to its lore, embracing you with its universe, slowly and without force. It makes you care about it and you will not realize it until its too late.This is a prime example of a simple story done right. Instead of giving you explosions, supernatural powers or meteor showers, Dragonfall gives you emotions, it gives you a sense of ownership, a sense of belonging, a sense of dread, a sense of anger and a sense of exhilaration. Now if you read this and think that this is not for you, then this game is simply not for you. As for me, a true RPG comes from the heart, where your emotions are subtly affected each moment you progress and are deeply affected by it so much so that it makes you think beyond and perhaps your own life. I have never played a game where the companions are so extraordinarily done - these are characters with flaws and grey morality, these are people, these are your friends, this is your team.No I did not feel this 5 minutes after I started the game, in fact, I have no recollection of when I start caring, sometimes, having played numerous games, I treat games as it is, just. Games. I played and I played and I care and this game succeeded and that's what matters.At the end of the game, I chatted with my friends and we have a good discussion towards the game. We were all surprised that despite the similar journey that we tread, all of us do it for very different purposes. Though we have our differences, each one of us agreed that this is one hell of a game.Despite its brilliance, no game is perfect, and so I am obliged to tell you the negative points in the game:- Camera Options: There is simply no way to rotate the camera in any shape of form, this can sometimes be very frustrating: from not knowing where to go and the miss clicks which do happen more often that you thought.- Weak Enemy AI: The AI does not make the best move possible, in fact, it usually does the worst move ever with the exception of the occasional throw of a grenade when your team is too bunched up together. It is a blasphemy that some RPG players do not own such a high quality game with very minor flaws and a small price tag. If you consider yourself one, please get a copy immediately.TLDR: A must-have for any mature RPG players who wants the real deal.			"

												Shadowrun: DragonFall is a cyberpunk themed turn based strategy game/R.P.G. developed by Harebrained Schemes and published by Harebrained Holdings. In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. 42 years later in 2054 a new threat is rising, one that soon has you and your team on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy just as whispers of the Dragonfall hint that the great dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive and waiting for the right moment to return. Dragonfall is the next chapter in the Shadowrun series featuring a new story, a new location and a revamped combat system as well as a host of other significant changes. Harebrained Schemes has taken everything that made the first game, Shadowrun Returns, so great and improved on it in every way which should be the goal of a worthwhile sequel. Featuring a unique cast of playable characters and highly memorable NPC's, I really enjoyed Dragonfall's intriguing storyline even more so than Shadowrun Returns.Like any terrific R.P.G., there are a number of available classes, attributes and skill sets to choose from which allow you to build the type of character that you want to have. For example, the Street Samurai uses combat skills to dominate the battlefield while Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells. If hacking is your bailiwick then a Rigger or Decker would be your character of choice. As your player levels up, you earn experience points that you can then use to upgrade a number of abilities for not only you but your team as well. When it comes to the customization of your character Shadowrun: Dragonfall does not dissapoint and this deep level of customization also immensely adds to the replayability of the game.Graphically, this title is very pleasing to the eye as it's filled with beautiful colors and smooth animation. I've always been a big fan of the isometric turn based role playing games. I like to pick apart the backgrounds and see how many details the developers can squeeze into them and this game has some superb environments and set pieces. For example, with this being a cyberpunk themed game, I can almost guarantee that I spotted an homage to Kaneda's bike from ""Akira"" and that's just one of the many awesome items to keep an eye out for.My favorite thing about Shadowrun has always been the strategic turn based combat and Dragonfall definitely takes what made the previous title Shadowrun Returns combat so great and polishes it to a beautiful shine. The battles are just as fun and even more challenging while the user interface is now much more refined and easier to use.While not quite as cinematic as XCOM: Enemy Unknown, another fantastic title in this same genre, Shadowrun: Dragonfall does rank among the top tier of turn based strategy games in my opinion. If you're looking for a title with a compelling story, thrilling combat, high replayability and who doesn't love cyberpunk then you can't miss with this game...highly recommended!			"

												2054.  Berlin.  The Flux State.  It's a world of magic, technology, metahumans, megacorporations, and dragons.  You are a Shadowrunner, a criminal who does the dirty work for clients who can pay for your skills.  But things aren't always as they seem, as you'll soon find out.As the story unfolds, you'll find yourself faced with some hard choices.  Your clients can't or won't give you the whole story, and moral ambiguity will cloud the decisions you make.  Not only that, the way you lead your team can have repercussions on how they view you.  As you progress through the story, they may open up to you, giving you information about their lives.  I felt like this was really well done.  Your teammates have back stories, character flaws, and even side quests.  It's up to you to say and do the right things to gain their trust.Since this game is very much story driven, be prepared to do a lot of reading.  It's not voice acted at all.  You are given dialog choices in response to things that characters say, and sometimes it's not possible to know where the conversation may be heading.  Sometimes you have choices based on your character's skill stats and ""etiquettes.""  Unless you use a guide, you won't know ahead of time whether you'll gain an edge in the conversation or not.  Not to worry, though, since the stat based choices generally are there to make the game easier.  You may gain ""karma,"" which is used to level your abilities, or you might find a way to avoid a fight by finding an alternative solution to the problem at hand.Nevertheless, sometimes you'll have to fight.  The combat system is pretty straightforward.  With a mix of magic, technology, and various kinds of weapon-based & unarmed combat skills, you direct your team to act through careful positioning, defense, and attacks.  How much you can do in your turn depends on your action points (AP).  You can use any character in any order during your turn to fight until all of them have used up their available AP.  Then the enemy AI will have a turn.  Outcomes are determined by your character stats and a ""role of the dice,"" so to speak.  That RNG factor adds a bit of uncertainty, but I never found it to be unfair.  It affects the enemies as well.In a late game mission, I was having a blast letting some of the enemies fight each other.  It got a bit hectic, since my team got spread out.  Sometimes I moved a team member around a corner and straight into enemies I couldn't see before.  Depending on how you handle it, some fights can become rather drawn out affairs.  If things don't go as planned, you may have to repeat the fight from the last save point.  The game does have an autosave feature that puts you back at the last point before most battles.  Of course, it never hurts to manually save after a battle either.Sometimes the fights happen in cyberspace.  If one of your team members has the Decking skill, you can explore and fight in the matrix by ""jacking in,"" as the game puts it, at specially marked terminals.  By hacking nodes in cyberspace, you can find information to earn money, unlock doors to find loot, and gain control of security cameras in order to possibly avoid fights. Fighting is a fun challenge, often necessary, but not a requirement for leveling your character.  I recall one mission where my character, a Decker, entered the place, did the job alone, and exited without killing anyone in ""meat space.""As I said before, there is no voice acting.  However, I thought that the musical tracks set the tone for the different areas rather well.  Likewise, the top down graphics are simple, yet effective.  No complaints from me there.  Occasionally, though, the game engine has issues.  While it's possible for your team to escape from a fight if the exit is nearby, I experienced a bug in one of the early missions where all of my team had left, yet the enemy turn went into an infinite loop.  I wound up repeating part of that mission from the last save point.  Another issue I experienced from time to time was a temporary inability to control my character in cyberspace.  I could pan around the scene, but I wasn't able to do anything with my character during my turn.  After a short time, though, it would become responsive once again.  I didn't experience it myself, but many have reported a serious bug that prevents progression in the ""APEX Rising"" mission.Bugs aside, there are some things that I wish the game had.  Many cRPGs have text logs of all the conversations that you've had in the game, including the dialog choices that you've made.  This feature is sorely lacking in Shadowrun:  Dragonfall.  There were times when I wanted to review the conversation I just had for clues that I might have missed on the first go.  Or I might have accidentally clicked too fast and missed something that was said in part of the dialog.  Another thing I noticed is that equipping an extra weapon to my player character wasn't very user friendly.  For example, my Decker had three slots.  I equipped an SMG, a cyberdeck, and a drone.  During a mission, if I picked up another gun as loot, it was available for me to use during fights and later sell for profit.  However, if I sold that weapon, I wasn't able to equip another weapon that I purchased in its place.  The purchased weapon would be in my stash, but I couldn't equip it without swapping out my SMG, cyberdeck, or drone.I should also mention that it's possible to customize the equipment for your team to some extent, but only your main character is fully under your control when it comes to equipment and upgrades.  After certain missions, you are also given a choice for each team member as far as upgraded skills or items are concerned.  If, for some reason, you're not happy with the skills available from your base team members, you are also given the option of hiring people at the start of the main missions.  You still get the skill upgrades for the base team members even if you don't use them in missions, though.I recommend Shadowrun:  Dragonfall.  Minor issues aside, it features a great story and fun gameplay.			"

												Bit of a cautious review, this one. I'm only ten hours deep into a game that I've heard can take upwards of thirty hours to beat, and my appreciation of it hinges heavily on how the story plays out.So far, though, I'm very optimistic. Basic info first. Dragonfall is the expansion for Shadowrun Returns, and this Director's Cut is completely standalone. The game takes place in Berlin, in a cyberpunk future where humans, elves, trolls, and some other races, share roughly equivalent status and co-exist peacefully, at least notionally. Naturally, there are factors - indeed, there are factions - which threaten to destabilise what could potentially grow into a decent world for all, and your merry band of shadowrunners will be at the centre of it all.Combat is turn based, and during normal play you can only control ""your"" character, with the other party members following along behind you. It would have been nice to be able to direct them independently, to get a tactical advantage when you know a fight is brewing, but c'est la vie, one can't have it all. You'll use guns, wield knives and swords, cast spells and summon spirits in order to defeat your many and varied foes. To level up you use Karma points, which are earned as they are in every RPG ever: by completing quests. There aren't enough that you can be a jack-of-all-trades, so try to pick a class you enjoy and go with it.The combat system is robust, with actions playing out on a tile (or hex) based grid, and plenty of cover to make use of, simply by moving next to it. Flanking bonuses are available, and critical hits are possible on exposed enemies (or on your own team, if you fail to take cover), so it's important to find a decent place and use your action points, or AP, judiciously. You don't want to run out of them and end up stranded in the middle of the room, where everyone can take pot-shots at you. Your team can be equipped with items, such as grenades or medpacks, which can be used at an AP cost and could tilt a fight in your favour. Don't think you can just hoard loads of grenades, though, as inventory space is quite limited. Certain characters will also be able to ""jack into"" computers and fight in virtual reality, which comes with its own set of abilites, but I've not done much of that yet. It's all turn based and on a grid, though, so probably not that different.One issue I've had with the combat is that it isn't always possible to tell whether moving to a particular space will let you flank an enemy. I've had to chance a move on a couple of occasions, and I wasn't always able to flank even though the situation seemed very similar. I think a visual indicator before you make your move would have been a great help - perhaps as a toggle so more experience players could disable it?The real meat of this game, though, is the story. Now, as I say, I'm just dipping my toes in really, but so far it has been very impressive. Shortly after the start, there are some jaw-dropping twists which I didn't see coming, and there haven't been any missions so far which felt like filler, or which took place in boring locations or with boring NPCs. The writing is strong, and the beautiful portrait artwork for different characters does a lot more to inspire my imagination that some plastic-faced polygonal goon ever would. There have been quite a few spelling and grammar errors in the script, though. Not enough to ruin the experience, certainly, but enough to stand out and jolt me out of the experience.With an interesting world, lovely art, very strong writing and some decent, if not particulaly inventive, combat, Shadowrun: Dragonfall is well worth your time. Jack me off I mean IN, jack me in.			"

												I honestly can not find the right words to express my feelings towards this game. I currently have a tear rolling down my cheek from the sheer excellence bestowed upon me. If it was possible to swim in a sea of nostalgia, then this game would push me below the waves and send me to my doom.I absolutely love it. It has heart, it has soul, it has me actually reading all the text. The story is engrossing, the characters are lovable. I have a really bad fear that after I finish this game,  I won't be able to continue living my boring life.I applaud the creators of this game for the masterpiece put in front of me. Thank you for this gem.			"

												Dragonfall is one of the best RPGs I've played in the last five years. Why, you may ask? Well, let me ask YOU a question, what do you want out of an RPG?Let's say you want plot. A setting. Dragonfall has you covered. This takes place in the world of Shadowrun BEFORE the tabletop. You're about forty years past the 'Awakening', an event that rocked our modern world and brought forces and creatures of magic back into it. Chief among those were the great dragons,  whom loom over both the setting and this campaign from on high. Along with magic, technology has surged forward, resulting in a cyberpunk fantasy mish-mash where your shamanistic mage can have an artificial eye, your hackers summon digital minions within the virtual world, and your drone-controlling medics can choose to fight with sword rather than gun. This strange mash of the cynical and fantastic makes a setting that is neither too grimdark nor too silly. A proper Shadowrun setting sets a perfect balance of moods and themes, and Dragonfall, fortunately, is no exception. I won't spoil the actual plot proper past what I've already said, but just know that it's full of twists and turns and has a wonderful depth.Let's say you want party members. A good party can make or break an RPG, and Dragonfall's definitely 'makes' it. You have the dark, distant Glory, wielder of two terrifying cybernetic arms and skilled field medic. There's the aging Dietrich, a middle-aged punk-rocker shaman slightly past his prime, driven by his idol to keep seeking 'the good fight' until death. You have the professional, rigid troll marks-woman Eiger, with whom you will butt heads until you can win her respect. Aside from them, you also have Monika, team leader, local hero, and skilled decker, and Blitz, a former gang member decker/rigger who may or may not be more trouble than he's worth. Oh, yeah, and you also have a dog. No team is complete without a dog.Each party member comes with their own backstory to explore, along with personal quests. The only thing missing is a love interest, but that's refreshing, in a way. You come to care about these characters because they're members of your team, not just because you want to get into their digital knickers. Finally, let's say that you're willing to play literally any RPG as long as it actually plays well. Well, then I've got good news for you. Dragonfall's engine has been tooled up to be better than the one that was used with Shadowrun Returns, and there's a deep selection of character skillsets to invest in. Combat is fair and, for the most part, only punishing when you make a mistake. There was only one mission in this game that I felt was unfair, and it was mercifully brief. Levels are well designed and hold a plethora of options that are available to you if you invest in certain skills. The only real complain I have on this end is that you're rewarded experience not for combat, but for resolving quests/dialogue paths. However, this also adds a refreshing twist; this is finally an RPG where you don't have to murder everything to get ahead. At the same time, if you choose to pursue optional combat encounters, there's often a little bit of loot hidden in the area to reward you.So, in the end, we have a game that's balanced on plot, characters, and gameplay. Not only do you have those three pillars of quality, but they're complimented by fantastic art and an atmospheric soundtrack. Dragonfall is the RPG of the year for me, and it left me feeling inspired to write and create worlds that are as deep and complex as this. If I had to recommend only one RPG on Steam, it'd be this one. That's how good it is.... Oh, and that's only the core campaign. Took me thirty-five hours. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll be heading back to try out some of the community-made fare...			"

Short version: 87%Despite being confined to a video game, Dragonfall is almost the quintessential Shadowrun experience. While it still has an unhealthy emphasis on combat, the story finally lets the players loose in this wonderful fantasy/cyberpunk world to let them do what they want.Long version:Shadowrun Returns was an enjoyable tactical game, but in the end, it wasn’t much more than that. It lacked the role-playing, the vast freedom this strange fantasy/cyberpunk setting has to offer. And this is where Dragonfall comes in to not only remedy most of the mistakes but to become something larger.For starters, Dragonfall can finally be called a real cRPG. We have freedom to choose missions, to make choices with actual consequences, and an entire team of individual characters with their own (somewhat clichéd) backstories. Even the main plot lets us experience most of the things Shadowrun quests can offer, from clean-up jobs to corporate espionage or assassination; and a huge campaign against a clandestine organisation and their sinister plans (which is quite cleverly written, even by cRPG standards). Game mechanics feel more polished. Almost all skills can be useful now, including previously underutilised ones (like throwing weapons). There are no mandatory items to use, so all builds can be as viable as any other, from sword-wielding street samurais to summoners constantly hiding in a corner.If there is still a weak spot, it is probably the decking (hacking). Most NPC deckers have pretty mediocre builds, but many missions offer nice additional rewards in cyberspace. It forces the player either to run a decker, sacrifice a spot on the team, or skip rewards; certainly great for role-playing, but feels restrictive.Still, in the end, Dragonfall is clearly a better game than Returns was. Better enough to advice newcomers to start with it? Frankly… I am almost inclined to say yes.			"

												First off, this is my first review on Steam and I am really disappointed that it is a negative one.I would truly love to recommend this game but I cannot.  The story is engaging, the characters are done well, and the gamplay excellent.  I liked the variety of ways you could play through the game as the main character and there is a ton of different weapons, items, spells, etc to keep yourself occupied with.  In fact, I have three new games that are in various stages just so I could play around with things.  Then I hit the brick wall.I was having a blast with the game on my most advanced playthrough until I came across the ""infamous"" (news to me) Apex Rising bug.  It happened just as I wrapped up the purge cycle and was hitting the final button.  OK, whatever, I'll just restart.  Five minutes in on the restart and bam, bug time.  I then hit the net to figure things out and find that this bug is famous.  Now comes the five more tries using suggestions from various forums and such.  Still bugged.  I then take one of my less advanced playthroughs to the Apex Rising mission.  Again, the game glitches.  Every time it glitched I was in a different spot and doing different things.What frustrates me the most though, is the copy-paste response from the developers themselves on the Steam forums with still no fix.  All it leaves me with a game that I enjoyed but can't finish.  Hopefully if you buy this game it works for you, but I can't recommend it.			"

												Dragonfall's Director Cut makes a real good game even better. The game just has a lot of quality all around, writing, atmosphere, roleplaying, you name it; and its real fun, even the combat, which I'm not usually a fan of in WRPGs. People who already played Vanilla Dragonfall should definitely give it another playthrough for stuff like the party member missions and anyone else just needs to get this. (Though I suggest getting Shadowrun Returns first, its good, but Dragonfall is such a huge improvement that it would be hard to play them in reverse order. Also Returns introduces you more to the world if you're unfamiliar with Shadowrun.) Dragonfall Director's Cut is overall a must play game for any RPG fan.			"

												The game is far from great in many ways - the lack of interaction with the game world otherwise present in many RPGs, the small amount of quests, the lack of freedom and exploration which would've been great in this setting if present.However what makes up for that is a Shadowrun setting itself (Neuromancer meets fantasy basically), well thoughtout RPG system with no junk spells and skills - having few but straight to the point, good writing avoiding many cliches with many skill checks in dialogues, quests with alternative ways to deal with issues for various character builds, lack of trash combat encounters designed to artificially extend the game time in many other RPGs - which helps since the game does not award XP for kills, only for quests. Your actions also have consequences that are far more than getting different dialogue lines later in the game and almost all quests present you with choices to affect the game. The downside however is that none of that is big enough to warrant a replay.Compared to Shadowrun Returns' railroaded progression the game also sees improvement in a form of hub from which you embark on quests, which itself has quite a few interactions with the local populace.Overall it's almost a proper fantasy-cyberpunk RPG and I've enjoyed it a lot more than its RPG ""competition"" - Wasteland 2 and Pillars of Eternity.

												Best RPG of 2014, hands down.Yes, i have played Divinity Original sin, no, i don't particularily care for Dragon age.Cyberpunk setting is refreshing, story actually does something for me, a lot of small, but really heartwarming things for an RPG fan. For example, a minor detail - companions don't give you control over their loadout and to some degree even leveling progression - is genius, minmaxing trinkets on silent slaves, as it usually is, doesn't come close. No stupid ""balance"", where there is a specific carefully laid out way for every archetype and build, so everybody feels like a winner. Lack of said way for some skills only contributes to overall role-playing experience: for instance i took ""etiquette: socialite"" and used it exactly once, because i mostly dealt with gangs and security (seriously, what did i expect?). And i loved being punished for that choice, or, should i say, not being pandered to.Interface could be better, and graphics aren't really 2014-like, but the game is good enough not not care about it.

												Note: I did not play the original version of Dragonfall so I cannot provide comparisons between it and the Director's Cut.The original Shadowrun Returns campaign ""Dead Man's Switch"" was certainly not bad: underwhelming perhaps, but personally I enjoyed the very simple style and story. It was a nice introduction to the Shadowrun world and gave me a positive impression, as well as instilling the hope for future campaigns that could expand on the fascinating material(official or otherwise).Dragonfall is amazing. The writing is absolutely top notch, from the characters, to the main story and even the side-quests. The personal character arcs in particular are solid; it did feel a touch predictable that they would all have a kind of tragic backstory to explain why they became shadowrunners but a couple were really well written, and despite all that you're still given the potential to engage in intriguing side-missions.The biggest improvement between the two campaigns are the significant amount of options that are available to the player in completing missions. Everything from your stats, skills, race and even class can open up a plethora of special dialogue or interaction options which can not only influence how you get to mission objectives but even the outcomes! It's implemented incredibly well and I had an absolute blast exploring the options at my disposal.My only gripe with Dragonfall would have to be the combat. It's well designed, very slick and easy to control with some light tactical touches that give it enough depth and challenge without being over-bearing. However I found myself getting very tired of it about half way through the game: I fell into a particular strategy that was obscenely good and thus combat played out the same way everytime. I often tried to incorporate different characters or explore other spells and combinations but there's just not enough to work with. Again the combat is very well designed, but there's just so little to work with in terms of unique spells or special abilities.Otherwise this is a great campaign and worth every cent.			"

												The best game I played in 2014, and I got it for six bux.Sure it may not have the sweet grafix or 100 hours of gameplay Dragon Age: Inquisition has, but the team at Harebrained Schemes makes Bioware look like a room full of monkeys on typewriters well before they come up with Shakespeare. Dragonfall's plot starts strong with a run gone wrong, and subsequently builds into a truly ridiculous but somehow believable cyberpunk-fantasy nightmare peppered with well-written conversations with your team. Contrast that with the inane ""party chatter""  and epic stories in most modern RPGs and Dragonfall feels like a game from another time. You'll learn a lot about each member of your team, and their stories don't feel contrived as they open up over the course of the game.There are quite a few side missions, too, for a game of this length. You're given some room to pursue side goals, and your team members might ask you for help with personal problems sort of like Mass Effect but less goofy. This is the kind of game you feel sad about completing because you won't see any more of the characters you've grown close to in such a brief amount of time.As for the combat, well, it's a bit simplistic. If you're looking for a tactics game with the complexity of Disgaea or Final Fantasy Tactics you'll be disappointed. Combat revolves around cover, basically. You'll want to keep enemies in clear view while positioning your team to not be shot in the face, outside of special cases like spell casters and ley lines. A friendly or enemy caster standing in a major ley line is a terror. In terms of progression, rather than leveling up and numbers everywhere you gain Karma for completing objectives and your team members gain perks every few missions. You can choose one of two perks per ""level"" for your team to specialize them further, such as having your soldier Eiger focus on sniping skills rather than shotguns. For yourself, you've got more choice with a full spectrum of stats and skills based on which stats you increase. As far as I can tell any sort of build for the player character is viable as long as you focus on one or two things and don't spread everything out. I ran into a couple buggy situations requiring me to rewind my save a bit, but nothing truly game ruining cropped up in my 20 hours or so of play. So yeah, if the game is still on sale when you read this buy it. If it's not on sale buy it anyways, it's the best RPG to come out in years. "

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut burst from 2013's Shadowrun Returns like a blood-and-titanium phoenix. Harebrained Schemes' first Shadowrun game is an excellent turn-based tactical RPG whose strengths are offset with awkward save mechanics and limited team customization. It was followed by Shadowrun Returns: Dragonfall, which replaced many of the parent game's human failings with polished chrome. The director's cut is the pinnacle of this evolutionary leg. It's hard-wired with enough features to run like a top-of-the-line pleasure rig, free of any unsightly Essence loss or dumpshock. Dragonfall - Director's Cut is a great game packed with pathos, atmosphere, heists, and intrigue.Dragonfall takes place in magical cyberpunk Berlin, home of countless free-states, gangs, and corporate interests. Like all good Shadowrun stories, the inital run is a rabbit hole into something far more complex. In this case, a simple burglary explodes into a conspiracy wrapped in fire, scales, scientific hubris, and the worst kind of cyber-stalker. On a more personal level Dragonfall revolves around the Kreuzbasar, an autonomous neighborhood in the midst of Berlin's urban chaos. The Kreuzbasar is more than a hideout and a resting place for the central crew of shadowrunners. It's a community to build, protect, or exploit. Visiting its inhabitants and getting involved in its dramas are welcome contrasts to excursions to the outside world. The residents of the kreuz are a persistent group, who scratch the same itch as maintaining a castle in Suikoden or a Breath of Fire town. Checking in on their lives deepens the world, develops a strong sense of place, and provides ample sidequest fodder.Since the protagonist's personality and skills are based on the player's choices, the narrative heavy lifting is mainly handled by the Kreuzbasar's core team of shadowrunners. It's beyond risky to go alone on a run, so teaming up with a crew of dangerous, flawed criminals is the way to go. Glory, a frosty medic loaded down with vintage cyberware, and Dietrich, an aging punk rock shaman, are standout voices who exemplify and complicate familiar cyberpunk themes of dehumanizing technology and rebellion. Each team member's personality shines through in the moral choices made during missions.The core runners are supplemented with a handful of specialists who can be hired for individual runs. However, they're generally not worth it since they demand payment up front and don't have the strong advancement abilities of the core crew. After every major run, the core team of runners gains several pre-determined skills. They also gain one of two advances, each keyed toward a different facet of their build. Eiger, the troll combat specialist, has different specs as a shotgun surgeon than as a sniper, although she's a ferocious beast either way. Some advancements provide bonus gear for the core runners, which repopulates after every mission. Grenades and medkits add up over time, so securing a renewable source of consumables is a worthwhile investment.Combat is a turn-based affair. Each character has Action Points(AP), which govern how many actions they can take. Movement, normal attacks, spells, spirit-summoning, and fancy cyberware all require AP. Complex actions like reloading a grenade launcher or casting specialized spells require multiple AP. Positioning is very important because of Dragonfall's cover system. Hiding behind the scenery provides cover, which reduces the chance to get hit. Armor, on the other hand, prevents damage. Anyone who ends a turn in the no man's land of a bare foyer had better have a backup plan. Enemies use cover wisely, encouraging the player to tactically reposition or discover other techniques for bypassing cover. Magical or technological bombardmant are possible, but it's more fun to send a remote controlled drone through the air ducts or flank with a summoned abomination.Despite the different ways a crew of shadowrunners can be organized, the scenario design is forgiving enough to allow for experimentation. While some character builds are more universally useful than others, no team is able to do everything in a single playthrough. This abundance of options provides freedom to explore a specific path without feeling like useful resources are irretrievably lost. If a team lacks the requisite skills to do something neat, it will probably have the skills to access something else worthwhile. Harebrained Schemes should be commended for this balancing act: it's difficult to put together a terrible team, but team design still has real consequences.Every departure from the relative safety of the Kreuzbasar is a mission. Although it would be easy to see each mission as a traditional fantasy dungeon with go-go dancers and air ducts, the mission variety is morally nuanced and shaded with surprising twists. Most of the missions involve breaking into a building and shooting some dudes, but each one is laced with enjoyable twists, both narrative and tactical. NPCs further complicate missions. The office buildings, science complexes, and city streets traversed by shadowrunners are also places of business and everyday existence. Even the stealthiest team will occasionally encounter a janitor, office romance, or quirky personality who threatens to disrupt the integrity of a mission--or provides unexpected aid if everyone plays their cards right.The five new missions introduced in the director's cut stand out as excellent examples of what makes the game so great. Three of them are partner runs keyed to individual teammates. These sidequests draw back the curtain to explore what really makes already nuanced characters tick. Guiding your allies through their crisis points does double-duty; while they grow, their moral quandaries work as foils for defining the malleable protagonist. Because the main character can potentially take so many shapes or builds, these personal missions turn the screws and force tough decisions. Is it worth allowing evil to escape if it saves innocents? Is it worth solving a dangerous injustice if its institutional causes are unassailable? Taking sides with Berlin's factions is inevitable, and rarely consequence free. The other two new missions are further examples of the sublime torment of decision-making. Both ask the player how far is it worth going for money-or how much money is at the tipping point. Unlike many games interested in morality and choice, Dragonfall rarely offers a good option and an evil one. Instead, it presents a bad choice and a terrible one. Everyone in Berlin has an angle, whether it's salvaging a crumbling biotech franchise or trying to escape from a web of blackmail. You can't save everyone, but your choices will change the world.Although the writing could carry the atmosphere by itself, the graphics and sound team up to further enhance the dirty, haunting paranoia. The music is generally subdued techno, well-suited for vigilant sneaking or meeting with seedy characters. Areas have enough background elements to look lived-in and decayed, but still house sparks of life and individuality. Berlin's neighborhoods display a variety of architecture and themes; its residents are similarly diverse in their portraits and designs. Living in the world of Dragonfall wouldn't be especially pleasant, but it's believable.Games like Dragonfall don’t come about too often. For those of us who’ve grown accustomed to B+ grade titles, we forget what it’s like to experience a top-shelf game. Dragonfall is worth any RPG fan's time unless, I don't know, they don't like cyberpunk, dragons, or exceptional tactical combat.			"

												A DLC for a game is getting a standalone release. It's called a ""Director's Cut"". What does it mean? Is it really a full game? As good as the original Shadowrun Returns? Worth a purchase?YES! It would have deserved to be called ""Shadowrun Returns 2""! It's better in all regards. I played the original for 20 hours and spend a couple more hours with fanmade campaigns from the workshop. Now, the Dragonfall director's cut campaign took me 36 hours! And I enjoyed every minute. No game in years has managed to captivate me like Dragonfall did. It's not everyones taste, I'm sure, but for me it's the game of the year!Will it be for you too? You have to like reading lots of text, a large part of Dragonfall is like reading a ""gamebook"" like they were popular in the 80s and 90s. Then there's this weird scify/fantasy mashup that the Shadowrun universe is: Cyberpunk with Dragons, Elves and Orcs, magic and shamanism. You need to like that, too. But if you do the story is excellent and as deep and well written as you'd expect it from a good cyberpunk novel but rarely find in a game. The choices you're about to make are interesting and mostly tough. It's rarely black and white as it is in so many other RPGs - everything is gray. Morale is a comodity. And even for an opportunist the best choices are rarely obvious.The game has it's flaws. The combat mechanics are kinda opaque. A lot of items and cyberware lack the detailed descriptions you'd wish for. So sometimes it's impossible to make an educated decision whether a particular option really is what you want to purchase. I often tabbed out and tried to google additional info but usually to no avail. So even now after 36 hours I've still not figured everything out completely. The flanking and cover system is a little intransparent - oftentimes you make your move and then watch in horror how the follow up situation is totally different then what you anticipated. But it doesn't hurt the game too much. Yes, combat is a bit messy and the UI is a little confusing too but when you end up doing things that you never wanted to do it's frustrating but also supports the atmosphere and storyline of the game quite well. You struggle to survive and try your best to react to the chain of events that unfold mostly outside of your control... you might think you are in control (this being a turnbased game after all with all the time in the world to plan) but in the end that's just an illusion!Now that I've finished the game there are quite a few decisions I made that I regret. Not only in combat but also story-wise or regarding how I build my character or the suboptimal group-setup I chose for a couple of missions. But those are a bunch of micro-failures that did hurt but didn't require me to reload and in their sum add to the impression that my palythrough was really unique. It feels like my experience was not so much canned and predertermined as in other games but evolved out of my decisions and actions in a complex environment quite naturally. This feeling of having real choices that actually matter is what makes an RPG great and Dragonfall excells in providing that. It also excells in providing NPCs characters that are interesting and that you care about. This game does not spend tons of money on mocap animations, actors and voice acting but employs your imagination to fill in the blanks and that works very, very well!			"

												I played Dragonfall initially just after its original release. I very much enjoyed it then. With the free Directors Cut upgrade for previous owners, I thought it would be a good excuse to play it again. I'm glad I did. I spent about 40 hours on y DC playthrough. I thought it was even better the second time around. The new missions were cool, and I think the game improved quite a bit with the upgrade.  The Runners being able to level up along with your character was pretty cool. They get a more XCOM style of upgrade rather than the direct point expenditure of your main character for upgrades. The distinction is cool and works well. Speaking of your fellow runners, they all have stories that you can learn throughout the playthrough that incorporate quests into them. Those were all quite fun I thought.The graphics all look a bit more polished, and everything tends to look better now than it did before (at least it does to me). The UI is significantly better as well.Anyway, story wise, I thought it was better than Dead Mans Switch overall (although I think the ending of DMS was better). As my 40 hours of gameplay should tell you, there is a lot to do in the game. Ton of content.9 out of 10. I thought this game was even better the second time around.As a nice little bonus, there are also cards and achievements for this game.			"

This game weaves the fantasy and cyberpunk atmosphere  with an environment filled with megacorporations of intriguing power hungry individuals mixed with a shady underworld holding the downtrodden residents. Gang-warfare, magic and virtual-reality all co-exist in this old school isometric role-player with turn-based combat creating an experience where you can make a difference by being the peerless Shadowrunner  9/10			"

												The best entry in the series and my personal favourite.Improves on almost everything that was rather lackluster in Returns. From new weapons, more polished functions and new gameplay enhancements like flanking and armor to character development, both stats and story-wise.The narrative pacing, combined with gameplay segments work in a wonderful synergy, which is further uderlined by the great atmosphere of the cyberpunk-y anarchistic Berlin.The only thing that bothered me was that it wasn't longer, no backwards editor compatibility with Hong Kong assets and some story/character ties that were left a bit too open for my taste. And the obvious ""tablet/smartphone"" UI, but that was just a small issue IMHO.Also, to anyone who was as invested in the shenanigans of the Allied German States and the Kreuzberg kiez, as me: I recommend reading the ""Datapuls ADL"" sourcebook, that is sort of an official continuation of Dragonfall and details such things like the fate of post-anarchistic Berlin, Kreuzbasar, and the surrounding areas in the 2070s. Unfortunately, it is available only in German.All in all, I definitely recommend this game. Had tons of fun with it (even more with the editor) and  for me personally, it is one of the highlights amongst the newest cRPG titles - a genre that is currently re-emerging again in full strength.An event that makes me incredibly happy!P.S.: Glory is best girl.Yes, I have no shame.

												I've never been a big fan of Shadowrun, even though I'm an avid roleplayer, so it is a testament to Dragonfall's solid writing that it made me want to dig into the tabletop RPG. The game drops you in the middle of Berlin's Flux State, an anarchic city with greedy megacorps, heinous cults and scheming dragons. All are vying for power and any individuals that could try to oppose them are waaaay over their heads. But there is hope: as a Shadowrunner, you will take jobs from these mammoths and decide which one gets to keep their superweapons and which one will have their secrets leaked. It is a bleak setting where life is cheap and everyone is out to get you, but you can make a difference. Just think carefully about who you want to make an enemy of and who you choose to trust.You have many, many options to customize your character and your companions will cover your blind spots so you are free to play pretty much anything you want without having to worry about missing out on content. You can also influence how your companions specialize their builds, though you don't get total control over their builds, and some of the most important choices will depend on how you help them resolve their own personal sidequests. By the way, your companions are all very well written, having many memorable lines and moments each. Going into this more would mean spoilers, so you'll have to trust me there.Between the variety of character/party customization  and the many, many plot choices you can make through the story the game has enough replay value to go through it at least twice.Also Harebrained Schemes gave this out for free to everyone who already had the Dragonfall DLC of Shadowrun Returns and that's a serious show of goodwill when most companies would have, at most, given their previous customers just a discount. They have gained themselves a repeat customer in me for doing that.			"

												I can't say I've ever written a review before, but the devs are calling for feedback. I've only played a few hours worth into the game, possibly less than half way, but I already REALLY like this game. If you enjoy Cyberpunk, RPGs, or squad turn-based combat, there's a good chance you'll like this game. You don't need to be aquainted with the Shadowrun universe, I wasn't, Dragonfall explains the setting well. The writing is surprisingly high-quality; your squadmates are fully-fleshed out characters with their own thoughts and opinions on you and your missions. Unfortunately, Dragonfall doesn't support any translations, you can only purchase an English version.Sorry if this review seems a little bare-bones. Just buy Dragonfall; you'll be happy.			"

												Shadowrun Returns was already a good if somewhat linear return to the Shadowrun universe in video games. Its expansion Dragonfall improves the experience by giving more choice and consequence, a better story and a much better hub (in Berlin) to explore.The Director's Cut of Dragonfall however, is a masterpiece. The game looks better, especially the UI. There's more freedom to customize your companions' abilities and more character development with more easter eggs for fans of the tabletop franchise. But best of all, more missions.  Whether you played Dragonfall or not, this game is well worth the price. I am glad that CRPGs are making a comeback, with Shadowrun Dragonfall joining the likes of Divinity: Original Sin and Wasteland 2 as among the must-play games of the year.			"

Shadowrun Dragonfall - Director's Cut ReviewI have fond memories of playing the Shadowrun game on the Super Nintendo back in the 90s, but I've never delved into the tabletop game or novels. When I saw there were a series of Shadowrun games available for PC I was interested, and going on what I'd read in forums, I decided to jump in with Dragonfall - Director's Cut which is an enhanced stand-alone expansion for the previous title, Shadowrun Returns.The game has you create a character with a great deal of customization options including gender, race, combat class, appearance, and even an advanced mode that lets you create a custom build from scratch. Once that's done, you're thrown into a heist with a crew of Shadowrunners - the term used for mercenaries in this dystopia/fantasy world hybrid - and things soon turn ugly as your team leader is mysteriously killed on what should have been a routine mission. This sets the tone for most of the well written, and well balanced campaign. You're running in the shadows doing questionable acts for often unscrupulous clients in order to uncover a greater plot and seek revenge for your fallen teammate.The gameplay is segmented into two parts: You'll hang around the Kreuzbasar in Berlin which functions as a hub complete with story to investigate, team members to form relationships with, and merchants to buy weapons and upgrades from. Once you've got everything together, you head out on jobs to earn money, gain Karma (the in-universe term for experience) and advance character and story elements. This is the meat of the game and it plays out in turn based battles in the vein of XCOM or Divinity:Original Sin. You and your team will use guns, swords, magic, fists, remote controlled drones, performance enhancing drugs, and explosives to dispatch enemies and reach objectives.Overall, I found the experience pleasant and addictive. I have a habit of not finishing RPGs, but this one kept me playing to the end with a pretty satisfying conclusion. As I mentioned before, the characters and plot are well written, and the world is a nice departure from generic swords and sorcery and heavy handed dystopia by instead combining the two genres pretty seamlessly. You really have to experience it to fully appreciate a world where Adam Jensen could hang out with a gun toting Legolas the elf. You'll often be presented with difficult moral and leadership choices as you muddle and force your way through the campaign.Pros:Interesting story and charactersFlexible character creation and game playMusic that fits the atmosphereWorkshop support, editor and player made mods to extend the experienceSelectable difficultyCons:Campaign is a little shortIsometric graphics are detailed and well implemented, but won't blow you awayI would recommend this game for fans of tactics games and role playing games. The unique setting is intriguing, and the campaign is well-written. "

												Pros:- Great writing.  Every mission hammers home the fact that morality in the Shadowrun universe consists of varied shades of grey.  Most of them made me stop to think through an ethical conundrum for several minutes before preceding.  Features multiple endings based on your decisions.   - Great team.  The characters are genuinely interesting and your home base has a nice, lived-in vibe to it.  You buy-in to the experience and the setting.- Great music.  I listen to the soundtrack on youtube while I work.  It does get a little repetitive but not to an annoying extent.- Good balance.  I didn't feel the combat was overly challenging but I played for the story so the last thing I wanted was to replay a battle over and over just to hear more of my teams' backstories.    Neutral:- Physical ('Meatspace') Combat.  I'd say about 50% of the battles are tactically interesting.  The other 50% are slugfests that slow down story progression.  I should add that I played a drone rigger on my first go-round...this probably made the early battles a little harder and the late battles a little easier.  Basically I view this as an awesome narrative game, with combat representing a necessary evil.  - Detailed.  I grew up with Shadowrun (and Earthdawn...) so I had a good knowledge of the setting when I started the game.  The writers don't pull any punches; you get the full Shadowrun experience here.  For someone who loves Shadowrun it's paradise.  If you don't know what Shadowrun is I think they give you enough overview information that you can follow what's happening but you may struggle with the context a little (ie. orcs are no more inclined toward evil than elves in this setting, toxic spirits are always evil, dragons are incredibly deceitful...that kind of thing).  - Upper-tier storyline.  This game is not street-level.  I didn't have any problem with this but some might.Cons:-  Matrix battles.  That ratio of interesting/grindy combat skews a lot harder in the matrix...probably closer to 15% interesting and 85% dull.  The matrix is integrated into combat well; you do get the sense that your decker needs to be protected in meatspace so they can accomplish objectives that will have an immediate impact on the battlefield.  That's fun.  It's just that the matrix combat itself is very much an exercise in 'I hit you, you hit me, I hit you harder, you hit me'.			"

												I bought it on sale for about 3 USD. I then booted up, and played it for eight hours for about three days before beating it. If that isn't reason enough to buy it then I don't know what is.Though you might want a bit more winded explaination. I bought Shadowrun: Returns many months ago and played it to about 90%( I did go back and finish the remaining 10% in about 30 minutes). It was an okay expirence. The story was alright, but it kind of felt.. dull. Nothing felt really alive, it was just go in and shoot the next thing.Dragonfall isn't like that. The narrative made each character feel living, I got a lot more feedback from what I did, and the world just was a bit...fuller than Returns. I had a very pleasant expierence with the game through and through except for one mission of a bank heist. It was awful, it had bug, its load time were slow, but thankfully it didn't last long. The moment that mission passed, the game went onto smooth sailing.The combat is about what you expect if you're coming from Returns. It went by pretty quickly and didn't feel too bad. I kind of wish the animations were a bit faster and the UI was a bit easier (Selecting tiles is a pain when you can't actually see them, and sometimes what constitutes as cover is flaky at best). Some information wasn't presented well, like flanking. Even if I was shooting perpendicular to their cover I would sometimes get a flanking hit. But other than that, it was fine. It wasn't spetacular, but it wasn't awful, it was fine.But the character interaction, the art direction, the story, that's why I play RPG's, and that's what you should go in expecting. A tight narrative story,			"

												Shadowrun Dragonfall... what a game... what an amazing piece of art!Shadowrun Dragonfall is an isometric, fantasy, turn-based RPG set in a future Berlin. This is my first ever Shadowrun game I have touched... and finished. And I must say, I have enjoyed every bit of it. The story is quite interesting. There is no voiceacting, the whole stuff is going only by text, so you have to read a lot. Sometimes, you will get some really long paragraphs of conversations you will be almost lazy to read. But its always risky not to, especially when you might miss some important bit of a story.Overall art is great. It has a very beatifully drawn scenery and some parts will leave you jaw-dropped. (ending is pretty good)The combat is turn-based. If you are familiar with Xcom, you will definitely like this game! Altho I am never sure how did I miss that attack when it had 99% chane to hit, DAMMITThe gameplay mechanics are easy to understand, and its suited for beginners as well. Which I really liked.The game aso offers multiple endings. Based on your chices in the last few missions. There is total of 7 endings you can get!The characters! You will create your own player character, give it a name, gender, race... and you will join a group of characters you will surely find really hard to forget. You can learn ybout their past, and discover their stories before the game. And there is also a cute dog. Dante <3There is also number of bugs though. So make sure to check them out on Steam discussions and learn about those.I recommend this game. Thank you humble bundle <3			"

Shadowrun: Dragonfall – Director`s Cut is an isometric tactical cyberpunk RPG. In a dystopian future, where dormant elf, orc and troll genes reemerged in the population and immortal dragons run mega-corporations that control the world, you join a crew of mercenaries known as Shadowrunners out of the Anarchy Flux-State of Berlin while attempting to survive a conspiration surrounding the possible return of Feuerschwinge, the most deadly of dragons.Pros: This is a much improved standalone version of the Dragonfall DLC for Shadowrun Returns. The story and setting are just as compelling as the original, but with almost twice as many quests, including character-specific side-quests for each of your crew members, more creatures to fight, and additional equipment and cyberware. Now, as your crew levels up, you can direct the path they chose which will impact their equipment, as well as their skills, spells or special attributes. More than ever, choices matter as every dialog will have a variety of options, some only available with certain skills, which can dramatically change the end game with multiple very different endings. The music is just as immersive as it was before.Cons: As with Shadowrun Returns, the graphics aren't on par with the AAA industry, mostly sprites and objects, and the game requires you to read to remain interested as there is no voice acting. The original game was created as a tool for the modding community, but that hasn't carried over as much with this standalone expansion as the Steam Workshop has little additional content. The tactical combat still lacks the dynamic environment found in other games of the genre.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!This still comes off as highly recommended. But beware: if you buy this, you buy it for the incredibly well-written story, not for the tactical combat (although it isn't without its charm). If you like cyberpunk and fantasy, you will enjoy Shadowrun: Dragonfall – Director`s Cut!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Much better than Shadowrun Returns (and that one isn't bad either). The settng, the characters, the story, the side quests are all well done. Moreover, unlike in Shadowrun Returns, the story is non-linear and the side quests have different outcomes. The only downside is that the choices don't feel too impactful and the major choices related to the main plot are at the end of the story. There is also a plus: it's easier to achieve all possible game endings.Overall, Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a solid RPG, and while combat is not ideal and there are some minor bugs, I would totally recommend the game.

												While I think HBS does good design, they fail on the QA level miserably.  Returns had a game breaking bug in iOS which was never resolved.  Even on the PC, it looks like Dragonfall: DC follows their trend of poor quality testing.  At the end one particularly long and difficult quest, a hacked door could not be interacted with - resulting in a failure of the quest and going back to an old save and slogging through it all over again.  Now another quest will let you try but mysteriously removes the one item you need to actually solve it ... again wasting time and making the quest unbeatable.Considering how long this game has been on the shelf it seems like HBS has no real interest in fixing these game breaking bugs.  I'm not holding my breath and certainly never giving them my money again.So no, I don't recommend Dragonfall or any other HBS game ever again.  It's one thing to have these kind of bugs on launch day, but when they persist even years later you can tell what kind of commitment the studio actually has to their players.			"

												I bought this and Dragon Age: Inquisition on the same day. This was on sale for $5, and Dragon Age had just been released and it was full price.I put 30 hours into completing this masterpiece before spending more than an hour or two into Dragon Age.Let me preface this review by saying that, while I enjoy cyberpunk themes, I had never played anything in the Shadowrun universe. I discovered after I played and beaten this game that this is a stand-alone DLC to Shadowrun Returns, so this review is also focused on having zero experience with Shadowrun Returns before playing and completing this game.The biggest positive for me was the story. The story was well told, gripping, and satisfying. There are some elements about the ending I didn't understand, due to lack of knowledge of the Shadowrun universe (for most of the game I assumed when they referred to ""dragons"" that they referred to some sort of augmented superperson.. not actual dragons themselves). The core characters are supremely polished and satisfying. The world is realized very well with fun and immersive environments. There were a lot of options on how to finish each mission and I really felt my choices had an impact on the story, even at the mission level.I'm generally not a fan of tactical combat. The combat is in this game, while not amazing, is pretty good. I realized pretty quickly that there is no ""RPG"" benefit to combat, and if you could it was generally best to avoid it. The game gives you lots of (sometime subtle) options on avoiding combat.I ran as a Decker: a character who jacks into systems to control them. One flaw in the game was that I'm sure I went 10-15 hours into it before the first time I could jack into something, so my character was kinda underpowered otherwise as most of his skill was in decking. This game is a great value. A great story with fascinating characters (you often delve into their backstories quite a bit) and an immersive world that you feel like you actually have an impact in. Highly recommend.			"

												Just beating Dragonfall a couple months ago, I thought it would be a good time to go back and play the Director's Cut of this game. There is a lot more features added on the game from combat to team customization which wanted me to play this story again! I was also happy that it came free since I had the DLC earlier, so I didn't have to put extra money into a couple more missions and and upgrade on the game itself.Most of the improvements are in combat from more detailed hits as in flanked hits, and cover hits so you'll know what's going on in the fight. The layout of the weapons and items/spells is all out on the bottom screen so it's a little bit easier for you to access them and a little bit quicker so it's a plus. As I mention items and spells, using them is faster as in you're not waiting 5 seconds just to heal your ally, where it's more instant when you use haste and more spells. The game now has Workshop, so I'm very excited to see extra campaigns that game designers decide to create for us to play!I'm only at the Nightclub level right now so I haven't played any of the new missions, but I will say that this is definitely worth another play around. I'm pretty sure my thoughts on this will stay the same, but I will most likely edit this to go about the new missions in the game.			"

												I kickstarted Shadowrun Returns. The original campaign, Dead Man's Switch, was serviceable. It didn't feel particularly engaging but it was enjoyable. The follow up campaign, the original Dragonfall, was a marked improvement. The writing, the mechanics, and the overall fun factor took several leaps forward. I said to all my friends, ""Play Dragonfall first. It will definitely keep you hooked."" Now that the Director's Cut of Dragonfall has been released, I can safely say, that THIS is the Shadowrun Returns game that I had hoped for when I kickstarted it years ago. Characters and mechanics and graphics have been given an overhaul once more and it feels and plays great. A hearty recommend for any turnbased roleplaying game fan. Start here. Get this one.			"

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is everything I loved about the pen and paper RPG back in the day. It's dark, it's gritty, it's mysterious and it is all kinds of awesome. The world is beautiful as it is deadly. The writing is excellent. Only in few other RPG's has a few lines of text set the mood so perfectly. Goes to show you don't need to spend truckloads of money on motion capture and voice over talent to create a good game. The few issues I have is that combat can be rather boring. Certain skills outperform others and combat has a tendency to drag on needlessly sometimes what with enemies hiding in heavy cover. I also take issue with the fact that enemies seem to have an endless supply of grenades. Flashbangs in particular.The interaction cursor is rather wonky at times. I've lost track of the times I wanted to pick something up but my character just moves over to the spot and stands there.Certain classes are also a lot better than others, the balance between them isn't really that good.All in all, this is a great game. If you are a Pen-and-paper old schooler like myself you'll love this game. If you're not and are simply looking for a good RPG, then pick this up. You will not regret it.Final verdict: 8/10. Must buy. It's at least a 20hr campaign of RPG goodness.			"

												You will get better description by reading other's recommended comments because they will tell it better. In any case, it is future, and magic started to affect the world about 50 years ago. Large corporations control everything and you are mercenary for hire -  A.K.A ""shadowrunner"".Gameplay is like X-com, but little worse. Graphics is mix between 2d for background and 3d characters. While I enjoy background like that, it is nothing jaw-dropping. Sound/BGM is ok. So if it is so mediocre, why am I recommending it?Because of the story of course. The story alone makes this game one of my favourite games - Over original Shadowrun and even Shadowrun Hong Kong. The main story is engaging, the characters are well portrayed… But there is more depth to it than that.It is about the THEME. Not just the main story but the underlying theme that stretches across all of the missions - perhaps too obviously. This game uses its background(Shadowrun Universe) to provide multiple aspect of this theme and I respect Harebrane scheme for making campaign like this. Hopefully, when your character stare at the bullet-proof glass, you will be able to look at reflection of yourself instead of monster on the other side. It is unfortunate that I cannot speak further, due to my desire to not spoil anything.It is this thematic story(which I have not seen since NWN2 - MotB) that makes me really love this game, and I recommend it to anyone who is into story-driven RPG.

												Shadowrun... A compelling, unique cyberpunk universe where a shotgun in the face will probably miss. A lot.●▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬●×°×★Summary Review★×°×Overall Rating: ★★★★☆ [4/5]Story: ★★★★★Gameplay: ★★★☆☆Sound: ★★★★★●▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬●★OVERALL★Reminiscent of expansion packs in the 1990's, Dragonfall is a standalone story staying true to the already established world within the previously released Shadowrun Returns. With over 30 hours of content, Harebrained Schemes has given us an entirely new game, instead of some ill-developed cash-grab DLC that's all too popular these days. A small studio that started out as a kickstarter has achieved something that other, much larger developers repeatably fail to do: make a great video game. It's immersive. It's authentic. And most importantly, it's fun!★STORY★You start out as a shadowrunner set in a futuristic Berlin. The year is 2054. Unlike towns such as Seattle, Washington, the Flux-State is a home to anarchists. It’s a place where power is constantly shifting, poverty and profit go hand-in-hand, and the only law around is dog eat dog. It's a gangsters paradise. But it's not all paydays and parties. Rumors have been spreading across the message boards about the long dead Feuerschwinge’s return. One of the meanest, most powerful Great Dragons that ever existed. The aptly named ""Firewing"" nearly destroyed Germany 42 years ago when her rampage killed hundreds of thousands. But her hubris was her downfall. And if she survived, she'll be back with avengeance for her day of defeat, forever known as ""Dragonfall.""With top-notch writing, interesting and complex characters, Shadowrun: Dragonfall boasts an immersive, compelling story that is disturbing one minute, then humorous the next. Drama, romance, and betrayal. Dragonfall has it all and then some.★GAMEPLAY★Listed as a ""tactical turn-based role-playing"" game, you might be a little surprised at what you find. I've come to think of the Shadowrun Returns series more as an interactive virtual novel with tactical and roleplaying elements. Because the true lure of this game is not the gameplay, but the story. I'm not saying that it's bad, it's just not what makes the game entertaining. While you're able to change some elements of the story to your own unique perspective, the main storyline arc remains similar. And customizing your character has little impact on how the story develops, instead offering a different perspective on the same events.At best, the combat is a distracting requirement to continue the story. At worst, it will make you want to pull your hair out. In the end, this is not a great tactical turn-based shooter. It is, however, one of the best stories you'll ever experience in a video game.★SOUND & MUSIC★Once again we're treated to the talents of Jon Everist, who was one of the three original composers for Shadowrun Returns. The music is so perfectly in tune with the world's futuristic, steampunk backdrop that it fits in seamlessly with the first game's soundtrack. It's so good that I bought the Director's Cut version of Shadowrun: Dragonfall just to own the music.Aside from the music, the sound effects for the game are satisfying. The wet meaty crunch as your enemy is dismembered by a close-range shotgun blast. The ominous tribal drumbeat that fills the air as your mage summons an elemental. And the cyberistic chirps of IC attacks within the Matrix. It's all very well done.★BUGS & BOTHERS★It's been over a year since Dragonfall's release, but sadly, there are still a number of bothersome bugs and irksome annoyances that keep this game from being a perfect 5 out of 5.Most notably of which is ""the Apex"" bug. Which refers to a game-breaking bug that occurs during the main storyline mission, ""Apex Rising."" You must complete this mission in order to finish the game, and therein lies the problem. The developers have acknowledged that this is a serious issue and they're still working on a fix to this very day. However, we've been given a work around: Don't save during the mission. I know, it sounds counter-intuitive, but a lot of players have confirmed that it works.Another annoyance is the multiple layers of RNG (Random Number Generator). Since Shadowrun began as a pen & paper RPG, similar to D&D, random numbers rule the game in the form of dice rolls. Then came along Shadowrun Returns (the video game) and its tactical turn-based RPG model. The problem is that the game has multiple layers of RNG stacked upon each other. Combine this with a lack of combat information to tell you whether or not you missed, hit, or the target dodged you're left with a rather misleading percent chance to hit marker. And since the Dodge skill is calculated *after* the attack, even a 99% chance to hit (the highest possible within the game) can be completely false.But if you can move past this flaw, you'll find a rich story within a unique, futuristic fantasy world. And I firmly believe that the Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a much improved addition to the Shadowrun Returns trilogy.			"

Now add in: one of THE BEST stories there were lately, which makes you stick to the screen. Improved combat, visuals. Good music. This makes this game an unforgettable experience. Story sucks you in, combat is fluid and pretty tense. Simply put one of the Best RPG there is. Shadowrun Returns was good. But Dragonfall even as DLC, was an improvement so huge, it overshadows Returns pretty easily.Totally worth every cent.			"

												I was not sure about this when I first tried it, so much so that I left it alone for about a year after my initial experience. Rarely have I been more thankful that I went back to a game, it is now one of my favourite RPG's!The game has some design quirks that can initially frustrate, you will get over these and may even like the simplistic streamlining of your team members level progression by it's end. Combat is mostly solid but I did find it was at it's best when I played as a mage/shaman, though it was probably easier in the early sections as a samurai with the opposite being true in the game's latter stages.Some will tell of the APEX quest crash which thankfully did not happen in either of my two play throughs. I did what the devs said, no quick saves in this quest, regular save as little as possible, and make a back up before you embark as an extra precaution.The story is good with many well thought out moral dilemmas that give your character a fully fledged selection of well fitting choices for the situation that they are in. One of the places where Fallout 4(which on the whole I enjoyed a great deal!) seemed to get things a little bit wrong.It has several endings, one of which stands out as possibly my favourite of any RPG ever. I really can't think of another that finishes your adventure in such a perfectly executed and unexpected way.On the whole I can't recommend this enough, a game I could have easily dismissed turns out to be an absolute gem!...also, for any fans of the old SNES Shadowrun like me, you may wish to know that a remake of that game is being developed as a mod for this and it looks like it will be completed in the next few months.

I'm not a fan of the art style of the actual game, particularly, though I am of the portraits (and the two don't necessarily line up...). I find it's always a bit give or take with SR's art style.The story, however, is brilliant. The sideplots are engaging, the characters are wonderul (and broken and terrifying) and the interaction and your involvement in dialogue is just excellent. I'm annoyed that I finished the game, which means it gets a 11/10 from me.			"

												The original Shadowrun Returns was a flawed but entertaining enough RPG - the combat was decent, the writing was okay, but nothing really stood out as *great*. The expansion, Dragonfall, was a significant improvement, offering a much deeper storyline and much more interesting characters. The Director's Cut re-release? Fantastic, and one of the best cyberpunk RPGs to date.Smart writing, smarter characters, a politically complex setting and a lot of new content is in this version of the game, including a general UI overhaul and some balance/AI/systems tweaks to make the game feel more like Firaxis' Xcom once the bullets start flying.The Director's Cut re-release has one disadvantage: It doesn't include the original Shadowrun Returns campaign, Dead Man's Switch. Thankfully, if you own Shadowrun Returns, it's very easy to copy the relevant files over, and play the older campaign with all the system perks of the re-launch.Absolutely recommended if you like CRPGS, Shadowrun or Cyberpunk in general. Very little negative to be said about this one now.			"

												I got this on a humble bundle trade and kept it in my library for months thinking it was boring. Then when my child was born, I had to play games that I could leave any time, even in the middle of a turn. So I installed this one and gave it a shot.My gosh. What a masterpiece! Story is straightforward but gripping. Graphics are great. Action is also fantastic, similar to XCom but not as stressful. I greatly prefer this type of tactical vs the Final Fantasy Tactics type because this system has a pathway (corridors and doors), facing, and cover system.My only real complaint for this is the inventory management, where I am unable to trade with my companions when engaged in a mission. I can't even command them to pick up items unless it's in the middle of a battle.  I would also have loved to hear voice over for extra immersion.Now that Im done with the main storyline, I'm now looking forward to trying out the mods!9/10			"

There are plenty of side-quests in this game, and they aren't all easy to discover.  This makes finding and completing them extra satisfactory.

Posted: September 6, 2015
<Disclosure - this game was provided free for review purposes>Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a meticulously crafted tactical turn based RPG set in a dystopian future filled with elder races, magical powers and advanced technology which blurs the line between man and machine.Based on the long-running tabletop RPG of the same name, Shadowrun (Dragonfall) places you in the role of a Shadowrunner – A mercenary for hire working out of the Berlin flux state. In 2012, magic returned to the world as well as monsters, the elder races of Dwarves, Elves, Orcs and Trolls and of course, the mighty Dragons. This combination of worlds makes for an incredibly rich universe rife with lore and mystery, which can gradually be uncovered by playing through the story and interacting with your fellow residents in the slums. Creating your character is a dull, confusing process as swathes of information are thrown at you with little explanation. There are some pre-defined classes to choose from but these may feel too restrictive for some. Immediately after you are thrown into your first mission; here you are introduced to your crew as well as given a brief introduction to some of the game’s mechanics such as Decking (hacking into the matrix) as well as a crash course in combat. The events of this run will ultimately lead your team down a path of revenge and a search for the truth and it will be your job to lead them. Dragonfall does a great job of telling an emotional, mature story for those willing to read into it, and not simply through the main plot; each party member has their own developed personality and backstory with plenty of dialogue and associated side quests which can also provide them with new combat abilities. Dragonfall’s strongest suit is, by far, its writing. There is an awful lot of reading involved in this game, and even more if you plan to explore all the available conversation options and backstories of your crew. This may put off some people, and indeed at times Shadowrun feels more like an interactive novel than an RPG, but this is merely a testament to how engrossing the writing truly is. Dialogue is consistently engaging, never dips in quality and is frequently accented by multiple skill checks which can affect how the conversation will play out. Etiquettes are another factor which can affect how conversation pan out with different types of people – specialise in street lingo, corporate jargon, academic discourse etc. to better communicate with your team and talk your way out of dangerous situations. There is also plenty of information to extract from the environment if you pay close enough attention. PC databases can be interacted with to search for keywords, open files and hack to access data which provides backstory or could prove valuable in the right hands. Often, finding a crucial piece of information can completely change the way a mission will play out which simultaneously rewards exploration and incentivises multiple playthroughs. Combat in Shadowrun consists of turn based, strategic battles which offer a fair challenge. All actions, including movement, require AP which regenerates each round. This simple formula is embellished by a cover mechanic, a wide array of abilities; offensive and supportive, varying weapon types and the ability to deal AP damage to enemies, restricting their actions at the cost of less HP damage. For the majority of the game you begin each turn with 2 AP which really doesn’t feel like enough; oftentimes you’ll open a door to find an enemy squad staring you down and combat will begin immediately forcing you to scramble for cover -  as a result, combat can feel sluggish at times as you require a number of turns to correctly position and apply buffs/debuffs. Even then, the low accuracy of attacks is a constant annoyance and results in a wasted turn and an even longer battle. There are a lot of great concepts at play here, Shaman abilities in particular seem to allow for a more tactical approach with powers that can manipulate the battlefield to hinder foes and aid allies. The pace of combat picks up a little late on in the game as more options becoma available and AP per turn is increased, however, when examined as a whole, the combat system leaves a lot to be desired, and is certainly (in my opinion) not the focal point of the gameGraphically, Shadowrun Dragonfall is nothing to boast about. Pre-rendered stage backgrounds benefit from a somewhat  hand drawn look but can often look sparse with limited diversity and in some areas while character models look boxy and underdeveloped. This isn’t a huge problem as most of the game takes place from a zoomed out isometric perspective, but when examined up close, there’s not much to praise. Artistically, the game is pretty consistent and does a solid job of conveying the cyberpunk vibes. This is a grim, dark future where the dereliction and dirt of the slums act in stark contrast to the clinical glass paned walkways of corporate Berlin. The hand drawn character portraits in particular look terrific and it would have been nice if this art style leaked over into the graphics a little more. In terms of sound design, Dragonfall features a predominantly techno-heavy, Bladerunner-esque soundtrack which perfectly matches the melancholic atmosphere and environs of future berlin. The music does a decent job of blending into the background, often merging with the ambient sounds of the mission maps – but listen closely and there are some solid tracks on offer here.Developer Harebrained Schemes have successfully managed to condense the depth and complexity of a table top RPG into a standalone campaign. With open ended character progression, meaningful decisions, exceptional writing and a competent battle system, Shadowrun Dragonfall cements itself as one of the finest cyberpunk adventures available and a terrific RPG in its own right. Well written, endearing NPC’s and plenty of upgrades and progressive side quests drive the experience and keep the player gripped as well as a good novel. While movement can be clunky, text often too faint to see against the background and some issues with freezing later on in the game, the breadth of gameplay available more than makes up for these gripes. Barring a few technical annoyances, Shadowrun Dragonfall is consistently entertaining, challenging and engaging, and definitely worth your time.Pros:+Exceptional Writing+Fantastic game world+Frequent, impactive skill checks+Rewards exploration and investigationCons:-Combat can be sluggish-Character creation and skill trees can be daunting at first-Occasional freezes/breaksScore: 8.5If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

There's been multiple threads about the bug on the HBS forums, But aside from myself, few people seem to have managed to not have the bug. It was especially disheartening to me because I originally got the steam version after encountering the problem on the android version whhich HBS also refuses to fix.It's far enough along in the game that most reviewers never got that far before writing their reviews. I can't reccommend it while the bug is still there but to me its worth it for the independent workshop builds. Theres a lot of good content there. I just wish they would fix the bug.			"

												I was a big fan of the first Shadowrun campaign (Dead Man's Switch) - you can read my previous review.Dragonfall takes the same basic formula, with lots of small improvements. The new UI and VFX put a bit of extra and much welcome polish on the game. The story and dialogue is really well executed, and frankly they are the main reason why I am a big fan of the series. Gameplay is very nice, don't get me wrong - it's just  that I think the story is what makes Shadowrun stand out from many other RPGs.If you don't have the first game, this is probably the best place to start. It's better in many small ways that adds up to an overall superior campaign and experience.Incidentally, HBS have done great by their backers, giving away the Director's Cut for free. That's how it's done.			"

												One of the best RPGs in resent years. I had very little expectations after Shadowrun Returns, and was simply blown away by Dragonfall. Allow me to share some of my thoughts on the matter.1. Story and characters.Probably the most important part of any RPG in my opinion. And I am happy to say, that Dragonfall' s characters stayed with me long after I finished the game. And then came back a year after. And then came back again next year. I understand, that the richness and the impact of the story are highly subjective variables based on the cultural level of the player. So, basically, what I find deep and engaging you might find boring and formulaic, because you might have seen it before a thousand times. So let me just tell you, that Dragonfall's story managed to surprise me not on one, but on two occasions. I can't recall the last time that happened in video game. Seriously, probably not since Planescape Torment....What you must understand, that it is not my first dance. I am well accuanted with cyberpunk genre both in literature and in games, and usually begin new journey with “been there, done that” attitude. So, you can imagine my surprise, when the story managed to not only engage me, but also surprise me. 2. Atmosphere.Another Dragonfall's strong suit. I haven't felt this tense being hunted by nebulous foe since KOTOR 2, which is hight praise for me, since KOTOR 2 is my favorite game. Take it as you will. The atmosphere in Dragonfall does something magical: it sucks you in, it encourages you to read into context, to learn who the major players in this world are and what is your place in the grand scheme of things. Let me put it this way: when you find yourself reading 3d and 4th editions of Shadowrun rolebook and the “Sixth World Almanac”, while analyzing discussions about the nature of elf immortality, after replaying Dragonfall, then you know the game does something right. 3. Gameplay and UIThere are things that Dragonfall does right. And then there are Gameplay and UI. First of all the UI. I don't know who had the brilliant idea of putting all the text in a small window on the right side of the screen in a game MOSTLY CONSISTED OF TEXT. All I can say is get accustomed to eye strain. The text itself is very well written, but sometimes feels redundant. The combat is basically the same that it was in Shadowrun Returns, which is to say: not very good. It's slow, it's boring, it's not very tactical, and it's repetitive as hell. And since roughly 60% of the game consists of combat, I can practically guarantee that you ll be grinding you teeth by the end of the story. The structure of the gameplay is basic enough: hub-mission-hub, but it works well, and allows for a lot of quite time, which is essential for creating complex and interesting story. The game has a very “cheap” feeling overall: assets are used, then reused, and then used again for good measure, which is not a problem per se, but considering the astronomical sum that Shadowrun Returns was able to acquire on Kickstarter, I can't help but wonder, where did it all go. In conclusion: take it, not as a review, but as a love letter to a game, which came out of nowhere, took my hearth by storm, and permanently occupied part of my brain for itself. Both Dragonfall and Hong Kong are worth your time, if you re not afraid of reading, but hey, if you made it here, all the way until the end (for some mysterious reason) then I know, that you re the right metahuman for the job. Until then, I ll see you all in shadows. Oh, and never, EVER cut a deal with a dragon.			"

												Holy hot damn, finally got around to finishing this and I'm glad I did.Gameplay for the Director's Cut has been fixed dramatically. Where Returns had issues of all kinds, including but not limited to the complete irrelevance of Deckers, some Etiquettes never being used, a clunky as hell interface, and general balance issues, Dragonfall has smoothed most of that over. To my knowledge, every etiquette was used more than once, Having a Decker in the party is useful for pretty much every mission, and just about every class and build has a place. Granted, the balance isn't perfect; while playing a Steet-Sam, I was damn near invincible by the end of the game, and that was after dumping a ton of points into charisma.Thats not to say everything is perfect. Clicking can still be a bit wonky, which makes me wish we had a macro to click through enemies to move to spaces their model is blocking, or a macro to undo your last move. The difficulty here is great and nicely challenging for the most part, but there are some missions where RNGesus will forsake you and some where RNGesus doesn't leave your side. This kind of statistical play is common to all RPGs, but at low levels it can be extremely frustrating to miss two point blank hits in a row, only for an enemy from across the map to crit you twice in a row. It isn't just possible but common for a mission to have entirely different outcomes based on your dice-rolls, which turns the pulse-pounding tension of the game's combat into a head-throbbing annoyance.Plot is great. I don't want to spoil it, but just know that its great. In your head, you're expecting things to twist in about one of thirty different ways, which is fantastic, and I love that it keeps you guessing. In addition, it drops enough hints that the twists doesn't come entirely out of left field; It ain't no Shamaylan flick.Includes the mod-kit, and tons of fan-made campaigns, but even ignoring that, this game has plenty of hours of content and a lot of replayability.What are you waiting for, chummers? Those corp-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and wizworms ain't gonna kill themselves!			"

												This ""indie"" rpg sits heads and shoulders above the entire industry as an example--a game doesn't need a massive budget to be enjoyable. While the entire ""indie"" industry has shown games this for a while, this game in particular stands out as a paragon of this message.The Story:The story arc that is set out for the character to play through is ingeniously and meticulously designed to capture the essense of a universe that is so wide in scope and details that packaging it into a small game makes the game more obviously golden. At no point in the game should you feel like you need to go buy a sourcebook for the tabletop RPG Shadowrun (from which this game is based) in order to understand what is going on. Further, despite not needing to, I found myself digging through articles online to digest the rich history behind various events that you ""run"" through. You are effortlessly immeresed into what ""running the shadows"" is like. From the perspective of someone who has played other tabletop RPGs, I can tell you that this game is one of two games I have ever played that does a system designed to be played on tabletop does justice to said game.The story isn't one dimensional. Every character or class you play draws out anther element of the game. Even simply thinking about elements of various ""runs"" you perform, you discover the web of conspiracies and lies that line the seams of the Shadowrun universe. BUT! again, you don't have to do these things or spend time philosophising to enjoy the game. The main story by itself is terrific. For fear of spoilers, I will move on.The Characters:This is an aspect of games that I feel so few games do even remotely well. Even developers like Bethesda--for all the impressive things they spit out--have never made a game where I remember a single character's name for all the time I put into them and interacting with them. I understand many peoples' tastes on this matter in particular will vary. I feel that one thing that is most likely to make a game re-playable for me is remarkable characters. I will not get into the various characters in the game for fear of spoilers, but as bad with names as I am, I could probably name off all the main characters that you run with in the game. I get this deep feeling that despite the text medium with no voice over that I *know* these characters--that I have had conversations with them. *THAT,* from where I stand, is an incredible feat. The characters have various personalities and avoid ""cardboard"" stereotypes. They feel fleshed out as opposed to the long list of games I could rattle off with characters so hollow, you could cook a meal in the middle of a flash fire warning zone without the slightest fear of setting fire to the forest you were in.Style / System:This game is a top-down / isometric rpg design. When I saw screenshots of this, I decided to wait--I wasn't familiar enough with the Shadowrun tabletop game at the time to be a backer and I found that I rarely enjoyed isometric games. That fear was unfounded. When I began playing, the first comparison in my mind was the only other top-down game I had really enjoyed: Fallout (1). I don't enjoy that style, but this game streamlined it down (further in the director's cut) to a place where the story and the characters could shine. A bad system can overshadow and ruin the best of stories. Hairbrained took a style that I didn't enjoy and made a game that I both enjoyed and could easily put on my top 10 favorite games list. Are there things that could still be streamlined? Yeah--that's a loaded question though, because if you're honest, there aren't very many games that couldn't be streamlined. In this case, there might be one or MAYBE two things that could be streamlined more, but Hairbrained found a magical balance where this simple style allowed them to draw out elements of the universe that--for example--a first person shooter could have NEVER ever done.If you enjoy RPG games for the story or for the characters, I have very little doubt that you would enjoy this game. Of course there's always the possiblility, but I find it unlikely at best.Stop reading this and go run the shadows, already.			"

												+ Interesting world and atmosphere.+ Improved on the original Shadowrun Returns in every way.- Still not enough depth or replayability to warrant going through game again.This is what Shadowrun Returns should have been.  Just about everything in it is much improved upon and makes for a more enjoyable experience.  The UI in combat is easier to navigate; the story is deeper and better written; characters are fleshed out; more missions to do and people to talk to.Even though it was enjoyable, there still isn't enough here for me to want to play through it again.  There are plenty of other dialogue options I could go back and see, new builds to try, but the story and missions are too limited to make it worth it to me.  Had there been more optional missions, or randomly generated missions that kept the game fresh, I would consider it.  The framework of this game is ripped straight out of any BioWare game from the last 10 years.  You have a hub with some NPCs, your crew that slowly reveals more about themselves after each mission; you hit a point of no return, and the game wraps up.That is probably the weakest part of the game.  It needs more things to do, missions to go on, items to use, equipment.  There is a really solid base here and with some more time to flesh things out, I think they could have a much better result.  Shadowrun is based on a pen and paper RPG like Dungeons & Dragons, it's biggest strength is how deep the gameplay and player choices go, and that's more what the devs should be aiming for.Still, this was a nice adventure, limited as it was, so I will recommend it. If anyone is looking to try Shadowrun, start with this, not Returns.			"

												Dragonfall takes place in Berlin and it involves the return of a dragon that seeks to wreak havoc on the city and it's up to you and your team to stop him.The setting is what makes things interesting as it mixes standard fantasy tropes like Dragons and orcs with a futuristic asthetic making the game a unique hybrid of Fantasy and Cyberpunk.There are also many other side quests unrelated to the main plot that you can get involved in and all of them are interesting in there own way thanks to sharp writing and the setting of the game itself.Gameplay is split into 3 parts, exploration and having conversations with many NPC's, Turn-based combat and exploring the Matrix to turn off cameras/turrets and open doors.Exploring and talking to people is probably the best aspect as there are many ways you can take conversations in and many times avoid combat completely. I'm also not much of a fan of turn-based combat but there is plenty of variety to kill your enemies with lots of guns and spells to use if you invest your karma points wisely (There is a fairly robust skill tree and you'll have to think hard about where to spend your points as there is a limited amount of them).The matrix is basically just turn-based combat in virtual reality and since there are a lot less enemies and ways to deal with them this is the weakest aspect of the gameplay.Visually the game is pleasing with a nice variety of environments to explore and plenty of little details strewn around, combat also looks satisfying with occasional dismemberment when you kill an enemy along with special effects when you use spells. Sound is also well done and while there isn't any voice acting the electronic music helps bring the game to life as well as the impactful sounds of the combat.Overall Fans of the original Shadowrun RPG on the SNES should find lots to like in Dragonfall as well as RPG fans in general and with a 10 hour main campaign along with many sidequests AND a level editor there is more than enough to keep you busy for a while.

												What is Shadowrun?  Basically, it takes place in a cyberpunk future where magic (specifically, dungeons and dragons style magic) has entered the world.  Think if William Gibson and Gary Gygaxes imaginations had a baby.  Lil' Willgar Gibgax.The game itself is an RPG with turn based combat, with real time exploration smoothly (for the most part) transitioning to turn based when the combat starts.The campaign that came with the initial release showed a lot of the potential in the engine they have created, but fell flat when it came to delivering a decent game experience.  Technical issues like not being able to save your game except at the end of ""chapters"" and overall lack of polish and development really made it feel like a module more than a completed game.  Which, to be fair, it technically was exactly that, and the campaign creation software is included in the game.  But personally I'd rather have a polished, complete feeling game than a toolkit.The release of the Dragonfall campaign delivered everything that was missing; a real, fully fleshed out game with a well written and detailed story.  After a rocky start it feels good to wholeheartedly recommend Shadowrun, especially in a time when this particular genre has fallen by the wayside.From what I can tell after playing through the ""Director's Cut"", it includes improvements to the combat UI, more control over how your NPC buddies level up, adds more equipment, and a few missions which develop a few NPC characters further.  If you haven't tried Shadowrun yet, this is the version to get.			"

												I underestimated Dragonfall. Coming into the game, I was just expecting a solid turn-based RPG in a unique cyberpunk/fantasy setting. It certainly delivers there, but all the care and thought put into the details elevates it into a great game I would recommend to all RPG fans, not just those that clap gleefully at the idea of troll mercenaries sniping corporate mages.One of the primary elements that sets Dragonfall apart is how well it embraces player choice. The levels are carefully designed so that whatever your character's specialty, (s)he'll have a time to shine. Maybe you can hack some turrets to fire on the security guards, or maybe you're a smooth enough talker to convince them to let you in. If you've got a drone with you, there might be a vent you can send it through to explore. Some levels will feature ley lines which empower your mages' spells or maybe there's a restless spirit just waiting for your shaman to bind him.These aren't just one-off examples, every mission has this kind of care put into it, letting your character do whatever awesome thing he or she can do.Combat is similarly diverse, with different skill sets gaining access to different spells and weaponry, each with their own benefits and shortcomings. You run a missions with your character and three additional characters of your choosing. While the game doesn't force you to do so, I would highly recommend switching up your party makeup some, as seeing different abilities and developing strategies around them is one of the fun aspects of the game. Tragically, only a subset of the available characters have in-mission dialogue lines. They're just a few flavor bits here and there, but I still resented missing out on them whenever I took a mercenary instead.The second huge success of Dragonfall is the story. I was expecting the writing to mostly revel in smashing cyberpunk and fantasy tropes together, but it goes well beyond that, forging the disparate elements into an engaging mystery and quest. Of particular note are some of the moral choices your character can make, where conflicting agendas and imprecise information will leave you wondering what the ""right"" choice was even after you've seen the consequences. Thematically, the story definitely leans a bit more towards cyberpunk, with elements of class disparity and technological progress outpacing morality.I would be remiss to not mention that this game was developed on a budget much smaller than most modern RPGs, and it shows. There's no voice acting, no cinematics. The character models, while solid enough to not break immersion, look low poly/low texture resolution if you stop and focus on them. VFX and animation are similarly limited; most spells don't end up looking as awesome as you would expect. These shortcomings never took me out of the experience, but it did feel like the game relied more on my imagination to fill in gaps than most modern games.Provided you can get past the lack of AAA gloss, I would recommend this game to anyone who loves RPGs. It's got best-in-class diversity of characters paired with excellent level design and a great story with some of the best moral choices I've seen in games.			"

												The story in Shadowrun: Dragonfall. is excellent. The story in Shadowrun Returns was decent to me, as a newcomer to the Shadowrun universe, but this definitely felt like a step up - you have your own party this time instead of a bunch of rentals for every mission, there is a larger central hub, and the characters are easier to care about. There are also lore tidbits that spice up the game, in particularly the very excellent Shadowlands BBS, that make the world just feel so much more *alive*.There are more optional missions in Dragonfall than Returns, yet they are less ""missable"" than Shadowrun, and some of the missions can be done in any order so as to break up the linearity a little. The plot was very satisfying and engaging as well, escalating at a nice pace and instilling a suitable sense of danger to the player without randomly introducing something outlandish like Returns did. Some quests have more than one possible ending as well.Overall there is also more content in Dragonfall than Returns - both in that there are more missions (About 19 or so in Dragonfall vs 13 or so in Returns), and that the maps tend to be a bit bigger, or involve more than just blowing everything to bits with Eiger. They do stretch the engine to make more creative objectives. There is also a ""mass effect"" feel to the way they did things, with a central hub and companion loyalty arcs and a changeable companion roster, plus the unfortunate side effect of having to talk to every single person between each mission to see if you missed anything. Gear and karma progressions felt good without being overpowering.Why then does this game get a downthumb? Because of bugs. Several of these are decker/rigger specific, so you may not feel it as much if you used another character, however this engine is such a piece of drek and the issue with having a longer and more complex game than Returns is that it also magnifies all the issues with the engine.General:- There is some sort of an internal memory leak that drags the game's response time down, either over time, or as you make more saves per session (which is also sort of the same as over time, I guess). It usually isn't an issue until a couple hours in, but save games and loads start to take longer and longer, from about 20 seconds when the game first boots, to well over a minute to load a savefile several hours in. The game itself will eventually begin to respond a little more sluggishly than usual to commands or NPC conversations, until eventually at some point you try to save the game and the game freezes up and dies.- But if you're lucky, you'll never get that far, because you will just run into another game-ending bug instead. Rarely, your controlled character will just stop responding to anything out of the blue. You can click on the ground and they won't move there. You can select skills and get a highlighted border around it, but you cannot select a target. You can hit escape, and navigate that menu, and that is about it. Everything else in the game doesn't respond to your commands. This can happen regardless if you are controlling your own character, controlling another character, or in free move mode nowhere near a battle. Thankfully, you can usually save/load out of this bug, but sometimes you have to close out and restart anyway.- Until you run into a version of this bug where you try saving and nothing happens, and you have no other recourse to restart the game. And then when you load back in, that save file or some of your save files from the current mission are gone. This only happened once to me in the penultimate Apex Rising, and seems to happen to other people in that same mission more than any other mission, but it was infuriating. Workaround: DO NOT SAVE AFTER DEFENDING THE TERMINAL AND BEFORE ZONING BACK TO KREUSBAZAR. That won't fix it all, but that was a 100% crash situation for me over 4 or 5 science attempts. Once you zone back to town you can save.- Some broken dialogue chains. There are a few of them around, but the most glaring one is when you are checking up with a contact on a certain friend after a mission and you find out they are dead. Then the next time you talk to that contact again, they reuse an old line that mentions that the person is still settling in well. Another one is when you finish learning about the story arc of a certain NPC, and then talk to them again afterwards but before the final fight. Their conversation loops back to the start as though you had just met them for the very first time.- Not being able to rotate the map or force-move. Some character sprites in the in-game world are bigger than others, and if they are sufficiently big enough, there is just no way to force your current character to walk into the tile ""behind"" that other character unless you find the exact pixel (if it exists). It just selects them instead.- Some skills let you select X number of targets before it fires. For some reason, being in selection mode does not prevent you from walking to a spot on the ground (and ruining your entire turn) if you happen to click on the ground within move range, instead of having no effect like most other games do in their target selection modes.- Broken terminal entry. Depending on what exactly you do, there is one unread message near the end that you receive but  can never read because it never shows as an option.- Talking to characters requires two clicks. First click will move you adjacent to the character, then the second will actually start the convo.- There is no way to select which side of an enemy to melee attack from, even if you have enough movement to run laps around him. Nor does it smartly default to the side with cover.Decker/Rigger-specific:- If you equip two drones and a deck for a mission, and then pick up a weapon while on the mission, you do not have an option to reject the pickup and send the weapon to the stash. The weapon then overwrites one of the already-used slots, causing you to be able to equip that weapon, both drones, and a deck for not only that mission, but also future missions. Your loadout screen at the start of a mission then becomes hilariously wrong, with it showing the weapon and two other items, but the item that it overwrote will not be an option to equip or unequip. However, when you load into the mission proper, you will still have that configuration of items/weapons.- Sometimes, during turn-based time, even though your drones are in auto-follow mode and not being controlled by you, they just stand there when you run off instead of following you. This may be specific to the one mission where you zone into a new map and immediately go into turn-based and get a chase objective.- There is another mission where the doors close as you leave a room, and your entire party then has to go to a specific location for the next part of the quest to trigger. However, if you are a rigger with drones following you, the doors will close after you leave and before the drones leave, trapping them in there. This then prevents the followup objective from triggering because not everyone is there.- You cannot use many things while not in combat (thankfully you can do Decking while out of combat, unlike Returns), and one of them is control your drones. It is possible to end a combat with one or both drones in a ventilation system used for drone passage between one room and another. If this is the case, the drones are inaccessible until the next combat or level transition, as they are trapped in the very comfortable vent and cannot be ordered to leave.- Usually they path back fine (if a path exists, see above), but I saw both my drones passing through walls once or twice after combat to get back to me. Oops. Although this is inconsequential so it is more cute than anything.  I also saw them passing through a window at least once, and that was neat.			"

												Best 2014 game, hands down.Only contender would be Divinity Original Sin, gameplay was very refreshing, where DF Director's cut very solid.Anyway.Returns or, Dead man's switch got number of critics, most were valid.Simply put, DMS was short and, very, linear.DragonFall took everything that was right with Shadowrun returns and push it forward (writing, music), everything that stood in the middle (gameplay, UI, some graphics elements) are now among the finests.When it comes to linearity and short-life-span.One normal mod run is about 45 hours.The game is still linear, but not like its predecessor.Every stats of your character will be taken into into account during missions, dialogues, and will offer different outcome.Almost every mission is made of choice, and for some, they will affect the course of the game and endings.Whem it comes to choices and consequences we are not speaking Fallout 1/2, nor Arcanum, but still, it's there, and it's great.Now, maybe this review was not story-seller, but DragonFall Director's cut is an elite game among its peers.

												Much better than Shadowrun Returns, the writing is alot better, the game world I found more interesting and its more fun to play this time. You also get the directors cut which improved over the first Dragonfall release. If you like Shadowrun Returns even a little, there is a good chance you will love this game. Some very interesting characters, some fun gameplay, if you want a well written rpg, pick this up down the road or today when it is on sale on steam! I have beaten this, just on gog.com and not steam, bought another copy when it was cheap.Open up that wallet and get ready for a grand adventure! Looking forward to the Hong Kong Shadowrun coming this summer! This reminds me of Fallout New Vegas in some ways... the fact that it improves over its previous game in every aspect is awesome.			"

												The game has an amazing setting, a good story and a fun-to-explore turned-based-tactical battle. It's furnished with NPCs whose stories you can follow, or not. You can taste the cyberpunk on your tongue, you can bypass fights without losing XP (Karma) which allows you to have a blast playing out a badass or a nice guy.However, it's buggy as hell. I was loving every minute of the game, even with the random crashes here and there. Sadly, one of the final missions is a crash wall. If you don't read about the ""no no""'s before doing it, you're going to fall deep into a pit of frustration as your saves fail and the game crashes randomly. It is the apex of buggyness.I'll give it thumbs up as soon as this moves out of beta. 40 great hours of gaming didn't make up for the 2 hours of raging frustration.EDIT: The problem is not only restricted to Linux it seems.

												Story (8/10): Definitely the most interesting part of the game. The story is well written and the dialogues are interesting while being limited (pretty much always branch out to the same final choice).Gameplay (6/10): As you may have read in other reviews, the combat in this game plays a bit like X-Com: EU but with less strategic elements. I was expecting a challenging AI with challenging combat, both of which I didn't get. You can do pretty much whatever you want and win easily each time.Replayability (4/10): I can't see any reason to play through the game a second time. The story is too linear and the roleplaying elements aren't  implemented well enough so that you want to experiment the game with another type of character.  Also, I would have prefered a lot more items (secret weapons, secret armors, etc).  Graphics (7/10): The graphics in this game are pretty (considering it's an isometric RPG  indie game). The environments are well detailed. The biggest letdown for me is that you can't rotate the camera like in XCOM:EU. Also, I noticed stuterring while the character moves and you move the camera at the same time. Overall (7/10) : I must admit that I had high expectations for S:D. I bought it because of the reviews on steam, where most people seemed to have really enjoyed the game. I would say that if you want a good story and don't mind for a very linear game with limited loot, you might enjoy the game. Stay away if you expect a RPG with lots of choices and consequences and want freedom of exploration like in Fallout 1/2 or Planescape:Torment. In short Good: - Story- Setting and ambiance- MusicBad : - Very linear (can be good if you like very linear games)- Combat not challenging enough (poor AI)- Too short- Not enough items to be discovered- Not enough RPG elements- No replayability ( for the single player of S:D only)			"

												Before we begin: This game is not a simple DLC! It was marketed that way, yes, but this is a whole new campaign which is quite a bit longer (and better, if I may add) than the original Shadowrun:Returns. And furthermore: Before playing this I knew absolutely nothing about the Shadowrun universe except for the content of its predecessor. Having brought that out of the way, let's begin, shall we?I want to start off, by saying that I normally value good gameplay over story, especially if its text-based story, but this game... this game, man... Right from the start I fell in love with the world and the characters. They drew me in and did not let go until the very end. The gameplay is also quite good, actually. Which is something you maybe wouldn't expect of such a story-heavy RPG. Not as good as the obvious comparison, XCOM, but it gets the job done quite nicely. I don't want to take away too much, so here is just a word of advice if you plan on playing this game: Take your time, explore every inch of the gorgeous world and let yourself get enamored with this fabulous piece of software. And what I mean by that is: In most reviews they talked about how this game is around 12 hours long. In my first playthrough, attempting to explore everything possible, it took me 35, three times as long. And yet, I still had to go for a second run to get to see all there is. The level of detail and optional content in this game is just breathtaking.I, again, highly encourage anyone who has any interested in RPGs to pick up this gem. It will be well worth your money and time!			"

												much meatier offering than the first shadowrun returns. good turn-based combat gameplay remains intact, decent integration of skill choices into various dialogue box interactions thoughout the story. well-designed missions and dungeons. well-written characters with an abundance of interactions. a little bit stingy on the karma, but ultimately that's a balance and difficulty issue. completed on normal mode with only a few points in various missions presenting high risk. suffers a little bit from presenting various dialogue choices that have the same ultimate effect, but that's a minor quibble. significant weakness was leaving me wanting more, teasing various bits of lore and possibilities, telling you about places you never get to visit, but every adventure ends sometime. if youre new to the peculiar shadowrun setting this adventure might be jumping into the deep end, you may have a bit of reading to do to understand what certain characters are talking about. WORST quality of the game is questionable stability - a couple of times the enemy ai would get stuck and never end their turn, or the game would freeze or lock up on level transitions - save often!

												The definitive Shadowrun experience, indeed. The story, the pacing, the writing, the companions (which were missing from Returns), and the combat - are all awesome.If you enjoy Shadowrun or the cyberpunk fantasy genre, this is a must have title. Highly recommended if you enjoy tactical RPGs.The writing and the music in particular are exceptionally good.			"

												Quality game from a good series. I personally prefer this over Hong Kong because the story is more interesting, the missions better designed, and there's a deeper sense of character and squad progression, in my opinion. I enjoyed SRHK, but liked this even more.The developers have created an immersive world here and filled it with memorable characters brought to life through good story telling. It's easy to see that there's care and craftmanship put into the material, which is important because there's no voiceover--and a lot of text. If it wasn't well written and engaging, this would quickly become a chore.From an RPG perspective, it also succeeds in numerous ways. For one, the character customization is pretty extensive, from the stats you choose to the weapons and skills you employ to the cybernetic implants you graft onto your person (or not). This greatly adds to replayability.You also face numerous choices, which make subsequent playthroughs worthwhile to see how the different paths play out.Good game and a solid recommendation.			"

 Highlights +* Great story full of twists and turns +* Fantastic choice system+* Plenty of ways to build a character Positives + Good length + Plenty of content+ Clever dialogue Negatives - Average music- Team customisation is limited- Karma points are few and far between so can be difficult to invest in a skillset- Random number generator can be annoying Concerns -* Potentially game breaking bugs (Don't save at all on the Apex rising mission)  Consensus Overall, Shadowrun: Dragonfall draws inspiration from titles like xcom with the strategy, turn based elements and the end result is a cyberpunk triumph with only a few annoyances. If you want a good story coupled with rpg elements and strategy then this game is most certainly for you. 8/10  "

												After having played through Shadowrun Returns and liking it for it's story but disliking it for it's simplified and overly easy combat I had hopes for Shadowrun: Dragonfall.  And I was not disappointed.  The folks over at Hairbrained achieved their goal of making a great follow up to Returns!  The story / writing are great and help keep you wondering what is going to happen next.  The combat is far more challenging this time around which is much appreciated.  I still wish for more freedom and more interactive environments but Dragonfall does a much better job of facilitating choice and consequence.  Overall a beautiful game with a fun, engaging story that is only held back simplified combat / hacking mechanics.  I hope they continue to refine this platform with more complex mechanics as it is truly a diamond in the rough at the moment!			"

												This is exactly what I was hoping for when I backed the Shadowrun Kickstarter.  It's immersive, entertaining, and oozing that awesome Shadowrun ambience.  The mechanics aren't exactly deep, but they're much more in depth than Shadowrun Returns, and they focus on fast, fun tactics.  My only complaint is that it's not always clear when you can save the game without checking the menu.  A trifle.  The game is great. If you like RPGs or cyberpunk, you owe it to yourself to play.

												A great enhancement to the original Shadowrun Returns. Biggest pros are the multi-dimensional characters, the correct pace of the main story and the atmospheric writing which makes it hard not to take just another mission or spend just one more hour in-game. You feel the price of your decisions more often than not, and that's a cool thing to give weight to these situations.Another big pro is the studio behind the game - HBS - itself. Making Dragonfall - Director's Cut available to all DLC purchasers and backers for free wasn't something I'd have expected (not a common attitude nowadays when even a skinpack of two new textures or 'upgrades' between versions with almost no differences have their pricetags) and it speaks volumes about how the guys in HBS intends to handle their relationship towards their players. That builds trust towards both them and the games they create for me.Cons are nuisances. Since you have an own team with rich backstory and personality, you barely need to hire random runners so that part seems a bit neglected. Custom builds for street samurai is still a weak point due to the over-simplied essence and cyber/bioware slot system. The engine has its flaws, but not to the point it would ruin atmosphere.  Voice-acting could have served great (still, I never felt they used up their limited budget unwisely).Dragonfall is a great deal for anyone who likes futuristic fantasy/cyperpunk hybrids set in Europe for a change and don't get intimidated by a rich, written narrative (yes, you need to read a lot).

												Now that I have completed the game, I wanted to review it. Director's Cut goes above and beyond what the original Dragonfall did. For one, a completely revamped combat system. It made the game both easier and harder. Harder because if you're out of cover or something, you will be mince meat. The same can be said about your opponents, and some AI have a tendency to sit in the open. Another point is that there are some new missions. They shed light on your fellow runners. Storyline is amazing in my opinion. There are moral greys as well as black and white, but the game doesn't really beat you over the head with what's the right choice at the time, more what may or may not be reasonable. The characters are great, your followers and the Kreuzbasar's residence all have life to them, you get to see them change as the story goes on, both subtly and in ways that you can affect. I really have no gripes, just future ideas for future games, which is what that would turn the review into.

												I had picked it up on a sale some time back on a whim and hadn't gotten around to playing it until it was recommended to me by a friend.  I was very pleasantly surprised with the game after starting it up.Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a standalone expansion to Shadowrun Returns.  It's a tactical RPG with a deep and engrossing cyberpunk story that offers a lot of choice to the player.  The conversation and interaction system in place I found to be one of the most entertaining aspects of the game.  No matter what skills you choose to build you'll have options available to you that change one or more aspects of your current encounter and/or mission.  For example, someone with high decking would be able to hack into a facility's security system while someone with high strength would be able to just break down a wall.The leveling system itself is well done.  There are your main stats (strength, quickness, intelligence, etc.) which each have a tree of their own to build on.  Strength, for example, has specialization branches for melee weapons, unarmed combat, and throwing weapons.  For your main character you choose where each individual point (called Karma in-game) goes, while for your allies you're given the option of choosing between two upgrades, similar to XCOM: Enemy Unknown.The turn-based combat, in my opinion, is something of XCOM-Lite, though it is very fun and enjoyable all the same.  The story and RPG elements are deep, however, and that's where this game truly shines and makes its mark on the genre.I highly recommend this game to all fans of cyberpunk, tactical RPGs, and deep storytelling.

												Harebrained Schemes captured the essence that emanated from the orignal Shadowrun games (SNES/Genesis).The story is brilliantly written with care, creativity and realism (in terms of character dialogue). As for the audio, they could not have made anything better then what they offered. The character creation is pretty straightforward.As this was their first attempt at Shadowrun, there are a few improvements they could bring forth in the future: a rotational camera (unless I missed that), perhaps an option to make the enemy characters ""redder"", as well as better character creation and ingame enemies (often times, the avatars do not like like the characters. Also, the way you create your character is limited). Lastly, I wish that options ingame truly had an impact - your dialogue choices make practically no difference, except in a few instances where the outcomes isn't all that different anyhow.Despite its flaws, the game developers gave it their all as they offered us a game with utmost professionalism. Aside from the shortcomings, the game itself is a masterpiece, and its flaws are easily overcome by the brilliant way it was brought forth. I mean, the music, the story, the characters, the skills tree etc. are simply so well presented that you wish one thing only: that Harebrained Schemes will continue making Shadowrun games, and hopefully expand their work to encompass something even more brilliant.

												Positive review because I love the story and the setting so far. I've been looking for a good cyberpunk movie or game and this hits the spot but man are there some bad game design decisions. The good UI is not noticeable because everything just works, but in Shadowrun (both the original and Dragonfall) the UI is annoying. For example, why aren't there hotkeys for Journal/Missions, Inventory, Character Sheets like every other normal RPG on PC? Why are there no hotkeys for actions? Clicking on items in the world sometimes requires multiple clicks. Text gets cut off of item descriptions when you use Hi-Res Text Mode and on and on. These are issues I expect from a poor PC port.The world also seems lifeless--Don't get me wrong, the writing is fantastic and carries most of the world-building and the art is rather beautiful, but from a gameplay standpoint it all feels very static, like you're moving around a painting. There isn't a sense of depth, literally or figuratively to the environment. Not to mention that the 3D character models are frankly quite ugly for a modern game--it makes it harder to connect to the characters when they don't look like their portraits OR their text descriptions (Wasteland 2 has the same issue).Combat while fun, also suffers from poor animations and poor sound effects. It's just not as tense or as satisfying to hit or kill an enemy as in other turn-based RPGs because the actions really lack any visual or auditory punch.I recognize that this is an indie budgeted game and not a Triple A title like XCOM, but with a professional development studio behind the title I just wish more thought would have been put into the interface. This is the second standalone game, mind you, and although there are noticeable improvements over the first (namely in story and choice), there are still a lot of issues I wish they'd have ironed out when pushing this ""sequel"". It feels a lot more like a standalone expansion.Overall, I still recommend it and I sincerely hope Harebrained Schemes will take the Shadowrun IP and give it a lot more spit and shine for the next iteration after Shadowrun: Hong Kong. Perhaps even move to rendering the world in true 3D (fingers crossed!).			"

I didn't expect that i would like this kind of game, but it really surprised me. After playing so many RPGs from the ''big guys'' in the industry and realising, that they get more and more casual, Shadowrun Dragonfall felt very good.Dragonfall has a very gripping story from the beginning till the end with many difficult decisions and it is all narrated through text. Yes through text. No voice over. It felt like reading an interactive Shadowrun novel and i thought about how much i missed reading a good book and let my imagination do the entertaining.Granted, it is a little sparse gameplay wise and it looks too ''oldschool'' for my taste, but it was a very pleasent experience.I really hope the developers will make another Shadowrun game with updated graphics, better character customization and an even bigger scale. I will definitely try more of these ''new oldschool'' RPGs out "

Really though, Dragonfall was already good when it was a ""DLC"", and as a bigger and improved stand-alone game it has not lost any of its quality. If you liked Shadowrun Returns and didn't get this for some reason when it was a DLC, then get this stand-alone version now. Also if you are a fan of cyberpunk, turn-based RPG's (think Fallout 1/2, but 16 years newer). and good storytelling, then you owe it to yourself to look at this one. It's nommers. :3			"

												Finished the game with a dwarf decker/rigger. Graphics and art style are really well-made, with vibrant colors even for a game that takes place in the ""shadows"". The soundtrack is a pleasure to ears 100% of the time. Story and character development are trully engaging. One of the few games that actually manages to make you care for your team outside combat situations. Also one of the few games that makes you NOT mash on the <next> button of a dialogue, since it has no voice acting and feels like a session of pen and paper goodness. Leveling (karma) system is done right and also makes you feel that your character actually gets better not by just getting a +1 on his Level counter, but for gaining ""actual"" experience from the situations he faces. Combat mechanics are pretty decent as well. - could use a better aiming system though, since I missed plenty of times with 85%+ chance to hit and at one point I missed 3 times in a row with 99% chance to hit... Maybe it was the difficulty setting though, since I played the game at max difficulty level. Anyway, this isn't even an issue that downgrades your experience or one that would stop you from playing it. I highly recommend it if you love story driven, turn-based rpgs and a big plus is that you don't have to be a hardcore Shadowrun fan to enjoy the game			"

												It's nice to every now and then have it easy and just point to a game saying ""yes, this is better than its predecessor"". Such is the case with Shadowrun: Dragonfall so let's waste no more time and just dig into it, chummers.Developer Harebrained Schemes has most certainly demonstrated to have learned a lot from Shadowrun Returns and applied it to this game; ranging from basic UI improvements which are this time not hampered by game's tablet release as well as various tweaks and plain structural changes in order to make it more of a traditional RPG as opposed to a highly linear affair. For starters, game actually has more-than-token hub area you'll keep coming back to for more than just recruiting characters because hey, while you CAN recruit some unrelated Fixers in good old Shadowrun tradition, game is obviously built with an already existing cast of characters and it behooves you to stick with them in order to get their input during missions as well solving their own sidequests and gaining approval in the process. Cast is varied, both personality and archetype-wise, so you'll definitely find staple characters befitting your character build. But the most important change compared to the original is, as mentioned above, a purely structural one. Dragonfall is a grander game on pretty much every level. Ranging from more involved story to more missions as well as the real show stopper – healthy sprinkling of choices and consequences you'll get to handle throughout the game. They range from depending on your etiquette and minor ones to major decisions affecting the main story in drastic ways you may want to replay certain sections to fully witness. Definite step up.To close up game is not perfect, but most of those issues are my own preferences. I'm a fan of low-key Shadowrun and Returns' story was more along those lines as opposed to affecting the state of the Flux-State to such a degree in Dragonfall and you could argue game loses some of its tight narrative by giving you missions you only do in order to get the funds you need to progress further, but I think those would largely be dishonest complaints to hold against the game in the end.

												Quite a decent story-driven RPG. Rather interesting storyline, mostly well-written characters and dialogues, albeit sometimes overly dramaticized. Mediocre turn-based combat system with annoyances, such as characters covering tiles behind them, so you can't send another squadmate there as there is no way to click there. Skill checks in dialogues, albeit I'd say there is not enough of them, and a very nice audiovisuals. Overall, for a discounted price it's a must-buy for cRPG fans who like story-driven games, but not for anyone else. The game, however, is quite short, and not really replayable, hence I'd be hesitant getting it for a full price (if anybody buys games on Steam for a full price :lol: ).			"

												I loved every minute of it. The story is simply amazing, the side missions are intense, each character involved have unique backstory, and there are a lot of moments where morals and desires coming clashing together. The new interface makes life a little easier, the home hub is busy with things to do, there are a lot more uses of particular karma skills in dialogue than in the previous game, and each teammate have unique upgrades when leveling up. A drek-ton of twists and turns makes you want to know and see more. If you like conspiracies, corporate espionage, sabotage, assassinations, spiritual underworlds, gang turf wars, illegal experiments, magically attuned tech junkies, murders, mysteries, betrayals, and of course, a damn good story - should definitely give this a go.

												I liked Shadowrun Returns a lot when it came out. It had a new fantasy-cyberpunk setting for me, looked pretty, story was nice. As a huge cyberpunk fan i was amazed. I missed Dragonfall when it was released as Dlc campaign, but now i finally caught up.I didn't expect too much since i heard back in 2013 that ""Berlin"" was planned as small mini-campaign for original SR:R backers. At my surprise i was wrong. So wrong.Story is deeper. Characters is a lot better. Each has its own story line. My personal favorite is Glory. It took me longer to complete the Dragonfall than Returns. Music is fine. Atmopspere is incredible. Unique cyberpunk-fantasy with orks, trolls and elves.I dont really cared for gameplay as i played for story mostly. But i guess battle system is fine too.Dont worry if you haven't played Shadowrun Returns as it dont have much connections to this game.If you like cyberpunk and games with decent story line - i highly recommend.

												I've been asked by many friends what the difference is between the Shadowrun Returns DLC for Dragonfall and the Director's Cut.  I'm going to write from that perspective; there's already plenty of reviews telling about the game itself and I will be using spoilers.  Let the reader beware.First off, the overall plot reminded me a  lot of Baldur's Gate II.  Divine being-type entity split from its divinity and that problem becomes the player's problem, the player is required to raise a ridiculous amount of money to chase their adversary, along the way the player gets to know their companions better if they care to, and the player is offered side missions for each of their companions that gives each of them a slight boost.  Despite all the similarities, I very much enjoyed the Shadowrun take on the story idea; enough to play it through several times and grab every achievement - as there are many ""hidden"" achievements tied to how the game ends, that's saying something.Where the Director's Cut differs from the DLC is mostly the inclusion of the companion missions, the Black Lodge audition, and missions on behalf of some of the Kreusbazar vendors [the majority of these are in both games, but I know the mission for Ezkibel was missing from the DLC for sure].  There are some other noticeable, but minor differences like less dialog options when dealing with Doctor Ezkibel after taking care of the sewers, but they do not really impact the game at all.Edit:  playing the DLC after the Director's Cut allowed me to notice that for some reason there are some dialog triggers and conversations that somehow failed to fire in the Director's Cut.  For example, meeting Audran for the first time in the Director's Cut he just starts shooting when you meet him.  Playing the DLC, he actually explained why the player's intrusion could not be forgiven and finally some companion lines made more sense as they reference that later.I found that the missions and dialog included in the Director's Cut greatly enhanced the story and gave it a lot of depth that the player wouldn't know was missing until they experienced it as the DLC is not incomplete without it - it's just more complete with it.The display and inteface is also slightly different between Dragonfall Director's Cut and the base Shadowrun Returns.  While both games made use of keyboard shortcuts for things like inventory items, spells, and personal skills only in Dragonfall are they labeled on the display - playing the base game I never even knew those shortcuts existed and they enable the player to enjoy a quicker and smoother combat experience.I also like how the weapon display was laid out in Dragonfall over the base game with all the information made available at a glance and number hot keys to switch to specific weapons.  The only thing I would consider missing from Dragonfall that was present in the base game was the ""F"" key to cycle through weapons when my attention was too focused on the scene to look up what number would correspond to whatever weapon, especially for a character whose loadout changes or an unfamiliar character.Another item that is an improvement in Dragonfall in my opinion is the ability to lend not just consumable items to your team, but also weapons.  In my first playthrough, for example, I made use of rifles and shotguns so whenever I could afford to upgrade my own gear I was able to lend my previous weapons to Eiger as they were better than her in built gear for a while.  It also gave me the ability to outfit her with an assault rifle while the Shadowrun Returns Dragonfall DLC does not allow that to happen.I'll be honest, I backed Shadowrun Returns on Kickstarter so the Director's Cut didn't cost me anything additional, but having played both I would gladly pay for the extra content and story that the Director's Cut offers and consider it money well spent.

												I HATED Shadowrun Returns.This is SO much  better... Starting off it seems like it's going to be the same, but it's just so much more polished.It's better written, there are tons of story rich missions to do, and you have a much larger central hub. Yeah, there's a central Hub that branches out to different missions, but they take you to so many different places that it's just much less linear. In Returns, you were just in the Bar the whole time. In this, you have your own Base, plus the city outside, which actually has vendors and shops. This game is much, much closer to the original SNES Shadowrun. This game gives you more choices on how to do your runs, moral choices that -even if they don't effect the game too much- still give you a sense of freedom. There's a few other things going on here that you should just experience yourself but I give Dragonfall .... 9/10. ""Returns"" was easily a 7/10 for me.If it had the Sega Genesis style matrix it'd be 11/10. If it had more weapons/armor and you could actually loot corpses for phat lootz it'd be like 15/10.			"

												""Dragonfall still suffers from many issues that plagued Shadowrun Returns, namely the linearity (though this issue has been lessened), lack of item/weapon variety and a somewhat poor implementation of cyberware and cyberspace. With that said the added focus on plot and characters makes these issues easy to overlook and the campaign a joy to play. Long time Pen & Paper Shadowrun players might be a little disappointed, but it stands on its own as a fine RPG worthy of belonging in anyone’s collection.""Full Review: http://www.tech-gaming.com/shadowrun-dragonfall-review/ "

												I've been playing story-driven games for 25 years, going back to the original Deus Ex or further back to Neuromancer on the C64.  Add in turn based combat, and I'm usually sold.  The problem here, for me, is too much story for not enough combat.  And the combat is not challenging.The combat is improved over SR:Returns, but it's just not at all difficult, even on the highest difficulty.There's also not enough interaction with the Matrix, especially for this type of game.Linear, linear, linear.  Again improved over SR:R with more optional missions, but still too basic.  And the hand-holding is pretty extreme.Once I started quick-scanning the dialogue, I knew the game had lost me.If you want a ton of story with a reasonable amount of comat, this is a solid game.  Just not for me, and it seems the reviews for Hong Kong also indicate an imbalance of story<>combat.  Too bad as I want to love these games.			"

												I've been a huge SR fan for years... err.. I guess decades now.  I fondly recall the Sega Genesis SR game from my mispent youth, and was thrilled to see the franchise revived.  While SRR has a few bugs and the original story was a bit linear, the team at HBS has done an excellent job expanding on the initial release and providing new resources.  The game is also supported by a small, but avid modding community which receives regular support and active encouragement from HBS (which essentially crafted an expansive editor for such a purpose).I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys turn based strategy, the grimey future of a cyberpunk-meets-magic world, and a supportive community that is always seeking to expand scope and content.

												Shadowrun Returns was already an excellent game and I'm happy to report that the Director's Cut of Dragonfall continues that fine tradition. While the original game sported a perfectly fine UI, the DC adds even more polish and several nice new additions. No longer do you have to hunt for your weapon and spell abilities – they're now all there right where you need them.The game was already visually stunning, but the new animations and other refinements just add a bit more polish. Critical hits are now viscerally satisfying and the new attack animations look killer. Most of the changes are small but add a great deal to the overall feel of the game.The storyline of Dragonfall was great in the original game, but the changes in the DC really take it to the next level. The richly detailed NPCs now all have their own specific missions that meld well with their complex and interesting backgrounds. These custom missions not only give your running mates new abilities, they also give each NPC a fitting resolution to their own unique stories.If you liked Shadowrun Returns, the Dragonfall Director's Cut is definitely worth purchasing (if you haven't already gotten it for free!). If you're new to the game,  this is definitely where you should start. I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												I know Shadowrun since 1994, when I bought the second edition core book, the novels and almost every sourcebook that I could find. I love the cyberpunk + magic atmosphere. Shadowrun Returns was a great game because it was very faithful to the tabletop game. And Dragonfall is even better. It has some of the greatest writing I’ve seen in a game. Even though there are no voices, the dialogs made me stand at the edge of the chair saying “oh my God, I can’t believe this is happening”, over and over again. This game is a truly epic shadowrun experience.The game mechanic is simple: turn based combat with some limited options, which really could be improved. I’ve played with the music turned off, listening to Refused (a Swedish punk band) instead. Sorry Harebrained, but it was a great improvement for me, Refused is perfect for this game and it would make a much better sound track.This game also has an adventure editor, and I guess there are a lot of Shadowrun fans that will make great content for others to play.

												Shadowrun! It's a great little RPG/turn-based action game. As far as combat goes it shares a lot of similarities with X-Com, however the addition of magic, and a wide variety of skills and weapons means that it's quite detailed and a lot of fun to play. The roleplaying portions of the game are fun, and you can assist or kill people and monsters you meet, as you see fit. There's some hacking and espionage elements that you can use during missions, or just blow everything up. I'm a completionist, so I like all the optional mission objectives and side quests. I haven't had a chance to play any of the user-created content, but there is some content out there for when you finish the main game. Overall it's good fun and a well-polished game, so I recommend it.			"

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is pretty much everything I had hoped Shadowrun Returns would be. The difference is not so much in the game engine, although some minor user-friendly UI tweaks in the Director's Cut are most welcome, as in the design of the content. Where the Shadowrun Returns adventure (The Dead Man's Switch) was heavy-handedly linear, almost completely lacking in opportunities to simply explore the landscape and run missions unrelated to the main plot, Dragonfall has some minor characters with interests and concerns (and missions) that have little or nothing to do with the fall of a dragon. It's almost like a rebirth of the brilliant world of the Sega Genesis entry in the Shadowrun video game franchise. My one complaint is that it is most unsatisfying to try to play a Decker, which is my favourite class. Few missions require decking skills, and even when they are of use it is often simply a question of: ""Do you have a party member with a Decker of at least level whatever?"" If so, you can use this terminal, bypass this security, etc. ... without having to actually *do* anything. That aside, I like this game a LOT. If you like to sandbox and take a leisurely look around, you can do that (some). If you want to stick to the main story and get to the end as quickly as possible, you can do that (mostly). And if you're a crusty old pedant like me, you'll be pleased to know that when the big story segments are presented, this time around the story is told with proper attention to spelling, grammar and punctuation.

Still annoyed at the ""80% chance to hit, miss miss miss miss"" crap.  That still needs fixed.  It can get pretty frustrating when a big fight happens and it takes an hour when it should have taken 10 minutes.  But the story and other aspects of gameplay more than make up for that.   "

 Quick summary  (more below)+ Excellent main story filled with mystery and plot twists.+ Fun side quests, especially the optional Knights of Lightninghold.+ Memorable characters with deep character developments.+ The world is absolutely packed with lore, a lot of optional stuff to discover for those interested.+ Gameplay has a lot of player freedom, most of the encounters can be dealt with in many ways.+ As a result, there are tons of choices for most of your needs, all with their respective consequences. + Berlin looks great, visual design is amazing. It breathes cyberpunk.+ The sounds in it are very atmospheric, both environmental sounds and the great soundtrack.+ The gameplay itself is very solid, nice amount of depth. Basically XCOM:EU-lite.+ Nice pacing, no unnecessary filler. My first playthrough took me 30 hours, and not a second was I bored.- Team inventory is only accessible at the start of a mission, not during.- Some fights take too long, like ""in X rounds Y will happen"". I didn't like that. ~ 2054, Berlin. Welcome to the Flux State. ~ The GoodShadowrun: Dragonfall - a game that has been on my radar for a while, but due to circumstances I never really got around to that. I've recently decided to give it a try, and it only took half an hour for me to get hooked. After a short but intense tutorial, you find yourself in a beautifully designed, atmosphere and futuristic Berlin. At times it can feel overwhelming, especially if it's your first cRPG experience. Which is what it was for me. The world is absolutely packed with lore, and the best thing about it is they don't force feed it to you. It's only there for people who want to know about it, it's completely optional. A lot of those little pieces of information can be put together and it really helps make Berlin feel alive. It all contributes to the amazing experience of the main story. An excellent story filled with mystery and plot twists. I'm also very positive about the characters. Each one of them has different stories to them, and they're fully fleshed out that make all of them very memorable.Another thing I really liked - or even liked the most - was the insane amount of player freedom. There are many situations that can be solved in more than one way, in a handful of ways, and frequently even more than that. You can be smooth and talk your way through (or into) trouble, or you can be as subtle as a brick to the teeth and let the bullets do the talking. Or, I don't know, smash a wall and make yourself an entrance if you're into that. Or are you the type of guy that likes to bribe people? Intimate them? Or use different skills to pass through? There's a lot you can do to solve encounters, and that amount of player freedom gets even better if you factor that most of the stuff you choose to reach your objectives have their own set of consequences.The not so GoodAre there any flaws? Well, actually there aren't. At least not in a way that really bothered me. However, there are two things I'd consider unfortunate, but not actually flaws themselves. But still. The biggest one (and probably even the only one) is that you can access your team mates' inventory during missions. It's only available at the start. After that it's not possible any more to change their inventory, only yours. Also, some fights can take a little while. Especially the ones with time pressure (""in X rounds Y will happen"") felt like they could have ended sooner. And that's all she wrote. This is the first ""traditional"" cRPG I have played, and it has set the bar extremely high. Even for newcomers, it can maybe feel a little overwhelming at times, but stick with it like I do, and if you like narrative-heavy cyberpunk experiences, this will be right up your alley.			"

												Yes.Its kinda nice that each Shadowrun game's plot doesn't have anything to do with any of the other games beyond subtle references; none of them bump into each other while all pulling from the same source material, and there's no running plot to keep up with really, just datapoints on a timeline - most of the points by themselves are insignificant but add up to a really interesting, if complex, universe.  Means you can jump into any game and you really haven't missed much (plus its easy to go back to SR, and from what I can tell of Hong Kong it'll be just as easy to come back to DF). Keeps it from getting too heavy, and the Shadowrun universe is very .... flexible? It lends itself to telling interesting, self-contained stories that draw from several genres, sci-fi, cyber-punk, fantasy, espionage, talking dragons that wear italian suits, talking dragons that don't wear much at all, corporate conspiracy, drugs, philosophical and moral questions about (meta)humanity, shooting things in the face for money, shooting things in the face just because you can, convincing things to just shoot themselves in the face, family over all else; all that stuff in a nice, neat little package.Wang-in-the-face turn-based tactics gameplay but there's a difficulty slider, and some firefights can be avoided/altered in your favor, and you can save basically any time there isn't movement on-screen (save often, and keep multiple saves).  ALWAYS HAVE A DECKER IN YOUR CREW, ALWAYSALWAYSALWAYS, else you WILL miss out on ... things. It was a bigger deal in Returns but its still a thing here as well. I'd consider investing some decking skills and a datajack in your main character if not rolling as primarily a decker, the one provided for your crew has weak combat skills and generally has little use in combat other than using up health items, while you have a good healer, a tank, and a dps all available as free crewmembers from the outset; your mileage will vary though.Some of the user campaigns have made rattles across the internet, there's even a sandbox-esque mod available I believe.  anyway its a moot point now, if you haven't played a Shadowrun game and are interested...well, pick any of them, they're all good and all play/look roughly the same (Dragonfall is superior to Returns but in very small ways, Hong Kong obviously is the best looking so far).  The modders have been good about porting their stuff to each new game, the UGC editor is good like that.Avoid the Shadowrun wikis unless you're an avid drug user. You've been warned.			"

												In how many games will you hear about a fat dwarf moving like a cheetah as he jumps to use his big, fat body to save a Turkish barista from getting shot? Well...this is one of them.Pretty much an upgrade of the first ""Shadowrun Return"" version. The world feels more complete and open and the quests are more. You also get your own team and they do not steal your money to go on your trips in the same manner. I do miss the old bar and I think I prefered Seattle in some places more than Berlin. But the game is overall a much more poolished version of the first version. Directos Cut is a clear buy if you like turnbased RPGs. I raise the old 6,5 in Shadowrun Returns to a 7,5 in this one. Which I state as a ""Good game"".			"

												Just finished the game and totally loved it! + The level design was great+ You had a lot of variety between the missions and it was not repetive at all+ There's plenty of different classes and characters to use and they differ greatly+ Can't get enough of X-COM style combat+ The story was interesting enough+ Length of the game was perfect, there was plenty to play and it ended before it got stale, took 27 hours for me- Enemies didn't really differ from each other and you don't need to have different tactics for different enemies- There are some bugs and one gets you stuck, have to save all the time- Couldn't change party equipment which was surprising - You couldn't give picked up medkits and grenades to your party members, only way for them to get them would mean character picking it up himself in combatAll in all I throughly enjoyed the game and would recommend it to anybody who likes RPGs and tactical turn-based combat, I love both. Will play through it again in a few years. 4.4/5			"

												This review may be biased purely because I have played the pen and paper version many years ago as a youngster, and playing this seemed to vividly bring to life all those adventures I ran and played all those years ago. These guys (developers) did an amazing job capturing the spirit of Shadowrun, and I can't give it any more praise than this review. If you've played Shadowrun Returns this title will be no shock to you it plays just like the original but with a bigger quest, more characters, more music and more griping characters. The moding community is also brill with enough one off adventures and campaigns to keep anyone playing this for even longer, thumbs up!			"

												Shadowrun Dragonfall, while not a direct sequel to Shadowrun Returns, is set in the same universe with the same mechanics. And yet, Dragonfall has some vast improvements over its predecessor.Party CompositionUnlike the predecessor, in which you hired mercenaries for each mission, Dragonfall sets you up with a dedicated team of story-related companions. Each companion has their own quest (think loyalty quests from Mass Effect, but if they weren’t garbage), which you access via dialogue between missions.Additionally, each party member has special skills you can unlock as they level up. Unlike your own character, who still levels up with Karma, your companions level up as you progress through the story and complete specific missions.CombatThe combat system seems a little more streamlined than in Shadowrun Returns. While the UI received some minor changes, everything just felt smoother and more fluid.I think the most notable change was the fact that combat would end when I had eliminated all of the enemies that I was currently engaging. This was a huge improvement over Shadowrun Returns, as it left me free to explore the map without having to move my entire party each round.StoryThe story is definitely of a much higher quality in this game. There were no notable writing errors, at least none that were so extreme as to break my immersion. Furthermore, the plot made sense. The twist at the end was indeed unexpected, but was completely believable. And the ending felt epic - I did not walk away going “What just happened?”, like I did with Shadowrun Returns.Why I hated itPerhaps this comes from playing the games back to back, but it really felt like more of the same. Sure, things were improved upon, but not so much as for it to feel like a new game.Also, I hate decking. Like, REALLY hate decking.Final RecommendationWorth playing. Take a break between the predecessor and this game, and it might feel more refreshing than it did to me.			"

												This is the 2nd Shadowrun game I've played, the first being Shadowrun Returns and I'm glad to say that the formula is the same, and it works well. I took just over 30 hours to complete this instalment but it was still pretty satisfying. My review here will comment on features as a standalone game as well as in comparison to Returns.Pros1. Good characterization of NPCs, nice turn-based combat system, unique and interesting soundtrack. 2. I think there's a wider variety of weapons here, including those that stun (guns and grenades)3. I like the artwork and the atmosphere of the game -- very post-apocalyptic and cyberpunkCons1. There are a few bugs -- sometimes things temporarily freeze in the Matrix; you can move the mouse but can't click anything. This is not a big deal, after a minute or so things return to normal.2. Inventory management hasn't changed since the first game, and can be pain when you'd like to distribute items to your fellow runners (you can't). It's not a bug but a design feature, so hopefully they'll change this in time.3. The storyline isn't really as compelling as Returns. There are some twists and turns but they aren't very natural and seem a little contrived. The German setting is interesting but future storylines could do with some improvement.True to Shadowrun, there is no voice acting. And there is a LOT of dialog. But I don't consider these Cons, just features that hearken back to classic RPG type days. Some like it, some don't, others are neutral.All in all, this was still very satisfying to play (especially when your runner is equipped with a minigun!) and as long as HBS keeps producing 'em, I'll keep playing 'em.7.0/10			"

												This game is really rich in story. Plus, the combat is good. You don't really see games that have both of those traits very often. I also don't use this line very often, but genuinely one of the best games I have ever played in my life. I hope the rest in the series are just as good.			"

												I thought Shadowrun Returns was good, but Shadowrun: Dragonfall is great.Seemingly minor additions like a core team of runners to choose from, loyalty missions and some freedom in the order and selection of side-missions make a surprisingly big difference; there are more opportunities for character development, and things feel less linear than they really are.The campaign is much improved, too -- twice as long, no goofy twists, consistently good writing and different branches leading to multiple endings.If you enjoyed the first game, you'll enjoy this one too.  If you are haven't played either, then jump straight to this one.			"

												An enjoyable and entertaining game. I made a point of playing an jerk type character, interested whether or not the writing was baby-banging-to-the-wall bad. It was not! I enjoyed picking on the troll and being a bit of a prick to everyone in a loving, shadowrunnery sort of way. Even to a dragon. There is a dragon in it! Hope I didn't spoil it for you. Back to the game: combat starts weird but gets enjoyable later on as your options open up. I was playing a rigger/decker, and I will most probably play this game again as a mage. Inventory management is utter ƨhite, and while not being able to manage your story-companion character's gear, it is quite understandable from the context: they are all running the shadows. No way some dwarf in cool shades can just fancy-prancy-magic-dancy into their hole - err, home - and tell them what to wear and what to kill people with. My biggest complaint would be the UI. I hope it got better in later titles, because not being able to manage inventory and seeing stats like HP on the same page is bad design. Also, the rotating between party members' inventories and character screens when trying to heal them outside of combat is just stupid too. It gets bearable once you get the logic of it, mind you there is little to it. Maybe there are mods for that? I have not checked, quite frankly.Story is good, interesting, lots of choices. It also taught me, as someone interested in game mastering shadowrun and other, a good lesson: always have mechanically different solutions to problems. As a rigger and decker, I had plenty opportunity to get around obstacles: make fights easier by turning automatic weaponry against their owners, hack matrix defences and get access to cameras thus avoiding conflict where unnecessary, as well as a lot of additional information during missions that would not have been available to me had I played a charismatic mage character. Though those can be deckers too! Though you pay with magical capabilities due to the essence loss associated with cyberware implants, but hey, make an interesting character, not one that is a cookie-cutter powerhouse. You are here to have fun, after all.Difficulty-wise, I played it on hard, had no issue. I would recommend playing on hard because if normal is any more easy, anyone who has played strategic games like this will be bored quick. Whenever I rewinded a mission, during which you cannot save so you have to start again, I did it to see different conversational choices' effects on the narrative. Some differed to greater degree than others.Overall, this is a good game. I do recommend it to folks, whether you like Shadowrun as a tabletop rpg, or not.			"

												I was highly skeptical that I’d enjoy this game, but I thought it wouldn’t be too bad to lose three dollars. I was pleasantly surprised with what I got out of it. I have skirted around old school computer role playing games (‘crpg’) for a while because of the preconceived notion that I would not in a million years be able to play these due to their older sensibilities and graphics. As soon as I booted it up I was one hundred percent there; Harebrained studios had that special something that was able to sink its hooks into me straight from the get go. What I got out of this game was a tactical combat system that was easy to pick up, characters that I cared about in a story that was intriguing, and ‘rpg’ mechanics that were solid.Story:When playing games today one usually expects the narrative to be told through fully voiced and animated characters but despite the lack of these, it remained completely engaging right up to the end. The entire story is told through text with no voice over, so the fact that I was fully engaged in the game was quite a surprise. The way they wrote the story made me want to keep going, uncovering the deeper plot and learning about the characters in my crew. There is a sense of mystery hidden behind each plot point and some of the characters, which produces the urge to discover and not just forget about the members in your team. All the characters are pretty well written with different problems that they have, and some which the player can help solve by means of side quests. Other characters just need somebody to talk to and the player can find out about them and uncover their mystery just by talking to them. The story and characters were just very well done.Gameplay:The narrative is supported by a pretty intuitive tactical combat system that is easy to learn but harder to master. It is turn based, with each character on your team given a certain amount of turns with which they can close distance between an enemy, find cover, attack, heal, use tools, and buff team mates. There are substances that can be taken to do various things to a character. Placement of characters is vital for surviving combat scenarios, especially due to the fact that longer range weapons become less effective at close range, while of course a shotgun  is ineffective at long range. Knowing when to use med kits and abilities optimally is also important. The game play loop is fun and thoughtful due to the varying roles of team members, the array of weapons, and progression in levelling up characters.World:The World is also an important component of the game. Although the scenery may be grimy and maybe not so aesthetically pleasing, it feels real, with the people in it having problems that can range from plumbing issues to more elaborate corporate schemes. The characters populating the cities really live there, and feel like they are actually a part of this cyberpunk Germany.  Even though it is outwardly stained and ugly, the good people populating the Kreuzbazar make it worth fighting for and exploring.Performance was rock solid at 60 FPS with my specs:8GB DDR3 RAMi5 2320 3.0GhzNvidia GTX 760 4GBFinal verdict:9/10			"

												Shadowrun Returns was a great game, and if you haven't played it yet, give it a try. But where the /real/ Shadowrun experience is lays solidly with Dragonfall. Everything about Returns has been tightened up, improved and and enhanced: the storyline is amazing, the companions are well fleshed out and interesting, and the improvements made in AI and HUD are great. With the improved AI, the turn-based action can be much harder than those who've never tried that style of play might anticipate, and on higher difficult levels it absolutely /demands/ the use of strategy to avoid death. The mood of the setting is done justice by the almost noir feel of the graphics that have a perfect cyberpunk feel, and the music is fantastic. Overall it's an incredibly solid RPG with good graphics, story and gameplay. If you like turn-based games it is well worth a try, and for any Shadowrun fan it's an ansolute must buy. 10 out of 10 in my book.			"

												Stands alone in the cyberpunk turn-based RPG market.  There are other games with similar themes, but there's nothing as good as Shadowrun: Dragonfall in terms of the finished product.-Incredible amount of character skins and specializations.  The experience is slightly different based on the race, class, and specialization of skills you choose.  My dwarf rigger uses totally different combat strategies than my human street-samaurai, and triggers different interactions with NPCs.-Excellent ambient soundtrack music and effects add suspense. -Better than average story blending magic, corporate espionage, and political intrigue in post-modern Berlin.-Variety of missions including data-theft, pickup-and-deliver, assassination, negotiation, and protection.-Optional objectives (side quests) between missions, or often within them.-Events become available (or unavailable), based on your choices in conversations and side quests.Usually your team is limited to 4 runners, but the combats never feel unbalanced since your team gains greater skills as you progress through the story.  Fans of other turn-based tactical RPGs like Ogre Battle, Fire Emblem, or Final Fantasy Tactics should probably own Shadowrun: Dragonfall.			"

												Isometric RPG in a weird German cyberpunk setting with decent turn-based combat, good implementation of the ruleset and an enjoyable storyline. You don't need to know the other games or the setting to enjoy this, but you do need to be prepared to read a bit.Solid 7.5-8/10 - the only real failing of this game is when you hit bugs, and you probably will at some point, so be warned.There are ample reviews of this game already, I'll include a few things I haven't seen mentioned much in the other ones.Writing:Cyberpunk setting, but don't you let that put you off - I'm not a fan of cyberpunk stuff, but the story holds my interest and the game is enjoyable anyway. Accessible, interesting and worth enjoying as a story in its own right.The writing is passable if not stunningly good, there is a fairly dry narrative style throughout but it is concise enough not to matter, and the actual story told is great. Story arcs are sane in structure, characters are ok, motivation is created to continue and there is nothing infuriating for the story junkie, assuming you can cope with the natural level of cheesiness you get in this kind of setting.RP:Dialogue *often* presupposes what the Player-Character's disposition will be towards a given NPC or event, offering a choice of different spins on the same thing that are obviously calculated to get different responses from the NPCs. As such, you won't be weaving a deep RP experience with your own character, picking to do the right or wrong thing, to love or hate this faction or that, throughout this game.So in terms of RP, slightly more of an adventure than an RPG - but really good enough to play anyway, and you do get to build your own char properly in the mechanical sense.Combat:Turn-based not pause and play, but isometric RPG combat is here and well-implemented, with various classes that cast/melee/use guns, positioning is important (flanking, cover, proximity) and you can cast your party members in different roles and get a ""game plan"" going on that leverages their strengths.There is a whiff of both XCOM and the infinity engine games about the combat, and although I can't promise you will enjoy Dragonfall's gameplay as much as either of those, it is fairly solid and holds up well if you are an old hand.Production values/aesthetics:The game is simple and perhaps inexpensive in art style and graphics, but is done in a way that looks and feels complete and consistent, neat and tidy - it will not make your eyes bleed. You may occasionally wince at the cheesiness of drawn/painted things, which have a whiff of fan art about them (the title screen being a great example) but I think this actually fits the cyberpunk aesthetic really well.Sound is OK to good, with a nice 80s sci fi feel to the music which is again quite in keeping with the game's setting and tone - but again will not rock your socks off or anything.Implementation of ruleset:Not an expert on this ruleset, but at face value this seems to be a satisfactory implementation in spirit, indeed quite good considering how light the game seems at first. You can build a character as you wish using one of the predefined classes, or create your own from scratch, and everything that should be there for the purposes of gameplay, seems to be there.Touch controls (for the very few people who are interested :) ):Obviously, mainly you will want to play this on a PC. With that said, should you switch to your Surface/other windows tablet for a relaxing session away from your PC, the game switches to touch controls and works excellently, which is a nice aspect of many top-down RPGS.It could do with a toggle for touch controls rather than detection, however, because streaming to a tablet (which is otherwise awesome) means no touch controls - as a mouse-driven game you have almost everything working fine except mouse drag clicks somewhere random when you stop dragging (which makes combat very difficult/unplayable). That said, isometric RPGers who do this probably already own Gestureworks - I uploaded a profile for Shadowrun: Dragonfall which just adds a pad for mouse drag, so if you grab that the game is *mostly* fine. For hover, I guess you can switch the game to ""double click"" in the settings, although I didn't really find this necessary.Bugs:This is the only real downfall of the game. There are bugs, you can trigger them easily, you will find them. It's not such a nightmarish bugfest that I would give it a thumbs down, but it feels pretty bad to experience problems during a long and difficult fight (you can't save during combat) and patches don't seem to be forthcoming - the game can be something of a nightmare if you get caught up in the worst of these bugs, so be warned.

												I bought this quite some time back and then quickly relegated it to the Buyer's Remorse pile. I'd thought it would be a real fun Shadow-Watch type game (although, yes, that game had plenty of issues) - but it was just too confusing to me to start and the game world seemed too boring. I got into my first combat on hard as recommended for veteran turn-based players, but promptly got wiped to pieces. six months later, it's christmas break. I finished witcher 3, and then dying light... so i decided i'd give dragonfall a spin again. this time, i wised up and chose normal mode... and I also completely abandoned any kind of min-maxing. I just decided to make a character that would swing a katana pretty decently, and then put plenty of points in things like intelligence and charisma so that I could say/do more things in dialogues than just yes/no/kill.well... it's 3am right now. i've been playing this for eight hours straight. yep, it's indeed very much fun, much more than shadow watch, and well written. theres little niggles like the mouse cursor is hard to place at times when too close to a character, but you just have to move it slowly and ... there it goes. some people complain that some battles are too long, but i disagree. i love the waves and waves of enemies. its always dissapointing when you make a good team and all you get are clowns that peter out in 5 minutes.i'd go as far as to say that if you like xcom but wish you could have more control over your guys... well, this is the game for you. fallout fans will like this, too (the original games).

												The Good:+ Similar mechanics as previous Shadowrun Returns. Allows you to just jump in and play if you have played that game.+ Interesting story that develops as the game goes and keeps you engaged.+ Forces you to make some tough decisions. I appreciate that in an RPG because it allows you to evolve and play your character. Give your play though and character depth.+ Game does not waste your time. No real unnecessary grinding. Play though took ~19 hours.+ Lots of interesting missions. + Good characters.+ Play the kind of character you want.+ Replay-ability. Missions have multiple ways to complete them. Also being forced to make some decisions it would be interesting to see how the game would possibly turn out if you played a different route.+ A better combat interface than Shadowrun Returns.The Bad:- I feel like even scaled up the text is generally smaller than I would like.- Still some wonky interface stuff. For example healing other team members in between combat.TLDR;It is a well crafted RPG that will not waste your time, and tell you a decent story. It is an improvement of previous games in the series. I would highly recommend it.			"

												Rating 7/10Overview: Turn Based Isometric RPGSimilar Games: Planescape Torment, Wasteland 2, Baldurs Gate.The Good:This game has everything you want in a cRPG. Great story, interesting characters and a fun combat system. Dialogue that varies depending on how you build your character that can alter different missions and change the outcome in multiple ways. Tons of weapons and spells that make combat fun and engaging. I also have a bias towards cyberpunk settings. If you love cRPGS and like turn based combat this is a game you may want to check out. The Bad:This also happens to be one of the most unstable games on Steam that I have ever played. Glitches, game will crash, save files will fail to load, hang-ups for a minute before you can play. Near the end, one mission makes it impossible to save or else you will corrupt the save file... These are not isolated instances, many others seem to be having the exact same problems and what worse the developer don't seem to big in a hurry to fix any of this. Conclusion:I could easily not recommend this game as many other have but the game itself is fantastic, of course, your enjoyment of the game depends on how much frustration you are willing to put up with. I say if you are a fan of the genre, jump in and enjoy the ride, everybody else should avoid this game until it becomes more stable.  "

												Much improved rules completely change the game.  Shadowrun Returns was total noob mode.  Just pile on the ranged combat skills and kill enemies whether they're behind cover or not.  This game makes combat more punishing but not so much that you'll be reloading every fight.  I don't think I've ever even died once yet.Game is easy, but the dialogue is well written.  This version of Shadowrun easily has the most fights with the most enemies compared to Returns or Hong Kong, but the increased difficulty is minimal.Missions are the longest here, but the game is less linear.  They're only less linear when you count the fact that you can take missions in any order you please, though.  Given that you get karma during and after missions, missions you take after the other ones become easier until you hit a milestone in the story and take on missions like Bloodlines and MKVI.Overall I'd say this game is deserving of its metascore, with a replay value of about 140 hours for me.  I was trying out multiple builds, though, and running through the same story just to fight with different styles doesn't really improve replay value as much as you'd think.  It would be better if there were much more different playstyles than simply ""you can skip combat if you have lots of charisma"" and ""combat is easier if you don't invest in charisma unless you're a shaman.""

												*6hrs+So just to update at the 6hr+ mark game has gotten even better. First mission area is fun location with some nice challenging battles, optional quests and loot to be had. The squad also has a levelling system akin to XCOM / Mass Effect (2 choices per level) and that fabled tactical option of overwatch 'is' indeed there, sweet! Bear in mind that much is hidden / locked until you progress at the start and that can take a while if your chatting to all NPCs & reading computer screens etc. But for me again thus far, great squad-based tactical rpg!*First impressions (< 2hrs):Just under 2hrs but first impressions, this is as good as the latest xcom for me, more reading required as there isn't any voice acting to speak of but the writing thus far is very detailed and quite sublime setting up the scenes and situations perfectly.Visuals are nice and stylized fitting the cyber punk theme pefectly that also matches the awesome sounds & music.All I'm looking for now is my favourite option in my turn-based tactical strategy games, overwatch (or attack on move), I hope it's there but there are many, many upgrade options and skills already available so it shouldn't prove a problem otherwise.

												Not perfect, but good.The Shadowrun series is a bit of a mixed bag for me. Neither the first nor this one has really produced a gripping story. Combat options are limited. I HATE HATE HATE the hacking sequences. There are a lot of flaws in this series.Yet I play these and have a great time with them. The exploration is good. The world of Shadowrun is so compelling that you just have to see what's around the next corner. The art style is simply one of my favorites in any game, ever.  The gameplay is cool - you will not have the skills to solve every issue and you have to learn how to deal with it. That might be maddening to some, but it makes it all the sweeter when you do have the right skills to take advantage of the situation.Plus, the dev is awesome. Not only do they release a good game at release, but they've gone in and added real content as a ""thank you"" to their customers. Who else really does this? Which is why I backed their latest kickstarter.This won't be your GOTY, but you will get 20 hours or so of great enjoyment from it if you like the subject matter. Plus you're supporting one of the ""good guys"" in gaming development.Now that is all said, let's talk about Drgonfall. Shadowrun Dragonfall is the highlight of the series. With very similar gameplay mechanics between the three different games n this series it boils down to which game has the best and most comprehensive story. Dragonfall's story is - IMO - the most memorable of the bunch. It's interesting, it's complex and it's there are some very good NPC characters in this game world. It's not the most brilliantly written RPG but Dragonfall is above average (while the other two are fairly average). Combat options have been improved from the first game and the Director's Cut additions do a much-needed job of fleshing out the game world. Thus I recommend this to RPG fans. If you're going to play all 3 Shadowrun games then I suggest you do so in order they were released. If you're going to buy just one, this is the one to buy.			"

												If you played Shadowrun returns and want more action, then this game is for you. Improving on the original, Dragonfall: Director's Cut starts you off with a simple milk-run gone wrong. Now you gotta find who did it while haggling jobs from clients. This game is where Shadowrun started to cement my love for the franchise. The game itself improves on many of Returns's problems, and vastly overhauls the game to being something else entirely. I never tried the vanilla version, but this game feels better than whatever it was. The team you run with are all unique and fun, diverse and exciting are their personal quests, and the rewards from them help you in the game in the long run. The addition of leveling your character and party up vastly makes this one of my favorites, as you cna customize anyone to your heart's desire.The locales and the world are beautifully rendered and a fun to blitz through, and I loved the many choices at the end to wrap it up, even if the ending itself was a bit weak given all you did. but hey, that's the price when you run in the shadows. Still, it's a fun game nonetheless.			"

Dragonfall has completely blown me away. Relatable characters, good runs (both short and long), and wonderful atmosphere. Visuals are adequate and do a good job of sucking you in after a couple of hours. Music is haunting and perfectly syncs with the environment. Highly recommended. Cannot wait for the brilliant mods!

												After spending around 40 hours of pretty tight game time it all comes to this - Shadowrun, what can I say? First of all I must say that knowledge of the shadowrun universe is hardly limited due to the fact that in soviet Russia RP games played you! Actually it's because the RP base isn't as developed as in US or EU. Most of the knowledge of Shadowrun's universe came from watching Spoony Experiment videos on shadowrun. It sounded like fun and when Dragonfall popped up on sale — I took my bet into playing it. I'd say it's worth the money.The idea, the look, the type of game play — it hooked me up, I like those type of games. The techno&magic mix made me go nostalgia about Arcanum... what a treat that was... I most likely will be comparing those two in the review quite a few times.Anyway, you play as a shadowrunner, a person doing jobs, or should I even say ""shady"" jobs, hoho, for the profits! Yeah, that's about it actually. Yes, you're just a ""mercenary"" going to do jobs to profit from. Killing, hacking, sabotaging, blowing sheit up — you name it. And you don't work alone, you got a bunch of fellow shadowrunners at your side helping you out. I assume that can go out solo by not picking any mates on the mission screen but the mechanics of the game don't have stealth elements in it, so you'll just end up eating a bullet in the end anyway. So your first mission is to break into an old estate of some guy. Simple enough. You go in, rumble around and... sheits get real! Yeah, you don't fool around in here. Sheit gets real fast and you need to work your way through up till the end. Not going to spoil more so let's go more into technical stuff:1)The graphics are ok. I mean it looks like neverwinter in future (no surprise) so you shouldn't be expecting hotzors 3d female forms popping out on you and having blast process of your nvid cards blow your mind. You're not here for the graphics. Good games don't need graphics (they do actually, ""cough"").2)The skills and rp elements are where they are. You get a big tree of skills which helps your character to go through his hardships of shadowrunning. Be that gunfight, hacking, casting spells — it's all here for you. Want to be a ninja with a sword and a rifle - sure thing. A pro-hacking mage — not a problem. Want to be a dwarf that hits people in the shins — go right ahead, do it! There are a bunch of races to pick from: dwarfs, humans, elfs, trolls... I assume it just gives partial boost to stats and limits to your skill tree. Just pick an elf and you can be good at pretty much everything! You even get to choose the skills of your fellow group runners, but the choices are quite limited. Actually they are limited to just 2. Yeah, bummer.3)Action. Well, this where the game takes a moderate blow. Your acting on the field is pretty limited. You just walk around, point and click stuff to work/pick up and when enemies pop up you go into the attack mode which did disappoint me. The combat is turn based which provides each of the character with limited amount of action points. That is 2 for most of the game and 3 at the end of it. Those can be boost by certain items for a period of round, but it's not a big thing. It all falls down to finding the biggest rock/table/cover on the screen, get behind it and start shooting. Going out with your fists and swords is possible as well, which actually isn't such a bad choice, but I dismissed the idea of becoming  a bullet-cushion. To spice the combat a bit there where added a few things to mage it a tad more interesting, like leylines for the casters (specific points on the map which glow and add some bonuses to casting) and explosive barrels (which there aren't a whole lot throughout the game, but hey, I guess it would look even more rtarded if the goons where hanging around explosive materials. There can also be found some turrets which can be hacked to from certain terminals, but they aren't all that groundbreaking. The hacking UI is pretty similar to the combat one, except that you're limited to specific ""program"" actions that you buy and the linear maps are even more linear. Not much to say about that, except that getting killed in the virtual land just makes your eyes bleed a little, not killing you on the spot (most of the times). Controls aren't spectacular. Misclicking is sometimes a point of frustration, when it leads to cancel your attack action forcing your az out of cover up to your enemies face. For the weapon selected you have a bunch of skills to use (depending on how you level them) which consume different amount of action points and ammo. Yeah, while you have ammo, you don't have its count, as in - you don't need to buy it. It's stocked up so you just need to reload your gun when you need to, spending a point or two to do so. Mana for the casters doesn't seem to be running out as well. You just get counters on your skills and magic which usually takes about 1-2 rounds of cool down. The first thing in combat I went to was my numpad. In Arcanum you could pick the part of the body to make your attack to but in here... no, you can't do that. It could've added possibilities though, as in — shoot the gun/arm of the foe and then talk some sense into him... but nope, murder that fker! There's also no stealth element in here. No crouching, getting past people, etc. At a certain mission you'll try to go past a patrolling guard without detection, but most likely you'll fail a few times like me, crossing out stealth completely.While not on the missions you get to hang around a sector of town named Kreuzbasar. It got all ya need — weapons, hacking tools, medical supplies, magic, all natural coffee. I should note though, that the stocks are rather poor. There isn't much of variation on guns, spells or other tools. It's just a item with a level 1 at start and later items and spells of 2 and 3rd levels. You also get to have some robo and bio implants injected into your body, but there isn't a big variety of those as well and you'll need quite the coin to get jacked all over with those. Not to mention that they decrease your ""humanity"" points or w/e, which decreases the amount of spell-slots of yours. 4)Socials. As an RP game about 30-40% of the game you'll be talking. Talking to people, machines, your dog, etc. Same to interactions with terminals and computers. You get certain lines of dialog each time which are fun to read and decide on whether you're a good guy, ok guy, not care a lot guy or an azhole. The responses will come out in the similar line to your dialog options. There are a few specific lines that pop up from time to time and if you have the required skills (charisma, decking, etc...) — you can pick those. They mostly just give additional options of solving your verbal problems together with giving some neat text to read and a few karma (skill) points.5)Characters. The game actually works a bit strange with that. You have a set of runners with you, ones that are close colleagues of yours and others hired for cash. But picking certain classes as your own to play, such as a caster or decker makes certain chars obsolete. You can only go in a set of 4 to runs but for some reason the absent member of your crew seem to have a dialog later of how difficult it was doing this or that, how good you where on a mission and stuff. Creepy. Or lazy? The socials in your crew aren't really gained, in the end you still can talk everyone up to their best and get their special missions. At certain point you it ruins the feel of completing stuff for them. 6)Overall. The game is satisfying, but leaves a feel that it's raw. The potential of such game is huge, like that of Arcanum, but this one is shallow. I do though understand that this one is just a start for the setting. At some point I hope that it will stand up to Arcanum standards, will turn from an enthusiast based table game into an epic adventure. Right now it's a onetime game.			"

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall was an excellent expansion to an imperfect game, and the directors cut edition fixes many of my issues with the base game, such as the UI and lack of good side quests. Understand that this is not a game like Skyrim or Wasteland. There is no expansive overworld, but the detail that goes into each area is immense and more than compensates for the lack of choice and the linearity of the story. This should not be a mark against the game however, as it is under no illusions that it is an open world game, and the linearity works very well and allows the developers to tell an intriging story that could only come out of the Shadowrun universe.

												I Kickstarted Shadowrun Returns and waited impatiently while it was developed. When it launched I was satisfied, but not delighted. It was a good game and I was not unhappy I had funded it, but the story failed to grip me. Reviews were in the 70s and I felt that was about right.Then, Dragonfall happened and I wasn't delighted, but ecstatic. This is an AMAZING game. All that was good with the original was kept and improved, but this time around the story was first rate. I kept playing and playing longer than intended just to see what happened next. Here I disagree with reviews as they were 80s, and I'd say this game is a 90 minimum.I was one of many who encouraged HBS to release it as standalone, because I felt that if someone were to buy in to Shadowrun, this would be the campaign to do it on. Well they listened, and here it is.If you like RPGs, you owe it to yourself to own this one. The story is top notch, the art style is gorgeous, the music is superb, and the mechanics are solid. I cannot recommend it enough.			"

												Like cyberpunk? Like turn-based combat? Then you will probably love this game. The narrative is interesting and resonates with themes of friendship and especially trust, which is a vital aspect of Shadowrun if you want to have more than just ""dungeon hacking"" in the future. It helps a lot that the project is led by Jordan Weisman, creator of the (tabletop) Shadowrun RPG.For those who have played Dragonfall as an expansion to the base game, this standalone version includes some new side missions and the possibility to customize the progression of the main NPCs. The combat interface has also been modified to present your tactical options more clearly (although I miss the Fallout-esque version from the base game...)			"

												Now that Dragonfall is standalone, we're all better off for it. Shadowrun Returns was a fair effort to revive a great IP. Dragonfall is the real game.And what a game it is. Characters feel real, like they've been lived in for a while, not just plopped all one-dimensional and tabula rasa into the story. They have motivations, interesting origins, disagreements, and so on. They feel like actual people. And those people breathe life into the story -- a conspiracy yarn full of magic, intrigue, and high-tech low-lives. Choices are difficult. There's often a clear division between the morally right and wrong choices, but the consequences muddy it up. Is it better to spare some schlub for the sake of conscience if missing a payday means you can't stop far greater evil down the line?Combat is kind of a stripped-down X-Com affair with turnbased isometric squad stuff. It's serviceable, but the real treat is the writing.			"

												Originally made available as paid downloadable content Dragonfall is an all new story campaign, set in a new city with no connection to 'Dead Man's Switch,' the campaign initially released with Shadowrun Returns. In Dragonall, you'll create an all new shadowrunner to play with, but for all intents and purposes, he or she might as well be the same character with reset statistics, as his or her role in the story is that of an expat whose cut all ties to Seattle, the capital of Shadowrun, and relocated to Berlin.Two things are immediately apparent when you start up Dragonfall: First, there is an all new save system that lets you save anywhere, replacing the checkpoint-based autosave that was a source of frustration. This really opens up the experience, letting you save your game before trying out new gear and letting you rewind in case you make the mistake of going into combat without a medic or a spellcaster.Second, the writing is just plain better. While 'Dead Man 's Switch' isn't a bunch of chicken scrawl, it did suffer from taking a stab at too many plot threads with barely the resolve to bring them all together. Dragonfall is simply better paced and there's a greater sense of texture to the world, and not just because of the seeming foreignness of Berlin. Dragonfall evokes a world still dealing with the lingering memory of recent catastrophes and the ominpresent political, racial and economic tensions that threaten to damn it.Characters in 'Dead Man 's Switch' tended to wear their hearts on their sleeve; you make them for who they are pretty early on. Greater attention and care has gone into presenting characters, whether it's the cantankerous Turkish coffee shop owner who also manages free wi-fi throughout the district or the race rights activist collecting charitable donations across the street. Each one has an interesting story to tell, but they won't always share it just because you ask.The sense that every individual has layers to them is best exemplified by your crew. You inherit leadership of the group after what was originally thought to have been a milk run goes wrong. That means that although they are mostly strangers to you, they have all the group dynamics and deep histories of a pack of veterans. Eiger, the argumentative but honest ex-military sniper who serves on your crew, will bite back if you try to boss your way into authority. But try to hard in making nice with her and she will see through you and question your sincerity. Dragonfall also presents a larger and more liberating cyberpunk playground to work with. 'Dead Man's Switch' placed the entire plot on rails, including your trip back and forth to your base of operations, and effectively dictated the pace of the entire experience.  For the majority of Dragonfall, your goal is to raise the capital to acquire the services of a highly secretive and extremely powerful information broker. Effectively speaking, that makes the middle third of the game is about going on missions to bank the money you need to keep the 'big arc' going. That doesn't mean that Dragonfall is an open world sandbox in the mold of Skyrim and Fallout: New Vegas. Rather, Dragonfall lets the 'big arc' get out of the way in order to focus on what it is like to be a shadowrunner. You get to sink your teeth into that mean streets vibe, dealing with clients of less than honorable intent and treading cautiously in missions where complications are guaranteed. The city of Berlin isn't just a linear series of shoot outs, but a loosely connected collection of adventures centering around your safehouse in the Kreuzbasar neighborhood.Dragonfall still has its problems, though most of them are born out of the restrictions of Shadowrun Returns itself. Precise positioning during combat is still tricky, and for all the color and detail to the maps, they serve solely as wallpaper for colorful reams of descriptive text. That being said, Dragonfall is the campaign that Shadowrun Returns should have shipped with, as it realizes the richness of the setting even as it threatens to be constricted by the mechanical and aesthetic limitations of the Shadowrun engine itself. It simply makes a stronger case for the Shadowrun universe.			"

												This game IS shadowrun. It just is. Never mind adherence to pen and paper rules (which this only loosely sticks to), this ""feels"" closer to it's pnp source in concept and execution than any other computer version of it I've played. It is extremely well and atmospherically written, it is beautifully designed... the only thing I wish it had was a true sandbox mode - but never fear, because Shadowrun Unlimited, a UGC pack using the resources of Dragonfall, shows amazing promise as long as it continues to be developed by the very talented author. Seriously - if you liked Shadowrun... buy this game. If you like cyberpunk worlds, buy this game. If you hate turn based CRPGs... ok you shouldn't buy this game. But other than that, for such a low price I think you'll be hard pressed to find much better value in any single player game, anywhere.			"

												Wow. Just WOW. Best Tactical RPG I've played since Final Fantasy Tactics. Phenomenal storyline with appropriate Shadowrun-y twists and turns. The magic system places magic users as capable of high spikes of damage and support. The plethora of guns allows a shooter to provide battlefield control as well as a more consistent damage output. Melee weapons offer the bonus of allowing you to move and attack with the use of just 1 action point. Deckers are better played and balanced here than in the actual pen-paper game I STILL play. (as of 4e)Riggers and Shamanic summoners bring their own guns or spells to the table, along with their support crew which can be supporters, damage dealers, or tanks themselves.

												I was... basically happy with Dead Man's Switch, the original campaign of Shadowrun Returns.I really enjoyed Dragonfall when it was released as DLC. The story was way better, everything felt more polished and finished, and it scratched a Shadowrun wargaming  itch I've had ever since picking up the Shadowrun DMZ box set many years ago. I always had trouble persuading people to try out DMZ because it's a complicated setting with a lot of tactical possibilities and the rules involve quite a lot of random number generation and book-keeping, the kind of thing that's really more suited to some kind of mechanical calculator..Anyway, this is an updated version of Shadowrun Dragonfall with a much better engine, loads of cool new gear, NPCs and sidequests. You can finally choose how to upgrade your party and resolve their personal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t side-missions. There's a new UI. The story and setting are still satisfyingly Shadowrun.On the whole it was well worth the zero pounds sterling the upgrade cost me. If you also got it for free (seriously, you should check) then I would recommend playing it. Otherwise you might even want to buy it, if you enjoy nerding it up with the Shadowrun setting and tactical wargaming as much as I do.			"

												One of the game i definitely find worth buying. Universe of Shadowrun is quite interesting itself and developers managed to create game to stand for expectation, even if it's not about complete transfer of all attributes of original setting. Even after completing original DLC i dived into game for 10h without noticing time passing by. Improved effects, UI, additional missions, gear, spells, implants makes this game even more versatile in terms of replayability. Alot of angles to see and interact this world from: hack door or break wall, see aura aspects of persons and alot of other ways to find solution to some situations.Game's plot can draw you from real world easily. Playing shadowrunner you must live as shadowrunner, doing variety of  jobs, quite much of which will put you dilemma: be professional and complete job as your client desire or do as your heart and morale tells you. Some people might find lack of full control of partymates' development as negative side, but it makes game even more interesting.If you like turn-based games with alot skill choices and cyberpunk and dont mind having magic all around - this game is for you. Perhaps graphics is not as most people will prefer - it's not a cutting edge 4k resolution realistic one, but it's solid and even better than			"

The UI has been cleaned up and simplified, and it was overall a much smoother experience. There are still odd bugs, such as the game taking an inordinate amount of time (30 seconds or longer) to decide that I had, in fact, killed all of the enemies, and combat was, in fact over, or a random NPC's dialogue tree starting over from the beginning as if I had never met her, but it was uncommon and not game-breaking.

												It's a shame that Dragonfall wasn't the original campaign for Shadowrun Returns instead of Dead Man's Switch, because this is truly one of the most engaging and enjoyable gaming experiences I've had in recent memory.  While I enjoyed DMS, it always felt like it was missing something to me.  Thankfully, Dragonfall seems to have found that certain something, because this game is something special.  I haven't enjoyed a CRPG this much since Baldur's Gate II rocked my world.Dragonfall's story is one of the best that gaming has to offer.  The plot was engaging and the members of your team were genuinely entertaining, well-realized characters.  I found myself truly interested in their side stories, and interacting with them became one of the high points of the game.  There were several moments throughout the game that brought a smile to my face (such as, and these are very minor spoilers so be warned, the triumphant re-apperance of a previously bit character, or one particular NPC's fascination with bad TV paying off in a big way).  These little touches served to underscore for me just how much I was enjoying myself as I played.Mechanically, the changes to the combat system and UI with the Director's Cut have finally brought Shadowrun Returns' systems in line with contemporary turn-based tactical games such as XCOM: EU and the Banner Saga.  Given a similar revamp (or at least a much needed injection of oomph) is the dialogue system.  Unlike DMS, spending your karma to beef up combat skills no longer feels like the be-all-end-all choice.  Rounding out lesser used attributes often results in unlocking new dialogue options, rewarding you with extra karma and gear, as well as increased insights into the lore (many of which come into play much later in the game as additional dialogue options).If you were left feeling lukewarm after DMS and are itching for something more, give Dragonfall a try.  If you're a fan of turn-based tactical combat, give Dragonfall a try.  If you love these sorts of ""old school"" CRPGs, give Dragonfall a try.Seriously, just give this game a try.			"

												The Kickstarter stretch goal DLC now as standalone game and it's great! I didn't even have to pay for it, nor did anyone who had the DLC prior to the release. The already good storyline is expanded with extra missions and endings to give it more depth. The engine and interface has little tweaks here and there. Maybe this is not quite Shadowrun Returns 1.5, but at least 1.35. As with SRR, user generated content can be expected to give longevity to this product. Most of the creators will probably come over to this version. Even without the UGC, the official campaign has enough choices and consequences and possibilities to do things differently for good replayability. It's not so linear as DMS was.As of the writing of this review there is still some, mostly minor, bugs, but I expect Harebrained Shcemes to fix them eventually. They seem to be getting the hang of this CRPG business. Now put the experience to use and move on to the SR2, HBS. The rules system is OK, but could use some more depth.			"

Still, some choices and upgrades when it comes to weapons/armor/spells.-An objective-based XP system (you don't have to worry about getting XP from killing baddies, and there are many interesting ways to get around combat that yield the same reward.-Many missions that are concise, interesting, and never feel too long.All of the substance:-A thematically interesting hub connecting all other missions, loaded with NPCs with backstories that reveal over the course of the game, and sometimes reflect the choices you've made.-Backstory and missions for all the guys in your team-Some branching over decisions that have an interesting impact in the world, but at the same time don't feel forced, don't make you overthink things or feel that you've ruined the timeline. There aren't obvious 'right' or 'wrong' choices.-Lots of ways to solve each problem. For example, there's a room full of baddies, you can tamper with the vent system and fill it with poison gas, hack a door that opens a path around them, or walk in and kill everyone.All in all, it feels deep, but not overwhelming; it has complexity in the right places, but tries to keep it simple everywhere else. Many, relatively short missions which all feel different. Good game.			"

Still, some choices and upgrades when it comes to weapons/armor/spells.-An objective-based XP system (you don't have to worry about getting XP from killing baddies, and there are many interesting ways to get around combat that yield the same reward.-Many missions that are concise, interesting, and never feel too long.All of the substance:-A thematically interesting hub connecting all other missions, loaded with NPCs with backstories that reveal over the course of the game, and sometimes reflect the choices you've made.-Backstory and missions for all the guys in your team-Some branching over decisions that have an interesting impact in the world, but at the same time don't feel forced, don't make you overthink things or feel that you've ruined the timeline. There aren't obvious 'right' or 'wrong' choices.-Lots of ways to solve each problem. For example, there's a room full of baddies, you can tamper with the vent system and fill it with poison gas, hack a door that opens a path around them, or walk in and kill everyone.All in all, it feels deep, but not overwhelming; it has complexity in the right places, but tries to keep it simple everywhere else. Many, relatively short missions which all feel different. Good game.			"

												Amazing game. An absolute gem in turn based RPG genre. And to think I got it for nearly nothing in a Humble Bundle. Good story. Interesting characters. Deep combat. Originality. What flaws could be mentioned? Well, art style can look a bit unattractive at first glance. Some game design decisions can be a bit confusing at first, for instance the things to do in Matrix or the fact you don't get gear for all the team like in other games, but can loan team members a weapon or consumables for the mission. All things considered, this is one of the best RPGs I've ever played and I don't say that lightly.			"

												Take XCOM, remove the base building and add a meaty story and long, well written dialogues and text. Change the setting from alien invasion to Cyberpunk, Bladerunner style visuals and you have yourself Shadowrun: Dragonfall.I didn't play any other Shadowrun games before but I didn't feel like stanger at all.+ Good visuals.+ Good music.+ Very good story and writing, rare these days.+ Good combat mechanics.+ Overall good RPG experiance.- No voice acting. Not a bad thing imo.- Lots of reading, again it's actually a good thing but not everyone will like it.Get it if you like old Fallout, XCOM and other such turnbased RPGs.			"

The shadowrunner up of turn-based RPGs.As turn-based RPGs go, the Shadowrun series from Harebrained Schemes has consistently proven to be ""jack of all trades, master of none.""  Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut is no exception to this rule - however, while underwhelming, it still pulls off a very enjoyable cyberpunk adventure and deserves a playthrough or two.Yes, the game includes character development, an involved plot & a detailed cyberpunk setting.  It isn't the best example of these things, though.  Yes, the game features RPG progression & tactical turn-based combat, but it is soundly beaten in both departments by other games in the turn-based world (particularly concerning combat, the XCOM series is superior).  This is the series that has it all, but doesn't quite do it well enough to knock your socks off.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's just how it is.  In fact it seems like every successive title from Harebrained Schemes - from Shadowrun Returns to Shadowrun: Hong Kong - gets better & better.With the Director's Cut, at first I expected a glorified expansion to what was a tragically brief & sparse campaign in Shadowrun Returns.  The question of whether this could stand on its own legs as a full game was decisively answered in the affirmative.  The campaign has enough content and detail to qualify as a standalone.  Improvements across the board, to engine, combat, progression and creative aspects are welcome & give me hope for the future of this developer.  Difficulty settings range from Easy to Very Hard; I did my first playthrough on Normal & only got caught up on one fight, which I was able to finish after retrying.  Even the final encounter of the game was of little challenge on Normal.  Hard seems the appropriate setting for most players to start with.Credit where it's due, this is a highly enjoyable scifi cyberpunk setting with unique lore that blends Fantasy with Scifi & offers a distinctive narrative style.  The writing for plot, dialogue & more remain sort of simple & cumbersome as in its predecessor, but that's not to say I didn't enjoy most of the experience.I do like the RPG system in this series.  Race, class, attributes, skills, abilities, gear, cyberware & essence - all this enables fun character builds.  The progression system makes point distribution & other choices meaningful.  Design seems to prioritize familiarity & accessibility (read: simplicity) over depth (complexity).  It works out okay - it's nice to know that (as long as you've got a clear archetype in mind) your best choice for upgrades is immediate & obvious, at all times.As with its predecessor, Shadowrun: Dragonfall suffers from a slowing of pace that renders the campaign a bit tedious to get through.  This is an issue inside & outside of combat.  Turns take long than they should.  Everything from the menu & user interface navigation to movement & interacting with NPCs/objects just feels a bit slow.  Fans of turn-based genre may or may not mind any of this, but it's worth noting this kind of problem is frequently cited as what turns other gamers off of turn-based RPGs.  Further slowing progress is a narrative heavy on dialogue & description (which I would be all for, except that as I said the writing is often mediocre).Piggybacking on this problem of the game being too slow, there are a few occasions of what must be either design oversights or bugs:  Occasionally combat doesn't end after your group eliminates the last visible opponent, presumably because it's scripted to be a running gunfight situation or because other enemy npcs are present nearby but outside your line of sight.  Moving party members individually, especially if advancing carefully, using overwatch, keeping buffs up, etcetera..gets tedious after several turns with no action whatsoever.  Sometimes enemy AI is clearly confused or caught up on some unknown issue, because enemy turns will last far longer than usual, forcing the player to either reload the game or sit and hopefully see resolution to the turn.  This is frequent enough to be a real annoyance; it's especially likely to happen while a decker is jacked into the matrix.The campaign editor that famously released with Shadowrun Returns is also available here & appears to be a robust tool for modders.  I haven't taken the time or effort to learn it & thus can't comment on it.  I can comment on the player made content using the editor, which includes a few decent story driven campaigns.  That's what I search for & they're there, but few & far between.By no means should my criticisms turn you off of this game, especially if you're a fan of the genre & of cyberpunk.  It's enjoyable & can be had very, very cheaply during Steam sales.  Thumbs up review, definitely worth a playthrough!TIP: Remember the player character's Essence score cannot go below 1, & that's after any cyberware enhancements, so plan accordingly.  New upgrades costing either more or less essence will become available as the main campaign story progresses, & additionally after certain side missions are completed.			"

												Worth every nuyen; more addictive than BTLs. If you're looking for a stellar RPG to jack into & spend a little time out of meat-space, this gem should be high on your list. Where to begin...In debating whether it deserves a space right next to the likes of Planescape, Arcanum or Fallout, I decided Dragonfall DC was a more conservative understudy. It may lack the sheer unrivalled scope of the classics, but what it does, it does exceedingly well; Harebrained are to be lauded for delivering a tight experience that never really drags or feels out of place. I know someone has built a good RPG when I actually find myself caught up in the story, caring about characters, feeling elation at successes and dread at revelations.In inevitable comparison to its predecessor, Shadowrun Returns, Dragonfall exceeds it in every way. A better story, more interesting characters, actual character development (particularly your team), and a real investment in dialogue checks & mission branches all come together to give a much more rounded, fulfilling experience. Rather than a sequence of linear missions strung together by plot, Dragonfall's story has multiple interlaced arcs, multi-faceted NPCs, and a real sense of a living breathing world just around the corner. We need more thinking-person mature RPGs of this kind.The overall design screams 'replay me'; it's practically impossible to experience all the story, all of the branches, in a single run, and that ignores the huge range of personal character options one can experiment with. When you factor in the pricing and origin of the game, Dragonfall really puts a lot of AAA developers & publishers to shame. A superb example of a relatively simple story & background, told well, with a lot of depth put into the underlying design. A special mention goes to the soundtrack, which is included in the game purchase and for my ears is absolutely wonderful.In trying to write negatives, I found myself mainly just wanting more from the game & its world. As an RPG, it's a focused experience - you don't get many interactions or much opportunity to explore the vast cyberpunk world. Said world is mostly hidden, hinted at, lost in the shadows, and I found myself occasionally yearning for a more traditional RPG-style opportunity to meet new people and steal from/for them. There were points where I felt the game was driving me towards particular approaches without a wider context for them or a real reason other than 'make the game world more alive' - for example, there is such an obvious drive towards the player being unnecessarily charitable in certain dialogue that it might as well have 'plot point - will matter later' written in mile-high letters. An RPG with broader scope would conceal this better by allowing for many more interactions that may or may not actually matter in the grand scheme of things.Dragonfall's focused style works well because of the urgency of the plot, but I could easily see a much larger game rising from its ashes, with factions, honour, politics and allegiances woven around a broader game world with wider consequences & more of the R in RPG. One can only hope. Until then, this is a must-play for any RPG fan.			"

												Very fun turn-based game.Loved the stories, you also get to make choices that impact outcomes.Couldn't stop playing it, just had to finish it type of game.However, I didn't find playing it again as fun as it was first time around even though there are a variety of classes to play.I did play both the original and the sequel, both have great stories.Looking forward to playing Shadowrun: Hong Kong.

												I am a long time player of tabletop RPGs and tactical RPGs and I must say that I loved this game. I just finished the game for the first time in Hard difficulty and I plan on playing it again in the highest difficulty next. The game is the second in a serie of (currently 3) but I feel like the stories are disconnected so you probably can play them in any order.The story is great and well set in the shadowrun universe. Characters are well written with a deeper and often darker aspect to discover. The storyline is not too complex to follow but complex enough to enjoy.The battles in the game know how to be stressful. Many of the ""fights"" are very well scripted with multiple actions to take in sequence that increase pressure on you. For instance there is a battle where you need to press two switching in two rooms in the real world while your decker has to open the way for you from the matrix. The game knows how to keep you on edge.Graphics are nothing too fancy but perfectly integrated in the style of the game. Though I played on a not so good for gaming laptop and had to set graphics setting low.The main issues I had with this game are linked to the UI. It can be very frustrating at times. Here are a few things I found annoying in the interface. I'll detail that because I hope the developpers will read this and do what they can in future versions. I give a fairly long list but that is mostly to the developpers benefit. The game is good !-The combat rules are somewhat kept unknown. It is not clear to me what each statistic is doing or what some of the acronym stand for. A particular instance: Some weapon have a Ar-P statistic which I guess stands for Armor Piercing. When using it some of the armor points of the enemy unit blinks but seem to come back in the same round. I guess Armor Piercing is different from Armor Striping but making it clear would be nice. In the current form Armor seems to be a typical DR (damage reduction) and it is not clear to me that there is a real difference in practice between +3 Ar-P and +3 DMG.-the UI can be very hard to read for me. Maybe it is becuase I am color blind but the overlays in same tone can be quite hard to read. In particular, the techniques icon in the matrix often features white writing on white background and the cooldown of a not yet used technique can be hard to read.-the HP of an enemy can be very hard to read because its health bar is essentially hovering over the units head but whatever is behind that unit can make it hard to read. Even pointing to the unit does not really help: more information appear in  box that is transparent and depending on what is behind the text might be very hard to read. It could be fixed by giving a setting for the opacity of these infobox.-It is sometimes hard to understand what an action will do some actions might require you to move first but the ""trajectory line"" is small so you might not realize your character will have to move to accomplish this action. In comparison in FireEmblem, a (too) heavy line will show you the path your character will take.-Some attacks can damage neighbooring  unit (shotguns, miniguns, glory's closecombat), it would be good if the units potentially in the line of fire could be indicated. especially the shotgun widespread shot can be fairly hard to predict.-It can be very hard to point to some tiles in the game. Trying to move 4 characters on a 2x2 area is very difficult because you keep on pointing to one of the character.-When healing outside of combat, I find it annoying that I can not see who has inventory and who needs healing. A simple tweak would be to display a ""currentHP""/""maxHP"" information next to the character's name in the ""who to heal"" dialog. -In terms of gameplay, some things were annoying as well. You can not give an ally an item once the mission has started. I ended up in ridiculous situations where the leaders inventory was full but Glory's inventory was empty and when finding an item I had to send it to the stash.-It would be good if some action (reload in particular) could span between two rounds. Often with the apex' drone shooting costs 2AP and reloading costs 2AP but the drone only has 3 AP. I'd like to be able to fire, start reloading and pay -1AP next round to complete reloading.			"

												One of the best RPGs in recent years, that holds a special place in my heart.First. What do you get, when you call your mutant hellhound while subconsciously scratching right below the smartlink implant to steady the aim of your pistol, which shoots shotgun rounds, activating you spirit guide for a movement buff while your at it - to assist the female former special ops member in your party - who is also a troll? Hint. Asking the Dragonslayer shaman behind her wont get you much closer to the answer, but most likely make you chuckle at his response. He was the lead singer in a band once...If you haven't deduced it yet - the setting is superb. The characters well written. The story meaningful and gripping.The best fables use magic and archetyping as set up, not to self referentially glorify the ingenuity behind it and Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a tremendous fable in that vain. The time it takes the game to draw you into the world behind the shadows - is five minutes, and it wont let you out of its grasp anytime soon.Gameplay wise it is a round based, tactical, strategy game with a limited set of party members - in the tradition of an XCOM game, but with the added benefit of character arcs and backstories you will care about. Its accessible even for genre beginners but at the same time incredibly rewarding to master at the later stages.The developers were able to address most criticisms of the older Shadowrun Returns release. The UI was overhauled, saving is now possible at every stage of the game and gameplay systems improved.Dragonfall is a 12-15 hours standalone game (derived from a former DLC within Shadowrun Returns) with a unique story and a fantastical setting, whose biggest problem was the lack of marketing money to launch it into a broader market. It got niche recognition and well deserved critical acclaim - but only a few people ever played it. Lets change that. :)			"

												A thing about this game that I noticed from the very start, this game takes very heavily after the the tabletop RPG it is based on. So if you enjoy the tabletop RPG, i would imagine you would love this game; If you hate Shadowrun or tabletop RPGs in general, you might not like this game.the combat feels very similar to Xcom, as you control a team of generally 4 characters, each with their own particular skills and abilities, and all the characters have a limited number of action points they use to perform actions. although honestly I think I find Shadowrun's combat a bit more satisfying than Xcom, both do to an increased level of variety of skills and customization, and because of the roleplaying elements inherint in the gameplay.I get the feeling this won't be a game for everyone. If you need the shiniest graphics, or lack the patience to read pages of text (there is a lot of talking and exposition in this game and no voiceacting), or you simply don't care about story and just want to get into combat, then you might want to skip this game. But if you don't mind that, and are a fan of story based RPGs, then you will probably enjoy it.One bonus to the poor graphics and lack of voice acting, I'm willing to bet that means mods are a lot easier to seamlessly make into the game, and I look forward to the mods and campaigns that the community createsOverall, 8.5/10. If you enjoy RPGs or tabletop RPGs you will likely enjoy this game.			"

												Although I have not finished the game, I must say that already it's been one of the most immersive RPGs I've ever played. Don't let the graphics fool you - although the game may be subpar in graphical performance it's excellent plot, writing, soundtrack, customization, and multiple character classes make this a game that I'm sure I'll put in almost as much time as I have in games such as Skyrim.  The game starts off basic enough, and is very easy to pick up. However, as you progress through the game even on Normal difficulty, you will find that there is much to learn and the difficulty quickly increases. The last few battles are pretty damn epic, although I haven't done the last one.. yet.I'd highly recommend this to any RPG or strategy game fan, as it has elements of both.			"

												Shadowrun Returns - Dragonfall - and Dragonfall Director's Cut are Shadowrun through and through.I have played the pen and paper game from 1989 with first edition all the way to 5th edition now out. (Second Edition is still the best to me)I have played both SNES and Sega versions. (I like Sega better)Then one day I saw the Kickstarter for Shadowrun Returns and I was like wait Jordan Wiseman is making a new Shadowrun..... DONE!I was all over it I dropped $250 on it right then an there and so far HBS and Mr. Wiseman have done nothing but impress me time and time again with a very good game.This will remain a part of my collection (Sourcebooks, Novels, Sega) of Shadowrun products hopefully for a long time to come as I hope they plan on making more content for it. (More Seattle stuff and some Denver (Pre Bug City and Post??) would be cool as well)Anyway if you like RPG's with Tech and Magic in them this game really blends them together well it has a great track record of provideing quality product with a deep long running story that can be used for future content you should check this out.

												I cannot recommend this game enough. the core game off Shadowrun Returns was passable, but a little bland and rigid. However, Dragonfall had some of the best writing and setting design I've seen in an RPG, with highly compelling characters, a richly textured world, and an excellent design philosophy for including choice, control, and making your character build matter beyond the speed with which you mow down enemies. From a game design perspective, the director's cut has done even better. The interface is much more fluid and informative now, and the tweaks to the mechanics and the feedback the game gives you about those mechanics makes it just FEEL better. it's othing groundbreaking, but it's well suited to the old-school rpg design the game was built to evoke. Heartily recommended.			"

												I put 30 hours into the original Dragonfall alone. I would be more than willing to play it all again with the improvements promised.Also because I spent a lot of time talking to my crew and I would love to play through a mission concerning Glory's past.Glory's my favourite.Anyway, Dragonfalls great. It's got a proper save system, unlike the original Dead Man's Switch campaign. Originally you could only upgrade your own character; it seems to be different this time and judging from what information was put out there, you won't be able to steer a mage off into a life as a hacker. It wouldn't be worth it anyway. TRUST ME. One job is enough. I also made some major decisions on the last stretch of the game fully prepared to get screwed over at the end, but the game actually rewarded me for taking those chances and I was pretty satisfied with the ending I got, so I encourage you to go nuts.The User Generated campaigns are pretty stellar too, from what I've played since finishing Dragonfall, and I look forward to seeing what people do with the new system, if allowed. I myself plan on making a custom campaign at some point too.So, it's turn based, cyberpunk, has a decent community focus, and there's dragons in it. What are you waiting for?			"

												Dragonfall DC improves upon Shadowrun Returns in every way.The battles are more challenging and tactical. The enemy AI is better and strategy matters. Melee oriented characters are now a lot more viable because of the changes to cover system. The new missions are really interesting and Blitz's personal mission is hilarious. There are choices to make which actually seem to have significant consequences and multiple endings.   I consider this one of my favorite video games of all time.  If you liked Shadowrun Returns, you'll love this.  Even if you were disappointed with the linearity and brevity of ""Dead Man's Switch"" I would recommend this game.			"

												Dragonfall - Director's Cut is a great game overall, and it pains me to have to admit that I suffered through a lot of buggy mechanics and a poorly optimized engine to complete it. Now a disclaimer here: I was playing in OSX on a laptop, so the three minute loading times and stuttering are probably not as likely in windows, but they were there for me.Now what is it that makes this game good you ask? Well for one the writing takes the cake, and there are a lot of interesting characters with history to explore and many of them aren't completely static in terms of character developement. You get to know them and directors cut added a few missions which completely sates your desire for closure. As you learn about the plot and setting the game leaves you wanting to know more, and there are a lot of places to read between the lines for the story. It plays out a lot like a book,  and you'll find your self reloading your game to explore different conversation options just to learn what might happen if... As far as gameplay mechanics go it was a lot of fun, not too difficult but still offered a bit of variety. But it's not all roses, there was a pretty bad experience I had where I was pursuing my dream of being a rigger/summoner hybrid, which turned out to be a complete waste as you can't summon spirits when you have a drone. Big downer, as some combinations of skills are arbitrarily useless together. This is probably the biggest flaw of all, and was a bit turn off for me. In addition to this there are character builds where you can have up to 15 strength with trolls and whatnot. Well I'm sorry, but you are never going to get your strength that high because there just isn't enough karma that the game provides to justify it, and that was another disappointment. Throwing weapons are useless only because there are only two (yes, only two) throwing weapons in the game which is not at all apparent or even reasonable considering how many types of other weapons there are- Which also foiled my plan of having a character who only had strength and throwing weapons like a badass ninja. Did I mention the game is glitchy? Bugs with enemies not moving or attacking at all, the screen staying black after talking to shopkeepers, sluggish performance in OSX, lack of control options for key rebinding, three minute loading times, often clicking on things or loading menues took on average 5-10 seconds to perform... It didn't stop me from completing the game, but it'll probably stop me from replaying it. A sad thing to have to admit, as I really wanted to explore the mechanics more. All things considered, I would still recommend this game. Good stories seem dead in the water in many mainstream titles, and you would do your self well to play through this at least once so long as you can digest some text and get lost in the world. The variety of endings really ticked my fancy, and there is plenty of good stuff to keep you interested in playing this title all the way through. At the price point of 15$ it really is a great deal for something that'll kick your imagination in to gear and deliver a satisfying story that you aren't likely to forget.			"

												The best that has happened to Shadowrun since the NES game. (2nd is the normal Shrun game by the same folks.) IF you want cyperpunk, and are not turned off by the in some places, cartoony (yet simply gorgeous) graphics, you'll get great story, great sidetracks, great (in places clicéd, but still masterfully made) characters, great music and a more Europe-centric setting, hop on!The great news is that this is the rare case when the expansion is way, and I mean _WAY_ better than the original. While Shadowrun Returns was great after patches, Dragonfall is the master class.(It took ~10-15h to finish the non-DC DLC version, but this has some extra missions and else)			"

												So as of this moment I have not gotten very far in Dragonfall, but I have beaten the original campaign ""Shadowrun Returns"" and had only just barely started the DLC Dragonfall before this director's cut was released. But the improvements for this standalone release make it by and large, far better then Returns. One is that you feel more connected with your team-mates and they level up as you do with a branching skill tree depending on how you want them to develop. And unlike Returns, I can actually remember my team-mates names. The hub mission system is also far funner to do then the straight line that Returns makes you run through. Not that you shouldn't play Shadowrun Returns if you've never played a game like this, it's a great introduction and makes understanding the mechanics for this game far easier. And they finally made your skills important for the game if you want to get into certain areas or not do too much combat. And the atmosphere is amazing as well, they really nailed the feeling of the Shadowrun universe.I also have to really put a little spotlight on the developer for upgrading everyone who got the DLC to also get the standalone game. It really want to support the company in their future releases if this is how they treat their customers. But seriously, this game is what I remember old expansion packs being, an entire second campaign with tons of new content to enjoy!			"

One thing I really liked about this game was customizing a character to be both a smooth talker and firearms expert.			"

												I first played through this when it was a DLC, and I loved it then.  I loved it to death.  When I finished it, I sat back and thought to myself that this Dragonfall DLC was amazing, couldn't be better.  Well past me was a naive fool.  Dragonfall - Director's Cut takes everything great about the original and then makes it even better.  More story, more stuff, smoother combat.  They took a great product and polished it until it glowed like the Saar-Lorraine-Luxembourg Special Administrative Zone.I played through it twice, which brings my total runs at Dragonfall up to four.  This is, quite simply, a superb game.			"

												Absolutely amazing isometric RPG. While the original campaign in Shadowrun Returns was pretty mediocre, Dragonfall massively improves on it. The game mechanics are still the same, but the quality of writing has gone through the roof. Dragonfall has one of the best written RPG plots I've played in a while, with excellent characters, and more moral ambiguity than most games of the genre. If the game was slightly longer, I'd argue that this is scary close to the likes of original Fallouts, Baldur's Gates and Planescape Torment in quality. If you liked any of those game, I would highly recommend giving this one a try too.			"

												Where the original Shadowrun Return campaign was easily outdone by community made campaigns, Shadowrun: Dragonfall shines on its own.  What was great about the original - beautiful 2D isometric artwork, modability, variety in character builds, good combat with some tactical depth, and an OK story - has been double downed on in Dragonfall.The story's easily the most talked about strength of this game.  Where other games will rush to establish most of the characters you meet the moment you meet them (looking at you, Borderlands), Dragonfall takes its time to let characters develop over time.  There's plnety of opportunity to establish your own protagonist too throughout dialogue, which doesn't reward the nice guy choice every single time.  In a way, the game is sort of like what would happen if Telltale decided to ditch their amazing voice talent to do an isometric tactical RPG.Combat is notably stepped up.  While the original Shadowrun Returns had massive balance issues that made the game way too easy, in Dragonfall there's considerably more care put into crafting tense firefights.  Very Hard difficult is actually fairly difficult, with massive shootouts being hard enough to justify sometimes avoiding them by using your skills.Character building in particular is a lot more rewarding.  There's a lot of skill checks in the game that expand on the story or give you something extra or allow you to tackle a mission in a completely different way.  You could of course look up a guide to figure out the exact point totals you need to succeed every check, but the result is a spread out character that might have some trouble getting through the game.And, of course, there's plenty of beautiful artwork to go around.  Character portraits and backgrounds are as great as they were before, evoking the tropes of the cyberpunk setting.  The only complaint to be had is the low-poly character models.  The less you zoom in on them, the better.Once you finish the main game, there's plenty of high quality user-made campaigns waiting for you.  There's plenty of junk, sure, but stuff like From the Shadows, Run are worthwhile in their own right.For $6, it's a steal.  There's a version on Android for the same price right now, but from what I recall it lacks modidng support.  The game isn't exactly graphically intensive, so if you don't care much for user generated content or if Harebrained Schemes brings in modding support for it later, the mobile version should be just as good and way more portable.

Getting so engrossed in this story was very refreshing for me as I find 99% of games these days to be mindnumbing and boring.The story and writing are the games redeeming features, the combat while relatively satisying at times isn't top notch, and the rpg/character progression is pretty limiting and simplistic.Overall - Don't mind a LOT of reading?

												I would give this game a neutral rating, if there was one. I love the writing, the soundtrack is a perfect match, the skill system has great potential, and the below average graphics are offset by some cute drawings. What killed the game for me was the combat system. I find it so annoying, I just could not bring myself to continue playing despite the captivating story. As such I do not recommend it.I don't know if it's their adaptation of this classic combat concept, or if guns and turn based doesn't work in general. It's cool on a statistical scale, but on the individual level it is random to a point where strategy feels pointless.Hit chances are comparitively low, you can easily miss someone standing right in front of you. Crit chances are extremely high and the difference is significant. There is a cover modifier, which doesn't have much to do with reality or common sense, probably due to simple technical limitations. It turns low hit chances into a waste of ammo across a room with a chair and a plant in the way. That is a problem, because ammo is at a premium. The sniper brings five rounds. Turns being split into two huge timeslices again defy common sense, and create an interesting strategical scenario, which has nothing whatsoever to do with the physics of this universe.The same strategy can turn out a walk in the park or utter defeat. Trying to kill the not-meant-to-be-killed Orc at the beginning a few times proved that nicely. Maybe it's intentional and part of the atmosphere, but the result feels random and artificial, and could be a lot of fun after a lobotomy.It's too bad, because the story really is a lot of fun, except for the ridiculous zero to hero approach, which seems to become more and more popular these days. Puberty probably helps digging that.			"

												This review is divided for people who have never played a game in the shadowrun series and people who have played shadowrun: return. I have also added a short conclusion regarding the keywords in the bottom of the review.People who have never played a game in the shadowrun seriesIn order to know if you should buy this game I will provide a bullet list with keywords that explain the kind of game this is:- estimated 24 hours gameplay (doing all side quests, reading conversations and main story)- The game is focused on reading- Choices matter ALOT- Achievement system (in my opinion it can improve alot, but its there)- Story rich- You don't need to have completed the shadowrun: return in order to play this (different story)- Tactical gameplay and it is solid (XCOM and final fantasy: tactics style)- Skillsystem is solid (but can improve ALOT)- addictive because you want to uncover more and more of the story.People who have played Shadowrun: returnIf you are thinking of buying this game when you have completed the return saga take these keywords in consideration:- This game is story rich again (even though I enjoyed the ending in Shadowrun: return more)- Gameplay has been improved (better interface while fighting)- The content in this version is alot more since I put in alot more hours (estimated 12 hours more) in this game- Its the same Shadowrun formula- skilltree the sameConclusionIf you never played the Shadowrun saga and liked the keywords earlier: BUY IT. The game is highly addictive and the story is broad. The producers of this game put their heart and soul into this game and it is visible. If you are doubting about buying the ""other shadowrun game"" because of the quality and content: BUY IT. You will 100% enjoy this version if you did the last (and maybe more... I did). "

												Dragonfall began as an expansion to Shadowrun Returns and it was a vast improvement over the original campaign.  Now a standalone entry, Dragonfall is my recommended place to start for those interested in trying out Shadowrun.  It takes the solid infrastructure created for Shadowrun Returns and builds upon in expertly, with a new focus on growing a core group of characters as much as a single protagonist.  The gameplay retains its fun turn-based tactical combat, new equipment and spells add increased options, and an expanded matrix system makes hacking more relevant and rewarding than before.But perhaps just as important in my estimation, it’s not just that is Dragonfall a good game, it’s good Shadowrun.  It successfully devotes itself to maintaining both the engrossing setting and the experience of running the shadows with a crew.  While playing I felt like I was playing through a fantastic module for the tabletop version.  It hits all the right notes: a colorful group of criminals and exiles, machinations of powerful corporate juggernauts, terrifying magical and technological advancements, and an ending that manages to feel both triumphant and bleak.With its character-focused storyline and emphasis on leading and growing a team of Runners, Dragonfall is Shadowrun done right.

												Well this is a series I'm just never going to get into. I don't know why; I like SRPGs, I'm okay with cyberpunk, I think the writing is good. But, well, I just found this too long and, by the mid-point, pretty boring. I wasn't a big fan of the first game and, were it not for the fact that I'd bought both games at the same time (for pennies) then I wouldn't have bought this. Problems from the first game persist in this: the matrix is still painfully dull, being just a palette swap which does nothing interesting (though there is much less of it this time around at least); there's a very definite core team you'll likely use for every run (likely only switching Blitz and Dietrich depending on situation) and the plot just meanders along with no urgency or a great deal happening. I found the ending very disappointing, too, and whilst the game gives you some choices to make there's never any consequence - I think it's poor design to have any character choices have no impact until a sentence or two on the 'End' screen - even Telltale games provide more in this respect. There are definite improvements from the first game - your core team now have some rudimentary level-up mechanics in place which at a stroke makes them both viable throughout the whole game and conversely discourages you from ever needing to hire any of the other runners; you can actually have a bit of a say as to what weapons and items/spells characters can take on mission (though it's annoying you have to reselect for each run) and melee characters have more joy. But overall I was left feeling mightily relieved it was all over. Like I say, I was disappointed with the plot in general - it starts building up to something but never delivers, I never really found combat too exciting (I was a mage, as per the first game, and at least felt more powerful) and little things started to grate (like the ponderous movement speed.)Shadowrun: Hong Kong was long taken off my wishlist as I was discouraged from reading that it suffers from a fair bit of padding in the hub world and doesn't is more of an expansion than a sequel, but having now finished Dragonfall it's crystallised that I definitely won't get Hong Kong now no matter the price.

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is an outstanding improvement upon Shadowrun Returns and an excellent example as a presentation of a cyberpunk universe and as a roleplaying game, that you most certainly would like to see in your library of roleplaying game collection. It is also a different approach to the linear, minimalistic design of Shadowrun Returns, all thanks to the development behind the magic which clearly listened to its community. By this, in my book, Herebrained Schemes has proved themselves as one of the open and progressive development teams in the industry. - Which, undisputably, rocks.Shadowrun: Dragonfall, starts with a simple enough campaign introduction which includes a small group of Shadowrunners doing their everyday job. As they, along with our protagonist, proceed deep into this twisted, mysterious job, they face a plot twist that shakes the foundation of their own perspective of the world and history. - Therefore, the Dragonfall Campaign starts as our heroes fight against a great set of conspiracies and problems regarding their community, as well as their personal nightmares that were haunting each and every one of their pasts. Needless to say, our heroes are scarred but resistant team of excellent runners from different backgrounds.Remember, Side Quests and enviromental details that are being presented within optional storylines are the ones that makes a roleplaying game; a live, breathing world.If you aren't familiar with the Shadowrun brand itself and/or would like to try out a turn-based roleplaying game like this, I strongly recommend you to start from Shadowrun Returns and proceed to Dragonfall campaign. Only then, you will agree with my opinion that this franchise and this development is worth following and supporting.Would you like to know something that also rocks? - It runs on GNU/Linux. Which, again in my book, is a huge thumbs up for any product.			"

												This is is great return to the PC world for the SR universe. The main campaign is on rails, but the story is still fun and worthwhile. I recommend Dragonfall over this SR:R due to the imrpovement in AI, interface, and a better story (that feels less on rails due to all the RO opportunities, but has more fetch quests). SR:R/Dragonfall was made primarily with touch screens in mind and so it plays a little clunky on the PC. Sometimes you'll run into problems with trying to get your character in a certain position to only have the game think you clicked the next spot over - not a major issue but an annoying one. The mod support is great and increases the games longevity. The mods even allow you to keep playing your same character through community mods or through the campaign again. Originally Dragonfall was DLC for this engine, but has since released in it's own engine. I recommend buying both games, and then placing SR:R module in the dragonfall engine for a better experience. SR:R has more mods than Dragonfall so you might just want to copy Dragonfall's module into the other engine to utilize more mod's.			"

												How do I keep this review simple, short, as well as helpful? (Hah, like I'm capable of short reviews...)Well, I can simply say that this is one of the best RPGs I have played in a long while. It's in a very cyber-punk future Earth, where metahumans (elf, troll, ork, dwarf) exist alongside humans.You start off this incredibly well-written story by choosing your gender, then race, and finally your class (which you are not limited to, by any means.. you can be a mage/decker mix if you'd like).The classes are as follows:Deckers - Futuristic hackers capable of entering the ""Matrix"" to take control of turrets/cameras/doors or steal data (wherein you fight programs to get at important nodes containing access).Rigger - (No I'm not yelling a racial slur.) ""Jack"" into your personal drone(s) to get a powerful ally that will fight alongside you, slip into small openings and vents to ambush enemies or unlock doors, and essentially have full control of any robot or turret that you can reach to turn the battlefield in your favor (I beat the game first with this and it was a lot of fun, as well as much easier than I felt being a Decker was, I regret not dipping into both at once).Street Samurai - Basic combat class. Can be talented with melee weapons or guns or both.Mage/Adept - Cast spells or channel magic into your fists to enhance or debilitate combatants.Shaman - Summon spirits to fight for you either by using various summoning spots (located conveniently in most battlefields) or special fetishes bought and kept in your inventory for immediate use. Beware, though... while they are incredibly powerful, they are not as loyal as drones and may break free and attack whoever they please.All of the combat in the game is turn-based. When an enemy knows where you are, gets too close, or you set off an alarm, your entire team of 4 (or more depending on if you have drones or temporary/neutral companions) stops dead in its tracks and you spend AP to move. 2 AP is the basic start and I've only ever had at most 3 on my Rigger and 3 on my two drones (so basically 7 total attacks, since having a drone active reduces your AP by one per) by the end of the main story.The combat works well and the cover system, while still leaving you a bit vulnerable no matter what you're hiding behind, isn't unfair.Aside from that, I just have to restate my love for this story. I won't spoil even the smallest detail, but I will say that you encounter a conspiracy and while it is not the only aspect your team will focus on, it is their main focus. You will do a ton of odd jobs as a Shadow Runner and test your skills and morality along the way.Watch even one gameplay video and if it looks like you could enjoy it, get the game. That's all I can say about it, because the story speaks for itself. I fully intend to try the other Shadowrun games, even if they aren't as good and I hope anyone reading this decides to do the same.			"

												I can't get enough of Shadowrun: Dragonfall because it offers the combination of two of my most played games. It has the turn-based action from Wasteland 2 and the (side)character development from Mass Effect 2 viz. you can engage with companions, get unique quests that are related to them and favor one above the other. The setting is quite attractively, reminds me a lot of Bladerunner and the Android universe. Still, the best adition to the game is probably the Steamworkshop, the original SNES game has been added and is fully playable which adds another 30+ hours to the game. Greatly recommended!			"

												if you like story-driven games this one has good writing & engaging companion characters. no voice acting but it's fine because sometimes it can be awkward if only the npcs have voices, or if the playable character gets one it doesn't feel very personal. character customization is also great, lots of options for skills so you aren't forced to pick specific 'classes'. no skill reset though so either save before you spend your skill points or use a save game editor.gameplay & mechanics seem pretty standard, nothing incredible but not bad either.also most importantly you get a dog companion. what more could you want?

												Unlike in Shadowrun Returns, you actually play as a shadowrunner that goes on runs. Not only that, but there's actual characters with arcs, choices, and a plot that's more than 'a bad guy wants to do bad stuff because he's evil, go stop him.' Likewise, the setting and its unique aspects are actually interwoven and integral to the characters, events and choices in the game, rather than serving as a convenient backdrop for a bog-standard save-the-world story populated by stock characters and stereotypes, as in its predecessor.The combat has a lot more depth, too. There's a point to flanking now, and non-offensive abilties now serve a bigger role what with the revamped mechanics. Coming from someone who thought that Shadowrun Returns was absolute rubbish, I thought Dragonfall was one of the best RPGs of 2014.			"

I was unable to reload or restart from an earlier checkpoint and a few other users have mentioned similar issues. Having had found no fix, I accepted my fate and just consider myself unlucky.'Shadowrun: Dragonfall' is entertaining and interesting; there were a few mature moments where the plot forced me to think about ethics and consequences. There were plenty of side missions, extra characters, and hours of class and decision dependent dialogue hidden in the game too. Unfortunately, it is, for this reason, I won't be restarting the game.

You notice what seems like drafts of a love letter to Glory, but the writing is unintelligible.You dig further through the notes and find what seems like a video game review.Shadowrun Returns threw us in a noir flick that progressively went over our head and while it featured a small cast of interesting characters, interactions were pretty limited.Shadowrun: Dragonfall introduced a more epic plot, a large hub area filled with NPCs, and a permanent crew with their own motives and personalities, making it a fascinating bonding experience.The Director's Cut further improved upon the original by adding side-missions for every crew member that further influence their character development and unique perks to specialize them in combat.Gameplay-wise, the combat system has once again been improved, it is still very much influenced by XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and makes it clear with the new UI tweaks, cover and flanking mechanics, and the revamped armor system seems to have had a significant impact on the usefuleness of magic, which previously felt a bit underwhelming.There are also new options that have been added when it comes to emergent gameplay, which is a thing I always welcome with open arms in CRPGs.Overall, if you've never played Shadowrun Returns, or only Dead Man's Switch, I would say this is the best entry in the franchise, and if you have already played the original Dragonfall campaign, the Director's Cut is still worth replaying for all the added content, some of it tying up loose ends left in the original DLC.

												Ah hallo meine Freunde, grab your 50 nuyen worth of Turkish coffee and get prepared to be sucked into the anarchist Berlin.The Dragonfall is simply an amazing RPG. I honestly think it has the best story in a RPG that came out in recent years. The gameplay is better than the Shadowrun Returns, there are much more things available like the armor bar and the combat AI is better than the first game too. I have no complains about the combat. It's satisfying. The characters are very interesting and likeable. I was surprised how much I got involved with them at the end and I wanted to play more and more just to see what happens to them in the future. They have good and solid backstories and personal traits that make them unique. They all have a certain quest that progresses their own stories. I recommend playing them all. Actually one of them (Glory's) was my favorite mission.The ending and the many twists and the mystery in the plot just grabs you and doesnt let you go until you finish the game. And then it continues to haunt you. Just get this and prepare for one of the best RPG experience of the last years. It is a shinning beacon among the shallow ""action"" RPGs and ""when you press a button something awesome has to happen"" crowd. But I would advise you to play the Shadowrun Returs first because this one is a massive improvement and if you play that later you will feel downgraded. 11/10 would run the shadows againLong Live Berlin Flux StateDante best companion			"

												I sort of like this game, it's a text based RPG, the story and characters are very good.I like the art style.Though Iam a prolific bookworm and love reading, I play a game to play a game, not read a novel. It would of been nice if there was voice overs especially at night when your eyes are feeling tired and you don't feel like reading.Sometimes gameplay can be annoying, even at 99% hit chance you will miss. I only kept playing as I like the story.I dislike there is no option to respec. I first had a shaman elf, did not like it much too much of a support character. So then went with a troll street samurai which was much better to play.This game I feel could be better. 5/10 ok but nothing amazing, it feels like an indie game, it's lacking a certain something. Gameplay is rather tedious and meh. The turn based system is so rng, even on easy it can feel overwhelming.Once I got to Apex and destroyed it, I experienced a game breaking bug of not being able to move, though I could hear the music still playing and reloading the last autosave just results in a black screen and for some reason my quick save is no longer there.My only option is to restart this rather lengthy mission from the begining and how do I know if the same bug wont happen again?Can't reccomend because of this game breaking bug which despite it happening to a lot of people never gets fixed. After experiencing this horrible bug, Iam not going to play another ShadowRun game. "

												Okay, where should I start? Right. Dragonfall is a tactical rpg with different difficulty levels. Combat is relatively easy when approached with some common sense at least up to hard difficulty and you can't customize much outside your main character.What made me like this game? It's very descriptive with its dialogue. Normal conversations between characters are expressed with narrations and loading screens are used for expressing the situation further. Your party members each have a character arc that is rather intriguing, however, they don't last the whole game.Shadowruns setting is interesting to me since it's cyberbunk meeting fantasy. Elves, dwarves, orcs and trolls running around using magic within futuristic Berlin alongside hackers and gunslingers. You can be something among these running around Kreuzbasar, one of the safe havens for unsavory types.Kreuzbasar has certain charm to it. It's a slum full of different people whose dialogue is refreshed after each mission. It's used as a base of operations for our protagonist. I could delve more into characters but I think I'll leave that for you to find out.Who should I recommend this to? Well, people that like to immerse themselves into the settings and people that like western role-playing games in general, like Baldur's Gate. "

												Dragonfall Director's Cut is an interesting game.  It's based in Shadowrun, a fantasy-cyberpunk setting that's pretty neat.  All of the usual players are here: dragons (a main component of this campaign), trolls, orcs, elves from the fantasy side; from the cyberpunk side you get stuff like artificial augmented limbs, The Matrix cyberspace, guns, swords, designer drugs that affect combat, and a lot more.GAMEPLAY:It plays as a turn-based tactical game, bearing some resemblance to the newest XCOM.  Actions are based on AP and there are various ways to alter that number, both for your characters and the enemies.  Several attacks have -AP and often stun enemies for a turn, giving a bit of breathing room.  There are also multiple ways to increase AP and give yourself more actions per turn and this adds variety and even more strategy on top.  The cover system adds complexity as well, as there's a risk-reward choice inherent in there:  do you stay safely behind cover and suffer reduced hit chance and the possibility that your shot will only hit for half damage?  Or do you rush around to flank, possibly leaving yourself exposed but at a better advantage with an opportunity to maybe kill that enemy this turn?  I enjoyed the style of gameplay a lot from this perspective.The flip side of the hit % chance model is that it's all based on dicerolls, and the way the stats work out can lead to some funky scenarios.  For example, my shotgun specialist character is standing at point-blank range with another enemy and I only have a 65% chance to hit?  I played on Hard, because I found the vanilla Shadowrun Returns a little too easy, so that might have something to do with it, but it's still frustrating and a little weird that scenarios like that happen.The gameplay gets an upgrade from vainilla Returns as well.  Several new kinds of weapons are introduced, including Eiger's sniper rifle -- a weapon that increases accuracy the further you get from a target, instead of closer, and Glory's hand razors that can cause bleeding per round and AP damage.  Weapon, spell and program selection is also a little easier this time around, as the HUD has been redesigned to show more information more easily.The most striking difference between them, I think, is the fact that this time you get a more static party, and you can do more with them.  This was definitely a complaint I had about regular Returns, in that for every mission you were hiring mercs to go with you, and you had no way to influence their loadout or progression.  In fact, you couldn't even use team members to pass skill checks, which seemed arbitrarily limiting and frustrating.  Not so in Dragonfall!  Here, if you hit a Decking skill check, for example, you just call over your Decker and he passes it -- assuming his skill is high enough.There are still some character-specific checks you need to pass, like some charisma or etiquette checks, but they're a little more reasonable in terms of general skills you can invest in to be able to still build the character you want to play.The only major complaint I have is being unable to manage your companions' inventory outside of combat, or have them pick things up when they have free space.  Just because my main character doesn't have more inventory space doesn't mean that I should have to leave health kits or grenades... but that's exactly what happened when I found some outside of combat.  Inside combat, you can just control them directly and have them pick things up, but outside there's no way to take control of anyone but your PC.  This could even be addressed by being able to start combat at any time to gain control of your characters, and then when you're done just hit End.  Again, it seems unnecessary and a little arbitrary to limit items like this.There's also some companion customization in terms of items and abilities, which is new this time around; every time they level up there's a new icon in the bottom right that lets you pick one of two options that increases one of their specialties.  With Glory, for example, you can pick between better healing or a new pistol.  It's nice to tailor them a little more to your playstyle without having to dive all the way into the level up screen and try to allocate points for five or six different characters.STORY:I'll be honest, after the regular Shadowrun campaign I wasn't expecting that much from the story this time around.  I had read that it was improved but the vanilla game left a lot to be desired, so really any improvement would be a welcome addition.  I was pleasantly surprised, though.  In terms of pacing, structure, and impact the writing in this game is miles above Shadowrun Returns.  Even the nitty-gritty mechanics of the writing have been improved, as a lot of the awkwardness of the prose in the first game has been done away with.  The characters are dynamic and a lot more fleshed-out, the moral choices and consequences seem a lot more difficult, and you find yourself not knowing who to trust or who is even telling you the truth.Your companions receive a similar boost and they're all unique.  They all have unique dialogue that relates to whatever mission you're on, and if they don't agree with something you're doing they'll let you know.  You can also talk to them at your home base to get a sense of their backstory, though you'll have to complete missions before they really open up about their pasts.  The conclusion to this is a companion quest, where you can't bring anyone else, and the two of these I played were superb, both in terms of mission structure and the quality of the writing.  Some loose ends were left dangling, though I'm not sure if I just missed another quest opportunity for one because I was at the end of the game.OVERVIEW:All in all, I really enjoyed my time with Dragonfall, even if Hard was maybe a little too frustrating for me.  The game definitely has some legs, as there's incentive to go back with a different character build and make different decisions.  There are multiple major branching points where the paths seem to diverge quite a lot, and I'd like to see what some of the others are like.  Different character builds offer more opportunities for passing skill checks as well, and bringing different companions will offer a new point of view on some of the events.I played Shadowrun Returns first, and I don't think I regret it, but it's not quite as polished an experience as Dragonfall, and some of the characters do cross over, plus there are some minor references to the original campaign, Dead Man's Switch, in here.  Mostly I'd recommend playing that one first just to see how far the team has come since then.  Dragonfall is definitely worth your time, though, and if you don't want to slog through the first one (or pay the money for it) this is a perfectly recommendable title in itself.If you like CRPGs based on pen-and-paper games, reading, and a really good story, you can't go wrong with Dragonfall.

												TL;DR - buy this game. Don't wait for sale, buy it now. It's worth paying full price. I would buy it again if I could. If you don't, big, angry dragon will hunt you and eat you. Seriously, you don't want to mess with dragons.Dragonfall so far is one of the best cRPGs released this year. It has everything you may want from such game: cool story, memorable characters (Glory is in my personal top ten of best characters in cRPGs ever), many ways to develop your character, interesting setting, more than one ending, big potential for replayability (counting original Dragonfall, I finished game three times). It's game that makes me care for characters I met. I wanted to know their stories and their stories and motivatopms are good, not usually mambo-jumbo most games are offering now.Are there any cons? I noticed few minor bugs, but nothing that ruined the game and experience (yes Wasteland 2, I'm looking at you now...). And it could be longer.			"

												An improvement in almost every way over the original Returns, Dragonfall keeps a much more cohesive story whilst simultaneously granting the player more freedom. Providing a handful of standard party members for every run instead of just popping up a list of nobodies helps make the game feel more like the adventures of a runner team, complete with the option to pick and choose what runs they'll be going on. Camaraderie is the name if the game, and with every member of the team having their personalities and backstories to explore, the player gains a vested interest in seeing everything through to its end.Hats off to Dietrich, the realest dude in the Flux State			"

												I tried words to express how overjoyed I am to see the Shadowrun franchise back in action and moving forward steadily with U(ser) G(enerated) C(ontent) support.  It didnt work.  All I have to offer in way of review for the new Shadowrun content on Steam is :-) :-) :-).  That's right, smiley faces.  SMILEY FACES TIMES TEN MILLION.  It's good to play a game that is turn based and seeping in the techno magic aspect genre that I love.  Shadowrun ""Dead Man's Switch"" was good.  Shadowrun ""Dragonfall"" was excellent, and receiving the Shadowrun ""Dragonfall Directors Cut"" for no additional cost through Steam is awesome!			"

												I've been a big fan of the Shadowrun franchise for quite some time.  When Returns first came out I was excited to try it but was underwhelmed by the gameplay's linearity.  It had a lot going for it as a cyberpunk RPG, but a lot of little details made it feel lacking.Then Dragonfall came along, like an answer to my consternation  of the last campaign.Now THIS is a Shadowrun game.  You start the game as part of a shadowrunner team, a mercenary black ops who work as deniable assets for the world's power players, infiltrating a German manor to steal some data.  It's supposed to be a simple ""get in and grab the goods"" mission, but things go south quickly.  After a disastrous run you and your team find yourself entangled in a conspiracy which can shake the very foundations of Berlin!Dragonfall is an open-ended game.  You can play a variety of character types, from a tech-savvy, computer-hacking Decker to a Physical Adept who uses chi to reinforce her martial arts skills.  Subtle infiltration is just as valid an opportunity as the run and gun method, although combat is inevitable in many missions.  Just about every mission has multiple options of conflict resolution which can effect the end result and potentially your post-run payday.One of the things I like most about Dragonfall is that you have a core team of 3 (potentially 4) runners who can accompany you on missions.  In Shadowrun Returns you couldn't always carry the party members you want to missions, and most of the time you were either stuck between spending your money on equipment and doing a run alone, or hiring shadowrunners to accompany you get getting stuck with sub-par equipment.  Gone is this concern in Dragonfall: while you can still hire mercenary runners, your core team does not have to be paid to go on runs, and all are competent in their fields leaving you with more financial freedom.Another strongpoint of Dragonfall is the setting.  The game's hub is in Berlin's Flux State, a walled neighborhood of anarchist rebels which is a haven from a world dominated by ruthless megacorps.  This is not without its flaws, for the unpredictable power structures leaves various gangs, criminal conspiracies, and other shadowy figures wanting a piece of the pie.  From the sterile halls of a pharmaceutical building to the grungy subways connecting Berlin, the environments are both interesting and versatile.And the icing on the cake is that the Director's Cut has a healthy assortment of new sidequests, items, and conversational details which expand upon an already-stellar game.If you're a fan of RPGs, enjoy cyberpunk settings, or just want to play a damn good game, then Shadowrun: Dragonfall is well worth the price.

												Another great installment in the cyberpunk world of the Shadowrun RPG:TL:DR;-setting: successful fusion of Dungeons and Dragons and the film Bladerunner (game setting was developed on the tail of that era, obviously derived)-stylish read-along in a detail-rich setting, not much ""choices matter"" here-easy to learn, fun turn-based isometric rpg-best suited for: anyone looking for a short, lite rpg or anyone curious about the Shadowrun setting-""STORY RICH""Much like its predecessor, Shadowrun Returns, the game was what precisely what I expected: short and sweet, stylish, with simple, yet effective, and fun game turn-based rpg mechanics. Building on what the previous installment had to offer, this storyline gave more of a feeling of making choices that changed the outcome of the narrative.Shadowrun Returns wet my appetite for sleek futuristic fantasy world of Shadowrun, one I had long known of but never previously delved into, and Dragonfall was another enjoyable foray deeper into that world. I can assure you, with this last keystroke, that I am immediately off to play the latest installment in the series, grinning from ear to ear in anticipation of more Shadowrun goodness. I can't believe I was missing out on this setting all these years. Great work again Harebrained Schemes! Keep 'em comin'!			"

There's a lot of really solid storytelling if you don't mind a bit of reading to get it (but then again you wouldn't be playing this type of game without expecting to read anyway). Some of the optional missions are hilarious, some are tense, and the choices you end up making have real consequences for how the rest of your campaign goes. Loving it so far.			"

												Initially referring to this as an expansion was a mistake because it towers over anything related to Dead Man's Switch; it's as much as an ""expansion"" as Hordes of Underdark was to the vanilla, perfunctory-at-best NWN campaign. It's not only 10x the game that Shadowrun Returns was originally, but arguably better than the SNES classic. I've been consistently surprised at the quality in the writing and characterization.			"

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is my favorite isometric RPG of a year with many other good releases. Its setting combines a cyberpunk corporatist dystopia with fantasy and magic in interesting ways. You lead a group of shadowrunners doing wetwork off the books for megacorporations while trying to combat a threat posed by a long-dead dragon. The writing in Dragonfall is excellent all around with surprisingly deep backstories for party members, interesting conversations (with choices and skills/attributes) and a story that keeps you on your toes and has multiple endings. The game takes place in Berlin with a home base in Kreuzberg (not recognizable) and missions that take you to other districts. Combat is turn-based with a system similar to the new XCOM. The missions are well paced with moments of exploration and gathering clues between combat scenarios. Dragonfall is not an open world RPG but its loose mission structure and fairly big hub (Kreuzberg) make it feel more like one than it really is.I would definitely recommend this to any fan of isometric RPGs with good writing.Notes: This is the improved stand-alone version of the second (much bigger and better) campaign for Shadowrun Returns. It lasts a good 15-20 hours or so. This version does not include the original Dead Man's Switch campaign from Shadowrun Returns.			"

												The art is beautiful. The writing is incredible.Basically, this game follows the X-COM reboot's method of combat. It's not a big budget, state of the art graphics extravaganza. But man, it satisfies that itch. Baulder's gate with turn based combat and sub-machine guns.You can play a cyborg Ork with an automatic shotgun. Or you can play an elf that summons elemental terrors from piles of garbage. Or all points between. What's not to like?This game is very adult themed. How adult? One of the character quests is quite possibly the darkest damn thing I've played since the Witcher series. There is also one quest that is so blackly hilarious I fell out of my chair laughing.After playing through the original twice, I gave this a shot. Unbelievable difference, much tighter game.Worth the price.Hoi Chummer. Cut the drek and get your run on. First we take Seattle, then we take Berlin.			"

												This heavily story driven cyperpunk tactical adventure is all the awesome it's predecessor was. Shadowrun has truly returned and this game has done much to reinvigorate the fandom that's been dedicated to the setting for decades now.Shadowrun comes with one campaign, Seattle and it's a lovely campaign. I loved the story and really loved the gameplay. The difficulty curve is difficult to gauge, but since so much of the challenge is in unraveling the story, it tends to vary from player to player. All in all, it's about an 8-12 hour campaign depending on your personal pacing and you'll love being immersed in the shadows of this particular fantasy.The real glory of the game for me is the editor it comes with which allows players to create their own campaigns. It's very powerful and easy to learn. At the time of this writing there are already dozens of player content out there, a lot of which is great stuff. Because of the editor, there's a solid community of engaged players to interact with and really enjoy the game. This is a must buy for gamers who love story driven games and especially those who love the world of Shadowrun.			"

												Done a couple missions and I must say the game is nicely put together. Each character has a unique personality. There are different dialogue options and approaches to each battle. There are unique classes and you can customize your character the way you want it. The hacking system is also very cool and unique compared to other games. The story itself is intriguing and will draw you in. One of the things I like about this game a lot is the karma/skill system. Everytime you complete a mission or side mission you will get karma. Karma is used to upgrade your character's skills. There is a lot of customization for this and the race you choose will even impact this. You don't get anything for killing enemies in the game. This is a fresh way to go about it since I feel like some games reward the players too much. Complete the mission first to get the reward, not during the mission. It also means when reinforcements are coming you won't be inclined to want to kill them just for extra loot/xp.All in all, I would give this game a 8.5/10. Talking to npcs can get boring, but this game is definitely worth the sale price tag. Just make sure you enjoy turn based combat.			"

Absolutely awesome game for an old school turn based, story driven RPG. AWESOME!!! The original dependancy version of Dragonfall was a huge leap from the original dead man's switch (which was still very good). However, the dragonfall: director's cut takes an alreayd solid game and shoots it into the stratosphere. The interfact is slicker, it is now a lot more responsive (things happen quicker, animations are much better), comat is much more logical, tactical, and fun. More spells, misssions, character development. EVERYTHING is just plain better. And best of all, IT WAS FREE BECAUSE I ALREADY OWNED DF. Congrats Harebrained Schemes!!!! You've hit a home run and I am one picky SOB. Trust me.

												Well I support this game. But not for the reasons you might think. This game is a very good example on how you convert a rich and deep enviroment and source material into a pc game and it is a very good example as well on how not to do it. Firstly let me point out the good stuff.The storytelling is excellent. It is very clear that the creators are some of the people who actually made the pen and paper version of Shadowrun. The story, the characters and the setting are spot on. This game proves that you do not have to have voice actors for every bit of dialog to make it good. The grafik design is very good. This is how Shadowrun should look like. The character portaits are nice and fitting. The game is a true role play game. You got character classes and you better play them according to their skills. This is not a you can have it all - example and that is a good thing.The soundtrack is brilliant. It reflects the general feel of the game and the situation your characters are in.  The main quest line is thrilling and its length is appropriate. The cimax of the story is well developed and satisfying. The bad stuff:The UI is terrible. Why you can not see your health bar while not in combat and why you need to dig deep in character and inventory screens to use a simple medpack is a mystery to solve. The general usability is rather poor. Avatars will several times be in the way of your cursor preventing you from reaching a certain spot.Pathfinding is poor. Why you have to ""expand"" your Action Points based running distance instead of having the game find the direct route using as many APs as needed is beyond my understanding. The feedback the game gives you using switches and dialog options is poor. The combat system works well on a table among friends where bad dice rolls are fun but it is not suited for a pc game. The frustration level is extreme. Your crack team of shadowrunners will miss point blank buck shots and it will miss often. The cover system is hard to figure out. The cover level does often not resemble the actual obstacle you are hiding behind. Wooden structures sometimes provide better cover than concrete. Enemies are not diverse enough. You basically fight the same set of enemies in different colors. Interesting battles are rather rare and that is a shame considering the source. Matrix fights are as well rather generic. The enemy AI is both predictable and erratic. Enemies will almost always target your weakest group members and will suicide run into your stronger fighters. They will spam grenades always as soon as your characters are closer than three tiles.  Combined with my point about the combat system leading to often hilarious outcomes of shots and melee atacks make tactis rather pointless. If you are outnumbered and outgunned and outskilled which will happen very often you basically have to rely on setting up traps  for one or two enemies cause the combat is that unpredictable. This is a major factor for me and I know for many gamers. The game is good and fun for people who love the source but it can be a tedious task and ridiculous gamble for those who expect a X-Com like experience. It is not that.   "

												If you're looking for a strong, complicated story, tactical gameplay, and the grandpappy of all cyberpunk game settings, Shadowrun: Dragonfall the Director's Cut is a game you want to pick up.For returning players who may have picked up Deadman's Switch (the original Shadowrun: Returns storyline), Dragonfall has a very different feel. Taking place in Germany, it deftly blends a sci-fi feel with heist, noir, and political themes to create a more fleshed out campaign setting. Characters you meet feel more real, and even the plethora of side missions add to the overall story and world.Gameplay changes from the original Shadowrun: Returns make Dragonfall a much more enjoyable experience to play. More character customization for your team and a streamlined interface and controls, along with upgraded save features, make the gameplay smoother.If you enjoy layered stories, RPGs, or tactical combat, this game is a great addition to your collection.

												The art is beautiful. The writing is incredible.Basically, this game follows the X-COM reboot's method of combat. It's not a big budget, state of the art graphics extravaganza. But man, it satisfies that itch. Baulder's gate with turn based combat and sub-machine guns.You can play a cyborg Ork with an automatic shotgun. Or you can play an elf that summons elemental terrors from piles of garbage. Or all points between. What's not to like?This game is very adult themed. How adult? One of the character quests is quite possibly the darkest damn thing I've played since the Witcher series. There is also one quest that is so blackly hilarious I fell out of my chair laughing.After playing through the original twice, I gave this a shot. Unbelievable difference, much tighter game.Worth the price.Hoi Chummer. Cut the drek and get your run on. First we take Seattle, then we take Berlin.			"

People may not be comfortable with the isometric view, but the world and the characters will hook you in to the point that it won't matter. If you like RPGs than you want this game.			"

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is the expansion to SR: Returns turnend standalone with a bunch of improvements.SR:R is a turn based tactical game set in the Shadowrun Universe (dystopian cyberpunk with elves, orks and magic mixed in).The combat sytem is functional but nothing to be too excited about. The story, character interaction and wonderfully written Dialogue is where the game in my opinion really shines.On top of that the game includes a complete toolkit for building your own Stories, so you can expand on the game as much as you want to.The Director's Cut improves some elements of the UI and either tweaked the armor+cover system or at least gave the player more information on how they work and if (and how much) enemies have either of them.It also changes/expands a few Missions and adds new ones into the main campaign.All in all great work and if you already have Dragonfall you automatically get the Director's Cut...now thats a sign of a great company.Rock on Harebrained =)			"

												Dragonfall - Director's cut is undoubtedly superior to Deadmans switch, which though good, was about providing the necessary fantasy, cyberpunk, noir experience. Dragonfall moves beyond the tropes, it is set in a fictionalized Berlin, where quaint German/  European names become a post modern simulicrum that vaguely echoes Wagners Neibelungen. Some of the scenes in the game are a kind of pay off for long developed story elements that were unexpected and disconcerting enough to be ""water cooler"" moments to the right crowd (Probably no one I know). What starts off as clunky tropes becomes a meditation on the idea of essence sacrificed to technology and the ideas of spirit within the Shadowrun game. The logic of the more bleak endings was rewarding to experience. Much better than expected.			"

												I can't get enough Shadowrun!  DMS was great and Dragonfall was amazing and now with the Director's Cut I am gobsmacked!  I really hope that they keep making campaigns, because everytime HBS comes out with one it is a million times better than their last attempt!  I love how they added even more speech options in the DC, because I like getting Karma any way I can!  All the extra missions are awesome too and really tie things up for the NPC's back stories.The only thing that I can think of that I would like to see added in the next possible game is some form of stealth system, where silencers and silent spells are useful.  Im getting close to putting 200 total into Shadowrun!  That doesn't count the time Im playing the original Sega game either!  lol.			"

												Done a couple missions and I must say the game is nicely put together. Each character has a unique personality. There are different dialogue options and approaches to each battle. There are unique classes and you can customize your character the way you want it. The hacking system is also very cool and unique compared to other games. The story itself is intriguing and will draw you in. One of the things I like about this game a lot is the karma/skill system. Everytime you complete a mission or side mission you will get karma. Karma is used to upgrade your character's skills. There is a lot of customization for this and the race you choose will even impact this. You don't get anything for killing enemies in the game. This is a fresh way to go about it since I feel like some games reward the players too much. Complete the mission first to get the reward, not during the mission. It also means when reinforcements are coming you won't be inclined to want to kill them just for extra loot/xp.All in all, I would give this game a 8.5/10. Talking to npcs can get boring, but this game is definitely worth the sale price tag. Just make sure you enjoy turn based combat.			"

												HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! This is my first review that I've ever written for a game. After playing it, I just had to write one. Absolutely awesome game for an old school turn based, story driven RPG. AWESOME!!! The original dependancy version of Dragonfall was a huge leap from the original dead man's switch (which was still very good). However, the dragonfall: director's cut takes an alreayd solid game and shoots it into the stratosphere. The interfact is slicker, it is now a lot more responsive (things happen quicker, animations are much better), comat is much more logical, tactical, and fun. More spells, misssions, character development. EVERYTHING is just plain better. And best of all, IT WAS FREE BECAUSE I ALREADY OWNED DF. Congrats Harebrained Schemes!!!! You've hit a home run and I am one picky SOB. Trust me. You are now, as far as I'm concerned, in the leagues of CD Projeck and the shadowrun returns game-line has been put on my AUTO-BUY WITHOUT THINKING list. Keep expanding! I'll pay.			"

												Im a big fan of turnbased combat games like XCOM, Divinity:Original SIn and Wasteland 2, so steam recommended me this game. I watched a few videos on YT, and read the reviews, and decided to go for it. If you like games with lots of text and little action. Maybe it's for you, I just couldn't even get past the first mission. Combad is way inferior to any of the previously mentioned games. There's no Overwatch function that I could find, and hitting someone even at point blank range is next to impossible. In the end I just gave up. Maybe I will try it again some other day. Not recommended.EDIT:After giving it another shot, im finally starting to get the hang of this game. It's not as bad as i first thought, but still, combat is still inferior to other similar games. What is good about shadowrun is the world.  I really like the idea of mixed scifi and fantasy in one game. I still think that execution could have been done better, but once you get past the first mission it's an ok game with a great lore and story, even if there is a bit too much reading involved for my taste. Recommended but not for everyone.			"

												Well I support this game. But not for the reasons you might think. This game is a very good example on how you convert a rich and deep enviroment and source material into a pc game and it is a very good example as well on how not to do it. Firstly let me point out the good stuff.The storytelling is excellent. It is very clear that the creators are some of the people who actually made the pen and paper version of Shadowrun. The story, the characters and the setting are spot on. This game proves that you do not have to have voice actors for every bit of dialog to make it good. The grafik design is very good. This is how Shadowrun should look like. The character portaits are nice and fitting. The game is a true role play game. You got character classes and you better play them according to their skills. This is not a you can have it all - example and that is a good thing.The soundtrack is brilliant. It reflects the general feel of the game and the situation your characters are in.  The main quest line is thrilling and its length is appropriate. The cimax of the story is well developed and satisfying. The bad stuff:The UI is terrible. Why you can not see your health bar while not in combat and why you need to dig deep in character and inventory screens to use a simple medpack is a mystery to solve. The general usability is rather poor. Avatars will several times be in the way of your cursor preventing you from reaching a certain spot.Pathfinding is poor. Why you have to ""expand"" your Action Points based running distance instead of having the game find the direct route using as many APs as needed is beyond my understanding. The feedback the game gives you using switches and dialog options is poor. The combat system works well on a table among friends where bad dice rolls are fun but it is not suited for a pc game. The frustration level is extreme. Your crack team of shadowrunners will miss point blank buck shots and it will miss often. The cover system is hard to figure out. The cover level does often not resemble the actual obstacle you are hiding behind. Wooden structures sometimes provide better cover than concrete. Enemies are not diverse enough. You basically fight the same set of enemies in different colors. Interesting battles are rather rare and that is a shame considering the source. Matrix fights are as well rather generic. The enemy AI is both predictable and erratic. Enemies will almost always target your weakest group members and will suicide run into your stronger fighters. They will spam grenades always as soon as your characters are closer than three tiles.  Combined with my point about the combat system leading to often hilarious outcomes of shots and melee atacks make tactis rather pointless. If you are outnumbered and outgunned and outskilled which will happen very often you basically have to rely on setting up traps  for one or two enemies cause the combat is that unpredictable. This is a major factor for me and I know for many gamers. The game is good and fun for people who love the source but it can be a tedious task and ridiculous gamble for those who expect a X-Com like experience. It is not that.   "

												This is a marked improvement over the original Dragonfall campaign, which was an improvement over Deadman's Switch. None of the previous storylines/versions were bad, it's just this one offers a lot more options and opportunities to define your runner. This version also allows you to pick some useful perks for the other runners on your crew, as well as take on some missions to aid them in their own personal goals. The combat and UI are leaps and bounds above the previous version and the new combat system removes a lot of the ambiguity present in the previous versions. Overall I think this game would be a fine addition to your steam library.			"

												This is my first foray into Steam game reviews, so make of that what you will.I backed SR:R on Kickstarter, and bought the base game for a few of my friends. I'm not the biggest fan of Dead Man's Switch, but I very much enjoyed certain UGC (User Generated Content) that was subsequently released afterwards.I already enjoyed Dragonfall when it originally came out, and I can say that, so far, I'm enjoying this game more than when it originally came out. I've yet to complete this version, because I've been distracted by other games and IRL, but there are several tweaks in the game that make you smile. This is *the* definite Shadowrun game (if we ignore the awesome SNES and Genesis/Megadrive games for a moment).The editor has been beefed up as well, and has introduced several new elements, such as armour. More and more, I'm looking forward to upcoming UGC. In the mean time however, I would recommend this game to people who are looking for a straight forward cyberpunk experience. It can seem a little clunky at times, but the game and the editor are a ton of fun.This game is worth double the amount they are charging for it.			"

												Shadowrun Returns was a great revamp of the classic Shadowrun games of yore that I spent many hours on in my youth. However, it felt a bit like dipping my toes into the large ocean of possibility that is the Shadowrun universe. Shadowrun: Dragonfall takes that experience and builds it into a thorough dive into the dark cyberpunk waters of Shadowrun. The Berlin setting is new and refreshing, the more polished combat system for the Director's Cut is both visually pleasing and more intuitive, and the story is outrageously good. The writing never falters, and that is what truly makes this game great. For fans of immersive and story driven games, this is one for you.			"

There are still some kinks to work out, but overall the game seems to load faster and run more smoothly.

While it still has room for improvement, I trust that the developers will iterate on an already repolished system with the upcoming China campaign.			"

												Note: Summary at the bottom of the review.Originally launched as an expansion to Shadowrun Returns, Dragonfall - Director's Cut brings a lot of improvements to what is itself a considerable improvement over the first Shadowrun game from Harebrained Schemes. It is refreshing to see a developer that not only listens to the fans, but does something about their feedback! Even more impressive is their decision to give this version for free to those who already bought Dragonfall as an expansion.Like the original, Dragonfall serves up a big slice of isometric turn-based strategy fun set in the dystropian / utopian (strike based on your views) Shadowrun universe. Magic once again meets technology, and in the shadows of megacorporations people struggle to survive, or even thrive. The cast features very interesting characters, each with their own backstory and motivations. Also like the original, this is worth a replay for its story, though the story is larger and better in almost every way in Dragonfall.Pro:*A stand-alone improvement on the expansion which was already an improvement on the original game.*A setting that never fails to engage, regardless of whether you hate or love the way the world has become in Shadowrun.*A developer that not only listens but actually acts upon feedback, and actively supports the community.*A community that releases new content using the game creation tools and assets that the developers released free of charge with the game.*The same exellent character portraits, with more thrown in!*Good, solid turn-based mechanics.*You can once again build your character's stats and abilities as you want them, or just use the pre-defined classes.Con:*Still only one campaign, though many more avaliable through the community. Dare we hope for an expansion to this, or better yet, a sandbox mode?*While the in-game models have gotten some new hairstyles, they still clash a bit with the exellent character portraits (especially for the orcs and trolls).Summary:This is an improvement in almost every way. If you own the original and liked it, this is for you. If you like classic isometric TBS games, this is for you. If you like the Shadowrun universe, this is for you. If the idea of cyberpunk or a setting that mixes fantasy and sci-fi, this is for you. While it may not be perfect, it is very, very good at what it does. 8/10 -Recomended!For more recomendations and reviews: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/strandedkerbonaut#curation "

												Pros/Cons+ Huge improvement over Shadowrun Returns+ Well written characters+ Lots of worldbuilding+ Choices in which missions to take and how to approach them+ Cover system actually works- Accuracy system still broken- Equipment, cyberware, and decking still limited- Frustrating endgame levels- Missions often still fairly linearShadowrun: Dragonfall hay have started life as DLC for Shadowrun Returns, but Dragonfal is an enormous improvement over the latter. Returns was a decent strategy RPG, but was criticized for being short and linear, for player choice being too limited, and for having shallow characters. The developers at Hairbrained Schemes listened to player feedback and succeeded in remedying many of these problems.With the story, the writers have taken inspiration from the Bioware RPGs, particularly Mass Effect and Dragon Age. The game is made up of missions which are largely self-contained. They tell their own little individual stories, but the plot is mostly standard. This is a character driven story, not plot driven. Your team and the hub area are made up of a motley crew of mages, soldiers, deckers, and privateers. Characterization is developed entirely through optional dialogue between missions. Everyone’s got a tragic backstory, but it never strays too far into the maudlin or the ridiculous. These are genuinely interesting characters that you’ll want to learn more about, and it’s all intricately tied into the world of Shadowrun.Speaking of which, there are heaps of worldbuilding here. Anyone with any interest in the larger Shadowrun universe should find a lot to like in Dragonfall. There’s something new to learn in every dialogue encounter, around every corner, and in every mission.The missions, or runs, have also been greatly improved. The player is given a choice of which runs to take and when, and within those runs the player often has a number of ways to approach goals, usually dependent on their character’s skills. After a certain point, usually when the shooting starts, the levels become more linear and straightforward. That’s a little disappointing, but combat itself has also improved. The cover system makes a real difference now, meaning that unit position actually matters. And simply playing with characters that you know and care about, that each have their own unique personalities and abilities, makes goign on runs more fun, unlike in Returns when your teams were made up of genericfaceless side characters. It’s a huge disappointment that the accuracy system still doesn’t make sense, though. My character is still often missing with a supposed 86% chance to hit, which is consistently frustrating.Other problems haven’t been given the same attention as the runs and story. Cyberware still feels limited. The limit on how many pieces of equipment you can use is very strict, and many of the actual pieces of cybwerware don’t seem to have much of an effect on combat. Options for weapons, spells, and outfits are all still barebones. Runs are fun, but more options in how to equip the player character and your team would go a long way towards making each experience different.At least, runs are fun up to a point. The final few missions take a noticeable downward turn. You no longer have much an option in which missions to take or how to approach them. The difficulty spikes through lame, cheap methods. Instead of putting together a complex situation for the player to overcome, the only challenge in late game missions comes from the game throwing larger and larger groups of generic enemies at the player, and eventually just endlessly respawning groups of faceless thugs.These missions are frustrating and boring, and sour what up that point is a fantastic experience. The options given to the player begin to be too limited again. You’ll be funneled through series of corridors, constantly outnumbered, outgunned, and never have the choice of bringing more than four of your team along at a time.Besides the last couple hours of the game, the campaign is a blast to play, though. It lacks replay value, but the main campaign took me a good twenty-five hours to complete, which makes the game a great value at fifteen dollars. This is an easy recommendation to any fans of the genre, fans of the Shadowrun universe, or fans of Shadowrun Returns. Feel free to skip Returns. Dragonfall is better in every possible way.			"

												I've really liked  Shadowrun Returns  - but this game is much better. It's the same magical cyberpunk setting, but the F-State of Berlin allows much more freedom in decision-making and shadowrunning. There are always solutions suitable for your playstyle - be it Elven Conjurer, Human Street Samurai or Troll Physical Adept (Troll Biotech Specialists are also there for the challenge). Even non-violent solutions are availble - and profitable. And I really like team management - there are personal quests as well as leveling-ups with branching perk choices. AND there's much work for deckers!This game is must have, must play, must love (unless you hate Shadowlands for some reason - but even then give it a try for the great tactical gameplay).			"

I'd like to play through with different skills, but it's a bit linear to have that kind of replay value.I'm probably going to play a few of the community mod stories too, some of which look as good or better than the main campaign.

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is my favorite isometric RPG of a year with many other good releases. Its setting combines a cyberpunk corporatist dystopia with fantasy and magic in interesting ways. You lead a group of shadowrunners doing wetwork off the books for megacorporations while trying to combat a threat posed by a long-dead dragon. The writing in Dragonfall is excellent all around with surprisingly deep backstories for party members, interesting conversations (with choices and skills/attributes) and a story that keeps you on your toes and has multiple endings. The game takes place in Berlin with a home base in Kreuzberg (not recognizable) and missions that take you to other districts. Combat is turn-based with a system similar to the new XCOM. The missions are well paced with moments of exploration and gathering clues between combat scenarios. Dragonfall is not an open world RPG but its loose mission structure and fairly big hub (Kreuzberg) make it feel more like one than it really is.I would definitely recommend this to any fan of isometric RPGs with good writing.Notes: This is the improved stand-alone version of the second (much bigger and better) campaign for Shadowrun Returns. It lasts a good 15-20 hours or so. This version does not include the original Dead Man's Switch campaign from Shadowrun Returns.			"

												I've really liked  Shadowrun Returns  - but this game is much better. It's the same magical cyberpunk setting, but the F-State of Berlin allows much more freedom in decision-making and shadowrunning. There are always solutions suitable for your playstyle - be it Elven Conjurer, Human Street Samurai or Troll Physical Adept (Troll Biotech Specialists are also there for the challenge). Even non-violent solutions are availble - and profitable. And I really like team management - there are personal quests as well as leveling-ups with branching perk choices. AND there's much work for deckers!This game is must have, must play, must love (unless you hate Shadowlands for some reason - but even then give it a try for the great tactical gameplay).			"

												What a beautiful game! Having inhaled the Shadowrun novel series back in the late 90s, this brings back memories of old. The Dragonfall campaign keeps close to my heart, as it is set in places i know pretty well. The graphics are neat, the sound appropriate, gameplay is about 25h, but the best thing is the story telling and the world it is set in. The Director's Cut adds a few more missions than the original Dragonfall, notably ones which dig deepter into your teammates' past. You also get a slightly improved combat interface, well done!There are some technical issues on Linux:- Every time you start Steam, the game tries to sync, preventing playing or installing anything else for about a minute.- Every time you start the game, you need to change the screen resolution and then cancel that action for the previously configured resolution to have an effect.- You cannot exit the game, it needs to be killed manually.

												Any fan of RPGs, SRPGs, or Turn Based Strategies in general should definately give this a shot. The original was a blast in spite of some visual bugs, and then they hand us this gem for free! The story has the perfect balance of non-linearity and great story-telling, which is rare in this genre. The story and gameplay combine into an awesome combination of progression that is increadibily addicting. The original was a good 20-30 hours, and this Director's Cut apparently adds even more content. Add that to a never-ending stream of quality user-generated content in the fully supported Steam Workshop, and this game would be worth  the money at double the cost. The dialogue system is also unique, where knowing a lot about knifes or drones can open up new converstation options.  The only con, is that the combat itself can sometimes feel a little lack-luster. There's cover, and a slew of custom abilities and equipment, but I find every other aspect of the game more enjoyable.			"

												I liked the idea of the modern world mixed with fantasy. This has a very interesting urge for me to try out not just games like this but reminds me of Arcanum Steamworks and Magica (which is like this, except for the fact that it's like the 18th century mixed with magic and races that you would expect to see only in a standard RPG).This is cool though, as it is not just in modern day mixed with orcs, humans, dwarves, elves and trolls like world of warcraft, but also forty years in the future and not in the U.S. which brings it a nice international feel.Thus I like this, but a few things. I am ok with turn based games, because I grew up with them. However other players have to like turn based combat.Secondly it is pretty good, overall as I just said, however, on some missions, like the one I am on right now helping blitz, I will say a few things. I played this on normal and the combat is too hard.At least it was for me, so I had to play on easy. Also again I wish there were recommendations on exactly what to bring with you on a mission, such as a ton of medical kits, because what was suppose to be a easy run helping blitz pay back a debt, has turned out pretty wickedly hard.Outside of that, I would of liked to have seen a few more races, like if forty or some years has passed, since this awakening, and magic came back to world and now you have orcs, dwarves, elves, and trolls as well as humans, I would have liked to see some half stuff. Such as half elves, half orcs, half trolls etc. Though the orcs and trolls and elves in the game already look like human beings just with some slight differences, (nice touch with the horns) with trolls for instance, maybe half-golems, (like half stone golems; half water elemental humans,;centaur people;) and also what about goblins? Full and half goblins would have been nice? Maybe again this is too much, but maybe in a future game that is continuing off where this game leaves off? The metahumans could have undergone more changes, making them really appear more orc and troll like, (such as in world of warcraft) and the half orcs, trolls, and maybe goblins could be somewhere in between.Anyway maybe in a future game where it's like five to ten years later, meaning in 2064? As of right now this game is overall pretty good.I would give it a B+ to A-.			"

												Best RPG based computer game I've played in a long, long time.To being with the storytelling is in a league of its own: you are allowed as a player to make the kinds of decisions that affect gameplay going forward, throughout, and in many different ways. Because of the multiple character types and the depth of story telling and that aforementioned ability to make decisions, there is a high degree of re-playability here. The multiple plot twists were well conceived and in some cases so perfectly concealed that my jaw dropped a few times.Combine that with some very challenging scenarios and tightly timed sequences which add an excitement factor rare in games these days (many seem too concerened with getting to the cut scene at all cost), I can only hope this series continues on (a Hong Kong Shadowrun would be magnificent!) and perhaps that some effort is made to bridge these iterations together in future so that character importing would be possible.Loved this. My first Dragonfall character was a Trollish Physical Adept - not much on detective skills, but laying my fists to the enemy was fun: manos de piedra! Think my next go-round will be a custom-build technomancer type. "

												This is a first impression review, and I'll update as I get deeper into the game. Dragon fall has a great old school feel to it, while still have a nice clean look and feel to it. Character creation is very well done in that you can go with a template, or roll your own which I always apprecaite in a game like this. Calling this a strait turn based RPG doesn't do it justice, as it feels much more strategic than just clicking abilities. To me it feels like XCOM meets Cyberpunk which is awesome. I would warn that there is a bit of reading in this game, which I enjoy, but if that's not your thing you might want to stay away. If I had one negative, about the game, it would be nice to have a little more keyboard control. If there are keyboard shortcuts I haven't discovered them yet, but I honestly didn't take time to look into it to deep.			"

												In a great many ways an amazing follow-up and in almost all ways an improvement to the game for which it exists as ""DLC."" However, make no mistake this game is bigger, more involved, and a much richer experience than its predecessor. Better UI, fully fleshed-out companions and a fabulous open mission structure in the middle of the game all at truly fantastic elements to the formula set out in SR.  The pacing on a couple of missions can feel a bit grindy (MKVI is a undoubtedly a slog and the final missions can seem like a lot of fights placed after the other) so I still personally prefer the original coors. However, other than a couple of frustrating fight-heavy missions that slow the story down this game is a true jewel.			"

												One of the best RPGs I've ever played. It's a bit short (only about 25 hours or so), and I wish there was voice acting. The storytelling is tight, the characters are well thought out and written, and the flow of the action is fantastic. I never once got bored. If you like the Shadowrun setting or are a fan of cyberpunk, you will likely love this game.			"

												The DLC version of this game is simply fantastic. The Director's Cut is the culmination of HBS' response to the feedback from the community and fans. It was nearly perfect before the standalone release. Now we can look forward to more content and polished and improved versions of the existing? Mind. Blown.High-Quality Dialogue, Story, Combat, Equipment, Progression, Discovery, and even some painful moral quandaries were found within. It is an absolute steal for the price, and while I do not normally replay game very much after I complete them, this one will have me replaying each archetypical character build to experience the feel of the improved content from various perspectives, both regarding combat and PC personality.

												The ""Must Have"" Indie game of the year.  Arguably the best cyberpunk videogame of the decade. Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut is an excellent tribute to William Gibson's Sprawl. Reminiscent of timeless classics such as Deus Ex, and Planescape: Torment.Included is a powerful game editor that we fans use to modify, edit and even create entirely separate cyberpunk stories of our own. The Workshop is full of potential and already has an active community, many of which are avid readers and writers devoted to tell their story.Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut is an ambitious project and HBS has delivered. The atmosphere, writing, and music are extremely high artistic quality, and shows fans that HBS has ""The Heart,"" and talent to make immersive campaigns.Buy Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut now!

												This game...You might argue that the graphics are too simple, or that the action isn't comparable to next-gen RPGs, but the writing... gentlemen... the writing in this game (Dragonfall, not Dead Man's Switch) is the best I've seen since Baldur's Gate. I dare say, even better.You see, nostalgia would have you say that Baldur's Gate is superior, but the truth is that like the cartoons we watched when young, the plots and characters aren't as good as our nostalgia-ridden memories would suggest. Shadowrun: Dragonfall raises the bar and gives us believeable characters and really interesting choices in the game. The ending can be VERY different depending on what your choices where during the game, putting triple A titles like Mass Effect to shame.Bottom line, if you are into good storytelling, and even if you aren't familiar with the world of Shadowrun (I wasn't), you'll find Dragonfall to be a delightful game. It's the kind of game that makes you afraid of finishing it, because you know you'll miss it's characters and setting.The game clocks at around 20+ hours and there's an editor included. Though it isn't as user friendly as - say - the NWN2 editor, there's some really talented (and patient) people out there producing UGC (User Generated Content) that can extend the life-time of this game for at least another 20 hours or more.Thank you Harebrained Games for a great experience, hope to see more of you soon.PD: Did I mention these guys released the Director's Cut version FOR FREE to owners of the original version? FREE DLC? And it's not hats or some other stupid prop that nobody cares about but ACTUAL game content? Hell... in a time when every big-time company wants to shove paid DLC down your throat, it's refreshing change.			"

												Shadowrun Returns was part of the vanguard of the 2013/2014 resurgence of the computer RPG and while the mechanics were well implemented, the story felt flat and linear. This is something Harebrained tackled head-on with the Dragonfall DLC, later released as a stand-alone product. While it doesn't hold a candle to some of the behemoth open world CRPGs out there, there's a great deal more optional interaction to be discovered in Dragonfall versus the original Dead Man's Switch campaign.More than the breadth of the world, Dragonfall really adds to its depth as well. The characters and dialog are uncommonly good. If you take the time to get to know the runners on your crew, you'll find a wealth of well-thought-out backstories doled out throughout the game in well-measured helpings. I would venture that this game performs well when viewed in the light of gender equality, as well. While the Sixth World can be an exploitive place, the game empowers you to do something about that. Dragonfall features a number of meaningful major roles for women, and their roles and backgrounds perform well against with-a-pink-bow and bechdel examinations. This game isn't making a statement about gender equality (because it's in no way ""about"" that), but I applaud it for executing its goals well while demonstrating that a quality title doesn't need to play into shallow tropes.I've been reading the Shadowrun core rulebook for the pen & paper game to get a group started with some friends, many of whom are newbies to P&P RPGs, let alone Shadowrun. I've recommended this game to get them familiar with the universe. I'm very much looking forward to the next installation from HBG.			"

												The short: Text-heavy, but with excellent writing. Smooth combat, lots of options, extremely flexible character creation model. Recommended, particularly for RPG and tactics gamers.The Director's Cut of Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a lighthearted, fun, and extremely playable RPG.  While visual effects are a little on the sparse side (no between-act cinematics a la Diablo here!), the world nevertheless feels like a living thing, and it's a pleasure to explore. The game's writing does an excellent job of keeping a player engaged, and develops a very solid, likeable, and extremely replayable setting. Hacking ('decking'), close combat, guns, and magic all mix together into a variety of player strategies, providing a broad set of options to get past each mission's obstacles.The gameplay feels smooth and solid, particularly with the Director's Cut revamp of the user interface. Everything is presented in an intuitive and easy-to-navigate manner, and the combat feels similar to other successes like XCOM, Fire Emblem, and other grid-based tactical games.The real advantage of Shadowrun Returns, as always, is the potential for user-created content. Shadowrun Returns is more of a foundation than anything else--with a handy, built-in campaign to show what it's capable of. The original Shadowrun Returns had a handful of extremely popular user-created campaigns available in short order, and I have high hopes for the Director's Cut content to come from Shadowrun's fan base. With these, the possibilities are endless. Although I have high hopes for future campaigns coming out of Harebrained Schemes, I'm sure that the game's fanbase will provide more than enough content to keep me occupied for a long, long time.

												*Just* finished my first playthrough. Absolutely fantastic game that expanded upon the original. Harebrained comes out once again with exceptional writing and storytelling that immerses you despite a lack of complex cinematic movies in-game. Highly recommend thinking of a ""persona"" for your character during the creation and making decisions based around that. Decisions can matter! The overall game might not change substantially, yet you and a friend can talk over great differences (from level events to story arcs) in comparing different playthroughs. Can't wait for more.			"

												I love this game. It's probably my favorite game. Having said that you should know that I grew up playing the SNES version of Shadowrun, and at that time, it too was one of my favorite games of my childhood. When I heard they were making a new version that was going to have the style of gameplay and heart of that game I was sold.Now having played it, many times over, I can't stop but reminisce of my times as a young adult playing the SNES version. In doing so have jumped into a time machine of happiness. This is one of the reasons why I love the game. I transports me back to the time when I was a kid, falling in love with a world that sparked my imagination. I've heard some nit-picking about certain elements of the game, among of which are having to actually READ THE DIALOGUE. To comments like this I have no real response, only bafflement. As to some of the other more constructive criticisms I have heard they have also been heard by HBS. Heard, and dealt with. HBS seems to be the right people behind this project and I applaud them for both the resulting game and their continued determination to make it even better. I marked on the calendar the day the Directors Cut was coming out and have been playing it every moment I can get away.As I said earlier, I love this game, it is probably my favorite game. I also appreciate the passion behind the making of it and look forward to supporting it as long as HBS continues to generate content. Which if you reading this HBS: PLEASE CONTINUE. I BEG OF THEE!

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is easily one of the better turnbased RPG's I've played recently. The setting is probably the best part, I've never played any tabletop Shadowrun, but it seems very cool. Keeps a lot of the flair of the older Fallout games, with great story telling, and a nice helping of humor thrown in.Combat is good, though some times a little frustrating when you whiff 3 attacks in a row. The only slow bits are the hacking fights, I just can't get into to the whole matrix thing.Overall, a very excellent game. Easily a 9/10.			"

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut is a definite must play for any cyberpunk fan and one of my top 20 RPG's of all time. The story is executed perfectly and never out of place in this masterfully crafted world. Characters motivations feel natural and organic, in no small part to the expert writing. And the combat has been improved greatly over the original Dragonfall, the system working behind the scenes to determine combat statistics seems quite a bit more streamlined. I unabashedly recommend this game for any Sci-Fi, RPG or any gamer who enjoys well crafted, intelligent digital entertainment.			"

												This is a strong adaptation of Shadowrun that delivers a very good campaign with an interesting set of companion characters.  Dragonfall manages to improve considerably on Shadowrun Returns in many respects, so if you have tried that already be assured that this instalment is a big jump in quality and storytelling.  Dragonfall was initially a very expansive DLC expansion for Shadowrun Returns, this Directors Cut is a standalone game that has again been considerably upgraded and expanded making it closer to a full sequel. (If you bought Dragonfall before, you will find this added to your Steam library for free).The game also includes a powerful editor allowing players to create their own content.  Like the Directors Cut, the editor has also been upgraded which should allow for the community to continue creating plenty of additional content.  I think this is very good value for money and well worth a shot for any sci-fi RPG fan.			"

												This is the DLC turned full sequel for Shadowrun Returns. So what does that mean ?Short version: If you liked the original Shadowrun Returns, and you didn't get the expansion yet, you will want to pick this up as it's an improvement all the way.If you already had the DLC, you'll have gotten this stand-alone version for free. If you never played Shadowrun Returns, but are looking at a decently priced RPG fix, start here.Shadowrun, for the uninitiated, is a Cyberpunk setting where the players normally run around as mercenaries, looking for the next big paycheck, unravelling various corporate conspiracies, and occasionally saving the world. So you have cybernetically enhanced warriors, hackers, drone riggers and such. The big twist is that in this setting, magic returned to the world in 2012, giving rise to metahumans (elves, dwarves, orcs & trolls) and Awakened people (various kinds of spellcasters), opening up the possibility of being invaded by spirits and other stuff normally found in fantasy settings. Mix all that into a cohesive whole, and you have Shadowrun at it's best.Shadowrun Returns did a fair job at laying the foundation, and the editor provided resulted in a good amount of user-created content. The problem was that the main campaign, Dead Man Switch, wasn't very well balanced and had a nasty case of Bad Plot Twist.  Where it did work well, it showed you can basically the combat system from XCOM: Enemy Unkown and build a fully-functional RPG with turn-based combat out of that, complete with branching dialogs, non-linear scenarios, NPC management etc. Then came the Dragonfall DLC, which is a new campaign, moving the setting to a new city with new characters (in-game hints suggest it runs parallel to Dead Man Switch time-wise). It came with much stronger writing and much better level design, to the point where it competes with classics such as Baldur's Gate and/or Planescape: Torment. It also does a much better job at driving home the gray-and-grey morality of the settings. And now, that DLC got expanded, and was released running on an upgraded version of the game engine. That's the director's cut. It includes more missions, tying in to your regular team members and/or the setting's background, a revamped UI that's more convenient in how it lays out the various skills, the ability to select upgrades for your crew, expanded combat systems , and a bunch of other small improvents.The total package almost makes the first Shadowrun Returns obsolete. I say almost, because although this edition still comes with the editor, user generated content from the Shadowrun Returns needs to be converted and republished by the authors, so there's a risk you'll lose out on your favorite user-made campagin			"

												*Just* finished my first playthrough. Absolutely fantastic game that expanded upon the original. Harebrained comes out once again with exceptional writing and storytelling that immerses you despite a lack of complex cinematic movies in-game. Highly recommend thinking of a ""persona"" for your character during the creation and making decisions based around that. Decisions can matter! The overall game might not change substantially, yet you and a friend can talk over great differences (from level events to story arcs) in comparing different playthroughs. Can't wait for more.			"

												Amazing.Best cyber-pung game, I actualy opened ShadowRun universe with these two games (SR:Returns and DragonFall).Dragonfall has amazing plot, dialoges, humor, conspiracies. Many times the twist of storyline made my jaw drop.I do recomend buy both Shadowrun Returns and DragonFall for those who are realy fans of:-cyberpunk (it is better than Deus Ex, believe me)-rpg (lots of characters with their stories, as for you own character, he/she do not have much opportunities to florish as a person)-tactics (this game is not that hard even on very hard mode, but there were some missions that made me frustrate before finding solution)-PLOT and narration (ShadowRun Returns is some kind of noir detective story with cliches like femma fatale, vengeance, private detectives etc. these things brings tears of nostalgia into my eyes. DragonFall is more ""adult"" story, with much more refined characters. "

												Fifty hours for one run through of this game. Better than the original content: Deadman's Switch (which was actually pretty good, so that's saying something). More options on how to solve problems on runs. In fact there were several times I was happy I had put lots of points into Charisma. This storyline offered much better integration of netrunning, which is important to me as that's what I like to play. Same engine as the original, but new content in a fantatiscaly twisted plot line that keeps you guessing until the end!  A job well done, and definately recommended for anyone who's a fan of shadow run, and/or CRPGs. I'm not even a huge fan of either, but I really enjoyed this game because it is a quality game all the way around.			"

												An improvement in almost every way over the original Returns, Dragonfall keeps a much more cohesive story whilst simultaneously granting the player more freedom. Providing a handful of standard party members for every run instead of just popping up a list of nobodies helps make the game feel more like the adventures of a runner team, complete with the option to pick and choose what runs they'll be going on. Camaraderie is the name if the game, and with every member of the team having their personalities and backstories to explore, the player gains a vested interest in seeing everything through to its end.Hats off to Dietrich, the realest dude in the Flux State			"

												This has turn based combat and definitely has the right Shadowrun look and feel.  Oh and Dragons.  <--- not a spoiler, it's in the frickin' title.If you like turn based role playing games, and/or are a Shadowrun fan - you may enjoy this game so... read on then go buy it.Caveat: I'm not quite finished the storyline yet.  It's been a pretty fun game so far.  I'll finish it up someday.  Honest.  I'm at the end of Shadow of Mordor and haven't finished that yet either.  It'll happen someday.So, Dragonfall.  I find it feels a lot like the pen and paper Shadowrun game I used to play.  I plan on going through at least part of the storyline again.  When I do I'll be re-making one of my tabletop characters just to see if I can get the character to turn out the way the pen and paper version did.  Not sure if it'll work, but just thinking about it brings back memories of the players, and characters, from that particular game.  This game gets a +1 just for makin' me all nostalgic.When I started Dragonfall I kind of had the plan to make a non-cyberware based street samurai, but I wound up making a mage who also uses pistols and was quite pleased at how it turned out.  The team you run with is fun, overall, and you get to choose who you bring with you.  That can significantly change how you approach some parts of certain levels.  With one character you can send a drone through air ducts to flank an enemy but wIth another you can hang back, bait the enemy in and snipe them.I really like how they incorporated the matrix runs for deckers.  In the table-top game it was tedious for four or five players to sit there watching someone do a run becuase a decker could do so many actions in a combat round while jacked in.  In this game the decker gets a couple turns of cyber-combat then the game goes back to the action in the physical world.  I personally thing it was handled really well, and it's fun.  I'd usually try to do the cyber-combat without using any support programs, but sometimes using them just made a decking run way, way easier.Stats are represented well, and each skill seems to be useful, even etiquettes can sometimes significantly change the way parts of the game turn out.  That and not having the proper etiquette makes you sometimes frown because instead of that additional intelligence of body point you COULD have bought Corporate Etiquette and talked your way around a fight, or tricked someone into letting you bypass a security door.  It's wonderful to have the option.Combat and cover mechanics are handled fairly well, too.  The stun grenades got annoying at times, but it adds another element to the combat and makes you really watch your positions.  If you spread out just enough you can avoid multiple characters being hit by grenades.  The weapon variety is okay, and you can ""lend"" weapons to your team-mates on a per-run basis if they have a spare slot.  This was a nice addition and opens up more combat options.  I never felt like I had to give anyone a weapon, though, as each character is competent.  You also get to make choices for the NPCs in your team when they level up, the game doesn't arbitrarily assign their skill choices.As always, get it on sale if you're not sure but this one is worth the full price, if for nothing else to simply support the Devs. who I think have done a great job bringing Shadowrun up to speed.

												Another great installment in the cyberpunk world of the Shadowrun RPG:TL:DR;-setting: successful fusion of Dungeons and Dragons and the film Bladerunner (game setting was developed on the tail of that era, obviously derived)-stylish read-along in a detail-rich setting, not much ""choices matter"" here-easy to learn, fun turn-based isometric rpg-best suited for: anyone looking for a short, lite rpg or anyone curious about the Shadowrun setting-""STORY RICH""Much like its predecessor, Shadowrun Returns, the game was what precisely what I expected: short and sweet, stylish, with simple, yet effective, and fun game turn-based rpg mechanics. Building on what the previous installment had to offer, this storyline gave more of a feeling of making choices that changed the outcome of the narrative.Shadowrun Returns wet my appetite for sleek futuristic fantasy world of Shadowrun, one I had long known of but never previously delved into, and Dragonfall was another enjoyable foray deeper into that world. I can assure you, with this last keystroke, that I am immediately off to play the latest installment in the series, grinning from ear to ear in anticipation of more Shadowrun goodness. I can't believe I was missing out on this setting all these years. Great work again Harebrained Schemes! Keep 'em comin'!			"

												If you like reading more than anything else - get this game. It's like an interactive sci-fi novel with a bit of an actual ""gaming process"". So you read for about 45 min (sometimes more), than you get a 15 min (sometimes less) fight. Comparing to the 1st game it has some significant improvements: it's longer, you can level up your party members now, you get new weapons (sniper rifles and melee weapons) and of course you get more read. A lot more.P.S. If you are a cat person - you may be dissapointed.			"

												I was a little worried when Dragonfall came out; that it wouldn't escape the shadow of it's forebear for me. I loved Harebrained Scheme's Shadowrun Returns, to the point where this was only in sobering afterthought after it started downloading.It was a couple hours into it, I believe, that I began wondering which of the two I loved more, eventually settling on the notion that both are simply lovely, and I'm fortunate to have had them in my life. Someone poured through source material books, finding beautiful pieces of lost and lingering lore, and updated them for a majestic new setting.

												This game is FLIPPING INCREDIBLE. It's a classic-style RPG filled with complex moral choices, story consequences for those choices, and exciting moral dilemmas all over the place. The combat is strong, the exploration elements act in aid of the story, and the environments feel rich and filled with small, important details. The characters are rich, party members and incidental characters alike, and many of the lategame dialogue scenes are so chillingly well written you'll debate what to say with a sense of genuine empathy-slash-anxiety. To return to the combat, it's a really satisfying tactical experience: not the best in the genre, but far above the RPG standard for certain. You've likely seen tactical combat like this before - action points, light/half/full cover to crouch behind, special abilities, consumable grenades and medkits - but it's executed to a high degree of competency, and preserving your squad through a gruelling shadowrun with good positioning and smart use of their limited resources feels great. Customising your characters' abilities, through advancements and decisions made on their personal quests, lets you strike up unique synergies between squadmates that feel uniquely yours: by the end of the game, your preferred shadowrunning squad will feel like a well-oiled unit with a playbook of diverse strategies. Even then, the combat is just a satisfying aperitif to the excellent world and story, which are certain to draw you in and leave you dazzled with their perspicacity. A gigantic success and a triumph of the genre, Dragonfall is absolutely one of the best games of its kind ever made. Play it!			"

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is effectively a giant DLC, the size of another game, for Shadowrun: Returns.  Because of this, most praise and criticism in my review of Shadowrun: Returns applies to this game as well.  This review will primarily focus on the changes.Some aspects of the design were improved.Shadowrun: Dragonfall is less linear than Shadowrun: Returns, and most important decisions you make will affect the ending.Several new weapons and spells have been added.You can now save at will, outside combat and conversations.Other aspects of the design are disappointing.I was hoping for more new weapons, spells, and armor, and perhaps other positive changes in the combat system (more statuses, called shots, a matrix that feels different from meatspace, etc.).Most music is reused from Shadowrun: Returns.  Yes, it was good.  Yes, some new tracks were added.  Yes, they are of similar quality.  It still feels disappointing.The Bloodlines quest has an infuriating stealth segment.  Guards literally seem to have eyes in the back of their head, such that you will be spotted even if they are facing away from you, unless there is a wall in-between.  The guards patrol very quickly, making it hard to get past them in time, even when you know what needs to be done.  Worst of all, your train of companions cannot be directly controlled and will frequently get spotted.  This should have either been turn-based, with proper vision cones, or removed.The developers have clearly favored a small number of possible builds for the main character and party.  Players without clairvoyance will be punished for deviating from the favored builds mid to late game.  Having to start over, after investing so much time, is likely to prevent many people from enjoying the game.Since you now have a large number of companions, you will want to play a build that is not redundant.  The only main character builds that are not redundant are adepts (still somewhat redundant due to Glory) and mages (recommended).You better buy and keep any tasers you find, and any other action point damaging weapons or spells.  Be sure that most if not all party members (not just your main character) have a way to cause AP damage.  It will be almost impossible to win the final battle otherwise.			"

												I didn't play Dragonfall until well after it came out where I played Shadowrun Returns almost entirely within the first week it came out; something about the advertising and the art just didn't catch me.  And then, on a whim, I dove in - and it's one of the best RPG stories in recent memory, while addressing many of the issues with Shadowrun Returns.To give context within the series of games, Shadowrun Returns felt like a nostalgia trip while Hong Kong felt like an excellent role playing session with friends - fun, a little impractical, with a lot of loose ends that don't get quite tired up satisfactorily and have to be explained by the GM.Dragonfall feels like Shadowrun if Joss Whedon decided he wanted to blow your mind with a complex mystery that makes you think you know where it's going - until you realize you didn't, because the Big Bad wasn't even who you were looking at.  It's phenomenally written, with characters you learn to love with backstories that make them relatable and interesting.  Better yet, it's morally ambiguous and some of the biggest choices are the ones that leave you uneasy in the end - one of the final scenes of the game has been stuck in the back of my head for weeks as one of the most genuinely creepy, threatening things I can think of.  With no caveats at all, Dragonfall is a blast and a story more people should get to experience - one of my favorite RPG experiences in years.			"

												What an incredible story.  I finally just finished this game and I can't recommend it enough to someone that enjoys a good tale.  It helps if you have previous knowledge of Shadowrun lore, but even still, I'm sure it would not disappoint if you're willing to put forth the effort and hear what everyone has to say.I feel like I know every character in the game personally.  Each one of them is very fleshed out and shines in their own particular way.  They are all so very unique and getting to know them throughout the game is a pleasure.  It feels like what you choose to say and how you say it truly makes a difference on your relationship with them.  I've never experienced that in another game before.  Everything else is just icing on the cake.  The character development, both yourself and NPCs, the deep turn-based combat, the unique art style, the variety of the missions, the heavy choices with even heavier consequences, and the soundtrack.  All fantastic, but the writing is the true gem here.  I feel like I've just read a novel after finishing the game, and I believe it will stick with me for a very long time.I highly recommend Shadowrun: Dragonfall, and I will positively be purchasing Shadowrun: Hong Kong.  I cannot wait to dive back into the Shadowrun universe.  A truly magnificent place to turn loose the wandering mind.			"

												this was my first shadowrun game but I've been playing turn based rpg's since falloutpros- amazing story and plenty of unexpected twists with many different choices and consequences- well fleshed out characters all with their own personalities and histories, I thought Glory was an especially well done character from her background- excellent music.- the graphics engine is clear and detailed enough for a game of this budget- combat and animation is fair though not really as good as something like x-com- enemy unknowncons - very restrictive party customization, you can't upgrade or swap your followers gear, very limited in what you can give them and limited upgrade choices, don't have any control over their actual stats, can't trade items in game. Though this was a developers choice it's pretty much it caused alot of disinterest in replaying- alot of reading text, this wasn't a problem for me but if people don't like reading they aren't going to like this game.- didn't really like the cyber combat sections, gets old because it's pretty easy but repetitive and too long- you can't sell old weapons/extra objects you don't use anymore, there's some really backward annoying design decisions in this gameoverall really great rpg 8/10			"

												The game mostly improves on its already good predecessor.+ Great story and characters.+ Side characters are more developped.+ Game is slightly less linear.+ Non-combat attributes matter more.- The music is still dull and repetitive.- One level in particular is quite repetitive (Apex rising).- The game lacks basic information about ingame items (ex: shared cooldowns on injectors)			"

												UPDATE: I have to change my review... the game is broken when you reach a certain point. Constant bugs with changes to inventory not being managed and, worst of all, game 'freezes' where characters don't respond to commands causing you to lose all your progress. This is really bad and happens on end-game missions that are the longest and most difficult ones. I just lost 2h of gameplay on one of the last missions due to this bug. This has been reported by other players since 2014. I can't recommend the game until this is fixed.The game has great visuals and good (but not stellar) storyline. Character customization is not very deep, but good enough (although customizing your crew uses a different system which takes a bit to get used to).Weakest point, IMO, is the combat system with awkward cover and line of sight mechanics (there's no cover where you would expect and line of sight sometimes makes no sense).If you enjoy XCOM combat mechanics and/or want a decent cyberpunk story, I would recommend.

												I thought Shadowrun: Returns was an impressive game, but Dragonfall makes it look like a mere proof of concept.Combining an outstanding plot, a remarkable amount of content (much of which is easily missed), multiple ways to solve quests (particularly non-violent solutions, given that combat awards neither experience nor loot), memorable characters, distinct differences in character builds and solid mechanics, this is one of the best RPGs I've played,It's not flawless - loading times are slow, some mechanics are poorly explained and there are lingering bugs, but every great RPG has a few rough edges. This is a game well worth experiencing.			"

												I tend to hate turn-based tactical games. Some games that thrill most fans of the genre feature horrible miss chances on normal difficulty, squad members who have no personalities with weapons that are more interesting than the people wielding them, no personal investment, and a boring ""story"" make up that game (X-COM Enemy Unknown is an example of these things I detest). Also, though I played Shadowrun Returns, I thought it was okay, but a glitch made the game freeze at the start of a mission quite late into the game, and I wasn't having enough fun with the game to even bother restarting the mission to continue.Then came Shadowrun: Dragonfall. I lean toward detesting this genre, but holy crap, this game is great! All the drawbacks of X-COM Enemy Unknown that I mentioned above are nowhere to be found in this game. The miss/hit chances on normal are satisfying, you have characters who can boost those chances for the whole team or its individual members from the very start of the game, the characters are some of the very best I have ever seen in a video game, and the story is quite nice with twists and turns throughout. I will say, however, that the ending is a bit of a whimper, but it wasn't offensively bad (Mass Effect 3) or anything.Both in and out of combat, the characters are great. Each has things you don't know about them, and after every mission or two, you go back to a sort of home base and the city block that it's in, and you get to learn more about your team members. They have some really interesting stories...especially Glory.  Wow. All of the squad members and minor characters will generally have something new to say, and there is so much atmosphere. The NPCs look like crap in this game, but with the isometric view above, it's easy to just not care. the art of the areas is great, and the game's setting is so perfect. The game has this cyberpunk setting with an intriguing tone of simultaneous melancholy and hope.Not only did the backgrounds and the well-written characters draw me in, but the music is so atmospheric for the locations you visit and the events going on in-game, and the narration writing is superb...by that, I mean the word artistry  the game charms you with time and again. There is oodles of reading in this game, as there is no voice acting at all, but I honestly prefer it this way despite normally not having the patience to read fiction...like ever. The game's writing is seductive, I tell you!!! You just have to read the narration and dialog when you go to new places and talk to new characters. It's incredible.My biggest gripe about the game is probably the tight-waddedness of its ""Karma,"" which are the points you spend to make your character more powerful. The game is -really- tight on there points. I received 198, and that's with me doing every mission and side mission, and trying to milk every Karma gain I could find in the game by starting off with 6 Charisma and looking up beforehand on forums what the best 3 Etiquettes (speech specializations) were. If anyone is reading this who isn't going to play a Shaman, do NOT take Charisma above 4. You can buy armor in the northeast corner on a ""trial"" side mission for a group that wants to hire you in-game, and it gives you +2 Charisma while you wear it. I believe 6 was as high as I ever needed, and Security and Corporate are the best Etiquettes. The Gang Etiquette would let me spend a bunch of money to skip one fight that wasn't all that tough. Whoop-dee-doo. =/  I wish so much that someone could have convinced me to take Charisma 4 instead of 6. I BEG you, do not take Charisma 6.Back on topic, in closing, yeah, I typically hate this genre. However, Shadowrun: Dragonfall is magnificently atmospheric through its background, its music, all of the story except the -very- ending, the characters, and the gameplay was enjoyable even for someone such as myself who doesn't tend to like this sort of game.I do not give many games this high of a recommendation, and I generally dislike the genre this game belongs to. Therefore you, dear reader, can assuredly realize just how amazing this game was to drag this much adulation out of a hater of the genre such as myself.			"

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall does not quite match Baldur's Gates or Fallouts, but it is a rather good game.Shortly:- If you were disappointed in Shadowrun Returns, but you find the world of Shadowrun interesting, give it another chance with Dragonfall. For me Returns was a disappointment.- If you haven't played any of the Shadowrun tittles yet but are interested then do ""skip"" Shadowrun Returns (the first tittle, although, the stories are completely separate) and go with Dragonfall.I am familiar with the Shadowrun pen 'n' paper roleplay, but not really a fan of it. Still, the mood of the world behind the game is well captured and the storyline is solid. There are also additional companion missions, side missions and bonus objectives which are optional, although, some side missions (of your choice) have to be accepted in order to proceed in the main storyline. If only there was voice acting in the game, it would be so much better.Compared to the previous tittle - Shadowrun Returns - the Dragonfall fares a lot better. Several improvements to the gameplay have been made for a more enjoyable play. The NPCs in the team are more (meta)humane than previously, with more character to them. The game is less linear than Returns. There are some bigger choices and some smaller choices, some of which affect the game, but some are just immersion (which in itself is not necessarily a bad thing).Still, a few mechanics in the game are annoying, although, some of them can be worked around.The most annoying is perhaps that while out of combat (and able to move real time) you can only control the protagonist and the rest of the team follows. Firstly, This makes it impossible to pick up items with your team members. Inventory space is very limited so most items end up being send to your storage (no longer accessable during the mission). Secondly, the protagonist is always the one to open the door to an unexplored area. And thus ends up taking the first shots (and grenades and spells) from the enemies as the turn based combat begins. Not every protagonist is tough as nails. The second flaw can be worked around by spending points on Body (toughness) or getting heavier armor, but it's still bad game design, especially since the combat it advertised as tactical, but you can't arrange your team to a position in advance.

												One of the best storylines I've had the pleasure of playing in very long time. Interesting companion side stories, very grey and ambiguous decisions to make, amazing writing, and multiple endings where your decisons actually have meaning. I took my time with this one and put in around 30 hours on my first play through. All in all, very satisfying and entertaining.			"

												My favorite of the Shadowrun: Returns engine games so far. The writing nails the setting and the mood, even better than the original title did. The side stories for your NPCs are more interesting than the main story fo some games. I was particularly fond of Glory's backstory. Not at all what I was expecting. But then, everyone had a backstory that made them more interesting and less one-dimensional.So this game takes the solid, polished engine from the original Kickstarter title, and adds writing that is really quite good, finally adding a solid game to the franchse!

												This seems to be the best currently available Shadowrun game you can play at the moment, including Hong Kong. If you like Cyberpunkish stuff, Shadowrun, and tactical turn based games a little in the X-Com style, here you are. Some of the player content created for it is okay, but nothing exceptionally stand out yet. I'd suggest you wait for it to go on sale unless you got a big hankering for Shadowrun.			"

												I was disappointed with this entry. I am a big fan of the older Genesis game and hoping that I'd get to explore a city and go on many shadowruns like the Genesis game. Instead I ended up getting put onto an on-rails story in which I often ended up in a hub world where your base it located at, do your shopping, then get transported out for what ever run selection you are given. While I like the moral choices within the runs there just weren't a lot of them. You go through them quickly and then you are thrown into the end game. I personally lost motivation to continue on knowing that I have to storm the final base and my character isn't decked out in any cool cyberware because the game doesn't allow you to do so. What is even more irksome is when you can see other characters with certain cyberware you are unable to obtain.Shadowrun Dragon Fall is just a very restrictive game in how you progress, when you can progress, and how you can develop your character.If you want a turn based strategy game with some character building and some good characters then this game will itch that scratch, but if you wanted more of a RPG experience then Dragon Fall cannot fulfill it.

												I recommend this game because it has an interesting story, but there are a lot of problems with the game itself.If you can get past the poor UI and quirky combat system (Can't use healing spells outside of combat, stunned & sleeping enemies can dodge, and much more) then there is a good story to behold.The experience system is meh, you don't get experience for killing enemies, and your skills don't increase as you use them. Instead you get ""karma"" which you can then allocate to skills. Unfortunately when coupled with there being no items on enemies, this means combat is a pointless affair as often you might as well just run past enemies to the exit.The quotes saying this is one of the best turn based RPGs of the year are way off, it's....ok.

												This review contains possible spoilersPro: Looks pretty good, great atmosphere, nice variety of characters, classes, skills and upgrades, satisfying turn based gun fightsThings that can go either way, depending on taste: A LOT of text to read, great if you are into lore, but I skipped at least 1/3 without that having much effect on gameplay, also a bit lineair (think original X Com)Con's: It has a great hi-tech, anarchistic, Sci Fi, urban atmosphere, but then they introduce dragons! Meh. Doesn't work for me. Miniguns, grenades, hacking, bioterrorism, and......a dragon as the big badass to go after? It really broke down any credibility or coherence for me, and felt overly geeky. Hacking computer data only to read about how terribly powerful dragons are! I mean comon. Also the game is relatively short (20 hours).This game has a lot in common with X Com or even the old Fallout games, it really has good looks and great atmosphere. I rate it 7/10. If they would dump dragons in their story, make the game at least 50% longer, make it more open world and throw in some cutscenes instead of endless reads, I would vote higher.			"

												STAR TREK HERE - Logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one. Destroy a town and save THE WORLD.So, it's 25+ hours in and I am on the final mission.In this game you control your party through various missions, often through combat situations. Think X-Com. Your own character can be developed a whole variety of ways that are sometimes reflected in mission options. Combat is pretty good as it has melee, magic, grenades, shotguns and rifles. And cover. After an initial reluctance to trust me - the party give me their undying loyalty and call me boss. I earn their trust and they do whatever I say.So, we are here in the final mission. My group have followed me through some intensive combat. I have to make THE CHOICE. There is a twist.Should I agree and join my enemy by helping him kill a bunch of monsters that may one day wipe out humanity. Off course.Ok mate - you made your case, let's do this. Let's save humanity.Members of my party look at me in shock, cue combat against my own team. What the heck is going on? Don't look at me like the traitor you bunch of morons, without me you lot would have died in the second mission!I ponder what to do and decide to reload as I think my own party would beat me - I should know I trained them for goodness sake.Second time around.I try and convince the enemy they are wrong. It's wrong to sacrifice the few to potentially save the rest. How could anyone possibly bomb a city and kill thousands of innocent lives to stop a war? For the greater good?Then the guy goes on about Hiroshima and I think ""How do you even know about that?"" and then secondly ""Crap - I can't argue with that"". We did that in real life so I assume it's okay in a game, although that text option did not appear.In the end I sort of killed everyone and now I feel a bit dirty. The game has lots of text that you need to read. I normally hate all this stuff but was able to train my brain to read again. You could buy this game just for that.In a RPG genre where developers talk about choices and all that jazz - this one sorts of delivers. Choices lead to rabbit holes and sometimes you just don't want to see how far down they go. There is a racism sub plot. Some guys can do magic. The inventory system is a bit dire.A bug in the APEX Rising mission that was fixed by Verify Local Files.A fantastic game - just don't think of the cosy world of Star Trek. If I was not already in love I would have some feelings for this game. "

												ShadowRun: DragonFall is a wonderful blend of great storytelling and rewarding combat.  What makes this game so great however is how all these greats parts come together to form a incredibly immersive experience.  You can tell that everyone who worked on this game was very passionate about making sure this would be the best possible experience.  That isn't to say the game is perfect but it is damn close.  Fans of well-crafted stories and those who enjoy tactical rpgs will all find something to love about this game.The world of ShadowRun feels so believable; the culture and the characters of the world are very consistent.  On top of that, the choices you make, both in conversation and decision making, help concrete your sense of presence in the world.  Will you storm in guns blazing, sneak past security, or talk you're way out of trouble.  You have a handful of different classes and races to play as which all utilize very different tactics.  You have mages that rely on spells, street-samurai that need to get up close and personal, and deckers who have the ability to control drones and hack into security.ShadowRun uses a turn-based tactical combat system.  You have a wide top-down view of your characters and the environments they pass through.  You can only see as far as you characters and the more distance between you and your enemies the harder they will be to hit.  You can however increase you stats to help increase your accuracy along with a multitude of options to boost charisma, intelligence, defensive, and other attributes.  You also have a vast array of skills that you can use to both inflict damage, weaken enemies, or heal and protect your allies.Soon after you start a new game one of your teammates is killed and you decide to investigate and hunt down the party responsible.  In the process you have to convince you allies to cooperate with you and get everyone on your team to share your vision.  All the main characters have very different personalities and react very differently depending on how you engage with them.  Over time you really start to feel like you really know the characters and have an idea of how they'll behave under different conditions.  What I find especially interesting in this game is how many of the elements of the story that seem to be isolated events all manage to start to tie in together as you get close to the conclusion.I was honestly surprised by how good this game was.  The graphics are gorgeous, the story is immersive, and the combat is just the right level of challenging.  Its a deep RPG that will require quite a bit of investment in time and thought but its well worth it.  The though choices and scenarios are very rewarding once you see them through.  I was pleasantly surprised by how long the game was and even after finishing I was very tempted to jump right back in try approaching things in a different way.  In the meantime I will look forward to playing the other entries in the series and will continue to reflect back on the good times I had playing through this magnificent adventure.			"

												I've now played three installments of the Shadowrun series; the original, Hong Kong, and now Dragonfall.The first two I devoured immediately. I played all the way through the campaign in a day or two. Dragonfall I did not.The start of this game is incredibly aggravating. From an RNG that I swear lies (I couldn't tell you how many times I missed a 99%, it was a lot though) to several missions which seem designed to tick the player off coming at you immmediately this game is hard to break into.

												Enjoyment during the game varies:  First impression: cyberpunk world, nice story, good art, great! 8/10  First combat: good, it's actually XCOM style, waaaait a moment it's subpar... (urge to play xcom). 6/10  Before APEX Rising mission: forgot combat comparion to xcom, really enjoying it! 9/10  APEX Rising mission: major game decision to be taken by the player here. And by the end of it... it freezes! Yeah it's a bug - tons of forums discussing it, lack of conclusive fix. Forced to restart mission - ""I'll just take an alternate decision at this major point in the game, hoping it doesn't freeze by the end again""... 4/10  Last mission: Fine, although forced to continue with the previous (alternate) decision as a consequence of a bug. Somewhat bitter ending, on a technical note. 7/10Overall, still very good and definitely recommended.			"

												This review contains possible spoilersPro: Looks pretty good, great atmosphere, nice variety of characters, classes, skills and upgrades, satisfying turn based gun fightsThings that can go either way, depending on taste: A LOT of text to read, great if you are into lore, but I skipped at least 1/3 without that having much effect on gameplay, also a bit lineair (think original X Com)Con's: It has a great hi-tech, anarchistic, Sci Fi, urban atmosphere, but then they introduce dragons! Meh. Doesn't work for me. Miniguns, grenades, hacking, bioterrorism, and......a dragon as the big badass to go after? It really broke down any credibility or coherence for me, and felt overly geeky. Hacking computer data only to read about how terribly powerful dragons are! I mean comon. Also the game is relatively short (20 hours).This game has a lot in common with X Com or even the old Fallout games, it really has good looks and great atmosphere. I rate it 7/10. If they would dump dragons in their story, make the game at least 50% longer, make it more open world and throw in some cutscenes instead of endless reads, I would vote higher.			"

												You should buy this game. Shadowrun: Dragonfall captivated me for a very long time, drawing most of its background from the Shadowrun pen and paper RPG. It takes place in a very cool setting, a setting in which magic, high-tech enhancements, and guns are all thrown into the mix. You want to play a troll that got all of his limbs replaced and blows up people to bits with a grenade launcher? You got it. A tiny dwarf that feeds off of spiritual energy and summons spirits that will wreck other peoples day? Yep. A sassy Elf that spent all of his credits on a new deck for hacking and can tear down an entire computer system? That's my usual character build.Almost every mission can be tackled in varying ways. You can talk your way out of a lot of situations, be it through bribery, charisma, or some simple trickery. There have been missions where you've been tasked out to silently infiltrate a place, and you know, you don't automatically fail it if you bugger it up and decide to go hot. The game has consequences that aren't stupid or ham-fisted, just reasonable.Two other things that I absolutely loved were the story and the characters. The story is a classic Shadowrun tale, which if you're new to things, involves deeper elements as you progress through the campaign. While this is a MINOR SPOILER ALERT concerning the start of the game, the whole course of events is kicked off once you and your group of Shadowrunners partake in a run gone wrong. Walking away just barely alive with a dead party member and your tail between your legs, its on you all to figure out who set you up. What follows afterwards is just awesome.Oh, right, the characters. They will draw you in. Take the time to read what they're telling you and do their side missions. I was trying initially to just blaze through the game, but it quickly sucked me in and I was talking to virtually every single NPC that I could talk to. From a troll thats trying to forget her botched military career, to a ""damaged goods"" street samurai that quickly captures your heart, the game's characters (both small and large) made me feel for them.Ah, and the gameplay. It's a tactical, turn-based strategy game of sorts. It's not hard to figure out how to do everything, and you'll find that most builds will offer something to the table in terms of combat. I enjoyed it, and its easily one of those games that you can sit back, crack open a cold one (or some wine if you're anything like myself), and enjoy getting a buzz while you blast some unfortunate soul with a combination of acid and bullets.Remember runners, shoot straight, conserve ammo, and never, ever, make a deal with a Dragon.

												Shadowrun-Dragonfall is a turn-based science-fantasy RPG which improves on its predecessor in every aspect of the game. If you are not averse to a lot of reading, as this game is heavily packed in narrative presented in a read-it-yourself format and like fantasy settings mixed with a bit of cyberpunk, then do yourself a favor and get this game ASAP, as it is a 10/10 title. Multiple endings, multitude of options to direct your self-created character via a desired development path, choices with consequences, all accompanied by a sweet and beautiful graphics reminiscent of the classics. Now, to go a bit more into details. Story:  Really good and immersive, even though the ending mixes up needlessly cryptic dialogues for the sake of it.Definitely the strongest feature of this game, the story, although not a direct continuation of the previous storyline, puts you again in the shoes of a shadowrunner, who ends up being involved in something bigger than bargained for.Some elements tie into the overall plot better than the others, with the spotlight given more tangibly to the famed Dragons from the previous game, but, with the exception of couple of dialogues cryptic for the sake of it, make up a coherent and plausible world (at least to this universe).The choices you make starting from the class you choose open up various options in dialogues, with some choices opening up different ending possibilities, but the game does a great job of not bombing you with ramifications of your choices straight away. Almost every choice matters in the end, allowing for the creation of a solid main character of your own choosing. Companions are well crafted, some sideline characters are nicely intertwined into the main story which does make feel the world even more coherent and the presence and actions of your character that much more impactful. It is definitely longer than Shadowrun Returns, but it does not feel like it is needlessly dragging out, because what your character does in the game, is given enough purpose and ties into the main plot that it keeps you occupied and engaged.  Gameplay:	Turn-based at its finest, with custom-made main character of chosen race and class which furthers the immersion in the story.It is a turn-based game where each actions take a designated amount of points from the total your character has each round. Even though, the fights rarely feel like they drag too long.The system itself rewards you for a thought-through actions and punishes you if you don't take a second to actually learn it. It is not the most convoluted system, though, so it does not take that long to get it.There are multiple races to choose from, which do not limit your choice of classes you can pick, but have an impact on how far you will be able to push a certain class—some are better suited for ones than the others (Elves can push Summoning/Conjuring the farthest, but end up with the least amount of health in the end). There are a couple of classes to choose from, but you can mix and match those as you play.The options to choose from all seem valid and offer enough incentive to get immersed in them. And there is a little twist with cybernetics and how it affects magic which must be taken into account while playing, which, alongside the possibility of multiple endings, adds to the game's re-playability potential. Graphics:	A modern take on classics with beautifully crafted environments and attention to detail that is impossible not to appreciate, once you're hooked. The graphics take some getting used to, as they are heavily inspired by the games of old. At a first glance it might feel not detailed or high-quality, but, once you get over the initial ""dated"" feeling, you will notice that the environments and characters have a lot of details to them, the settings make sense story-wise and, overall, it breathes a lot of fresh air to the otherwise nostalgia. It looks good and, in the end, you love it like the AAA titles which forgets that amazeballs graphics are not everything. Of course, nowadays, amazing storyline is no excuse to s ♥♥♥♥♥♥ y graphics as well, thankfully, the developers had a vision for this picture-esque esthetics and it shows.My only beef with this game is that spells, at least the projectile ones, feel too similar to one another and blend in with standard firearms, in the end.The higher tier spells are barely different than their low tier equivalents and not that different from normal bullets.Of course, to each their own, but I like some splendor and flare with my mages, thank you. Mind you, I still loved every single bit of my Sorcerer Elf, I just wish his magic showed a bit more, at least during the fighting bits.  Haven't played Hong Kong yet, but I hope that has been addressed, to some extent. All in all, I invite you all to give this game a try – I loved it and will definitely replay it a couple of times.

												Note: Pretty much a copy paste from my review of Shadowrun Returns. Rating: 7/10Budget: Worth it. Replayability: Low - The story doesn't change enough to warrant an additional playthrough. Length: Good - Custom missions too. Shadowrun Dragonfall is an expansion for Shadowrun Returns that was turned into a separate game. It's better than than Shadowrun Returns, I personally think. Better system, better graphics, cooler story if you ask me.  I have a few issues with it. You have to pick a playstyle extremely early in the game, and it's very difficult to know what is the right choice for you - Especially seeing as you have no way of controlling what classes your companions in the game will have. This is actually a much bigger problem than one might initially think. I tried going for a non-combat build, actually. I wanted to be the ""face"" of my party, but have my goons fight for me. Didn't work out - impossible to play this way. You HAVE to be able to fight SOMEHOW, so this was a letdown for me. Especially considering how much of the game you can actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t your way through later on. It's also fairly easy to make a character who is simply so good at fighitng that you can kill everything the game ever sends your direction. The games combat system is a bit rough and while a good translation from actual shadowrun, there's a reason that system is a bit of a cult novelty - It's just very rough in general. Over-all good game, but read a guide or something to save some frustrations.			"

												This is an excellent strategy rpg that manages to improve on the original in almost every way. Very much worth it, especially to a Shadowrun fan.The positives:-The story is great. It comes across as more of an interactive novel with deep plot points and very fleshed out characters. Throughout, you'll learn all about each of the characters in your team and around you and be able to affect your relationships. There's a lot of past in Berlin that ties into the main story which you'll learn about through people and events in the game. It gives the world life.-  There are good choice scenarios. Throughout the conversations and events in the game, you'll have the chance (if you have the right skill) to guide the dialogue in a certain direction or go down a different path. They also throw some moral choices at you which get as deep as killing a person or letting them go which will affect many things including your crew morale.- The combat is much improved over the original as well. It feels more streamlined and just works much better with the refinements they made.The soundtrack seemed much the same. The graphics seemed much the same (new tileset, but same art style). Neither of these things are a negative to me.There are still some issues:- Either I'm misunderstanding the Smartlink weapon or there's a bug that made it disappear from my inventory until I got into a mission. Then it showed up.- You still can't swap out inventory items with your crew. When you pick up items out of combat, you can only put them in your inventory or send it to your stash. Why can't I give it to my crew member?- It sometimes was difficult to click on an area behind a character because of the perspective. Not a big issue a lot of the time, but it became problematic during some fights when cover was hidden behind a person.Overall, it's the best Shadowrun game I've played so far!			"

												Skeptical at first, I decided to try it at a reduced cost.  I was not disappointed.  While it's not flashy like many new games, it has wonderful character art, and the writing is great.  I *did* find myself occasional skimming some of the readable content on files I came across, but I always paid careful attention to dialogue.  There, every choice I made mattered, in a way I haven't felt in a long time.  I was able to advance quite far in the game, so character development was satisfying, but I wasn't a good in the end.  I'd say it can be quite the challenging game, but not *too* challenging.  For this game, I was interested in a relaxing ""dungeon explorer"" game with a good story to fill my time between table-top roleplaying games that were in a lull.  I got what I wanted out of the ""normal mode.""  Even then I still failed and had to reload on occasion, although my character was far from optimized.  Generally I play such games (all games really) on the hardest mode possible, and this game would no doubt be quite vicious on that.  It would require optimizing the character.  FYI - I played a face character with amazing charisma who acted as a decent shaman.  Mid-game I picked up conjuring, which eventually got quite high.  I threw a variety of points into other things to round myself out for roleplaying purposes (Int, Willpower, Rifle).  I'd definitely recommend picking up a high Charisma still, as it gives etiquettes which in turn allow special dialogue options that both helped and increased the richness of the story.  The stories were classic Shadowrun stories, full of grit and backstabbing, secret organizations and fairly mature content done in a suitably mature way.  An all-round pleasure.  While short, the game oozes flavor out of its isometric rpg self.  Wasteland 2 was not quite so flavorful (while longer and very good in dialogue).			"

												Obsidian, take note. This is what people mean when they want an ""old-school RPG"" - an RPG with a *really strong story* and *memorable characters*, not the awkward gameplay of Baldur's Gate combined with a 60-hour mediocre campaign. Why yes, I'm bitter about Pillars of Eternity, why do you ask?I mean, sure. Dragonfall has its low points, mostly related to the AI. Why does every enemy shoot for my main character when they're having their face eviscerated by my melee team members? SImple, they want you to lose rather than to stay alive. Here's the deal, though: while that really got on my nerves, the sheer strength of the story and characters easily carry the game.Basically, it's a fantasy/cyberpunk setting that takes the dark aspects of those and builds a great world. Even the sidequests are interesting, even if there aren't too many of them - there's no boring fetchquests, everything is jam-packed with action, characters and stories. There's moral choices done right, as in, you simply get to choose between being pragmatic and earning a bit extra, or not committing horrible deeds for a little less. Your team members all have distinct personalities (who needs voiceacting?) and you'll really be looking forward to their comments about the runs you take.That's the thing with RPGs. If you focus on a great story and great characters, somewhat clunky gameplay is easily overlooked.			"

												This is an excellent cyberpunk themed RPG featuring turn-based combat with great tactical depth.The level of character customization is deep, and the story is great.I was well entertained for all 20 hours it took me to complete the campaign, and I missed a few optional missions.The visual presentation is really good, but it's all pre-rendered/drawn from a certain angle, so there is no way to change camera angle, which annoys a bit at times.Sadly there is no voice acting, so you'll be reading A LOT - but whether that's good or bad is very subjective I reckon. The music is good, and fits the theme well.A couple of things did unfortunately bring the experience down a bit:- A quite frequently occurring bug that makes you unable to perform any action or end your turn. I wasted a couple of hours in total reverting back to old saves due to this.- The AI is a bit daft at times. E.g. I've seen foes use action points teleporting away from my characters, only to immediately (same turn) run back to the very spot they stood before! - If you aren't in combat mode, only your main character can pick up items, and if his/her inventory is full, you can't let anyone else on your team have it. The item has to be sent back to stash or swapped with one of the items of your full inventory. REALLY annoying.Regardless of aforementioned annoyances - one of the best games of the genre I've played.82% "

												This is my first ever rpg game, so I really have nothing to compare it to. That said, I really love it and am very impressed with both the story and the gameplay. If you are new to the genre, like me, you likely will feel confused when you first start playing. There is a bit of a learning curve, and the interface won't feel entirely intuitive, but, if you are new to the genre, I would recommend you stick with the game, and you will surely get the hang of things soon enough. The character development and story are excellent, but, be warned, you will be doing a lot of reading in this game. I didn't mind this aspect of the game at all. In fact, the ""game"" feels very much like reading a novel in ways, albeit a ""cyberpunk"" futuristic one. It's not the kind of novel I would ever seek out (nor did I ever imagine I would ever actually write the words ""cyberpunk"" in my life), but, I must admit, the quality of the writing is exceptional. In addition to this being my first ever rpg, this is also my first ever ""turn based combat"" game and, man, do I ever love it! I'm really hooked on this game. I've come to learn that this is what's called an ""isometric rpg,"" and I very much like this format although ""isometric rpgs"" aren't everyone's cup of tea. I'm really glad I took a chance on this game and stuck with it. I picked it up on sale, but, in my humble opinion, it is surely worth the $14.99 price. I'm nearly 22 hours into the game (my guess is experienced gamers have finished the game in less than that time), and it's been a lot of fun and an initiation of sorts too! My guess is this will be a game I end up replaying using a different character and making different choices, etc. Hope this helps anyone who is intrigued by the reviews and/or new to the genre. I highly recommend it!			"

												Shadowrun Dragonfall is pretty much Shadowrun Returns, but better. Better characters, better story and better length (Returns/DMS was about 15-16 hours long, Dragonfall is about 21-24 hours depending on how much side content you do.)BUT in the process it's also become a lot buggier. On more than one occasion I found myself having to reload because a keypad or door became un-interactable or an important NPC refused to spawn. And while I was lucky enough to not experience it myself, apparently one mission in particular is notorious for glitching into an unwinnable state.It wasn't an deal-breaker for me, but if that turns you away then I don't blame you.

Though this was a developers choice it's pretty much it caused alot of disinterest in replaying- alot of reading text, this wasn't a problem for me but if people don't like reading they aren't going to like this game.- didn't really like the cyber combat sections, gets old because it's pretty easy but repetitive and too long- you can't sell old weapons/extra objects you don't use anymore, there's some really backward annoying design decisions in this gameoverall really great rpg 8/10			"

												By far my absolute favourite Shadowrun game by Harebrained Schemes Production. It has a story that kicks off with a bang, keeps you enthralled the entire way through and ends with a satisfying finale. Though the missions are linear they offer plenty of ways to approach any given situation from violent to nonviolent options, which often leave you feeling like a true badass upon their conclusion.All of that said, a word of caution: if you do not enjoy reading, do not buy this game. There are no cutscenes. There is no voice acting. Only excellent writing.			"

												7 of 10I'm really enjoying this, more than I thought I would. As a teen, I played the original table top version, and the writing style definitely brings back the old memories. I'd normally do Pros and Cons lists, but this time nearly every pro or con had a caveat. TL;DR Good writing, interesting characters and plot Generally true to the SR canon and feel Gameplay is okay if you don't mind missing 50% of the time, and a lot of enemy cheating In the LARP version you feel like a suped-up cyber badass who brings distinct skills to the team; you won't feel that way here, at all Gear progression is obtuse and expensiveImpressionsArt The character portraits are well done, and give everyone a unique look consistent with the old school LARP art The character models seem pointlessly, conspicuously low grade. Like, embarassingly bad. There is very little in the way of customization. They should have doubled or tripled the poly count and aimed for a much higher aesthetic standard. I shouldn't feel ashamed of my avatar.Field The isometic, fixed angle constraints work well overall. They don't overemphasize graphical bells and whistles, which lets the story shine through. The fog of war gives a fair enough representation of your field of vision for the most part. The same constraints can make moving to an exact location difficult, and often allow enemies to park somewhere and become effectively invisible while they hammer away at you.  100% of the time in this game, I feel like I'm straining to see the world. I constantly want to zoom in closer. I'm getting sore in my neck and shoulders from it. This limits how much and how often I can play.Gameplay Much of the flavor of the archetypes/classes is there. You can be a decker, a rigger, a samurai, etc. The mechanics tend to homogenize everyone into magic, guns, or melee Guns are superior, hands-down but using them is pretty boring - they all feel the same Using magic is fairly interesting, but it feels nerfy and impotent Melee suffers the worst. A street samurai should feel like a jacked up, high octane super hero at the bleeding edge of human/machine performance. Instead it feels clownish, primitive, and gimped. A real disappointment. You miss too much. It doesn't seem to matter how much you buff, kit, and skill for accuracy. You have about a 50/50 chance of hitting something. It's maddening. If you found XCOM games frustrating in this regard, you'll likely feel the same about SR.Dialogue There are often different story paths depending on certain dialogue choices, but just as often, dialogue choices are merely flavor because all outcomes are the same Many times I feel like I've figured something out, but I have to wade through the process of my avatar figuring it out, picking all the dumb choices I wouldn't say, so I can get to the point where another character points it out for them. Not immersive, just frustrating. I don't feel engaged in the dialogue like I did in the LARP sessions. But I guess that's to be expected.Progression There are different outfits and some sense of a gear progression path, so there's always something better than what you have to work for. The progression seems obtuse. I don't want a linear flowchart of gear to earn, but I would like a better sense of what my gear is doing for me, and what I can do to improve certain aspects of my performance. How much should I focus on cyberware as Class X? Many of the descriptions on gear are uninformative, and I don't trust that they map tightly to the LARP system. Things like Smart Links, rigger vehicles, hacking, and other components have been marginalized and lost. The coolness of it all did not make it through the transition to a video game. Final ThoughtsI think with some quality of life improvements, and maybe a second pass aimed at better capturing the wonder and coolness of the SR universe, this could be far more successful. But I enjoy the story and appreciate the work that went into the art. I think it's worth playing until you tire of it. I wasn't able to finish it on the first try, but YMMMV. My real recommendation is to get some friends together and play the LARP version instead.			"

												This seems to be the best currently available Shadowrun game you can play at the moment, including Hong Kong. If you like Cyberpunkish stuff, Shadowrun, and tactical turn based games a little in the X-Com style, here you are. Some of the player content created for it is okay, but nothing exceptionally stand out yet. I'd suggest you wait for it to go on sale unless you got a big hankering for Shadowrun.			"

												I was disappointed with this entry. I am a big fan of the older Genesis game and hoping that I'd get to explore a city and go on many shadowruns like the Genesis game. Instead I ended up getting put onto an on-rails story in which I often ended up in a hub world where your base it located at, do your shopping, then get transported out for what ever run selection you are given. While I like the moral choices within the runs there just weren't a lot of them. You go through them quickly and then you are thrown into the end game. I personally lost motivation to continue on knowing that I have to storm the final base and my character isn't decked out in any cool cyberware because the game doesn't allow you to do so. What is even more irksome is when you can see other characters with certain cyberware you are unable to obtain.Shadowrun Dragon Fall is just a very restrictive game in how you progress, when you can progress, and how you can develop your character.If you want a turn based strategy game with some character building and some good characters then this game will itch that scratch, but if you wanted more of a RPG experience then Dragon Fall cannot fulfill it.

												UPDATE: I have to change my review... the game is broken when you reach a certain point. Constant bugs with changes to inventory not being managed and, worst of all, game 'freezes' where characters don't respond to commands causing you to lose all your progress. This is really bad and happens on end-game missions that are the longest and most difficult ones. I just lost 2h of gameplay on one of the last missions due to this bug. This has been reported by other players since 2014. I can't recommend the game until this is fixed.The game has great visuals and good (but not stellar) storyline. Character customization is not very deep, but good enough (although customizing your crew uses a different system which takes a bit to get used to).Weakest point, IMO, is the combat system with awkward cover and line of sight mechanics (there's no cover where you would expect and line of sight sometimes makes no sense).If you enjoy XCOM combat mechanics and/or want a decent cyberpunk story, I would recommend.

												I tend to hate turn-based tactical games. Some games that thrill most fans of the genre feature horrible miss chances on normal difficulty, squad members who have no personalities with weapons that are more interesting than the people wielding them, no personal investment, and a boring ""story"" make up that game (X-COM Enemy Unknown is an example of these things I detest). Also, though I played Shadowrun Returns, I thought it was okay, but a glitch made the game freeze at the start of a mission quite late into the game, and I wasn't having enough fun with the game to even bother restarting the mission to continue.Then came Shadowrun: Dragonfall. I lean toward detesting this genre, but holy crap, this game is great! All the drawbacks of X-COM Enemy Unknown that I mentioned above are nowhere to be found in this game. The miss/hit chances on normal are satisfying, you have characters who can boost those chances for the whole team or its individual members from the very start of the game, the characters are some of the very best I have ever seen in a video game, and the story is quite nice with twists and turns throughout. I will say, however, that the ending is a bit of a whimper, but it wasn't offensively bad (Mass Effect 3) or anything.Both in and out of combat, the characters are great. Each has things you don't know about them, and after every mission or two, you go back to a sort of home base and the city block that it's in, and you get to learn more about your team members. They have some really interesting stories...especially Glory.  Wow. All of the squad members and minor characters will generally have something new to say, and there is so much atmosphere. The NPCs look like crap in this game, but with the isometric view above, it's easy to just not care. the art of the areas is great, and the game's setting is so perfect. The game has this cyberpunk setting with an intriguing tone of simultaneous melancholy and hope.Not only did the backgrounds and the well-written characters draw me in, but the music is so atmospheric for the locations you visit and the events going on in-game, and the narration writing is superb...by that, I mean the word artistry  the game charms you with time and again. There is oodles of reading in this game, as there is no voice acting at all, but I honestly prefer it this way despite normally not having the patience to read fiction...like ever. The game's writing is seductive, I tell you!!! You just have to read the narration and dialog when you go to new places and talk to new characters. It's incredible.My biggest gripe about the game is probably the tight-waddedness of its ""Karma,"" which are the points you spend to make your character more powerful. The game is -really- tight on there points. I received 198, and that's with me doing every mission and side mission, and trying to milk every Karma gain I could find in the game by starting off with 6 Charisma and looking up beforehand on forums what the best 3 Etiquettes (speech specializations) were. If anyone is reading this who isn't going to play a Shaman, do NOT take Charisma above 4. You can buy armor in the northeast corner on a ""trial"" side mission for a group that wants to hire you in-game, and it gives you +2 Charisma while you wear it. I believe 6 was as high as I ever needed, and Security and Corporate are the best Etiquettes. The Gang Etiquette would let me spend a bunch of money to skip one fight that wasn't all that tough. Whoop-dee-doo. =/  I wish so much that someone could have convinced me to take Charisma 4 instead of 6. I BEG you, do not take Charisma 6.Back on topic, in closing, yeah, I typically hate this genre. However, Shadowrun: Dragonfall is magnificently atmospheric through its background, its music, all of the story except the -very- ending, the characters, and the gameplay was enjoyable even for someone such as myself who doesn't tend to like this sort of game.I do not give many games this high of a recommendation, and I generally dislike the genre this game belongs to. Therefore you, dear reader, can assuredly realize just how amazing this game was to drag this much adulation out of a hater of the genre such as myself.			"

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a great game. It really is. I bet that you'll play through it at least twice.Dragonfall made a huge step forward from its predecessor: the classes became more diverse, the story got more refined, the dialogues feel much more fluent and more natural than in the original Shadowrun. While the first game was enjoyable but felt like a sample of a game that it could have been (you know, with all those corridor levels and little choice for the character), Dragonfall lets you decide on literally everything and play in a way you want.Nowadays I meet less and less games that can leave you totally satisfied, the games that you can't complain about. Well, Shadowrun: Dragonfall is one of these games. I highly recommend buying it.			"

												I recommend this game because it has an interesting story, but there are a lot of problems with the game itself.If you can get past the poor UI and quirky combat system (Can't use healing spells outside of combat, stunned & sleeping enemies can dodge, and much more) then there is a good story to behold.The experience system is meh, you don't get experience for killing enemies, and your skills don't increase as you use them. Instead you get ""karma"" which you can then allocate to skills. Unfortunately when coupled with there being no items on enemies, this means combat is a pointless affair as often you might as well just run past enemies to the exit.The quotes saying this is one of the best turn based RPGs of the year are way off, it's....ok.

												I got it in the Winter sale for £2.19 - For that price, I can't recommend it enough, I reckon I actually spent 30 hours completing it (but it was left open several times while I wasn't playing), for the full price (£11) I'm not sure I'd feel like I got my moneys' worth, as there's not much content for that amount of money.It's got a massive amount of story and really is more focused on that than the actual fights/upgrades etc, not to say the other bits were poor, but this isn't the kind of game worth buying unless you enjoy a fair bit of reading... If you do, it's just like a good book - Difficult to put down. Good quality game, but I disliked how much focus there was around an early incident, that cast bit of a depressing shadow over the rest of the game, for me at least.I'd rate it a very solid 7/10, as I'm not a big fan of the story side as much as I am of the game side, for the intended target audience I reckon it's a tenuous 9/10.

The turn based combat on the harder or even normal difficulty is strategic and fun as all hell. I have never had more fun in a game of this style.

												It's just Dragonfall better.What does this mean? Forget about Shadowrun Returns and get this. Dragonfall is a fantastic campaign that's even better now. There appear to be less bugs (I've not run into a particularly annoying, and thankfully rare, vision bug that existed when I played the original Dragonfall), and the new content is just a great as the old. There's very few things that could change my opinon for the worse at the point that I've gotten to.Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a good game. A really good one. It feels like a CRPG from over a decade ago, and I say that in the best way possible. It honestly feels like it could have been made by Troika, and I say that in both a good and bad way.What do I mean by ""both a good an a bad way""? Well, the game has some good writing, genuinely interesting characters, and a sold cobat system. The game also suffers from a few technical issues.When speaking of a the combat system, we're looking at a very XCOM esque sort of feel complete with grid-based movement and overwatch for helping to keep areas locked down. You'll likely often find yourself moving your characters from cover to cover while pushing forward and taking down enemies. The combat system works on a cooldown system for abilities, in which once an ability is used, it cannot be reused for X number of turns. All in all, the game actually offers satisfying tactical RPG experience complete with guns, magic, and swords. In terms of the technical issues, there's only a few I've noticed (or heard of), and that's if your screen isn't side enough, your HUD won't properly downsize to accomodate the lower resolution. Rather than getting smaller, it will display less skills, meaning if you have a full set of skills, you can't access them all (at least, to my knowledge). This means that even on an old SD monitor you have to use HD resolutions to be able to play the game well, even if this makes it look bad. Also, the UI seems to be a bit unresponsive when decking, so when I'm clicking around too fast (which is not fast at all by the way) I'll end up throwing out a regular attack when I mean to be using a special ability on an enemy. That's a small gripe though.Writing is... pretty subjective obviously, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. I really liked all of the characters, I found converstations interesting, I liked learning about the past of my companions, and I liked watching them grow as I continued to run with them. The chararacter aren't exactly super dynamic, as there'll never be huge changes in their personality, but still, as you converse with them, you can tell they're growing, which is actually more than I can say for quite a few other titles in the genre. The game also offers a number of choices in dialogue and otherwise, which allow you to influence the outcome of situations and the overall story. Aside from that, doing things one way over another may provide more karma (experience) or money.Seriously, the game is well worth giving a go (assuming it looks like the kind of game you'd be into of course).

												This right here could easily be called the ""definitive version"" of Shadowrun Returns.  The improvements to the UI, combat system, and NPC growth are welcome additions, as well as the story being a much better tale than DeadMan's Switch, the campaign from vanilla Shadowrun Returns.Pros:All the good stuff about Shadowrun Returns is here and some improvements.  The UI is better, especially with options to upscale text size, which is great for guys like me that play my pc games on a big HDTV.  Your team members also have individual levelling trees, which is great.  You have a little bit of control over their development. Cons:The environment is still a pain to navigate in when you hit a tight corner.  Often I try to move behind a crate only to missclick and end up walking around it to the wrong side, wasting action points.I'd like to see a better customization option for your team runners.  Ideally a total custom team building option, or at least class selection for them, because if I'm a decker, then I don't need a decker, that sort of thing, and some guy just sits around being useless.I may also be remembering this wrong, but I think the only team members you can choose abilities for are the core group, none of the hireable runners you can pick up, which makes those ones useless, because your teammembers will outpower them.Just a few nitpicks, it's a good game overall for people into turn based RPG's and that love that old school feel.Also, still gets a ++ in my book for being the only Shadowrun (digital) game with full selection of whatever race you want to play as to start.  Well, except a dragon :P			"

With ""Dragonfall"" they have stepped it up a notch.On finishing this campaign, I looked back at the choices I had made and the devastation I had wrought and could not decide if I had done the right thing. I know I tried to and I know I had good reasons for making the choices I did but even hours later I couldn't work out if I'd done the right thing.This sort of ambiguity in storytelling is difficult and precious.

												A great story driven RPG, set in a cyberpunk future, that seamlessly meshes fantasy concepts with cyberpunk/technology. The old school isometric presentation combined with the beautiful artwork manages to perfectly recreate the Shadowrun universe. Dragonfall was originally created as DLC for Shadowrun Returns, which was already a very good and enjoyable game. The standalone version of dragonfall improves almost all aspects of the original game, like adding more weapons, cyberware and magic, adding regular modifiable companions and companion quests, and having an altogether more well rounded campaign. Therefore I would definitely recommend buying and playing this game first, and for more shadowrun play the original game as a kind of DLC to this version. So if you are not rebuked by turn based battles, a la XCOM: enemy unknown, and a lack of voice acting (there is a lot of reading to be done), this is a grandiose old school RPG adventure in a great cyberpunk setting that I highly recommend!

												As an old-timer, Shadowrun has always been a game that grabbed me since I was a kid, back in the SNES.The thing you must know about that, considering you played Shadowrun Returns is that Dragonfall gets things going as it throws some of the nostalgia feeling out of the window(no Jake Armitage appearances this time!), but it just as much keeps the feeling of it in the soundtrack. The character development keeps getting even better, more dialogue options involving attributes and characters, you can use skills from your allies in order to do stuff(ex: Asking your partner to force through a door if they are stronger than you), the interface looks even more polished and new gadgets are added, such as new spells, weapons and all.Dragonfall has a really nice story, if you liked Coyote back in Shadowrun Returns, you'll love your new crew in Dragonfall, the story feels really catchy, I personally got really into my character, and the way it unfolds makes you go on and on with this game.Totally supporting the devs on this one.

												I started on hard and with a mage so i had a rough start and didn't like the game a lot. After some weeks of not playing it I gave it a second shot.  From that point on i loved it and completed it on one weekend. The story and the atmosphere are great. Was my first Shadowrun game. After i complete it I bought another one. So for everyone who likes game round based RPGs i would recommend giving it a shot.			"

												Final Fantasy Tactics meets The MatrixI played Shadowrun Returns 1st, I enjoyed it alot.  The game has alot of mysterious features with its RPG elements.  It doesn't really matter what difficulty you put the game on, Shadowrun relies on decision making.  If you make a bad choice, then the rest of the game or mission will be more harder than anticipated.  I love the combat system & character classes.  My personal favorite classes were Street Samurai, Shaman, and Weapon Specialist.  My favorite characters to use were Eiger & Glory.  However, the game always remains to have a fascinating storyline, regardless of what happens......10 outta 10 #Classic			"

												Great expansion/game from the 1st Shadowrun Returns game (though if you have not played it you can jump right in). The game skips out on the world law however so you might want to pop over to the Shadowrun wiki before you do just to work out why orcs are shooting mages with cyber guns.Its a fun tactical rpg with combat close to the most recent x-com - enemy unknown game. Position, cover and abilities all will need to be used to be successful. My 1st run through took about 20+ hours with most of the side mission though it was buggy in some places (mostly scrolling round during matrix runs).Storyline was good but not great for me - I went in as a Orc Street Samurai (big guns) and a lot of the game felt like they would have really preferred it if I had played a decker or a mage. However the character creation system is very flexible and it certainly warrants a second play.If you like cyber punk, combat RPGs and interesting settings I would recommend this one for you.			"

												I had fun with Shadowrun Returns, but it was Dragonfall what made me fall in love with the game. They improve gameplay with many different features but, more importantly from my point of view, the story is more detailed, deep and feels more like what I came to expect from a Shadowrun experience. This time you actually have a group of runners, you get side missions, different paths to complete your goals and all that good stuff. It still have flaws, such as very limited cyberware implants and the inability to trade inventory itens with your teammates, but the fun I had while playing more than compensated for it's problems. If you're a Shadowrun fan, likes cyberpunk themed stuff or simply enjoys strategy games rich in text and world lore, than you should check this out.			"

												This game is the reason why i have interest in shadowrun as a whole. although the gameplay is rather simplistic and easy (at least on normal) it is satisfying to a degree. the real meat of this game however is almost everything else. the characters are fantastic and the setting is amazing. the story isnt bad at all, however the 'twists' in the story are rather predictable. 100% recommend this to anyone who enjoys tabletop RPG like gameplay and the cyberpunk setting.

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a great game and an improvement on the base game. If the original Dead Man's switch left you with a feeling that something was missing - try this one. The campaign is more refined, focuses on team members and feels much more involving, giving a lot possible endings to be achieved.Great adventure, tactical combat and the world heavily influenced by Neuromancer novels.A must, if you like cyberpunk. Heavily recommended if you like tactical, turn based combat and classic RPGs.			"

												This game was surprisingly the best buy i've made on this Steam Sales. This game is definitely must-have title for those who like games like Fallout 1 or 2. Even more for those, who played Shadowrun on paper.Combat is turn based so you must know this before you purchase the game. Not everyone like this style of gameplay nowadays. I really enjoyed every minute of playing this game. The character leveling system and the combat system remind me those times when me and my friends were sitting in a room with bunch of dices and were playing Shadowrun on paper.The graphics are comic-like and doesnt add any ""realism"" but i think it has a reason, cause it adds the game unique atmosphere, which i liked.There is nothing revolutionary in the story, in fact the story is pretty simple without any major twists. But completing the game took me 23 hours and i didnt even finished all available side quests. Plus there is quite a lot of custom community content which i didnt even tried.So for me its 9,5/10			"

												Now here is a proper Shadowrun game.I got turned off Dead Man's Switch, the original campaign of Shadowrun Returns, as it felt a little bit t much like a traditional save-the-world RPG in structure. Dragonfall features a dramatic plotline in the background, but most of the game focuses on actual shadowruns, i.e., mercenary work against corporations. Dragonfall also features a considerably improved interface, and one of the few sets of permanent companions who I actually enjoyed to a man.Highly recommended.			"

												PROS:+ Tactical RPG, feels pretty much like XCOM in terms of movement, and cover mechanics.+ Skill Trees, there's alot of skills your can pick and choose from, so your abilities aren't predetermined for you.+ Races, you can play as various races which effect the min/max of your abilities+ Pretty interesting story, not the best, but it kept me playing.+ Different ways to approach situations, and combat. For example, you can talk your way out of some fights, or even bypass whole combat segments by having the appropriate skill.+ Potential for multiple playthroughs, but the story will play out the relatively the same.+ Good writingNEUTRAL:o Lots of Reading, each phrase of dialogue also has text in brackets to describe any motions a character is doing, movement in a room during dialogue, etc. CONS:- Combat got really stale, just tend to gun things down as quickly as possible instead of using magic. Melee should be even stronger, due to the fact you are exposing yourself most of the time if you decide to melee.- Some dialogue choices didn't matter. For example no matter how you tried to go through a dialogue tree, you would end up fighting regardless.- No Sneaking. There is absolutely no way for you to play a sneaky character. Theres no implants, magic, skill tree, or anything that can make you sneak, go invisible, etc.- Weapon variation is♥♥♥♥♥♥poor, there are not enough guns or spells in the game. And each ""tier"" of new weapons only became avaible after you got so far in the story.- Not enough side quests/missions to build up money. You cannot sell items to a vendor either (if you can I guess I'm just dumb)- Cyberspace is just boring, and is mainly just puzzles/buttons to advance XYZ.- You cannot rotate the camera (As far as I know) and It can really suck.OVERALL RATING:7/10. I would buy this game on sale (I did), I wouldn't pay full price for it. It's fun enough to get a couple of playthroughs to try different builds. Do not try to be a Jack-of-All, because you will feel pretty lacking during your whole playthrough.			"

												Shadowrun Returns was... not very good. The story was too fast to develop any relationhip with other characters so I couldnt feel motivation. And the story was just mission to mission without any break or sensible interaction in between. Not what I would expect from Shadowrun, p'n'p RPG or any true RPG (it is horrible how any game where one can put points to atributes is labbeled as ""RPG"").However, Dragonfall is totally different. Although number of missions are still small, you can chose their order (at least), they resemble standard shadowrun ""runs"" and quite often you are put in situation which are in grey area of morality or even quite black from every possible angle. This together with quite a lot of different solutions based on skills, be it hacking terminal to get 250 credits to geting the right answer with that high charisma to get through mission without firing a shot, makes SR:D quite a nice thing to roleplay and adds quite a bit to replayability.The story is also much better, it develops slowly, there are quite a lot of hints and player has the opportunity to get known his party in much greater detail. With Director's Cut, this is greatly expanded not only by expanded development of party members, but with their new personal quests and special abilities from them.If the original SR:R would have looked like this, it would be much better. On top that, steam workshop full of player-made stories gives quite a lot of additional hours after you finish dragonfall. So, if you like traditinal RPGs with a lot of interactions, if you like skill-based (or rather atribute-based) variety in finishing quests, this is a way to go.			"

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is the expansion to Shadowrun: Returns. And for the most part they share the same core mechanics, with Dragonfall having a few improvements to UI, party management, and overall level design. So if you didn't like Returns, than you are not going to like Dragonfall either.  On the other hand, if you only kind of enjoy Returns, or thought it was below average than you'll enjoy Dragonfall due to  its improvements.  Dragonfall has a lot of the same things going for it that Returns had too. The story is a compelling tale of revenge with numerous subplots and character development. All of which is told through a lot of reading. The characters in your group and in the game's world have their own goals, personalities, and abilities.  All of which makes them feel more realistic and relatable. Lastly specialization matters in the game since there are numerous options in the game's environment and dialogue that can only be access by a character proficient in a certain skill or talent. And while some might look negatively on this as limiting gameplay, I found it to be a positive since it made character development feel like it matter beyond just picking combat skills.Dragonfall has a few things going against it, most of which were also in Returns. The game's camera has an isometric view that cannot be rotated, which limits what the user can see and how levels are design. And while this fits into their desire art style, that art style is kind of bad. There isn't a lot of detail being displayed, and most objects/npcs are unremarkable. This also affects the next problem which is the production value for the game. There is a lot of reading, and I mean a lot, like a hundred of pages of text. And for most of the game this is fine, but where I take exception to it is during important scenes like the ending. The lack of voice overs, and cut scenes during these important story segments makes the game feel cheap, and the scenes lack effectiveness.  It is the lack of effort on this mechanic that irritates me, I mean Fallout 2 (which came out in 1998) had cut-scenes, which were just a slide show with a voice over. So it wouldn't be difficult for them to do something similar if they wanted to. Lastly, I encounter a rather nasty bug in the game that I feel the need to pointed out, since it is seems to be common, and it is major. Near the end of the game, at numerous occasions, I lost the ability to move or command my characters. And as you can guess, this was game breaking. The only recover I found was to reload a manual save file. I don't think having an issue like this is acceptable, especially in a title that has been out for a while. Like I said at the top, Dragonfall isn't going to change your opinion on the Shadowrun series if you had a negative view of it before. But if you liked it or had mixed feelings about it than it might. It takes what worked in Returns and does them better.			"

												Awesome game. Harebrained took the essence from shadowrun (rpg) and made this game full of mistery, history and combat. The turn based system with cover its perfect for who likes strategy.I totally recommend this game. One of best rpg games I've played			"

												Great game. Only played a little so far, but the dialog is much better than Shadowrun Returns.  My only issue with the game is no voice acting.  The walls of text drag on and ruin it for me sometimes and I feel that if good voice acting was in the game, it would just shine.  8/10 IMHO.			"

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is the expansion to Shadowrun: Returns. And for the most part they share the same core mechanics, with Dragonfall having a few improvements to UI, party management, and overall level design. So if you didn't like Returns, than you are not going to like Dragonfall either.  On the other hand, if you only kind of enjoy Returns, or thought it was below average than you'll enjoy Dragonfall due to  its improvements.  Dragonfall has a lot of the same things going for it that Returns had too. The story is a compelling tale of revenge with numerous subplots and character development. All of which is told through a lot of reading. The characters in your group and in the game's world have their own goals, personalities, and abilities.  All of which makes them feel more realistic and relatable. Lastly specialization matters in the game since there are numerous options in the game's environment and dialogue that can only be access by a character proficient in a certain skill or talent. And while some might look negatively on this as limiting gameplay, I found it to be a positive since it made character development feel like it matter beyond just picking combat skills.Dragonfall has a few things going against it, most of which were also in Returns. The game's camera has an isometric view that cannot be rotated, which limits what the user can see and how levels are design. And while this fits into their desire art style, that art style is kind of bad. There isn't a lot of detail being displayed, and most objects/npcs are unremarkable. This also affects the next problem which is the production value for the game. There is a lot of reading, and I mean a lot, like a hundred of pages of text. And for most of the game this is fine, but where I take exception to it is during important scenes like the ending. The lack of voice overs, and cut scenes during these important story segments makes the game feel cheap, and the scenes lack effectiveness.  It is the lack of effort on this mechanic that irritates me, I mean Fallout 2 (which came out in 1998) had cut-scenes, which were just a slide show with a voice over. So it wouldn't be difficult for them to do something similar if they wanted to. Lastly, I encounter a rather nasty bug in the game that I feel the need to pointed out, since it is seems to be common, and it is major. Near the end of the game, at numerous occasions, I lost the ability to move or command my characters. And as you can guess, this was game breaking. The only recover I found was to reload a manual save file. I don't think having an issue like this is acceptable, especially in a title that has been out for a while. Like I said at the top, Dragonfall isn't going to change your opinion on the Shadowrun series if you had a negative view of it before. But if you liked it or had mixed feelings about it than it might. It takes what worked in Returns and does them better.			"

												If you love Shadowrun, you owe it to yourself to play this one. It tells an awesome, and very cyberpunk tale.The game play is a great turn based rpg style, and all of the characters are unique and fun to play with. They have stories and motivations of thier own. Your character is given a little depth, based on how you complete missions, and how interact with NPCs. If you like rpgs, and you like cyberpunk, you must get this game.			"

												The Short:9/10Excellent game with a strong story, fun character customization, and a decent combat system. One of the few games I've been coming back to in order to see what's next (a rare thing for me, these days.)The Long:This story driven game is probably one of the best I've played in years. With a gripping story line, a sense of consequences for your actions (it reminds me a bit of Mass Effect trilogy, in this regard), and regular little rewards for the curious... it's turned out to be a very engrossing little game. (I'm on the last mission at around 32 hours of play time).No, the graphics aren't wiz-bang, chummers, but they do the job. The combat system is obviously based on a pen and paper system, your teammates are unique (as well as have their own personal stories), and you can build your character how you want to as you play through (with corresponding rewards and dialogue options being unlocked, depending on your skills). This game evolves around what so many current-generation games fail to think about: THE STORY.If you like a narrative focused games with good character developement, this is definately worth considering... ESPECIALLY if you catch it on Steam sale (I think I got it for like $3 U.S.).There is a recurring bugs that pops up (trying to move a character to a hex directly above a teammate's position is almost impossible) that is annoying, but the game has otherwise been stable, playable, and fun.I never really got into pen and paper RPGs, but I did read the rule books for a few (Shadowrun included), and enjoyed seeing aspects of that world brought to life. My biggest complaint? That you can't do local or online co-op or multiplayer. I greatly prefer playing games with friends. Maybe we'll see more of this in the future.Lastly... say ""hi"" to Knight-King Phil for me. I'd also encourage you to be nice to him if you meet him while running in the shadows ;)			"

												Shadowrun Returns is a solid game.Dragonfall is a great--excellent even--game. This is your true to heart and classic CRPG. Good, solid turn based mechanics, varied character building, engaging and excellent narrative and storytelling, characters you grow attached to, and an immersive and expansive world.Dragonfall fixes pretty much all the problems with Shadowrun Returns.  It's much less linear and the addition of a hub makes you feel much more connected to the game. You grow fond of your little community and the people who live within in.  You are given choices in this game and even if they don't implicitly seem to matter in the long run, they matter morally to you and to your character. Roleplaying recommended. Permanant squadmates. With personal storyline quests and character development. An engaging plot that makes you feel more included in the world--that you are influencing the world around you and making changes for the better or the worse. Much better UI system. It's clearer what cover you're characters are in and what skills you have available. Skill checks that actually decide how you go about things. Don't have decking 3 to unlock the door? Is your strength high enough to kick it down? Is your charisma high enough to talk your way through sticky situations? A harder challenge than the too easy Shadowrun Returns. You have armor, flanking, and covering to work around.Dragonfall retains what made Shadowrun Returns so good: an immersive world, incredible storytelling driven by excellent and plentiful writing, and tangible characters. It takes what Shadowrun Returns did right, fixes its weak points and made everything better.If you liked Shadowrun Returns do yourself a favour and play Dragonfall. If you thought Shadowrun Returns was too linear or lacked a truely compelling plot gives Dragonfall a shot. If you haven't played Shadowrun Returns but like turn based RPGs and/or cyberpunk play Dragonfall over Shadowrun Returns (but I suggest you play Shadowrun Returns anyway). They're standalone titles.  If you hate reading and good storytelling stay far, far away from this game.			"

Combat could be a bit better but it's accessible and still provides you with a bevy of options, characters are all brilliantly written, soundtrack and art are both magnificent, UI is a noticeable improvement over Returns, the Matrix is better than Hong Kong's design, plot starts off kinda generic but by the end it comes together in a wonderful fashion.

												Great expansion/game from the 1st Shadowrun Returns game (though if you have not played it you can jump right in). The game skips out on the world law however so you might want to pop over to the Shadowrun wiki before you do just to work out why orcs are shooting mages with cyber guns.Its a fun tactical rpg with combat close to the most recent x-com - enemy unknown game. Position, cover and abilities all will need to be used to be successful. My 1st run through took about 20+ hours with most of the side mission though it was buggy in some places (mostly scrolling round during matrix runs).Storyline was good but not great for me - I went in as a Orc Street Samurai (big guns) and a lot of the game felt like they would have really preferred it if I had played a decker or a mage. However the character creation system is very flexible and it certainly warrants a second play.If you like cyber punk, combat RPGs and interesting settings I would recommend this one for you.			"

												I had fun with Shadowrun Returns, but it was Dragonfall what made me fall in love with the game. They improve gameplay with many different features but, more importantly from my point of view, the story is more detailed, deep and feels more like what I came to expect from a Shadowrun experience. This time you actually have a group of runners, you get side missions, different paths to complete your goals and all that good stuff. It still have flaws, such as very limited cyberware implants and the inability to trade inventory itens with your teammates, but the fun I had while playing more than compensated for it's problems. If you're a Shadowrun fan, likes cyberpunk themed stuff or simply enjoys strategy games rich in text and world lore, than you should check this out.			"

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a great game and an improvement on the base game. If the original Dead Man's switch left you with a feeling that something was missing - try this one. The campaign is more refined, focuses on team members and feels much more involving, giving a lot possible endings to be achieved.Great adventure, tactical combat and the world heavily influenced by Neuromancer novels.A must, if you like cyberpunk. Heavily recommended if you like tactical, turn based combat and classic RPGs.			"

												After almost 2 decades (yes, I am an old man) I returned to Shadow run with Dragonfall. And after over 50 hours of game play I really want to hug everyone at HBS. No voice acting and no cuts scenes. Controlled by left click alone. Dragonfall does not need any of that. The story and characters are intriguing, the game play is relaxing but interesting and fun. And best of all: I can play it with one hand while my son sleeps in my other arm. Beat that, Fallout!			"

												I would say that Shadowrun Returns is like 4 or 5 on 10. Not enough missions, not enough actions, on a 12hrs walkthrough I spent like 5 hrs reading, not that is bad, but half of it was so boring. Dragonfall got a much better storyline, more actions, but maybe a little too hard... 5 on 10. The ratio between fun and frustration is not good, more frustration than fun and videogames are about fun, so I think the developpers litteraly miss the point of doing a game.			"

												Please note: I've played the original expansion for Shadowrun Returns, not the Director's Cut version. However, I imagine they are similar enough to write a reasonably accurate review.In short, this is one of the best modern day RPG's. A fantastic story, amazing turn-based combat system, great characters and real Shadowrun-atmosphere unlike in the original Dead Man's Switch campaign (here you actually do runs against different corporations and other enemy factions, many of them are optional). In the basegame (Dead Man's Switch), maps are linear and your character skills and stats are not utilized enough in dialogue, but in Dragonfall, both have been addressed incredibly well. There is also a nice variety of character interaction and optional side quests (you know, REAL side quests, not like thos in Dead Man's Switch).In many ways, this game reminds me of the games from the golden age of Bioware: Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Knights of the Old Republic and Jade Empire. It has similarly deep characters with interesting backstories and well thought-out story. But the setting here in the Shadowrun universe brings one unique spice to the mix: the morality is not as bland and dated as good vs. evil, but rather Witcher-like shades of gray.Then we have the epilogue section, which, while short, fills in some background information and specifics about the story and leaves the player off with an exceptionally satisfying solution - or solutions, there are choices that matter in the game!Couple words of criticism, though... While Dragonfall improves many aspects from the original Dead Man's Switch campaign, like adding a proper save system, side-quests, characters, shadowruns and story, the Matrix part is still just another combat system with little to no variety or difference to the ""real world"" combat. Luckily, there are now almost no compulsory hacking sections, so, while a bit dissappointed, I don't think this is a big deal. If you are looking for a Shadowrun game with an interesting hacking system, try the SEGA Genesis version of Shadowrun instead.Short story short: buy it, play it! If there is even a chance that you might enjoy a good old-stylish RPG mixed with modern day UI and mechanics or turn-based tactical combat game similar to XCOM:EU, I am almost certain you are going to enjoy this one thoroughly. To me, it left such a deep impression that I just can't put into words. I used to play the SEGA Genesis version of Shadowrun, and before I played this, it was hands-down the best implementation of the classic tabletop RPG. Now it has been dethroned by Dragonfall, easily.9/10, an instant classic and underappreciated RPG. Compared to mediocre Dead Man's Switch, this is a _huge_ improvement.			"

												Harebrained Schemes really expanded upon their Shadowrun Returns game engine in this remaster. They improved on the armour system, the party and the mission structure resulting in an experience that feels a lot more like a campaign about a group of shadowrunners rather than a single runner who gains and discards companions.One of few RPGs I have spent the time to play through multiple times so I can see some of the other conversation options.

												If you want some turn based combat in a fantasy-cyberpunk RPG look no further.  Dragonfall is an improvement in every way over Shadowrun Returns’ original campaign of Dead Man’s Switch and the directors cut improves the game even further.  Unlike many modern RPGs, Dragonfall can be played and completed in a number of different role-playing ways.  A typical mission may offer the options to go in guns blazing, to diplomatically talk your way to your goal, to bribe an NPC for information on a side door in that is less guarded, or to strong arm that NPC into giving you that info for free. The writing is excellent.  Many of the missions are more than what they seem to be at first and can often be resolved in ways that are unexpected.  Your choices have an effect and can change not only the way that missions are completed, but the ending as well.  The companions are well fleshed out and memorable, each with their own personality.  The directors cut adds companion quests and options that give each of them more depth that allows you to learn more about them and their history.Summary: The setting is unique with well-written characters, missions, and a few surprises.  Take your stims, chummer, and run these shadows.			"

												One of the best examples of what has lately been a renaissance for this type of top-down RPG (two other noteworthy entires are Divinity: Original Sin and Wasteland 2). The character building is robust without being confusing and the storyline and world-building are excellent, but the real star is the X-Com-style combat system. Keep in mind that this isn't necessarily a huge open-world sandbox like some of the others I mentioned (which is not a bad thing) but rather a more focused, semi-linear experience, akin to a RPG module or campaign. I have yet to play the original game but the general concensus is that this stand-alone sequel/ expansion is the superior of the two.			"

												I can start with a nice, clear, simple statement:  Dragonfall is -awesome-.It's a great game, I thoroughly enjoyed it.The earlier Shadowrun title, ""Dead Man's Switch"" was a bit hit and miss for me.  I've never really liked retro-style graphics (c'mon people it's 2015), and I found the story to be overly linear -- but overall I enjoyed it, and would give it maybe a 7/10 .. not great, but worth my time.Imagine my surprise when I move on to Dragonfall and find it to be .. just wonderful.They made some small game improvements, but in essence it's the same game as the earlier title .. but the main difference is the writing.  Best I can do is analogise -- Dead Man's Switch is to Dragonfall .. as The Hobbit is to The Lord of the Rings.Meaning a lesser (but still fun) work that came before a much grander work.The characters and situations in Dragonfall are just beautifully written.  They're just really well written, believable and their verbal and non-verbal exchanges are simply put - bloody great mate.I really thoroughly recommend Dragonfall, I gave it 9 out of 10 bronze jabberoos.

												Ive been a fan of Shadowrun since the SNES title, even before I knew it was a tabletop RPG. After nearly 2 decades of waiting for a worthy successor to Jake Armitage's original mission, Harebrained Schemes pulls the rabbit out of the hat, only to find that its made of gemstone-encrusted gold.Dragonfall is a fantastic tactical turn-based RPG with a great score and a storyline which will have you guessing until the end- and even then nothing is guaranteed without your own personal influence. I and my roommate both played the game through, and even though the main plot remained the same, the paths we chose and the outcome of the story based on those decisions wound up to be two completely different scenarios. With the amount of decisions that become available to you throughout the 30-ish missions depending on your stats, class, etiquette, race, ETC...this is a game with a LOT of replay value. If you loved 'Shadowrun Returns', do yourself a favor and pick up Dragonfall- it makes 'Returns' look like a beta in regards to how much is offered as far as gameplay is concerned. If youve never played Shadowrun before, I can only describe it as ""Blade Runner"" meets ""Lord of the Rings"". How cool of a concept is that alone??There are few things to gripe about in this game, but here are the things which I would like to see fixed:-When you find an item you are allowed to send it to your stash (which is only accessible pre-round) or swap it with something in your inventory. However, when you hover over your inventory, no popup appears, telling you what that item is- and until youre familiar with the item icons it can be tough to judge what to keep and what to swap.-Similarly, when you find an item, you cannot give it to a fellow teammate, even if they have inventory room...kinda sucks to find a really good grenade and then have to decide whether to swap it for one of the 5 items you can carry to battle, or just ignore it til next round because you cant offer it to someone else. -Sometimes, AOE (area of effect) attacks will not display the targetting ring at the feet of target until you cancel the move and re-select it. -While shifting between the Matrix and ""meatspace"", the music will sometimes bug out and play the wrong track, or simply stop altogether.Small complaints, but its hard to find faults in such a great game. Dragonfall delivers a package more solid than John Holmes...I cant wait to see what theyre doing with ""Hong Kong"". Check this one out!!			"

												Shadowrun Dragonfall is the best CRPG I've played in a while.Some features I was particularly impressed with: Fully fleshed out campaign hub. The npc vendors don't just sell you med kits, they have stories and dialogue trees that change as the plot progresses. The game systems are all integrated with the story, so immersion doesn't get sacrificed. Flexible party system. Your 3-4 main npc companions can be supplimented by mercenary runners, allowing your main character to really be any skill-set without endangering your ability to complete missions. The companions each have their utility, often times being able to ""step in"" and help your character solve puzzles or negotiate. As a follow up to the above, your main character has a lot of customization options, as you grow in power you get to specialize or spread out your skills and attributes. Even going into the end of the game the choice of what skill to increase next was always a difficult trade-off. Unlike typical crpgs, your statistics like HP, damage and accuracy do not automatically improve as you advance, you have to allocate your points towards those goals. This lets you be well rounded or neglect area in order to specialize in others, depending on your play style. Battle difficulty is balanced by in-game choices. The truly difficult fights in the game are often avoidable, and the ones you are forced to engage in typically have alternate win conditions besides wiping out the enemy force. Even the toughest fights will have environmental aids in the form of bonus party memebers or interactable battlefield (targetable explosive barrels, enemy factions that will fight each other if you lead them into each other, etc). Dialogue and Diplomacy can play a huge part in your story, if you so choose. Conversations with important npcs have a *lot* of branches, some of which appear after interacting with the environment (reading a journal or e-mail) or having the proper skill. Your companions open up to conversation based on in-game events, giving the progression a very organic feel. Charisma gives the option of unlocking ""Etiquette"" traits chosen as you raise it, instead of just being a number. Every few points of Charisma allow you to choose an Etiquette specialization (Academic, Corporate, Street, etc), which allows the game to provide diplomatic options without letting a charming PC bypass everything. Most major encounters have a diplomatic option, but you can't have enough Etiquettes to charm everyone. This way even the dumb thug PC can be versed in gang etiquette without having to become silver-tongued, which is a nice alternative to the traditional ""low int/cha pc must kill everything"" default.Dragonfall's main flaws are in my opinion: Poor inventory system, you cannot trade items with party members in the middle of a mission. This gets annoying because your main character can only carry a few items, so you end up finding grenades, guns and stims that you can't pass to your party members till after the mission has ended. This will be changed in the next Shadowrun game according to their kickstarter. The isometric camera angle can obscure targets sometimes, forcing you to play ""find the pixel"" when multiple characters are adjacent and overlapping their models. Some noticable bugs (especially in the cyberspace segments). Things like disappearing enemy health bars. I didn't experience anything game-breaking but I did have one instance where my character was able to jack into the Matrix (the cyberspace world) twice at once.  Decking/Matrix battles suffer from being really repetitive after the first couple times you jack-in. Like the Fade sequences in the Dragon Age series, the Matrix wears out it's fun. One fun part of some missions is having a decker jacked in to the system while the rest of your team are fighting, so you play 3 matrix turns for every 1 ""meatspace"" turn. Eventually I found the matrix portions to be boring, and longed to get them over with in order to return to the rest of the game. By the second half of the game the meatspace battles have many variables and strategies to try but the matrix mechanics never really evolve. Just as you get different gear, spells and abilities as you progress in the game, you gain ""programs"" for use in cyber warfare, but instead of getting more interesting the numbers just get bigger. Fortunately almost all the decking in the game is optional or has optional components.Besides those specifics, Dragonfall has good game mechaics and an excellent story. The turn-based combat system feels like a clean combination of Fallout and XCOM. The graphics are beautiful, especially the character portraits and scenery. The music and ambient sound are both top-notch, I usually listen to other music when gaming but the soundtrack here adds greatly to immersion. Despite its flaws I recommend Shadowrun Dragonfall to any fan of CRPGs and Cyberpunk.			"

												Shadowrun Returns was a very, very good game, with a little biases in game balance and a plot that flattened a bit at the end. But Dragonfall looks like the best RPG with turn-based combat since Fallout 2, I guess, especially in terms of storytelling and characters' personalities development. There are also a lot of positive minor tweaks and enhancements in gameplay and UI. Oh, and this ex-DLC is about two times bigger than a base game.Skill tree and combat system maybe not the deepest in the history of the genre, but still rather interesting and highly variable. Story brings here more non-mandatory restrains to team building than it does in Shadowrun Returns. On the other side, chatting with your core crew members and NPCs sometimes is even more interesting than gameplay itself, so you wouldn't switch your teammates for anyone else. Exceptionally good writing, even better than in Returns.			"

												It makes me sad to write a negative review as there are tons of stuff made right in this game. Overall combat and ""hacking"" are just so frustrating and simplified it kills the game for me. Playing this game is like reading a good book but as it is marketing as a video game I really wanted it to be like playing a great video game.pros:- well writen main story, companions and sidequests.- fantastic art style- dialogue has improved since Shadowrun: returns and is now actually interesting to read.- You can now decide the missions you wish to complete (major improve over SR:R)cons:- Combat: You want to make xcom-style combat but leave the best part (destructive environment) out of it? It won't work as covers can't be destoyed and you can't make alternative paths by destoying part of a wall off. Combat is really repetitive because now you just use the same  tactics over and over again. - Hacking is just more combat which is the worst part done in the game. Hacking would be much better if it just have some kind of infiltration minigame or pretty much anything but poorly exececuted figthing.- Character leveling is designed poorly as there are like max 2 skill trees you are ever going to use in whole game per character. You really can't feel any difference in your character after spending 40 karma points (kinda like talent points in this game).- Safe house theme and gun sounds are great but besides them sound world of this game is completely death. No voice acting, environment sounds, shady background music...- Reading dialogues is half a game so it's fair to ask font size to be readable: It's curently so small you really have to rest your eyes after 2 hours playing and there is no way to resize font in game.10 - Perfect game9 - Excelent game, best of the genre8 - Good game, worth your time7 - Average game, nothing really special6 - Bad game, avoid5 - Painful to play, completely waste of time4 - Failed game, unpayable			"

												I would love to recommend this game, and for many players that don't want to play on the highest difficulty it will probably be a good experience, but the still utterly broken cover system (way worse than for example XCOM : EU) made it so I had to lower the difficulty by one level. Then it was pretty much too easy. I could then ignore the shortcomings of the cover system, and keep in mind combat is still better than in the first Shadowrun Returns, but it just wasn't a challenge anymore. Good story, setting, leveling etc. really didn't have any major gripes with it apart from those two. Now it's deinstalled.TL:DR:Cover system is broken and horrible on highest difficulty.Deinstalled the game after half of the otherwise amazing campaign.			"

Seeing as the game has been out for a while there probably isn't much chance of them being fixed.The particular bug that I started to encounter towards the later half of the game where you lose the ability to interact with the game in any way and have to force close it. The previous title 'Shadowrun Returns' had a very similar bug; its a shame the devs never fixed it for this sequel.If you do decide to pick it up while its on sale make sure to manually save often as the bug may be connected with the quicksave feature based on reading the forums.

Indie & Kickstarted?! You should have told me! [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]Finished in about 20 hours, so I will talk very consciously about it.Game started quite bad for my taste, but then things got slightly better... and stabilized on average. I didn't know it was an indie kickstarted project developed for smartphones and tablets in mind and this explains a lot of cons.First, I would like to talk about the gameplay. Having experience with a lot of RPGs and turn-based games I have been disappointed: percentages to hit seem to be flawed, covering system is ridiculous, inventory is caotic, some combo are overpowered (you'll instakill with rifles and relative stats at 8+), experience points are given randomly and not by killing enemies, the stats of your party members are scripted, AI always attacks first (resolved in S:HK) and it' also dumb (you can wait for them at corners or take them from the shoulders), some mobs can't suffer critical hits, you are not given so many possibilities of attacking, you can't use your items outside of combat, often you are not given the option of using your teamates abilities in the quests, etc.Then, the story: I spent 20+ hours in the game clicking furiously and skipping 2/3 of the useless dialogues. Why ""useless""? 1) They are scripted, the choices you'll make DO NOT alter the game (if not a couple of occasions) 2) Skills are useless for dialogues: even when you are given the choice to use them, they just provide a couple of more rows of text to read 3) *someone die, so we have to find the culprit* bla bla *turns out all the city is in danger* bla bla *random excuse for making side missions* bla bla *gear up and go final attack*.Graphics: from the screenshots it seems to be very powerful... it's not. Just colourful. Game has big optimizations problems even if it's just a 2D world with 3D characters (welcome back '90). I got more than a couple of freezings but game always managed to stay alive (one way or another). Quicksaves often ""saved"" the day, but no crashes as told in some other reviews.Shadowrun Return has the same graphics but don't suffer from these problems: even level loading are quicker! If we compare the two games (with the same latest engine), Dragonfall has a more polished UI, a more intriguing story, nicer matrix puzzles, more turning points, but feels like a revised expansion (which is, in fact).The matrix puzzles, the door keyboard puzzles, the stealth mission and some side quests to dig into the past of your teammates are nice additions, but in the end they are just another *clicking*. I would have preferred more attention to the gameplay.I enjoyed it? Yes and no. Yes because I like these type of games, no because X-Com, Civilizations, Fallout still stand on a higher level. I would call it a nice time waster. If you are looking for a solid game, you should look elsewhere. I hope they'll get better in the next chapters.Best played with Keyboard & MouseRecommended Buy Price < 20$Score 7,5/10 "

												Dragonfall is a greatly enhanced version of Shadowrun returns whatever aspect you look onto it. A deeper and more engaging story, more stuff to interact to, a whole town as your base, better UI, A TEAM THAT YOU OWN, 30+ hours of gameplay. Although you have your own team, you still can't fully customize and kit them to your liking, instead you are given a simplified level-up menu on what you can upgrade to them.Unfortunately, despite all of those, I cannot recommend this because of one single thing. The Percentage chance feels really off.It did quite felt off in shadowrun returns, but I didn't mind it because the campaign on it is only 33-40% of relative length compared to dragonfall. But man, you are going to get frustrated and maybe forced to save scum because of the RNG chance. I'm not talking about the values being low, I'm talking about the expected results reflected on the current chance. I.E: 92% chance to hit, but you miss 4 out of 5 hits, are you kidding me? Also don't tell me that I need to show sample size, statistics proof yada yada, this inconsistent result happens way too often.Also wtf is up with the loading times? I guess the places are now somewhat bigger, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ like 30sec of loading?Do I recommend this game? No for people who loves turn based strategy games. But if you want a decent RPG with decent storyline and multiple ways to build your character, get this game, but don't expect a fair gameplay.			"

												I bought Shadowrun on a whim when it was discounted, not really knowing what I was getting myself in to. Having just completed it 5 minutes ago, I have to say......what a great game. One of my games of the year in fact.Fantastic writing with a labyrinthine plot and interesting characters - almost reaches the greatness of Baldur's Gate II in this respect. The level design is great and music is very atmospheric.Only two minor cons:Firstly, the visuals are a bit lacklustre. The backdrops are great, but character models are mediocre and in combat, the animations lack weight. You may critical hit with a shotgun, but you don't feel a sense of impact. Secondly, the combat itself. It's not bad by any means. In fact it's quite good. If you like XCOM it will be right up your street.

												Please note that the played time above is inncorrect, I've put a hell of a lot more hours into this game.Excellent. For a game that was on the sale which I thought ""Looks ok, reminds me of Fallout, only a couple of pounds. Why not?"" this turn based sci-fi meets fantasy rpg is one of the best games that I have played this year.Graphics-wise, think Baldur's Gate, Diablo, and Fallout 1 & 2. OK, it may a bit old school, not going to set the world on fire, but graphics alone don't make a game.The story is what drives it. Like reading a book that you are enjoying, you want to continue to see what will happen to you and your group of shadowrunners, with the added bonus that, once completed, you can start again with the attitude of 'What happens if I do this?...'Superb game. Absolutly love it.           10/10			"

												So far it's been better than Shadowrun Returns in everyway. It fixed my one main problem with the last title, you had to pay for companions. This, was the opposite of what I would have wanted, and it seems that I was not alone, because companions are free, and your party can even go over 4 now. Instead of the one interesting character in the last game every character has had good personalities. You want to talk to everyone and see what they have to say. Shadowrun Dragonfall is a better game in every way, and trust me when I say that the last game is not the game you should buy. The games are not linked in anyway besides backstory for how the world got the way it is. Took an 8/10 game and made it a 10/10 game*.*not finished yet, could turn really terrible			"

												I bought Shadowrun on a whim when it was discounted, not really knowing what I was getting myself in to. Having just completed it 5 minutes ago, I have to say......what a great game. One of my games of the year in fact.Fantastic writing with a labyrinthine plot and interesting characters - almost reaches the greatness of Baldur's Gate II in this respect. The level design is great and music is very atmospheric.Only two minor cons:Firstly, the visuals are a bit lacklustre. The backdrops are great, but character models are mediocre and in combat, the animations lack weight. You may critical hit with a shotgun, but you don't feel a sense of impact. Secondly, the combat itself. It's not bad by any means. In fact it's quite good. If you like XCOM it will be right up your street.

The setting, plot, and cast are all extremely engaging, however,  the wonky combat keep from achieving excellence. Very similar to, yet more forgiving than XCOM there are times when the battles are not as tense or immersive as they should be. Nevertheless, it is very easy to lose track of time exploring and defending Berlin 2054 from an unseen evil. As it stands Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut is a very good game worth your attention.			"

												Having come straight here from Divinity: Original Sin, I'm having trouble getting into this game because it's comparatively very linear (though it's not hard to be more linear than Original Sin). This is also my first Shadowrun title, and I'll possibly be buying more in the future even if it's relegated to a ""slow day"" game at this point because I like how it handles sci-fi/fantasy.I really, really hate how little room there is to roam, though. There are side quests early enough and you're allowed to visit sections you don't need to visit, per say, but the starting city is limited to a fairly small map of the essential buildings and people with the same applying to the other areas you encounter. It's point A to point B with room to stop and smell the flowers.One thing it does do a good job at is storytelling. Not too little, not too much, and not generic. As far as walking from point A to point B goes, it's pretty enjoyable as long as you're in the mood to sit still in the first place.Combat at 4 hours in has been pretty fun. There's tinkering with cover and ranged weapons, and calculating whether or not to go melee. Also some stats I haven't seen before and some additional dialogue options based on how you've allocated your points.			"

												Gripping turn-based fun.  Would say 'strategy' but that mostly relies on metagame knowledge.Dialogue options allow for several types of characters (bleeding heart or experienced shadowrunner).  Characters have rich backstories and optional missions to help resolve some loose ends for them.  The setting is oozing with cyberpunk charm and there are plenty of notes and emails to bring life to an already believable anarchist Berlin.  Choices have consequences, even if some are only getting some hateful email from somebody you wronged during a job.The only gripe I have is how combat is initiated by the enemy.  This often happens when you use a dialogue option to 'Attack', open a door, round a corner, or load into a new zone.  This always happens with your main character in the lead, your group huddled around him/her for warmth, out of cover, and enemies in or moving to cover.  The enemy moves and acts first, they favor squishy targets, and they love grenading tightly packed groups of sheep.  Kicks you right out of the experience everytime you see your crack squad of shadowrunners who have seen so many raids but get caught flat-footed when breaching a room full of guards they know are there.

It is not because of the game machanics that most modern RPG's have that make you grind and collect items for NPCs, I'm talking about the old school PC RPG games with intricate story telling and characters.I am so glad this directors cut is a stand alone DLC because because reading from what other people have said, this is a great improvement and should stand alone away from what mess had occured during the original release.

												This game is like someone waved a magic wand over a copy of William Gibson's ""Neuromancer"" and transformed it into a wonderful cRPG, but also accidently added a D&D guide to the mix. And the results were amazing.Shadowrun: Dragonfall is insanely impressive. The writing is intricate, detailed, and full of the world building goodness that makes you loveling remember games like Planescape: Torment or Baldur's Gate. You build a character from a blank slate, using a class system that is both manageable and flexible, allowing, for example, your Hacker class character to learn magic from the get-go, if  you so choose. And then the world unfurls around you, replete with body modifications, A.I.s, hackers, urban sprawl, street drugs, meta-humans, ghosts-in-the-machine and so much more.The graphics aren't jaw-dropping, but the environment and combat effects blend to create a great atmosphere and tone for the game. The combat is easy to pick up, essentially being a turn based tactical battle system where each character uses a pool of AP to move and attack. What's impressive about the combat is how organic it feels. The majority of your NPC companions start out with guns, and yet the turn-based system makes aiming, reloading, and firing fairly streamlined.Of special note is the Matrix portions of the game. Any character with Decking skills can jack into computer ports and hack computer systems. The Matrix is represented as a blue-data filled 3D map that uses the same combat system, but swaps out guns for software and hacking skills. This is a great cyberpunk element that also acts as a tideturner for certain scenarios. For example, one scenario has you infiltrate a warehouse only to have to backtrack out of it under heavy fire. All of a sudden, the Decker, who is little more than a squishy thief-style class becomes a powerhouse when she jacks into the warehouse's network and overrides the turret system. Too satisfying for words.If your a fan of old school cRPGs, well-constructed stories and settings, Cyberpunk or urban fantasy, do yourself a favor and pick this game up. It is well worth your time and money.			"

												Utterly fantastic. The combat of X-Com with the isometric RPG goodness of classic Bioware infinity engine- RPGs-and far less streamlined and linear than the somewhat ""meh"" base Shadowrun Returns Dead Man's Switch game. Between Divinity: Original Sin, Dragon Age 3, Wasteland 2, and Dark Souls 2, this year has been an embarrassment of riches for RPGs, and of them all this is the least graphically and technically impressive. It has irritating restrictions on companion ability, equipment, and even inventory customization, and I still wish there was more loot and skills to unlock. However, it runs circles around the rest this year in terms of writing, settings, and narrative, and that makes this one of the year's best in my book. Don't write it off if you didn't care for the original campaign; this is much closer to the ""sci-fi Baldur's Gate"" we were all hoping for, if not quite as deep.  I absolutely *loved* it.			"

												If you like anything to do with cyberpunk, Dragonfall Director's cut does it right.  I mean, they really hit a grand slam on every aspect of the game.  It's a lot like an interactive novel, except you get to play out the fight scenes.  Plot driven Character development is the best I've seen, ever, in any game.  And... if that's not your thing... don't talk to your team mates.  If you do listen to them, you'll feel for them.  I have to say, not once, in any game ever, have I felt an attachment to any character, until now. I get chills playing through most of the missions, reading the deep well written back story for each and every mission.  The AI seems semi-intelligent as well... they always go for my shaman, as he's my weakest link, survival-wise.  And choices... so many choices.  Many skippable runs, some minor, some major. So many different ways to overcome obstacles... locked door?  Send a drone throught a vent, or have your ""muscle"" break it down, or have your decker hack the security terminal, or have your shaman astral plane and see the keys that have been pressed, etc.If you don't like to read, well, you may not like this game.  However, it really is a good mix of reading a compelling story and interactive elements.			"

												Better than the original campaign, but still most of the same criticisms of that apply: very strong dialogue, decent plot and characters, a fun setting and lots of atmosphere. Still very linear and with clunky equipping UI, but now you can save anywhere (including in combat) and overall the story arc of this campaign is more impressive. Environments remain low on interactivity and colour text, and the lack of looting means the already somewhat linear path of the game can feel very rationed-off with no real opportunities for grinding or over-leveling, but the experience of the game is highly recommendable to CRPG fans, and one of the most accessible CRPGs too, thanks to the 2 action point combat system also used by the new XCOM. Perhaps most importantly, you can actually do runs now - that is, feel as though you have control over a homebase and go out on missions at your leisure. While it only comes about because of a contrived plot-feature, and it's not a substitute for true non-linear gameplay, it makes the game feel a lot more open and overall better-paced.			"

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is an amazing video game experience, in the directors cut your team really develops and grows. With interesting sidequests for each character and great dialog trees to follow. I would reccomend this game to anyone who wanted an example of excellent gameplay and story tied together.			"

												Well I guess this got it's own game entry instead of just a DLC for Shadowrun Returns. Below is my Shadowrun Returns review which included playthrough of the Dragonfall DLC...""This game is an absolute blast if you like the classic isometric style turn-based RPG. Best comparision I can make is Fallout 2 in the Shadowrun universe...or a cyberpunk Fallout. Either way I've played the base game plus the DLC and they've both been very enjoyable.If you're still in doubt try it out on a Steam sale and give it a shot.""			"

												Short summarization? A masterpiece of RPG work, minorly suffering from the one or other bug.Took me 24 hours to beat the game. (Once, on hard difficultY.) That alone is already a big plus, given the price of the game. AND opposed to many other campaign-driven games I actually think I'll give this game a rerun.To the details.The game is set in the Shadowrun world, which originally stems from a Pen&Paper RPG, set in a sortof-apocalyptic future (in this case 2052), where magic works again, trolls and orcs walk the earth like any human, megacoperations control most of the world... and dragons control the megacorporations from the shadows. Said shadows are your realm as well, assome sort of crinimal spec ops, a Shadowrunner.The game starts by letting you create a unique character with full flexibility as to what you want to do. Troll engineer? Elf brute? Sure, go ahead. Note that your PC (Playercharacter) is the ONLY character in this game you can fully customize. All other members of your team come with preset skills, equipment and a small upgrade tree (and the possibility to give them some of your quipment on a 'loaned' basis). So,no BG-style minmaxing of a 6-man supertroop.The gameplay consists of realtime-exploration, coupled with a lot of text, choices and some riddles. The other part (and something that will never be avoidable fully) is combat. Combat plays interesting, from start to finish, mainly due to you and your team unlocking new abilities and equipment. As well, it needs to be said that there are a lot of mechanics to grasp that are barely explained in the brief help section... Don't be surprised if you don't understand what's happening around you for the first half of the game. On top of that, the controls are a bit flunky at times (f.e. you cannot turn the isometric view and due to that will never be able to select a tile right 'behind' a standing character). Overall, satisfying enough though.(Especially if you can play as a cyber-augmented Chi-casting samurai warrior dwarf)To avoid spoilers, I'll not go into detail regarding the story. But let's express my oppinion this way: From start to finish I always felt motivated and intrigued by story. Driven to find out the backgrounds, and what could happen next. The morale choices the game presents you (and boy, it does that alot) as well never felt to simple. And when you come to the big turning points in the story (that have major influence on the gameplay), you really sit down, lean back and think for a minute or two before pressing a button.I feel obliged to mention the presence of a few bugs, too: I had to do the final fight twice, simply because one enemy got stuck in an inaccessible room. I as well had the one or other occasion where an enemy AI got stuck during it's turn, causing an endless loop of waiting. And there are a few reports of crashes, albeit I had none of those myself.Overall, these issues usually are annoying, but are reasonably rare enough (having to reload 3 times across a 24 hour timeframe... annoying, but I've seen FAAAAR worse).All in all, my verdict is: BUY NOWThe story is genuinly great. The background is great (duh, it's a Pen&Paper RPG, what did you expect). The gameplay is solid and diverse enough. Graphics are fine for their purpouse, the sound is acceptable (albeit hit sound grunts get really repetitive), the music just awesome and fitting. The game is stable, except for a few rare issues.Rating: 9/10 (just slightly missed the perfection, due to control hickups, lack of tutorials and the few issues mentioned)If you see this on a sale, BUY.If it's not on a sale, but you're a fan of Shadowrun... who am I kidding, any fan of Shadowrun already has this game. But if you're into (P&P) RPG anyways, get this.If you like Tactical Combat games, you might want to buy this, too. Albeit the focus clearly lays on the Story, not the Combat System alone.			"

												Amazing game, with some annoying seemingly easy-fix mechanical issues that were not adressed by the dev team. Such as being able to pick up an item, and then hand it to someone else in the room with you, or being able to switch who you're moving around out of combat, or some way to stop the always ambushed bunched up way you have to be at nearly every combat.

												First Shadowrun game I've ever played.Cons : - Some minor bugs can sometimes appear. Saving often and during battles is advised.- Early game may be though for some people, especially if you're not used to the mechanics, don't know how the system works and make some mistakes.- I suspect the classes to be a bit unbalanced.- Character models in this engine usually don't look very good. (with the exception of the dancers <3 )Pros : - Bugs being patched as I write this- Great story with really charming characters and dialogue.- Average/Good personal character customization that really impacts the amount of choices you can make.- Good/Great character portraits and environments that fit the situation.- Gameplay : Turn-based RPG's rule ! For the vets, Hard difficulty is perfect in my opinion.Conclusion : Coming from some of the best turn-based rpg's ever like FF Tactics, Tactics Ogre (PSP), Advance Wars, Fire Emblem, and most importantly XCOM : Enemy Unknown, my hunger for that genre finally came to an end when I finished this game. And it was one fine meal.			"

												Dragonfall - Director's Cut continues the great line of the roleplaying game Shadowrun Returns: Deadman's Switch, and in some aspects adds to it - all of which are improvements in my opnion.First of all, what is Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut? Well, a roleplaying game in a dystopia future with magic, tech, drugs, politics, double-crossing and otther filth. It is not affraid to pick adult themes. Furthermore, if you look in all the nooks and crannies you can even find comments in the game that make you think about your actions; If you whipe-out that rascist organization, what about the kids that were there just to get of the street to be warm and have meal? Another example is your fellow shadowrunner who is a victim of prejudices and domestic violence. Rarely did I see this in RPGs and I played a good many. Now, not every NPC is like that and some are a bit one-dimensional, but such archtypes can be fun to have around. Like its predecessor, this RPG has turn-based combat (like e.g. X-COM or Space Marines) but with its own unique twists. In comparison to Deadman's Switch, cover has grown in importance. So, what else is new? Dragonfall places more emphasis on different stats and social etiquettes. Spells are explained more clearly and in the Matrix you can actually find statements about meatspace that you were involved in. Also some quests have taken a lighter tone with more humor, but that may or may not be to your taste.All in all, this game is interresting for any strategist, that has the balls to adress more adult themes, and that all in the unique and intriguing world of Shadowrun. I recommend this game (and its previously mentioned predecessor) for any RPG fan and for anyone that loves to read Dark Fantasy, Dystopian Futures, or Noir fiction.			"

												Phenomenal game with one of the best stories I've ever seen in a video game, or even a novel. Characters are all fully developed; conversation choices (and the results) all make sense for the character; I haven't even found any typos or grammatical errors.If you're a fan of turn-based team RPGs, or Shadowrun, or both, get this game. Immediately.The only annoyance I've discovered so far is that, playing as a shaman, summoning points for spirits seem to be few and far between. It's especially noticeable in areas with large fight scenes, where you'd expect to find at least one point, and there are none (final fight involving smugglers, for example). It's not game-breaking, and probably done for balance reasons because spirits are powerful, but in the pen & paper Shadowrun, shamans can summon spirits nearly anywhere.			"

												I fell in love with this game within 3 minutes of playing. That's a tribute to the talented wordsmith ( writer ) and the artists that designed the portraits. I ended up developing a crush on two characters.I would have liked a proper introduction, since I found the lore quite jarring ( cyberpunk meets fantasy ) and it got more surreal, as the plot evolved. It would have helped me to make different endgame choices ( I feel like I failed at the end ). I've never played the pen and paper game or the first Shadowrun game: ""Dead Man's Switch"".http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun#Fictional_universeThe classes have everything from the traditional, offensive, elemental mage and healer to the more exotic: William Gibson style hacker, who runs through ""The Matrix"" like Neo; Rigger who fixes drones and uses them as pets in combat; Samurai sword wielders that go around slicing people's heads off; Empty-handed melee combatants, that channel Chi energy.The game has a couple of references to movies like, ""The Terminator"" and ""The Sound of Music"", so it would help to have watched those.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059742/""Du Heist"" is my favourite piece of music in the game. The scene is a late night bank heist / data transfer, while rifling through papers, searching for clues and missing links:https://soundcloud.com/everistsound/shadowrun-dragonfall-directors-cut-ost-du-heist-blitzs-missionIt took me 66 hours to finish the game on ""hard"". I loved the tactical combat and plan on re-playing the game another 4 times, to experience other classes.I give this game 9/10, deducting a point for the lack of ability to rotate the map in combat, the lack of a dedicated ""move"" button and the cumbersome inventory that obviously needs redesigning.In 30 years of gaming, this might be # 5 on my list of ""Best Games of All Time""...

												When i first approached this game, i was rather skeptical. The price was right and i wanted to play something new on steam as my xbox live subscription came to an end. I picked up the game with the knowledge that i was not a huge fan of turnbased rpg's nor was i experienced with the shadowrun universe. This game has completely changed my thoughts on the turn based genre. Boasting a retro style of play with nice digital graphics and amazing concept art, the game looks good. Through in an immersive story and multiple surprises around every corner and you have yourself a winner. The only minus to this game is the lack of a proper tutorial. Ive never read manuls though so im not really bothered. This is a must buy for any PC Gamer.			"

												I played Shadowrun Returns and fell in love with everything Shadowrun. I love the world, I love the character classes, I love the music, I love the stories, I love the game play, I love everything about it. I did not think it could get any better, but I definitely wanted more of it.Shadowrun: Dragonfall gave me everything I wanted and more: it is more Shadowrun, and it actually improves on an already perfect model. As RPG's go, this is right up there with Dragons Age for me. It is perfect, it is engaging, it is re-playable, addicting, inspiring, frustrating, consistent, fluid, and impossibly fun. I cannot recommend this game highly enough.My only complaint is that you are not able to import your Shadowrun Returns character. I spent hours building up my character and acquiring skills, and yet I'm forced to drop it for Dragonfall. That hurts a little. But it's a minor complaint because, admittedly, it's a new game and with a new game you get a new character. So be it.Otherwise, as I have said, this game is perfect. It is cyberpunk done right (and this from a guy who can't stand Snowcrash or other ""classic"" cyberpunk landmarks), and maybe more importantly, it's RPG done right.Harebrained Schemes should be proud, and I commend them for bringing this masterpiece to Linux.

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall Gameplay: BPros; Design is streamlined, combat is pleasing, though possible to simply brute-force it on normal difficulty. Interaction/exploration yields a good deal of backstory, and provides a sense of verisimilitude and depth. Even minor characters have a semblance of being living, breathing creatures. Cons; A few interface hangs mar the experience without being game-breaking. Most noteworthy were action hangs in the matrix. Did not require restarts/reloads, but entering/exiting menus and quickly hitting end-turn were necessary. Character building offers a depth that can overwhelm casual players, and feel constraining for those who want to build something diverse. Inventory space is at a premium -especially for decker/rigger builds-. Story: APros; As mentioned previous, even the minor characters have a story to tell, and a place in the world. The central figures have much more so. A true sense of growth and change for those who put the effort into pursuing it. I won't go into details on the plot, but I will say that I personally found it well written and executed. The story told was one I wanted to keep hearing. I enjoyed the decisions, and the consequences thereof. I enjoyed the antagonist characters as much as I did the protagonists, and did not feel as though they were cartoon cutouts plastered up to give you something to chase. Cons; The only real downside I have is that I felt the experience could have been spread out a little more. But that sentiment isn't one of ""lacking value"", but rather a deep appreciation for the world I'd been immersed in, and a desire to see and experience more of it. Art design / Sound design:  BPros; The artistic choices reflect a deep understanding and appreciation for the IP. From the darkest slum to the brightest corporate office, the environments felt rich and detailed. The audio was rather simple, but conveyed all the meaning it was meant to, and never pulled away from the immersion of the scene.  The sound design as a whole fit the world it was built for, and I was impressed by some of the more subtle aspects in regards to audio for magic. Cons; In a nutshell? Old tools. With a bigger budget, and the same love and devotion, this could easily stand against AAA titles. I don't consider this a failing, but I hope to see more from HBS, and would love to see them tackle the shadows with deeper pockets. Replay value: Moderately low, by itself. Moderately high if the Shadowrun community puts in the effort to tell new stories. There are a lot of different ways to play through the game, and a lot of builds to experiment with. But like a good book, once you've read it, you know where it's going to take you. The journey can be fun, but the destination remains the same. My bottom line:If you enjoy turn-based combat and tactics, have no fear of reading a good book, and enjoy a darker tale, this will be right up your alley. It's worth the play, and I'm honestly kind of sad to have waited as long as I had to experience it.			"

												I have to say I'm enjoying the game so far. I don't even mind that they split off the Dragonfall campaign. It just kind of defeats the point of expansions in general. These types of games only need to release campaigns ever once in a while with fanmade content to supplement it and you're golden. They don't really have to shoot for 100 hours of content. Just keep expanding on the city and main character, even if the crew changed up.This ""review"" just as feedback really, my biggest gripe is the location of the dialog pictures and text. I feel like I'm reading a book along with the game instead of it integrating the dialog with the game. With modern technology, there is really no reason to tell me so much and not show it to me. The camera can zoom in closer and show me the expression on someone's face, if not, change the picture to mimic what the text is saying.Also the characters should make body movements along with the text. I shouldn't have to imagine someone reaching for their gun when there could just be a ""hand on hip"" animation of pose.			"

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is an amazing game. You come to love each and every character because the amazing storytelling and backstory each one has.

												One of the better strategy RPGs of the last decade. Great depth of strategy, and a turn-based gameplay style that requires thought and planning to complete, especially in the later levels. It does a great job of capturing the feel of the Shadowrun tabletop RPG and should be highly enjoyable to anyone who loves the Shadowrun universe, or cyberpunk genre games in general.			"

												Really Awesome Game You'll have to be willing to read a lot of dialogues but they're very well written and the story is interesting. I think what makes this game really stand out is the amount of choices you have in dialog driven situations. It's really hard some times to decide what to do but its really rewarding in the end and some of the outcomes are really suprising. The Combat is challenging and fun and the character progression is also well made.I recommend this game to everyone who likes the genre and who is not too lazy to read.			"

												Definitely an upgrade from  the original SRR.  I still feel the world is way to small/instanced but it feels much more lively this time around.  Changed the combat HUD which I am not sure why it really needed to change but I guess people complained abou it. I found it fine as is though I must admit it does look streamlined now. The option to bypass missions by several means is now available much more often than before. However it is still too linear for me. I just feel as if this game should be more open sandbox style. However as I watch the changes to Shadowrun Online it seems as if that is slowly going in the direction I had wanted for this game as well as its predecesor. Overall very solid gamplay. Combat feedback is very nice. I can now tell why I crit or why I didn't instead of having to vaguely guess why it happened. You command a team this time around which is kind of sweet and the story is much more intriguing for me. The Matrix still leaves so much to be desired and as such it's almost a waste to be a decker even though it can open up some interesting avenues. I can see myself playing a few runs through on this even if to only try a few different classes. The story wont change but at least I feel somewhat compelled to play it again compared to Returns. Don't forget to check out the workshop for custom UGC's. There are some that are definitely worth it including some that are still works in progress. I would reccomend Dragonfall if you don't have Returns as it is defintely the better of the two. If you did buy it and liked it or not I would reccomend giving this one a go especially while it's on sale.			"

												My first time stepping into the Shadowrun universe and it immediately sucked me in. First of all the atmosphere the game wraps you in is fantastic. The world design is original and intriguing, the areas are beautifully rendered and the music is fantastic. The storytelling and dialogue options are well written and don't fall into some of the cookie cutter tropes other games fall into. Because it's the main reference I have, I would only say that the XCOM style turn based combat system which I love could use a little tweaking. I wish the game was longer because I have become quite immersed in the world, I look forward to more Shadowrun releases.			"

												This game has everything!-Mages-Shaman-Melee-Weapon specialists-Hackers-Dogs-Drones-Humans, elves, orcs, trolls, dwarves... (i maybe missing out on 1 or 2)-Dragons-And many more!Mechanics is simple enough to get me into the game real fast. But, you can go much more deeper into it at the tougher difficulties. Interesting story plot. Dragons + cyber + elves/dwarves + futuristic setting (like combining LOTR and Matrix into 1 movie), and they actually managed to pull it off (at least for me).One downside is that you can't buy equipements for your team. I guess this is how they encourage you to start another game with a totally different class/build (to increase replayability?).Another downside is that, it has linear storyline. Sure, there are different interaction options, but the general outcome is always the same (kinda like telltale games).TL;DR? Get it when its on sale.			"

												So, I've never played the tabletop Shadowun, and bought this on a friend's advice. And it is AMAZING. A perfect blend of high-fantasy and cyberpunk settings, with a lot of variety in weapons, magic, and cybernetics to augment your character. The pacing in both campaigns is a bit odd at times (IMO), and there are some balance issues around some of the magic (adepts are a bit weak without someone to throw haste at them, healing spells are weird), but they're engrossing nonetheless, and the gameplay feels like a tabletop without being clunky.  Overall, it's my top find for 2014, and I HIGHLY encourage anyone reading this to pick it up. If you like turn-based RPGs at all, you'll LOVE Shadowrun. If you don't like the genre: well, there's no accounting for taste.			"

												This is an incredibly well-written game. The storyline is executed perfectly and the combat system is a GREAT throwback of the turn-based RPGs like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights and the first two Fallout games. Even on the normal difficulty setting, combat requires some pretty hefty tactical decisions which can either make or break success for your team of runners. If you like story-driven games or the old school isometric RPGs, I HIGHLY recommend this!			"

												Phenomenal game with one of the best stories I've ever seen in a video game, or even a novel. Characters are all fully developed; conversation choices (and the results) all make sense for the character; I haven't even found any typos or grammatical errors.If you're a fan of turn-based team RPGs, or Shadowrun, or both, get this game. Immediately.The only annoyance I've discovered so far is that, playing as a shaman, summoning points for spirits seem to be few and far between. It's especially noticeable in areas with large fight scenes, where you'd expect to find at least one point, and there are none (final fight involving smugglers, for example). It's not game-breaking, and probably done for balance reasons because spirits are powerful, but in the pen & paper Shadowrun, shamans can summon spirits nearly anywhere.			"

												I've never played the Old school Shadowruns, but if they're any good as Dragonfall then I will. This game has one of the most complex story that will suck you into the world of Shadowrun in the first few minutes of the game. With fimilar XCOM style tactics that you quickly master how to use makes battles all the more fun. Jaw dropping handdrawn backrounds with characters that you will love and hate for all the right reasons. Expermenting with cyberware and new weopens will always be one of my favorite parts of my first playthrough. And after going through the amazing main campain, you can download another on the steam workshop! So not only do you get an amazing story filled with conspricys, hard choices, and fully flushed out characters in an amazing world where you can spend hours in. But you also get Costum campains from workshop users and a great combat system with balanced classes to tie it all together. See you in the Shadows. ;)			"

												Shadowrun Returns: Dragonfall is a fantastic follow up to Shadowrun Returns that improves on it's concept and gameplay without losing any of it's amazing storytelling and RPG elements.Unlike the previous game where you just hire other runners on your team, Dragonfall gives you teammates that improve the narrative storytelling with their interesting characters and even more compelling backstory and character missions. And if you don't necessarily like one of your teammates you can of course still outsource to other runners.The combat is still rather good, following an XCOM turn based action style incorporating the cover system. The RPG aspect of the game as to what class you play and how you customize your teammates affects the style of which you fight enemies in giving you the ability to avoid them or just run in guns blazing.All in all, a really good game for a turn-based combat or RPG lover.

												Huge step up from SR Returns but thats prolly not news.Technically the standalone version has some upgraded graphics, some combat mechanic adjustments (Flanking is accounted for now) and UI changes which at first seemed not so great - fixed menues instead of collapsing ones meaning more stuff on screen - but provide more ease of use. Also more missions and stuff apparently but i cant tell, never played the expansion version. Id say get the standalone.Gameplaywise its all good. Combat is more or less the same but in terms of missions and stuff theres a noticeable evolution. Depending on your skills, things you did before, guys you got with you or even by just doing something in the world (down to just looking at a picture) which can open up dialogue choices without skill checks you can solve situations in different ways and get different outcomes. Doesnt need to shy away from the Fallouts and Arcanum in that regard.This time around you get a fixed crew which you can also outfit to a certain degree (still can hire runners - i guess those dudes would have unique dialogues and such too and theyre not that expensive anymore but ehhh), they also get their own little story quest if you care enough - which you should, even if its just for the upgrades they get as a result.Cons :- yet again feels abit confined, altho theres loads of stuff to do (id say you can clock a good 20 hours). Really wish there was an overworld like in the old SNES game where you could run around and shoot up random dudes for monies instead of just the Hub. Purely subjective of course, this way you really get a ""tailormade"" experience instead of instanced loot dungeons. I wouldnt have minded a few loot dungeons but yeah, subjective.- leads to : yet again so many shinies to buy and so little moneys, moreso since you now can give stuff to your dudes. I guess its for balance reasons but you get OP anyway?- leads to : to counter that the game introduces new layers of difficulty on the normal combat towards the end like timed objectives and then split objectives and then finally both at the same time. I guess its for varieties sake so you dont just have more and more mooks thrown at you; i found that hugely annoying and would have preferred more mooks. Yet again subjective tho.In conclusion, great stuff any negatives i could bring up are purely subjective. Heartily recommendedTL;DR buy it drekhead			"

												I have beaten this game and I had a great time with it. The quality of writing is fantastic and I was very interested in the plot itself. A lot of choice is given in dialogue interactions via skill checks which can alter a few things, sometimes as simple as a bit of extra currency coming your way or avoiding entire combat encounters by smooth talking guards, which feels great to do.Combat is turn based using action points to either move, shoot, etc. with hit chances being percentage based so occasionally this can prove to be a mild annoyance if you're not consistantly lucky or are dumping points into skills to make you more accurate. Enemy ai can prove challenging even on normal difficulty, lobbing grenades at your party like no tomorrow.Though a lot of combat can be avoided via dialogue and skill checks, a fair amount is still forced upon you especially in the endgame, skill points in combat are a must so don't do what I did and max out charisma hoping to sweet talk your way through everything.The games story will take roughly 18-20 hours to complete, possibly more if you hunt down every sidequest.Stability wise I only encountered one crash and a couple of framerate hitches throughout my entire playthrough, nothing game-breaking or bothersome.I would definitely recommend playing this if you're a fan of strategy based rpg's.

												This game was brilliant.  I haven't written many reviews for games on Steam, but this one blew me away enough to take the time.I was a little apprihensive buying this as I played Shadowrun Returns and did not like it very much.  The story was nice (if a little farfetched) but the controls were abysmal.  Shadowrun Dragonfall - Directors Cut fixed any of the issues that I had with the previous game.Story - 10/10It was literally incredible.  It may be text heavy for some, but if you take the time to read all the interactions it is like reading a book.  Where as most text interactions just say what the characters are saying, this game includes facial gestures, descriptions of the surroundings including sights, smells and sounds.  I would have read a book or watched a movie with the same story and absolutely loved it.  A really fantastic selling point that many games don't have these days.Gameplay - 8/10 (28 hours to complete primary campaign)I am not usually a huge fan of turn based combat (RTS fan), but this system was very smooth and easy to get a handle on.  There were a few points left out of the tutorials (It took me about half the game to figure out that you could activate cyberwear) and the initial exploration of your home town was a little stunted by a lack of anything to guide you (It took me three missions to figure out that there was a cyberwear shop in your home town as it was tucked away in the corner).Graphics, Art and Atmosphere - 9/10Everything went to setting up an excellent atmosphere for the game.  The ambient sounds were fantastic throughout the final game (A little clunky in the finale) and the effort to create weather effects and ambient lighting really helped set the picture of the world.Final ThoughtsI waited for this game to go on sale before I bought it as I was a little apprihensive after Shadowrun Returns.  If I knew what I know now, I would have bought this game for full price on it's release date.  I also cannot wait to play through some fanmade adventures from the workshop.TL:DR - If you are a fan of turn based RPG's and don't mind reading text.  10/10 would recommend this game.			"

You have interesting companions, characters and cabals like in  Planescape:Torment, you have a generic RPG system with a bunch of skill checks like in Neverwinter Nights, you have party play like in Baldur's Gate, conspiracies like in Deus EX and the feel of the classic Shadowrun SNES RPG or a PNP Shadowrun campaign.The missions play mostly one after another but at times you can choose from several or skip some completely. The city hub with its inhabitants feels very alive and the death of a particular character I  always revisited for talk bothered me. Unlike most other games the nice answer isn't always the right one when talking to your friends just like in reality.The plot is above average and all of Shadowruns's interesting themes (read the ""threats"" sourcebooks) are brought together except vampires maybe.The game is set in shadow Germany which is known and yet alien and rarely used for games outside world wars so that was interesting as well.There's also plenty of stuff to read for lore freaks but lore haters can skip the flavor and just follow the mission goals.Experience is rewarded by finishing goals so there's no penalty for playing it your way. You can play a brutal and amoral killer or a kind charismatic guy.While the turnbased combat system is clearly like the one from the last game it seems much better now so I guess they made some improvements.I can recommend the game to true RPG fans especially those mentioned above and also Shadowrun/Cyberpunk fans.

												This breathtaking thing is rather old-school and classy. May cause loss of sleep, severe depersonalization and ""cant find my datajack"" syndrome. Goes best with drum'n'bass music and energy drinks (make sure to get lots of these before starting).This may be your only chance to get a life. Take it.			"

												This is by far the best Shadowrun game out there. The director's cut changes *really* help. It feels like a true sequel to SRR. If you haven't played a shadowrun game, It might be better to start here rather than with the original that has some nasty difficulty spikes, and a less interesting plot.This game is in my ""best games of 2014"" as well...

												Good game, while it says I've got a low amount of hours, I have about 20 hours on the original dragonfall. Considering that they've added more missions/more content, you'll get more than you pay for. Especially in a sale. Story is definitley great, gameplay is great as long as you don't play for 20 hours in a row like me. If you're the type of person to replay games, GET THIS, it's got good replay value since you can choose different sets of things for a character.			"

												I recommend this game as an expansion to the earlier Shadowrun game by the same company; it uses the same engine and has some expanded content for those who like to use the Workshop.  It also has a much thicker and more meaningful plotline than the prior Shadowrun game, especially within the bounds of character development for your team.   There's less to micromanage this time around; when giving a team member an item, it's explicit it is being ""loaned"".   You run with a team instead of just whoever you can afford, and you spend time doing actual runs instead of constantly following a linear sequence of events.   My one complaint is one mission: APEX Rising.   Without spoiling too much, you get your typical choice with an AI at one point; set it free or kill it dead.   This mission was really phoned in, not because of it's particular story, but because I think it was developed by the dev team's unpaid intern.   No matter which you choose, what happens next is the same: kill an endless wave of robots that all have a rediculous amount of health and junkies that all carry stun guns while defending a computer terminal.   There is a timer you have to wait out; this timer is only triggered by having your decker(s) hack two terminals.   There are also two turret terminals to give you some automated help, but only on one side at a time (both terminals cant' be active). What isn't obvious is your team of four has to defend the central computer from robots and junkies trying to kill it, but also defend the terminals (which are far from the central computer) from hackers that can pause the timer by getting a full turn near the terminal.   If this happens, you have to re-play the entire hack to get the terminal working again.  The end result is a mission where tactics mean nothing; you're entirely at the mercy of the Random Number Generator.  It all depends on whether or not all those taser shots connect, and which targets the turrets pick (they pick enemies at random).   Some of the junkies take a stim (also at random) which lets them move three times, enough to run past the turrets in one round and lock down the timer.  I'm not one to normally complain about difficulty.   I was already a gamer when the NES was new.   The problem here is that you cannot save during this mission once any enemies have spawned as a result of the hacking.  The save file corrupts when you try, and you have to force-quit Shadowrun and re-open it.  Forum searches tell me this is a common bug, in this mission only.   This game is the kind of game where it's reasonable to expect dinnertime or a phone call or something to interrupt a long battle; you can't do that here unless you leave the game running.  Other bugs (which force you to quit and reload from your last functional save) include parts of the Matrix disappearing and trapping characters in it, a sudden inability to issue commands, and stuttering when trying to hack a terminal.   Two hours of trying to get through that one section of that one mission and no luck.   I probably won't come back to this until it's been so long I start over.			"

												Dragonfall - Director's Cut continues the great line of the roleplaying game Shadowrun Returns: Deadman's Switch, and in some aspects adds to it - all of which are improvements in my opnion.First of all, what is Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut? Well, a roleplaying game in a dystopia future with magic, tech, drugs, politics, double-crossing and otther filth. It is not affraid to pick adult themes. Furthermore, if you look in all the nooks and crannies you can even find comments in the game that make you think about your actions; If you whipe-out that rascist organization, what about the kids that were there just to get of the street to be warm and have meal? Another example is your fellow shadowrunner who is a victim of prejudices and domestic violence. Rarely did I see this in RPGs and I played a good many. Now, not every NPC is like that and some are a bit one-dimensional, but such archtypes can be fun to have around. Like its predecessor, this RPG has turn-based combat (like e.g. X-COM or Space Marines) but with its own unique twists. In comparison to Deadman's Switch, cover has grown in importance. So, what else is new? Dragonfall places more emphasis on different stats and social etiquettes. Spells are explained more clearly and in the Matrix you can actually find statements about meatspace that you were involved in. Also some quests have taken a lighter tone with more humor, but that may or may not be to your taste.All in all, this game is interresting for any strategist, that has the balls to adress more adult themes, and that all in the unique and intriguing world of Shadowrun. I recommend this game (and its previously mentioned predecessor) for any RPG fan and for anyone that loves to read Dark Fantasy, Dystopian Futures, or Noir fiction.			"

												Excellent aesthetics blending the realms of cyberpunk and fantasy built around lack luster combat allow this game to be just shy of greatness. The setting, plot, and cast are all extremely engaging, however,  the wonky combat keep from achieving excellence. Very similar to, yet more forgiving than XCOM there are times when the battles are not as tense or immersive as they should be. Nevertheless, it is very easy to lose track of time exploring and defending Berlin 2054 from an unseen evil. As it stands Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut is a very good game worth your attention.			"

												So, I've never played the tabletop Shadowun, and bought this on a friend's advice. And it is AMAZING. A perfect blend of high-fantasy and cyberpunk settings, with a lot of variety in weapons, magic, and cybernetics to augment your character. The pacing in both campaigns is a bit odd at times (IMO), and there are some balance issues around some of the magic (adepts are a bit weak without someone to throw haste at them, healing spells are weird), but they're engrossing nonetheless, and the gameplay feels like a tabletop without being clunky.  Overall, it's my top find for 2014, and I HIGHLY encourage anyone reading this to pick it up. If you like turn-based RPGs at all, you'll LOVE Shadowrun. If you don't like the genre: well, there's no accounting for taste.			"

												Wow. First off, I just finished beating the game once and I am ready to play it again to try a different path and possible ending. If that's not an indicator of a good game, I don't know what is. I will echo many other reviews in that I 100% agree Dragonfall is much more advanced than the recent Shadowrun Returns. I have completed the SNES version when it came out (Yes, I am a grandpa gamer), and in many ways it's better than that and other ways it isn't. The SNES version's environment was very open, so much so that it was easy to get lost. But at least you could beef up Jake Armitage which was fun to hulk him up. Dragonfall isn't as open environment as the SNES version, but it is no where the linear game that was in Shadowrun Returns. Dragonfall is very much a 'Goldie Locks' between the two. In fact at different points in the game, you need to make choices that directly impacts the outcome of runs. So although the story progresses itself in a linear fashion, based upon what you decide and act completely effects the game. I do believe the game designers' intent of allowed the gamer to make these important decisions was with purpose. Allowing for decisions also invests the gamer in the story's plot. The main storyline is interesting as well as some of the optional side quests. As any good story or movie goes, there always is a twist that you don't foresee. I was close in my assumption. You can also become involved in your teammate NPC characters as well as powering them up. I would definitely recommend this game. It should not disappoint. I bought this for myself during the Christmas 2014 sale, and the cost was completely worth it. I don't believe you'll be disappointed with this version of the Shadowrun franchise.  "

Posted: December 4, 2014
												Short summarization? A masterpiece of RPG work, minorly suffering from the one or other bug.Took me 24 hours to beat the game. (Once, on hard difficultY.) That alone is already a big plus, given the price of the game. AND opposed to many other campaign-driven games I actually think I'll give this game a rerun.To the details.The game is set in the Shadowrun world, which originally stems from a Pen&Paper RPG, set in a sortof-apocalyptic future (in this case 2052), where magic works again, trolls and orcs walk the earth like any human, megacoperations control most of the world... and dragons control the megacorporations from the shadows. Said shadows are your realm as well, assome sort of crinimal spec ops, a Shadowrunner.The game starts by letting you create a unique character with full flexibility as to what you want to do. Troll engineer? Elf brute? Sure, go ahead. Note that your PC (Playercharacter) is the ONLY character in this game you can fully customize. All other members of your team come with preset skills, equipment and a small upgrade tree (and the possibility to give them some of your quipment on a 'loaned' basis). So,no BG-style minmaxing of a 6-man supertroop.The gameplay consists of realtime-exploration, coupled with a lot of text, choices and some riddles. The other part (and something that will never be avoidable fully) is combat. Combat plays interesting, from start to finish, mainly due to you and your team unlocking new abilities and equipment. As well, it needs to be said that there are a lot of mechanics to grasp that are barely explained in the brief help section... Don't be surprised if you don't understand what's happening around you for the first half of the game. On top of that, the controls are a bit flunky at times (f.e. you cannot turn the isometric view and due to that will never be able to select a tile right 'behind' a standing character). Overall, satisfying enough though.(Especially if you can play as a cyber-augmented Chi-casting samurai warrior dwarf)To avoid spoilers, I'll not go into detail regarding the story. But let's express my oppinion this way: From start to finish I always felt motivated and intrigued by story. Driven to find out the backgrounds, and what could happen next. The morale choices the game presents you (and boy, it does that alot) as well never felt to simple. And when you come to the big turning points in the story (that have major influence on the gameplay), you really sit down, lean back and think for a minute or two before pressing a button.I feel obliged to mention the presence of a few bugs, too: I had to do the final fight twice, simply because one enemy got stuck in an inaccessible room. I as well had the one or other occasion where an enemy AI got stuck during it's turn, causing an endless loop of waiting. And there are a few reports of crashes, albeit I had none of those myself.Overall, these issues usually are annoying, but are reasonably rare enough (having to reload 3 times across a 24 hour timeframe... annoying, but I've seen FAAAAR worse).All in all, my verdict is: BUY NOWThe story is genuinly great. The background is great (duh, it's a Pen&Paper RPG, what did you expect). The gameplay is solid and diverse enough. Graphics are fine for their purpouse, the sound is acceptable (albeit hit sound grunts get really repetitive), the music just awesome and fitting. The game is stable, except for a few rare issues.Rating: 9/10 (just slightly missed the perfection, due to control hickups, lack of tutorials and the few issues mentioned)If you see this on a sale, BUY.If it's not on a sale, but you're a fan of Shadowrun... who am I kidding, any fan of Shadowrun already has this game. But if you're into (P&P) RPG anyways, get this.If you like Tactical Combat games, you might want to buy this, too. Albeit the focus clearly lays on the Story, not the Combat System alone.			"

												First Shadowrun game I've ever played.Cons : - Some minor bugs can sometimes appear. Saving often and during battles is advised.- Early game may be though for some people, especially if you're not used to the mechanics, don't know how the system works and make some mistakes.- I suspect the classes to be a bit unbalanced.- Character models in this engine usually don't look very good. (with the exception of the dancers <3 )Pros : - Bugs being patched as I write this- Great story with really charming characters and dialogue.- Average/Good personal character customization that really impacts the amount of choices you can make.- Good/Great character portraits and environments that fit the situation.- Gameplay : Turn-based RPG's rule ! For the vets, Hard difficulty is perfect in my opinion.Conclusion : Coming from some of the best turn-based rpg's ever like FF Tactics, Tactics Ogre (PSP), Advance Wars, Fire Emblem, and most importantly XCOM : Enemy Unknown, my hunger for that genre finally came to an end when I finished this game. And it was one fine meal.			"

												Excellent aesthetics blending the realms of cyberpunk and fantasy built around lack luster combat allow this game to be just shy of greatness. The setting, plot, and cast are all extremely engaging, however,  the wonky combat keep from achieving excellence. Very similar to, yet more forgiving than XCOM there are times when the battles are not as tense or immersive as they should be. Nevertheless, it is very easy to lose track of time exploring and defending Berlin 2054 from an unseen evil. As it stands Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut is a very good game worth your attention.			"

Shamans now could meaningfully take part in combat in the early game without having to invest in another skill.   Saving isn't a giant pain anymore.It's a solid tactical RPG with an engrossing storyline, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes either.There were a few glitches but they didn't interfere with the enjoyment and the devs seem interested in still fixing things even this long after the game's release.

												What an amazing game this is turning out to be! I've been playing this kind of ""Steam-Punk"" rpg's for many years now, ever since i first played Fallout Tactics way back in the days.. I also remember playing the first UFO, up till the more recently yet wonderful UFO: Enemy Unknown series. (I also gave Wasteland 2 a very decent try, but sadly that game was and still is plagued by tons of bugs that made the game much less memorable imo..)I must say that i never played previous Shadowrun rpg's, so i'm overjoyed with myself having picked up this marvelous gem of a game, for a very decent price if i may say so myself.. Note that the game has a learning curve, and that your actions often decide what the possible outcome might be, so decide patiently and wisely! This game isn't for true rushers imo, because if you'd think that you're Rambo you're pretty much left in your undies rather quickly if you're not careful enough.. But once you're getting used to the system and you're starting to make progress, the game speads up too and more quests become available to your team as well.. So take your time slowly and patiently at first, and you'll do all the better afterwards! The auto-save system can be frustrating at times when you have realized that you've made a critical mistake. So my advice here will be to save your game often instead of having to backtrack over many 'lost' hours ect. It will happen many times over if you don't, that's guaranteed for sure!To conclude:I would like to add my personal score 8'5/10			"

												Wow. First off, I just finished beating the game once and I am ready to play it again to try a different path and possible ending. If that's not an indicator of a good game, I don't know what is. I will echo many other reviews in that I 100% agree Dragonfall is much more advanced than the recent Shadowrun Returns. I have completed the SNES version when it came out (Yes, I am a grandpa gamer), and in many ways it's better than that and other ways it isn't. The SNES version's environment was very open, so much so that it was easy to get lost. But at least you could beef up Jake Armitage which was fun to hulk him up. Dragonfall isn't as open environment as the SNES version, but it is no where the linear game that was in Shadowrun Returns. Dragonfall is very much a 'Goldie Locks' between the two. In fact at different points in the game, you need to make choices that directly impacts the outcome of runs. So although the story progresses itself in a linear fashion, based upon what you decide and act completely effects the game. I do believe the game designers' intent of allowed the gamer to make these important decisions was with purpose. Allowing for decisions also invests the gamer in the story's plot. The main storyline is interesting as well as some of the optional side quests. As any good story or movie goes, there always is a twist that you don't foresee. I was close in my assumption. You can also become involved in your teammate NPC characters as well as powering them up. I would definitely recommend this game. It should not disappoint. I bought this for myself during the Christmas 2014 sale, and the cost was completely worth it. I don't believe you'll be disappointed with this version of the Shadowrun franchise.  "

												If this game had xcoms interface and speed it would probobly be in my top 5 games.As it is everything about this game feels... well, clunky. The combat is on the slow side with plenty of glitches, the cover and flanking system simply does not work sometimes, and for some reason the game lags (no matter what my system settings are) whenever I move outside of combat. Oh and another thing that this game should copy from xcom is the ability to ROTATE THE ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ CAMERA. Hope you like the perspective you have at the start because its all you ever get.Now obviously this game can compensate for that or else I wouldn't be recommending it and it does this by having diverse and interesting characters, a flushed out game world with side plots and new people to interact with popping up after almost every mission, and a very appealing art style. Im a huge fan of story based games that allow for multiple personalities and SDDC has handled this very well so far.  I snuck up on a pay slave mid mission and had the option to either break his neak or tap his shoulder. After debating the merrits of both for about 30 seconds I tapped his shoulder, had a quick conversation with him then sent him home back to his family and gained karma  I love the way the karma system works because you recieve enticing rewards for whatever choice you make and dont feel like you need to reload a save just to see if your other choices would have led to better rewards. I might rewrite this review after I beat the game but so far I can say that its a good game in my books so buy it, load it up, and have fun blowing a power armored thugs brain out with a troll armed with a sniper rifle.

												I fell in love with this game within 3 minutes of playing. That's a tribute to the talented wordsmith ( writer ) and the artists that designed the portraits. I ended up developing a crush on two characters.I would have liked a proper introduction, since I found the lore quite jarring ( cyberpunk meets fantasy ) and it got more surreal, as the plot evolved. It would have helped me to make different endgame choices ( I feel like I failed at the end ). I've never played the pen and paper game or the first Shadowrun game: ""Dead Man's Switch"".http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun#Fictional_universeThe classes have everything from the traditional, offensive, elemental mage and healer to the more exotic: William Gibson style hacker, who runs through ""The Matrix"" like Neo; Rigger who fixes drones and uses them as pets in combat; Samurai sword wielders that go around slicing people's heads off; Empty-handed melee combatants, that channel Chi energy.The game has a couple of references to movies like, ""The Terminator"" and ""The Sound of Music"", so it would help to have watched those.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059742/""Du Heist"" is my favourite piece of music in the game. The scene is a late night bank heist / data transfer, while rifling through papers, searching for clues and missing links:https://soundcloud.com/everistsound/shadowrun-dragonfall-directors-cut-ost-du-heist-blitzs-missionIt took me 66 hours to finish the game on ""hard"". I loved the tactical combat and plan on re-playing the game another 4 times, to experience other classes.I give this game 9/10, deducting a point for the lack of ability to rotate the map in combat, the lack of a dedicated ""move"" button and the cumbersome inventory that obviously needs redesigning.In 30 years of gaming, this might be # 5 on my list of ""Best Games of All Time""...

												I really enjoyed the 1st half of this game. There are a lot of bugs bu t most are minor. There are, however, some rather large bugs that can break the game. Mid-to-late game I encountered a bug that caused the characters to randomely freeze up requiring you to reload the game. This was only a minor inconvenience in the earlier part of the game. as the game progressed the loading times increased. As of now, I am stuck in a fight due to the game not loading the saves correctly. This coupled with the characters freezing every other turn really breaks it.Again, the first half was fun, but it isn't really worth it if you can't finish the story.Hopefully more of you will not run into the same problems that I have had.

												This is a high quality product. If you love cyberpunk, you will love ""Shadowrun: Dragonfall"".If you love RPG, you will love ""Shadowrun: Dragonfall"".The quality of storytelling in this title is outstanding. ""Shadowrun: Dragonfall"" touches on multiple classic topics of the cyberpunk genre and adds some metaphysical ones for good measure. Getting to know the characters in this story is a pleasure, as they have morality that is not black-or-white and just as humans are, these people have their flaws and virtues, they need help and somehow the story is done in such a way that they induce genuine compassion. Tactical aspect is done well. Definitely an enjoyable experience. Variety of available playstyles is satisfactory. The only grudge I have against Shadowrun: Dragonfall is that it ends at some point and I'm afraid that replayability value isn't very high once you know the story. Regardless, it's definitely worth the price for the 50hours of fun I had out of it.			"

												This game is a testament to the tactical strategy genre.  It definitely has its own feel.  To compare this game to any other tactical strategy out there (even X-Com) would be obsurd.  The only similarity this game has with any of the other ones is the fact that it's a tactical strategy game.This game is rich.  It's deep.  There are 3 main archetypes of missions.  You have your sidequests, your plotline sidequests, and then your main mission.  The richness of this game brings all of these quests to life.  There is a story behind each of them, and you become a part of that story.  There are even ways to finish a couple of certain quests without having to fire a shot.  There are some very creative questlines presented in this game.There are a few negatives however.  Armour, weapons, upgrades, and even magic.  It all feels like you don't get much for your money from one set to the next.  They all feel very similar in feel.  It's also possible to jump from the lowest end hardware to the highest end, skipping the mid-grade stuff entirely.  The lack of randomly generated sidequests is nearly unforgiveable in a title such as this.  The game is surprisingly short.  The only real difference you will feel between the weapons and other items is your ability to hit and ability to soak up damage.  This also applies to spells, however spells are unique in that each one is different and each one offers a tactical variation on your play style.  The big problem with spells however is that you can only equip a handful of them, and so that one situation that crops up that you could use a spell that you rarely use, and the opportunity to be wowed by its effects is missed, for the simple reason that you opted for something else in its place.The other gripe here is that you cannot manage the inventory of your team.  They all come pre set with their own skills and abilities, weapons and armour.  You can only add in a couple of utility items like grenades and health packs.  So it is a little frustrating that you can't have better control over your companions.The reason for the shortcomings listed here though is because of the story.  The dev's obviously felt it was important to immerse the player into a deep, rich and invovling story.  The game offers countless hours of replayability as you will want to work on each skill tree at one point or another.  I haven't even touched decking, drone control, melee combat or psy powers.  The game is short, and narrow, and will leave you wanting more, better equipment progression and a wider variation of equipment and spells, however the gameplay itself speaks volumes for this title, coupled with an extremely solid storyline.I can't recommend this game enough.  If you are on the fence about it and you are reading some negative reviews that are preventing you from clicking the buy button, I would say this:  At the end of the day you will enjoy this game.  Despite its shorcomings, those shortcomings are more than made up for with a solid gaming experience.  And that's why we play games isn't it?  To enjoy the experience?  This game is a smooth platform, relatively bug free, rich, immersive, and has high replayability.  What more could you want from a title so cheap.It all comes down to that.  Just buy it already... :)			"

												I don't know exactly why this game is so fun, but it is.  It's fairly text-heavy, the graphics are pretty basic, some of the areas start to look the same, the world has limited interactivity beyond objects immediately relevant to the plot, there are a number of little glitches--and yet, in spite of these drawbacks I've logged about 100 hours in cyberpunk dystopian Berlin.The variety of character classes is one of the biggest draws for me, plus the fact that you can actually play a couple of truly viable hybrid classes. I played a Shaman on my first playthrough (steep learning curve, there) and a Decker/Rigger on my second.  The different skill trees and 'etiquette' functions are incorporated nicely into the dialogue and story options, so that based on your character's configuration, you will have to come up with different problem-solving techniques for various hurdles.Monika is written as a bit of a MarySue, but the other party members have wit and interesting back stories.  Several of them experience dynamic shifts in their relationship with you as the game progresses, which is cool.  It also seems like there are several different endings, based on a series of decisions you make in the last two missions, which gives the game a better replay value, imo.Buy it, okay, just buy it so that you can steal stuff from racists and insult Satan to his face.  Plus: cool hair-do.  Win/win.			"

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a fantastic old-school game that scratches the old Baldur's Gate itch.  The writing is superb, the characters are memorable and the combat is solid.This game has A LOT of dialog in it and no voice acting, so know that going in.  I found the game to be a bit too verbose at times.  You spend 50% of the game reading from a tiny panel on the right side of your screen which got tiresome on my wide monitor.The combat is a bit clunky, but quite fun.  For most of the game your characters don't have enough AP to move and use their good abilities so you end up moving your guys into position and hoping enemies don't move the next turn. Near the end of the game, you'll have more AP to use and this makes combat MUCH more enjoyable.One of the coolest things about this game are the RPG mechanics.  You can often find alternative methods of solving a problem or gaining access to an area.  Taking the time to explore is always rewarded with goodies.I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys old-school RPGs like Baldur's Gate.  If you don't mind reading a lot of dialog, there's a great experience to be had.			"

												Story?  Great.  NPCs?  Deep, interesting.Character Creation?  Varied, tons of options.Combat?  Fun, strategic, dynamic.Graphics?  Good, but who cares.Replayability?  Eh...it depends how much you like the combat/character creation.Mods?  Some really great ones (thank goodness).My only real complaint about Dragonfall is that, despite wanting to try new character types, I have zero motivation to play through the story again.  This is due, in part, to a lack of skill checks.  Besides the Decker class, there are very few opportunities to use a characters inherent skills (their stats/class/etiquettes) to effect the experience or the outcome of a mission.  So ultimately, each playthrough will be very similar to one another with a few minor deviations here and there.Luckily, the core game is so solid that even if you don't play around with mods after beating the game (which you should), you'll still have gotten your money's worth after a single playthrough.

												This game is amazing.  I had never heard of the Shadowrun games until I ran across this one, now I can't stop playing it!!  It has all the right stuff for being a cyberpunk, rpg, top-down-strategy game.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys cyberpunk or top-down games.  There is a sequel to this one already on its way out and it looks very promising, so I recommend you pick this game up before then.  Trust me you won't be disappointed!			"

												Far superior than ""Shadowrun Returns"" graphically and storywise.Gameplay is smooth, hardly any bugs and very easy on your video card.Has a very good Character class and developement choices which include cyberware and spells.Still lacking any voice over narration, so lots of reading.

												If you liked Shadowrun Returns, you will love this.It's an improvement over the first in almost every way possible, which also makes it a great game to buy as a newcomer to Shadowrun. Pros;The story, which is excellent, is intertwined with small scale personal stories that you can try to finish if you so desire.The characters are interesting and all have distinct playing styles, which you can either bolster or compliment with your level up choices. The gameplay and UI are improved from the first; it's a bit more intuitive than its predecessor but things like equiping items from the stash and using medkits out of combat have a very clunky workflow.Cons;Levelling up could be vastly improved by adding more depth (not to the Underrail / Fallout degree) and allowing more flexibility. E.G., if you're interested in becoming a professional smoothtalker, but are not interested in casting spells and the like, a lot of the benefit of having a high charisma is wasted.The dialogue options are somewhat limited throughout, I often felt as if my roleplaying response was not catered for with the options available.Overall; Recommended.A really lovely game, with a great atmosphere, interesting soundtrack (though not as good as the first) and compelling characters - you can really sink hours into this and feel satisfied with the result.

												Improves upon Shadowrun Return's main game, which was hard to do. Equally as tight in terms of a fast pased, character focused story that doesn't waste your time on unnecessary, boring, or churny bits. Fun setting. A few player choices that add some interest. Character customization is improved and is a lot of fun. The overarcing story of these games is a little nonsensical and vague, but the focus is rightfully on the characters and shines accordingly.Combat is tricky, but properly difficult so as to be challenging but not frustrating.I absolutely detest the concept of paying companies for a game before they have a product to sell, but I signed up to Kickstarter to fund the next game in the series (Hong Kong) because this was just so good.

												I don't know exactly why this game is so fun, but it is.  It's fairly text-heavy, the graphics are pretty basic, some of the areas start to look the same, the world has limited interactivity beyond objects immediately relevant to the plot, there are a number of little glitches--and yet, in spite of these drawbacks I've logged about 100 hours in cyberpunk dystopian Berlin.The variety of character classes is one of the biggest draws for me, plus the fact that you can actually play a couple of truly viable hybrid classes. I played a Shaman on my first playthrough (steep learning curve, there) and a Decker/Rigger on my second.  The different skill trees and 'etiquette' functions are incorporated nicely into the dialogue and story options, so that based on your character's configuration, you will have to come up with different problem-solving techniques for various hurdles.Monika is written as a bit of a MarySue, but the other party members have wit and interesting back stories.  Several of them experience dynamic shifts in their relationship with you as the game progresses, which is cool.  It also seems like there are several different endings, based on a series of decisions you make in the last two missions, which gives the game a better replay value, imo.Buy it, okay, just buy it so that you can steal stuff from racists and insult Satan to his face.  Plus: cool hair-do.  Win/win.			"

Posted: June 9, 2015
												The year is 2053, shortly after the completion of Shadowrun Returns.  Our story takes place in Berlin with a new protagonist and a new crew already on a job.  I don’t want to reveal much if anything of the story since that is what really draws players to these games, so I will keep story details to myself and only talk briefly about the npc characters and some of the new mechanics that were introduced in this game.  The Team-So first off, the four person team is once again the standard size team and the merc hiring system has made a lackluster return.  I say this simply because it robs you of story!  The team you originally run with are your constant companions and offer much more to develop the story with their own unique dialogs during missions, which I highly doubt you get by hiring Elf-ears McMagicshoot for a single run.  They still take a cut of the profit after running the main story missions, but you also do not have to pay them up front like other mercs.  Among your rogues gallery of runners, you have Eigar, a Militaristic Troll who is a weapons specialist, Glory, a heavily cyber enhanced field medic (no magic, but always has health kits) and Dietrich the former punk anarchist turned overly risk taking shaman.  There is also a decker you can acquire fairly early in the game, he uses smgs and if the story is played right he has limited rigger abilities.  I do think there is an option to turn him away if you so wish (I don’t recommend that if you aren’t a decker).  Now, one of the greatest things about using these main story npcs is that they implemented a talent tree for each of them.  There are 5 tiers for each character and it seems you get a point after each big milestone in the story.  A cautionary note – once the points are confirmed there are no refunds.  Also each character has two trees, but you are free to mix and match as you see fit but only one point per tier.Eigar - become a sniper or shotgun specialist.  Since Eigar is a troll, she is naturally pretty tanky, so getting up in their face is a fun option.  She is far from invincible but one of the options in her tree is to get wired reflexes cyberware that let her dodge the first attack against her per turn for 3 turns with a 4 turn cooldown, this is simply amazing for her.  On the other hand, specializing in Sniper will give you things like armor piercing shots and a double tap.  I recommend a mix between the two, making Eigar very diverse for lots of situations.Glory - buffs to medic capabilities or pistoleer.  Glory has high armor since she is so cyberized and does have a melee mode similar to a street samurai, so choosing a path with her seems like either way would be pretty good.  The pistol she carries takes 0AP to reload, and seems to be very often inaccurate (make sure your shaman is throwing that +15% accuracy buff out from time to time) even from mid distances but and this is a big but, if you do decide to be a pistol specialist, it does do some pretty decent damage late game with the final tier talent.Dietrich - better buff shaman or mix in some offensive magics.  I loved Dietrich as a character but his trees left me wanting.  Any way you build him, it won’t have that large of an impact on his gameplay.Mystery Decker - better decking or focus on smgs.  Not much to say about this character except that he only gets three tiers since you get him slightly later in the game.  If you are a decker, you most likely won’t use him over the other team member choices, but if you aren’t you will probably max out his decking talents just to take advantage of environment variables and normal mission decking activities.Your Character-Just like the previous game I went with a decker/rifle specialist which made the game an enjoyable play through with the occasional speedbump in the road.  I only had a handful of times when my main character actually died, but I think that’s mostly because I neglected raising my body stat enough early on (I think I ended with body 5 or 6).  Rifles still seem very op simply due to full auto, but it felt like I was reloading more in this game than in Shadowrun Returns.  In addition to the normal assault rifles they have introduced snipers, which are a great option to keep on you as well, so raise that ranged combat stat and get that extra weapon slot to carry both!  If a sniper catches someone out of cover and it’s a crit, it can easily be a one shot kill or chunk them severely.Decking, just like the last game is a very common thing pretty much everywhere.  I don’t recommend going straight decking right off the bat, so make sure you get more combat stats than decking points initially to have a smooth early game.I chose Elf as my race for the max cap on Quickness, but it also came with a default point in charisma, just like in the last game etiquette options are everywhere.  In Returns I believe Shadowrunner turned up the most, but this time I think Security was the most common option.  Often times this will simply turn the conversation in your favor but it wasn’t uncommon to just do nothing for you at all.  Hooray RPGS!Outside of my own character, here are some other things I noticed.  This game seems friendlier towards melee this time around in general (better cyberware and cover options).  In the cyberware shop you can buy wired reflexes pretty early on to supplement your dodge.   If melee isn’t your cup of tea, they introduced a few new variants on the previous games grenades as well as a grenade launcher to play around with.  Magic still seems pretty weak, but there seems to be more of a variety of spells this time around.Bugs-I encountered only a few bugs, and only one really broke the game.   Remember folks, save often!The one that broke it was a scripted encounter that started by some npcs running up to you in a room and then they just stood there looking at me like I was stupid.  Reloaded my last auto-save, tried again and it worked!  There was an issue with the cyberware shop, where I had 1 essence left but I couldn’t equip anymore gear.  Sadly I couldn’t find a workaround for this.Lastly, but definitely the most annoying there is a combat/movement lag that mostly happens in the matrix (I only had it happen once outside of the matrix).  Sometimes when you end your turn the game will just sit there and think, for 30seconds at a time, trying to figure out what happens next.  This is annoying but not game breaking. Conclusion-I thoroughly enjoyed Dragonfall for its excellent story that kept me constantly engaged, powering through and exploring every nook and cranny that was accessible to me.  The improvements on the previous game weren’t anything fantastic and hell I would even call it negligible at best but this seemed like repeat/sequel of an already great game in my book.  I’m good with that.Completionist game length – 30ish Hours (32 for me and there is a second run most definitely in the future for unexplored options)Rating: 8 / 10 "

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a fantastic old-school game that scratches the old Baldur's Gate itch.  The writing is superb, the characters are memorable and the combat is solid.This game has A LOT of dialog in it and no voice acting, so know that going in.  I found the game to be a bit too verbose at times.  You spend 50% of the game reading from a tiny panel on the right side of your screen which got tiresome on my wide monitor.The combat is a bit clunky, but quite fun.  For most of the game your characters don't have enough AP to move and use their good abilities so you end up moving your guys into position and hoping enemies don't move the next turn. Near the end of the game, you'll have more AP to use and this makes combat MUCH more enjoyable.One of the coolest things about this game are the RPG mechanics.  You can often find alternative methods of solving a problem or gaining access to an area.  Taking the time to explore is always rewarded with goodies.I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys old-school RPGs like Baldur's Gate.  If you don't mind reading a lot of dialog, there's a great experience to be had.			"

												This game executes turn based tactical combat well, but I'd say the storytelling is its greatest asset.The combat is pretty standard for what you would expect of a tactical game.  You have a team, and each member can take a couple actions a turn.  Characters have special abilities and different attack types.  There is a fair amount of variety.  Some characters excel at firearms, others at melee combat.  Mages can cast both damaging and buffing spells.  Summoners can call spirits, and riggers can control drones (the two ""pet"" classes).  Hackers have their own VR combat where they fight IC in a system very similar to meat combat.  The hacker's efforts in VR can grant access to other areas on the map, provide camera feeds, gain information that can be sold for money and other things.  In addition to character design, there are choices to make in combat such as where to take cover, how to flank enemies, etc.  It's a good system.As I said above, however, the story is what has really sold me on the game.  Between missions, interactions with NPCs shed light on the developing narrative, and the story kept me engaged.  What's more, each of your team members has their own story to tell.  The stories add a great depth to the characters.  These are not just spell/gun machines that follow you around in combat.  They are living, breathing people struggling with their own motivations.  It's very interesting learning what they are.  I'm perhaps halfway through the game, and I already have a strong emotional connection to the characters who's stories I've played through.I recommend this game.  For those familiar with the original Shadowrun Returns, this is a definite improvement, both in game play and in storytelling.  It is a solid representation of the tactical combat genre, the RPG genre, and the Shadowrun setting.			"

												I really enjoyed the 1st half of this game. There are a lot of bugs bu t most are minor. There are, however, some rather large bugs that can break the game. Mid-to-late game I encountered a bug that caused the characters to randomely freeze up requiring you to reload the game. This was only a minor inconvenience in the earlier part of the game. as the game progressed the loading times increased. As of now, I am stuck in a fight due to the game not loading the saves correctly. This coupled with the characters freezing every other turn really breaks it.Again, the first half was fun, but it isn't really worth it if you can't finish the story.Hopefully more of you will not run into the same problems that I have had.

												This game is a testament to the tactical strategy genre.  It definitely has its own feel.  To compare this game to any other tactical strategy out there (even X-Com) would be obsurd.  The only similarity this game has with any of the other ones is the fact that it's a tactical strategy game.This game is rich.  It's deep.  There are 3 main archetypes of missions.  You have your sidequests, your plotline sidequests, and then your main mission.  The richness of this game brings all of these quests to life.  There is a story behind each of them, and you become a part of that story.  There are even ways to finish a couple of certain quests without having to fire a shot.  There are some very creative questlines presented in this game.There are a few negatives however.  Armour, weapons, upgrades, and even magic.  It all feels like you don't get much for your money from one set to the next.  They all feel very similar in feel.  It's also possible to jump from the lowest end hardware to the highest end, skipping the mid-grade stuff entirely.  The lack of randomly generated sidequests is nearly unforgiveable in a title such as this.  The game is surprisingly short.  The only real difference you will feel between the weapons and other items is your ability to hit and ability to soak up damage.  This also applies to spells, however spells are unique in that each one is different and each one offers a tactical variation on your play style.  The big problem with spells however is that you can only equip a handful of them, and so that one situation that crops up that you could use a spell that you rarely use, and the opportunity to be wowed by its effects is missed, for the simple reason that you opted for something else in its place.The other gripe here is that you cannot manage the inventory of your team.  They all come pre set with their own skills and abilities, weapons and armour.  You can only add in a couple of utility items like grenades and health packs.  So it is a little frustrating that you can't have better control over your companions.The reason for the shortcomings listed here though is because of the story.  The dev's obviously felt it was important to immerse the player into a deep, rich and invovling story.  The game offers countless hours of replayability as you will want to work on each skill tree at one point or another.  I haven't even touched decking, drone control, melee combat or psy powers.  The game is short, and narrow, and will leave you wanting more, better equipment progression and a wider variation of equipment and spells, however the gameplay itself speaks volumes for this title, coupled with an extremely solid storyline.I can't recommend this game enough.  If you are on the fence about it and you are reading some negative reviews that are preventing you from clicking the buy button, I would say this:  At the end of the day you will enjoy this game.  Despite its shorcomings, those shortcomings are more than made up for with a solid gaming experience.  And that's why we play games isn't it?  To enjoy the experience?  This game is a smooth platform, relatively bug free, rich, immersive, and has high replayability.  What more could you want from a title so cheap.It all comes down to that.  Just buy it already... :)			"

												Shadowrun is a solid RPG that is good throughout, with rare moments of greatness. I played through the game on ""hard"" and think that is what most players will want to set it through. The combat system is a turned based strategy deal, but the tactical aspect isn't anything that is going to give anyone a headache. Keep your guys spaced out to avoid eating grenades, buff your main attackers with the aim bonus and haste and then shoot/punch everyone. The cover based/RNG system for hitting is rather bogus... you can have someone with a shotgun miss four times in a row from two meters away because the guy is kneeling behind a potted plant for instance. But as you go along, you'll figure out who to buff and blaze through most fights without much trouble.The story meanwhile is good and interesting. The world of Shadowrun is a weird sort of 'Okay let's do everything then' kind of world, with magic, hackers and sorcery. But the story is consistent and rich enough for you to sort of get immersed in the world. It has some issues though...First: The game tries to get you to make moral choices, usually involving how merciless you want to be. There are some interesting choices in here, particularly when the game pits your professionalism as a Shadow Runner against your morality (kill this guy in cold blood or botch the job, deliver the cyborg guy with no free will or free him). But that sort of thing leads to a bit of ludonarrative dissonance when on any given job you kill about 100 ordinary security guard dudes. Why's it only a dramatic moral choice when the dialogue box opens? Why doesn't my character ever agonize over whether or not killing Bob the Security Dude is the right thing to do? I feel that if a game wants to make keeping blood off your hands a major thing, then it should be a part of regular gameplay (a la Deus Ex), rather than just making it so that you are only concerned with NPCs with a name.Second: The game maybe presumes that you know more about this universe than someone who is first encountering it now would. There are a bunch of big choices involving dragons in this thing, but I never really had any idea what would be a good choice because my character had never met a Shadowrun dragon and was basically guessing what might be the best thing to do. Perhaps that is 'realistic', but I feel that the game needed to spend more time showing and not telling.Third: I hate that there's a four person cap on missions. When you're on a final mission where your team is making a last ditch heroic effort, it makes no sense that the fifth person is chilling in the van. These quibbles aside, it's a solid game with some truly excellent stories. Glory's side mission in particular was quite fascinating I have to say. I'll look forward to playing sequels.			"

												Albolutely a great game!The story is very well made and addictive and has some good length.Once you finished the story, the game isn't over because you gona download great stories via workshop and continue playing.(Currently I am playing the 'Shadowrun Unlimited' extension, which is great because it brings the game to a point which is amazing, i strongly advice developers to build onto such an open world which contains lots of different stories, which the player can choose from.)

												A great RPG, with a number of improvements over Shadowrun: Returns. The story is much deeper and more interesting, the characters each have their own personal quests (if you want to undertake them), and the gameplay is stronger.			"

												Look my hours played, now add about 30 hours for the original DMS campaign and another 30 for the original version of Dragonfall.This is the best game I've ever played. Fantastic writing, gripping, believable characters, tactical gameplay--all of it is just excellent. I honestly don't know what else to say because Dragonfall's amazingness should go without saying. Just play it.			"

												I'll start with the good of this game, which was very good: The Story. It's  Amazing. Playing through this game was a lot like a good book (slow, but really excellent characters with a well-developed story within a well developed world), except you can make interesting decisions throughout the book that can change the course of events in the world (how much it actually affects the story of the characters I don't know from firsthand experience, as I've only played through once).However, I unfortunately got bored with the gameplay fairly quickly. I found the battles to be slow, with frustratingly low hit%'s that didn't improve that much over the course of the game. I was pretty bored with the combat by about halfway through the game, but was so hooked on the story that I just kept playing. I found this surprising, since I'm a longtime fan of turn-based strategy games (I loved the old final fantasy tactics games, fire emblem, old and new X-Com, advance wars, you name it..) Of note, the very last chapter was significantly better about pacing combat than I felt the previous ~40% of the game had been. I thought the graphics looked good and helped get me immersed in the really cool world of cyberpunk meets elder scrolls anarcho-berlin. I'd recommend this game, but only if you're up for something slow paced and thoughtful.			"

												Story?  Great.  NPCs?  Deep, interesting.Character Creation?  Varied, tons of options.Combat?  Fun, strategic, dynamic.Graphics?  Good, but who cares.Replayability?  Eh...it depends how much you like the combat/character creation.Mods?  Some really great ones (thank goodness).My only real complaint about Dragonfall is that, despite wanting to try new character types, I have zero motivation to play through the story again.  This is due, in part, to a lack of skill checks.  Besides the Decker class, there are very few opportunities to use a characters inherent skills (their stats/class/etiquettes) to effect the experience or the outcome of a mission.  So ultimately, each playthrough will be very similar to one another with a few minor deviations here and there.Luckily, the core game is so solid that even if you don't play around with mods after beating the game (which you should), you'll still have gotten your money's worth after a single playthrough.

												I don't know exactly why this game is so fun, but it is.  It's fairly text-heavy, the graphics are pretty basic, some of the areas start to look the same, the world has limited interactivity beyond objects immediately relevant to the plot, there are a number of little glitches--and yet, in spite of these drawbacks I've logged about 100 hours in cyberpunk dystopian Berlin.The variety of character classes is one of the biggest draws for me, plus the fact that you can actually play a couple of truly viable hybrid classes. I played a Shaman on my first playthrough (steep learning curve, there) and a Decker/Rigger on my second.  The different skill trees and 'etiquette' functions are incorporated nicely into the dialogue and story options, so that based on your character's configuration, you will have to come up with different problem-solving techniques for various hurdles.Monika is written as a bit of a MarySue, but the other party members have wit and interesting back stories.  Several of them experience dynamic shifts in their relationship with you as the game progresses, which is cool.  It also seems like there are several different endings, based on a series of decisions you make in the last two missions, which gives the game a better replay value, imo.Buy it, okay, just buy it so that you can steal stuff from racists and insult Satan to his face.  Plus: cool hair-do.  Win/win.			"

It's a bit awkward panning around the screen to move your characters.  I didn't think the story was anything compelling, unfortunately I read too many good reviews about it and had to try it, but once again like the first one it didn't really engage me as a player.  It's one of those you play and forget about the next day, at least for me.  Don't think I will be trying the third one.			"

												While the original reboot (Shadowrun Returns) can be tauted as a revival or ""return"" to the vibrant cyberpunk world know as Shadowrun, this game fails to improve on the former's shortcomings and feels like a long DLC campaign rather than a proper sequel or improvement.I have the same issues with this game as I had with Shadowrun Returns. It has Pros:+ Very engaging setting for cyberpunk fans; not many games address this fantasy/sci-fi setting.+ Crisp isometric visual presentation and art direction.+ Well integrated gameplay between roaming and combat.Cons:- Utter lack of depth in gameplay mechanics; tries to be XCOM but succeeds only superficially.- Decking/hacking mechanics are also incredibly shallow.- Completely linear storytelling; decisions do no tmatter and side quests are uninspiring and feel completely unnessesary.- Poor character development; players should feel invested in their characters.Overall, I would not reccomend this game to anyone other than die-hard fans of the franchise or of the cyberpunk setting. It's not very expensive to buy however, so the value is not nearly as bad a disappointment as the content.			"

												What to say, What to say?First of all, this game is a Standalone version of the Shadowrun Returns expansion ""Dragonfall"" and I would greatly, GREATLY encourage everyone to get this instead of the DLC. Okay, you can get both if you want to support the Davs, but this right here is the definite version of the Dragonfall campaign.I even consider this the better of the 2 given story campaigns, due to. Well. I'll come to this latersowhat to tell you about it? Its the Shadowrun system in all its goodness and Shine! The Story takes place in the Flux State of Berlin, Germany in a Kiez (a word usually used to describe a neighborhood, kinda like the word ""hood"" in english) named Kreuzbasar in the Happiest place on Earth - Kreuzberg.and a lot of the Story can be described as ""It was a simple job, no way it could fail - and then stuff got worse"" but that theme is done so well, the story grips you from the get-go and never lets you free again.Now, heres why I find this campaign better than Dead Mans Switch - You are given a Team. people you work with, that get a backstory, a personality. Sure, DMS gives you that shaman and battle mage from the beginning, but those are only slightly covered in the Story.Your team gives that story Life, it feels more vivid, more  like you are the Leader of not some rolled together bunch of runners, but the leader of a well oiled team.but then again, the story pretty quickly makes you the leader of the team, so yeah. you are pretty much stuck with themNow, you may ask ""Why shouldnt I just buy the Dragonfall DLC for Shadowrun returns?"" I tell you why: This version is spruced up the Butt with special features. For starters the ""Level System"" for the aforementioned crew. After certain waypoints you can choose one of two permanent perk for each memeber. From extra equipment, active and passive abilities to better weapons. and sometimes you are just stuck between a rock and a hard place with your decision! get an active ability that reloads all your weapons for no cost or fet 2 sniper shots (high damage and pretty good crit chance) out for the price of one?Then there is the matter of a few extra missions, one for a Sidequest fraction, The Lodge, and one for every of your teammates (deepening their story even more and giving you a good feeling of closure)Oh, and the character Missions end up giving you a permanent upgrade for the character in Question Of course, it comes with all the upgrasdes of the original DLC version, such as ore spells, more weapons and weapon types.The game itself, due to its pretty free character creation system, has a lot of replay value. just to try out different approaches. The fact that you arent retricted in your character creations lets yourself be open for a ton of different crazy  multiclassing options. Workshop Content is worked on heavily and the User Made campaigns are fun to play.The Editor program is easy to handle and with a good Idea you may want to make your own.combat by itself is still the tactical way, a lot like XCOM (2012), Your units gain a number of actions a turn and you use them to move around, use abilities, Items or just lay waste to the enemies. You can take cover to increase your chances of not ening up as a bloody mess on the roadside (or as an adept, just say ""Screw that"" and use your spell that gives you different srengths of cover for a few turns)Oh, and if you skill yourself right you will endu up fighing  Basilisks and mini-Dragons by funching them in the face. That alone makes it awesome			"

												Its a decent RPG turned based game. Its a good fix if you're having withdrawl symptoms from WoW or eager to get a alternative fix to Fallout 3/New Vegas. The storyline is linear at first, but it fleshes out later in the game with multiple endings. There are subplots with multiple endings and the character development is decent too; the core characters in your shadowrunning clique have enough depth to justify their abilities and give life to the game's environment. Graphic is nice, and the art direction is excellent with its blade runner-esque influence. The game play is about 15 hours+ depending if you're into reading wall of text or just headliningthrough. However, there is to be complain about the technical side of the game. The out of combat scene transition seem to stall at time. Could be a bug, but it is making loading and saving game a frustration at time. It's a kickstarter game for sure, but for the time and investment put in this game its a high fun, high quality rpg game overall. 8.7/10.			"

												The Shadowrun reboot games are terrible. Just flat out, god awful and uninspired. Returns blows. Dragonfall blows. Hong Kong (from what I've researched), still blows because it has all of the problems but doesn't fix any of the fundamental issues.Yes, the dialogue can be decent at points, even inspired, but it's never worth the time you have to invest. Especially when the story plods along and places you in situations where, in a real game, these would just be side quests and not forced on you to interact with people you don't care about.These games were clearly made with mobile phones in mind, from the game design itself and how the shadow runs work, to the small areas that lead to loading time after loading time. From the menus and the big highlighted baubles meant for fingers, that also end up detracting from true exploration and make the games feel even more linear than they already are (thanks in part to design that makes it so you can't backtrack to previous areas unless mandated so by the story). The combat lacks that visceral quality games like Fallout 1 & 2 had and just never hits that stride of ""fun"" that a good game should, especially when you don't have a proper loot system because the developers thought it would be ""too hard"" to implement. Not to mention the world is far too static. In good CRPGs, the world was meant to react to your actions. Whether you stole things or killed someone, they responded well to player ingenuity and spontaneity. Instead, this game only allows for limited choices because the game is far too story heavy and doesn't want you breaking the content. If you don't like someone, you can't get rid of them until the story says you can. I want to play an RPG, not a visual novel.Oh and don't be surprised that nobodies made anything worthwhile with the editor - people would have to ENJOY playing it to want to make more content. Nearly twenty years ago, two separate companies took a stab at making the definitive Shadowrun experience for the respective Super Nintendo and SEGA Genesis. What's amazing about those titles is that despite the quirks that stem from releasing an RPG on a console, they hold up and are still debated amongst gamers as to which is truly the best game - and I have no doubts that the debate will continue to rage on, but I have serious doubts that the same would ever happen to this trilogy of trash.Even if you're starved for a modern RPG that doesn't suck, you will not find that here. Avoid.			"

												Finished Dragonfall yesterday. While it felt good and i definitely got my money's worth, I felt half the game went against the other, so to speak, or that the core mechanics in the game were bit disjointed:1) The way skill checks work in conversation feels annoying. If I don't have enough strength to pick a certain option, don't even show me that option. It feels like the game is constantly taunting you to spread your karma points around but then punishes you if you do so as that makes your character significantly less viable in combat.1a) Now i know most of the additional conv options is story fluff and only occasionally alternative objective paths/bonus goodies. Problem is showing the greyed out options shatters the illusion of choice and, by proxy, replayability. If I wouldn't see the greyed out options i would feel tempted to reroll a different character after my current playthrough just to see how certain convs play out when playing a strong decker instead of a charismatic mage. Due to seeing different options and noticing how all of them lead to the same outcome I don't feel tempted much.2) There's one optimal character build: Rifles, rifles, rifles. Long range? Carry a sniper rifle. Short range, grab an AR and then switch to a minigun. All the other weapon types are subpar compared to rifles. They tried to fix this by introducing weapon variety like tasers in the pistol group, or accuracy/different firing modes to some shotguns. Still, what's the point of tasing someone when you can unload full auto on him and kill him outright or in 2 rounds.Buffs are nice but redundant when you've cyberware and stims. Mages damage output shines only for a brief moment in the mid-game and then falls behind again. Shamans suck a bit as there's only a handful useful conjuring spells and spirits are too unreliable unless you pick the creator totem (which is one of the few useful totems in the game, by the way). Deckers are plain bad and matrix segments don't really justify having them around if you ignore story fluff. Riggers scale weirdly but are still worse than other choices and if the drones are gone they're dead weight. Melee is lacklustre.Seriously, I played through this game on hard and had a feeling all the time that having four runners with miniguns/sniper rifles/grenades would steamroll through everything there is in the game without issue. Also would feel like playing Syndicate.3) The party system is very restrictive and, what adds insult to injury, the game capitalises on these restrictions to work around basic design flaws outlined in point 2 which never should've been there in the first place.Ultimately I'd say the game's got lots of soul backed by great visuals, great music and a solid storyline but the PnP->cRPG translation is pretty bad which effects in a poor party system, basically non-existent loot system, poor character development and poor combat (although it did get considerably improved compared to Dead Man's Switch so kudos where they're due).Don't get me wrong, it all works, and it gets the job done and ultimately the game is quite enjoyable - but when HBS start working on a sequel they should go back to the drawing board and rethink the way they want to do it from scratch. The whole team is there, what you need is a proper systems designer.			"

												What can I say? I think this game is amazing. Where the original Shadowrun: Returns was a bit rough around the edges - some clunky UI, very linear, no fleshed-out party members - Dragonfall completely remedies almost all of that. This truly feels like the game Shadowrun: Returns *wanted* to be.*Very minor spoilers may follow*The structure of the game appears to borrow from Baldur's Gate 2 - after playing through the introduction you are thrown into a situation where you need to raise a large amount of capital. At this point the game branches out significantly offering you many quests to achieve this goal. While you will likely end up completing all of the quests available to you the order in which you do them is completely up to you. Each quest is interesting and offers opportunities for role-playing and making moral decisions. The content is rich and satisfying, with strong writing complimenting the challenging combat encounters. There's tons of dialog to read in-between quests that help flesh out the world of Dragonfall and bring everything to life.The UI has received a much-needed overhaul from Returns. There is now a more traditional skillbar and animations are performed faster which makes for a more satisfying experience overall.I see many people with this game in their libraries that have no yet played it. What are you waiting for? Play this *now*!  You don't have to have played Returns first, but it would definitely help you appreciate the vast improvements made in this Director's Cut.I am truly excited for the release of Shadowrun: Hong Kong. If the improvements from Returns to the Dragonfall are indication of what awaits us then we are in for a hell of a treat!			"

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a solid sequel and I recommend it for anyone who enjoyed Dead Man's Switch.  The story is better this time, and with far more dialogue immersion.  There is a great deal more combat in this game, but you can still avoid most of it with clever decisions.  All of the classes are useful, and the NPC team is highly competent.The director's cut edition fixes many of the problems from SR:R.  There are a few times when enemies will take a long time with their turns, but it's rarely more than a few seconds delay if they do get stuck.  During two playthroughts, I've only once had to reload a save due to a glitch.			"

												Unfortunately 2 game-breaking bugs ruined what was a potentially interesting game.  Looked online for fixes, and looks like the developers never bothered to adjust the code to avoid them.I liked the world that was crafted, but lack of voiceovers, ability to change view (this being a 4X is kind of essential) detracted from the environment significantly enough for me to never want to play a Shadowrun again.Avoid.

You cant go back. Also there are multi dimensional paths to take to reach a goal. This game truly is a masterpiece and I would highly recommend it.			"

												Terrific. If you liked Shadowrun Returns you will love this game. If you only somewhat liked SR you will probably love this game. It's better, more advanced in every way. You now have a set team, no longer having to hire runners mission by mission. (You still *can*, though. I just never understood why anyone *would*.) Combat, skills and cyberware have all been improved and added to since the first game. And the story is much more detailed. Pretty intriguing, actually. Dialogue is excessively wordy at times (not nearly to the degree of the next game, mind you) but with your party at least and during missions it's usually interesting. And the missions themselves have some brilliant moral quandries that surpass most RPG's typical black and white dynamic. Tough decisions await.But you're a shadowrunner. What did you think you were signing up for?			"

												The story may be good by game standards, but games live and die by gameplay being fun and fair.  Dragonfall fails at this; let us count the ways (mostly compared to XCOM EU/EW/2, which are much more polished): - Almost nothing is explained.  Help menu is nearly useless. - Lots of long-known, unfixed bugs, some game-breaking.  No dev action or community fixes. - Teammates can't level. - Can't melee from catercorner position, only cardinal. - Controls are bad, not explained, and not remappable.  Left-click for move, attack, and choose team member, really? - Can't rotate camera.  I don't care if it's because the backgrounds are painted.  Combined with the left-click-for-everything, this makes moving to a square one above a teammate an excercise in pixel-hunting. - Nothing is voiced.  What is this, 1998? - Animations janky and slow.  No apparent option to speed them up like in XCOM2. - Can't autosave every round like XCOM. - Graphics poor, load times still long. - Character counted as flanked when she's not. - Shot by enemy I cannot see. - Can see an enemy, have line of sight, cannot target.  Move towards, teammate disappears. - Displayed to-hit chances way off.  Just look at the threads on this. - Enemy AI stupid, places little worth on self-preservation. - Not enough things count as cover, e.g. doorway sides don't.			"

												As in the previous game, game breaking bugs diminish the enjoyment of the game. If you can live with jumping through hoops to avoid triggering the bugs that make you restart levels because you forgot to kill that one last soldier in an adjoining room and now you can't get to him and you are perpetually stuck in combat mode and can't progress the story... well you get my drift. It's a great game but it is not acceptable to have these kind of bugs still after all this time and after all those patches.			"

												You have less autonomy than in Shadowrun Returns, you're saddled with Monikas team right off the bat and you're stuck with dialogues that are meant for befriending them or you can choose to mess up those forced relationships with significant and dire consequences later.Forget the feeling of an independant shadowrunner who hires help and has associates he pays for when needs be. Now you're stuck with a crew integral to the storyline whether you like it or not. You can still hire help for side missions and pay for other shadowrunners but with the crew you already have that's completely free of charge it's pointless.I didn't like the lack of freedom in this scenario. It has more items, weapons, spells, outfits and stuff in general but the forced relationships with a crew you didn't get a choice with in the beggining make me feel like Shadowrun Returns was better written and scripted.This game has a more ''Mass Effect'' feel than I care for. You're basically Shepard in this game.Not my cup of tea.			"

												I am a huge fan of the Shadowrun universe but this game is impossibly broken. Don't waste your money. Typical game goes like this its 4 vs 40, your runners fire 20 shots with a 96% chance to hit and all shots miss except one which hits one enemy for 2 damage, 40 enemies fire and each scores 2.0x crit for 35 damage with shotguns from sniper rifle range and despite your runners being in heavy cover and wearing max armor and having maxed dodge. This happens over and over and over to the point you don't actually expect you will hit anything most of the time you attack - so much for feeling heroic.I actually found myself wishing I was playing the AI units cause they kick butt compared to your runners. You are regularly forced to run through doorways and small hallways that the enemy will unlease 10-20 grenades on your team which cost 10x what you would earn for the mission. Luckily grenades dont do crap for damage - go figure. After expending all your health kits that cost more than you will likely get paid for the mission you either run out of money or the game locks up mid mission and you reload to an old save losing a level and having to reread 45 minutes of dialogue boxes. Was this game even tested or balanced? Tried really hard to like this game but its just too broken.			"

												♥♥♥♥ this game.The writing's nice and I enjoy the feeling of Shadowrun, there's a good bit of nostalgia going on. On the bad side, there's a lot. The UI is awful and clunky, the battles take forever and you'll get ♥♥♥♥ed in every way possible. Coming back from a difficult mission? We'll throw you in an ambush, by yourself, let them have the first shots and give you one medkit and a grenade. ♥♥♥♥ing deal with it.Encounter design is unbalanced, some of them are absolute cakewalk and others I had to replay 10+ times, just to get the lucky die that one time.Classes are ♥♥♥♥ing useless - there's a decking or rigging challenge and you main character doesn't meet the requirements? Well ♥♥♥♥ you, your rigger who could totally pass can't even attempt it. Why? LOL dunno.The story and setting and writing are solid, but the systems they run on are terrible and the game is the opposite of fun because of that. This isn't even hard in that good way, it's just annoying and draining by how clumsy and user-unfriendly it is.THIS is a director's cut?! Well♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Harebrained Schemes fooled me twice with this series (and as a result I never bought Shadowrun: Hong Kong).  When I was going into the final mission of the game, I thought to myself, ""This would be a great half-way point in the story... but I think it's ending.""  And it did.  It's a very short game, not even worth the regular price because of the lack of options.  The replay value is actually poor.The game gives an illusion of depth and choice, but there's really not much to do.  Side quests that seem like they may open a robust new side plot revealed themselves to be nothing but one-offs that did not affect the overall story.The skill system displays the potential to level up your skills quite high, but there is not even enough game to ever max them out.  Also, the matrix/hacking segments were nearly game-breaking for me.  You have all these skills to level-up, and none of them matter when you hack.  All you get is the same basic attacks and become boring before the end of the first segment.			"

												I didn't like it.Having played Shadowrun returns and reading all those positive things about this one I was really confident that Dragonfall was even better. That's why I am really frustrated now when after couple of days of playing this I realize that I hardly will play it any further.The things I liked a lot in Shadowrun returns were mostly the plot, the atmoshpere and the dialogs. I even felt myself as in a crime movie playing a detective first. I read each dialogue and enjoyed it quite a lot. The NPC i talked to was charismatic enough to be involved and to be interested what they may say next. Most important, I could belive the story.All this is missing in Dragonfall. From the very beginning all the tasks are of cosmic importance. The motivation of the hero is absolutely not clear. Fight such terrifying opponent to revenge for a girl you don't really care about... Hard to believe. The NPC's talk a lot but I was tempted to skip majority of dialogs as I already knew what they are going to say.Too much and too boring.The long story short - something essential has gone from Shadowrun and I really feel sorry about it.

												Shadowrun: DragonFall is one of the best RPGs I have ever played and this isn’t being a fanboy on the game, I’m saying this genuinely! NO! DON’T COMMENT! JUST BUY THE GAME NOW! But because I like writing reviews, I’ll go ahead and write one… quite a shocker I know…Shadowrun is a tactical-turn-based RPG based in a dark futuristic cyberpunk world mixed with magical fantasy. I love cyberpunk, showing us what the future of humanity could be, especially when new technologies start changing dynamically society. Magical fantasy just opens up many more possibilities for the game’s story that just makes me want to discover more about it!So here’s basic initial story of SR: DF, you’re an ork or troll or dwarf or elf or a human (BLEAURGH, I hate human beings) who is a Shadowunner working in Germany in the year of 2055! You run... in the shadows… surprisingly enough… It’s just a fancy alternative word for “mercenary”. You join a new team and you start off immediately in a mission to assault a glamorous manor! Unfortunately, everything hits the fan and you bail off the mission! Now you and your team need to discover what’s behind the screw up of the mission, along the way you’ll be in place of awesome sidequests that vary the gameplay and narrative!Pacing is very important in game because it avoids the curse of monotony and makes it so the player wants to unravel more to see what the game has to offer more. This is why I consider RE4 one of the best games ever: pacing! Missions range from loud violent fights to others that can avert any kind of fighting if you handle the situation properly. For example, one of the missions is to stop this anti-metahuman that glorify the human race as the only true superior one… in Germany… why does this ring a bell? Progressing is downright enjoyable since you’ll just be unravelling more and more mysteries through the storyline. It is quite linear, you can verge a bit to the right or to the left but at the end of the day, you’re going in a “one way” direction. I don’t mind that actually, I prefer a better structured RPG game rather than one that isn’t as organized and you’re just faffing about. This doesn’t mean that I like to have my hand held, I just like everything properly placed in order.The writing is just spot on, it’s not stereotypical and exposition is delivered properly without being shoved down your throat purposely. Talking to characters requires some commitment to their personalities, constantly spamming the “ask X about Y” won’t make them convince them to trust. Don't get me wrong, what I’m saying here isn’t a DYNAMIC dialogue system, you’ll know how to handle your team in conversations right at the get go if you read their profiles in your PC. What’s trickier is handling characters who aren’t of your team, that’s where the challenge in the dialogue comes in, but really, it comes down to your luck and subjective thought, just like in any other RPG.Good characters, good arcs and good story (much better than SR: R).That’s all that needs to be said about the narrative. I would’ve, however, had much more diversified team, you have only one metahuman, but their personalities compensate that.The Shadowrun reboot continues its mechanics similar to another reboot: XCOM – Enemy Unknown.  A simplified tactical squad turn-based strategy is how I’d describe this, however if you’re looking for combat, XCOM would serve you better. Your key to victory are: chest high walls!My main issue of is that Shadowrun’s combat doesn’t have the same visual feedback and depth of XCOM. For example, due to the pre-rendered backgrounds, you don’t have any environmental destruction that can change the level drastically. The only environmental variables in the game are conveniently placed explosive barrels, although unoriginal, they do help with the variety of the battles. That said, this doesn’t mean that the combat system isn’t good and even then, the game tries a couple of small things. You have different firing modes for your weapons, different types of throwables, different melee combat options, battle drones, different magical powers that inflict status changes to characters and the game promotes a lot of consumable uses. The real environmental interactions come from outside of the combat that might affect the combat itself. For a simple example, if you search hard enough, you may be able to turn off the enemy turrets.As any RPG, the game has progression system which is a very important part of the game, not only for the combat, but for the story as well. You don’t gain EXP, instead you gain Karma points in small numbers and they do depend when and how your receive them.  Like in Fallout, you can use your points on a certain event to get something out of it. It’s a nice implementation, combining mechanics and story in a subtle way, although it’s a tad awkward to think of life like mathematics. There are two big criticisms that I have, which is that the most useful attribute is that of charisma (because you can sweet talk anyone to convince them to your side and most of the time, you’ll be chatting in this game) and your teammates (depending on their specialty) can replace the missing attributes that a situation asks from you. That’s why most of the time I took Blitz because he could easily hack anything that my character couldn’t.This standalone expansion also improves the UI significantly. Although it places an awkward “directional pad-like” UI on the right bottom corner, almost like it was meant to be ported to a console. Hopefully, it will.The AI is as good as that of XCOM: EU, no real complaints about them. They’ll be as efficient as they can be before they’re put down.The combat gels well with the story and changes itself according to the situation of the plot thus, it keeps up with the aforementioned good pacing which makes the majority of the combat quite special and unique. Yet, there was one annoying mission that you had to chase down an enemy and at the same time, fight others, kept getting away because you were getting easily killed by other gunman. I also remember a mission where you had to go through constant groups of enemy in such a way that it felt like a sudden difficulty spike. Glad those were the only moments the game irritated me. However, if you go down, then it’s game over, even though your teammates are up. There is no permadeath aside from one mission and there isn’t an injury system from XCOM, I don’t mind that, considering you’re always limited to at max 4 characters to take you with. However, that permadeath mission might’ve made the missions ahead much more difficult than usually.XCOM: EU was good but it had its issues, like the severely restricted 2 Action Points, it did remove many little niggles like crouching behind cover but your tactics were limited. Same happens with SR: DF, you won’t get an extra action point until about the beginning of the end of the game. What’s more annoying is that you can’t control your characters in an RTS style, they all follow your character’s lead, which makes “door breachings” very awkward. So you’ll be out on the open as you breach through a door.Graphically it runs in the Unity engine, with low quality models but beautiful pre rendered backgrounds. Options are scarce and for some reason, the game runs terribly when you zoom out, dropping the framerate to 30 even though there was nothing special of the game. Other than that, there are no technical issues aside from the AI freezing during its turn.So yeah… that’s Shadowrun: Dragonfall! The Bollock's Edition has 33 hours of a nicely paced RPG  with a memorable narrative and satisfactory turn-based gameplay. I recommend you play Shadowrun: Returns, it’s still worth it and if you play this first before Return, then you won’t enjoy it as much. I recommend it!			"

												Finally, this is the game I wanted when I originally donated to the Kickstarter.This campaign reminds me much more of the classic tabletop game.  Members of your crew bicker with you, ask favors, and over time gain or lose respect for you.  Once you've done a few runs, you have a few more choices on what jobs you want to take on.  There will often be multiple way to complete the job, and bonuses for thorough exploration.Combat is a ton of fun, and all character classes feel useful now.			"

												If you're a fan of oldschool, top down RPGs with turn based mechanics and heavily nuanced story elements and many forking paths to go down, you'll enjoy that aspect of this game. Much of the game looks lovely thanks to the illustrated, static backgrounds, and the character models get the job done if you don't look too close, but once you do, it looks kind of like you're playing with old WoW characters with a cyberpunk sheen.If you find yourself sympathetic to the storywriter's worldview and you enjoy this genre, you won't be disappointed by much but some of it's visuals and relatively short length compared to other similar games and other entries in the series. If you're apolitical or centrist, however, and new to the genre, I couldn't possibly recommend this to you in good faith, as the game loves to preach to you - not all the time, but often enough to make one feel alienated, frustrated, and dissatisfied. Extended: The story and setting themselves are great, and really fleshed out. Your character can develop in many different ways, with a myriad of different skill sets that all feel powerful, and most importantly, useful.  It feels awesome and dynamic, and that's what gave me incentive to try this game out. The game works- doesn't reinvent the wheel though as far as isometric turn/tile based strategy games go though, so I won't go on about it.My one gripe with this game, and I'll be blunt, is it's politics. I don't have a problem with the theme and setting catering more to far left or right sensitivities, people are entitled to their own opinions, and matters of ethics and morals are entirely subjective, up to the interpretation of the individual but the writer apparently doesn't think so.It takes me out of the whole experience- anyone who's a fan of this genre wants to play the game and experience it through their own eyes, draw their own conclusions- it's meant to be a role playing game, but the game seems confused over who is ultimately in control, the author or the player.Moral nuance simply doesn't exist in this universe, at least when we're dealing with issues of intersectionality and identity politics (which the game does A LOT) and I find it above all, childish and irksome.There are many other RPGs out there that handle such things much better- I won't name them, but many games come to mind where you are given factions to choose to ally with that may seem good or evil at first, but in the end, they all end up having their reasons, real and tangible reasons that make the characters feel like actual human beings with depth and personality. But this game doesn't really seem to have that in any consistent manner- the good guys more often than not are good because they're good, and the bad guys more often than not are bad because they're bad (or worse, brainwashed by the REAL bad guys), and to add onto the whole absurd affair, your dialogue options pigeonhole you into the same false dichotomies.NPCs range from the well-made and sympathetic, to the typical two dimensional moustache twirling jerkoffs, and it makes the game feel less like a proper RPG and more like some subversive, half baked propaganda piece half the time. It might fly in Mass Effect, but the Paragon/Renegade♥♥♥♥♥♥here feels so phoned in and preachy, and I feel like I wouldn't have so much of an issue with this aspect of the game of the rest of it wasn't so well executed and balanced by comparison. And then in the next mission everything is fine again- you're called in to do some work for a shady organization, with a team they cobbled together seeming at random, and you have to choose to support one or the other, and it feels great, it feels dynamic and real and multifaceted again, just as an RPG in the modern era ought to be.IF you can ignore all that, have at it- it's a great game in every other aspect, from the visuals to the world building to the core mechanics and character progression, well worth the measly fifteen dollars.

												The fluff is the most interesting part of this game.  The mechanics are poor, very poor.  Irrespective of your % to hit you'll hit on an every other shot basis, I've missed on a 99% chance on more than a few occasions, regardless of difficulty.  I wish I had read some of the other more negative reviews, as this is just sloppy workmanship, irrespective of the 'indie' tag.  FTL is under the same tag and is light-years better than this.Simply not good enough to enjoy this game.  Can't recommend this and will avoid the dev from now on, which is Harebrained Schemes LLC.Done.Oh yeah, forgot to give it a score.  This is ♥♥♥♥ing dire and the indie title doesn't save it when they expect people to pay for it.  Uninstalled and dismissed.  I only wish this was via CD/DVD so I could use the ♥♥♥♥ing thing as a coaster.2/10  DNP			"

												I actually backed Shadowrun Returns on Kickstarter. I don't remember the tiers, but there was one that included the ""planned Berlin campaign"" and a snazzy USB key. That's the one I got. I greatly enjoyed SRR on release, I wrote a glowing review on it and I was pleased as is, especially with both a campaign and the tools to make my own (which I keep meaning to do).SRR and its initial campaign, Deadman's Switch, were fantastic. Dragonfall, however, is the fulfillment of all the hopes I had for this platform. The writing is miles above the previous campaign, which was already quite decent. The main NPCs - the Kreusbazar crew - are extremely fleshed out, very relatable and rarely (if ever) step out of character. The plot itself, while not ""mind-bending"" or whatever other cliche epithets people like to attach to these things, is semi-original but that's irrelevant because the execution is nearly flawless. Nearly. The sidequests for your fellow Shadowrunners (including the additions in this Director's Cut) are entertaining and further serve to get you attached to your people. The expanded cyberware selection in the DC is also incredibly welcome, because that's one area where Shadowrun Returns was fairly lackluster.The interface improvements, while not a massive overhaul, are welcome and make the game that much easier to manipulate and play. The use of additional etiquette types in actual gameplay makes investing karma into Charisma actually worthwhile this time around, instead of being a guessing game as to what actually sees any significant use.If you enjoyed Shadowrun Returns, enjoy cyberpunk plots, enjoy good characterization and fun tactical gameplay then Shadowrun: Director's Cut is well worth every last penny. Even though I got it for free as part of my backing the project, I WOULD have paid extra for it.			"

												Cool game. Has an environment comparable to the latest Deus Ex game, along with Deus Ex's skill system in that skills are used to complete quest objectives in different ways. The combat is XCOM style, except members of your team have a personality, though relationships are not as deep as a Mass Effect/Dragon Age. Story is real interesting, and it's well written, along with the dialogue. Very easy to recommend this game. Oh, and you barely have to manage your team's skills and inventory, which I love. Love.

You will be outgunned. You will be forced to walk up to enemies who will shoot, burn, and otherwise dismember you before you are allowed to act. And then the odds calculation cheats.And that's before you get to the hard difficulty settings. "

Neither would load.I verified my files, re-installed the game, did the whole damn dance. No dice.I started over, this time saving across many different files. Until none of them worked anymore past a certain point.Something to keep in mind: I've never completed the first mission. This game is a pile of bugs held together by sticky bug guts.Wait for it to go on sale. Good for about 10 minutes of fun before the fact that it's just a rancid pile of horse bowels catches up with it.			"

												SCORE: 10/10 ( and I am picky about my reviews and will often give amazing games around 9.0-9.5 due to minor issues). This game just transcends even otherwise stellar games due to it's flawless combination of turn-based strategy and RPG elements in a world that is gritty, believable, and engaging.If X-COM and Fire Emblem had a baby in the Matrix, this would be it. Shadowrun Dragonfall is even better than Shadowrun Returns, both of which are just a breath of fresh air in the RPG and turn-based strategy worlds. This has all the turn-based goodness of X-COM and FIre Emblem, but all the RPG mastery of Divinity Original Sin and the best of Dragon Age.The story is truly exciting. But the WRITING ITSELF IS PHENOMENAL. It is as good as the best sci-fi novel, with details and scene setting that takes your mind to details that the already superb graphics don't.I have already backed Shadowrun: Hong Kong and look forward to whatever this studio tries to do. But they have pretty much combined my two favorite genres into a perfect game.			"

												Shadowrun Dragonfall was already an amazing piece of work, reminding us again of what RPG actually meant, sometime back, but with the Director's Cut it has evolved to one of THE single best games of this decade. The Karma System allows for countless costumisation of your main character, the new levelling system for your followers add a valuable factor, as you can skill them in anyway you need to complement your main character. The personal Quests of you followers are interesting, and add to the setting in fantastic ways. This game allows the player to fully immerse himself in the world of Shadowrun, to experience this setting, bringing us so close to what Shadowruns actually means, that I could often enough smell and taste the Berlin of that time. I personally can recommend this game to anyone who always wanted to try Shadowrun or any good RPG. It is ideal for anyone and any audience, experts, casual gamers, beginners and also shows how much Harebrained has evolved since Shadowrun Returns (which also was a fantastic game). I am personally looking forward to seeing more of Harebrained and must personally thank them for giving us a new giant in the RPG genre that can compete with cult-titles like Baldur's Gate any day!

												Sweet lord I cannot recommend this game enough to true lovers of RPGs. This game has given me more hours and more enjoyment than quite a lot of full priced games. The story is absolutely fantastic and there can't be enough praise given to the writing. All the characters are interesting with very few that you meet falling under any obvious cliches. The combat mechanics are mostly the same as in Shadowrun: Returns. Only this time the encounters and combat zones seem to be better designed so the fight sequences are quite fun and tactical (unlike in the last game where tedious was a good description). The matrix sequences are also FAR better than they were in SRR. But again, it's the story, the writing and the world that sucks you in. Right at the end of the game, effectively the epilogue, long after the last achievement has been earnt, and quest has been completed you're presented with a choice that effectively has no tangible outcome to you, the player. Yet, the world has you so invested in your character and the world, you can't help but agonise over the decision. The game ends after making the choice and for days afterwards I was questioning whether I did the right the thing. Such is the quality of the writing in this game. There's a handful of small bugs but only once was it bad enough for me to forcefully quit the game. Thankfully it resolved after I reloaded my save - others who encountered this particular bug apparently had to reset the level so I'm happy with my experience. No serious negatives that jump out at me. The fact that you can’t heal more than your latest injury using magic is fine, but only once I got used to that. Players of SRR beware, magic is no longer a cure-all. Always keep med-kits. I feel the game doesn’t communicate this change well enough. Or it did and I wasn’t paying attention :/Two weeks after finishing it, I'm still thinking about how good it was and how sad I was to leave my persona behind when the story ended. If that's not a sign of how good it felt to walk those streets then I don't know what is. 9.5/10Truly a fantastic game. If you love RPGs with deep stories and aren't put off by reading, don't go past this. "

Also, an interesting tidbit is that this masterpiece wasn't advertised to death as 'Cinematic' and instead opted to just tell a good story primarily through text.

												I'm new to the Shadowrun universe, so I didn't know what to expect out of this game. However, given the positive reviews and its low cost, I decided to give it a try. Little did I know, this would turn out to be a very, very good decision. There are so many great things I could say about this game - I could go on and on. But in the interest of keeping this review concise, I'll pick out one thing I found that sets it apart from every other game: the storytelling. The quality of the writing in this game, in every aspect - between the dialogue, the side stories and the overall story - is mind-blowingly phenomenal. It simply doesn't get any better than this. When it's over, it will leave you desiring for more, and the good news is: more is on it's way.			"

												I really had fun with this game. It actually feels like what the original Shadowrun: Dragonfall (not that it was awful by any means) should have been like.Visually, Shadow Run: Dragonfall - Directors Cut, is presented in isometric 3D just like the original SNES game, but is now turn based. Not as deep as say XCOM Enemy Within, it is still a great game to play.Unlike the original, you now can upgrade your crew just like your main character. Not only do their stats and abilities improve, but they also get better weapons and equipment. This makes the game so much more enjoyable, and eliminates so much of the frustration during combat in the later stages of the original game.Spend the extra cash and get this version of the game instead, you will have a lot more fun.

												This game really drips psi-punk atmosphere in great old school package!The best way I can describe this is try to get you to imagine a Fallout 2 amped up to v1.3; even *more* atmosphere; and of course it is set in the Shadowrun universe.  Those are some great ""Pros"" for a Pro and Con review.  I will not even bother to list them because if you have never played Fallout 2, buy that first, here, now.  With that said the ""cons"" for a ""pro and con"" review should be obvious as well.  No 3d.  No voice acting.  Limited graphics.  etc...etc...   But, if that was not your thing at all, you would not be reading this far into the reviews anyway, would you??Of course if you like the setting, or tactical/sci-punk shooters in the ISO-metric view this game is quite fun.  It has a bit more RPG than Fallout did IMO, and that is a good thing.Other than the game being isometric view only (ala 1999) my biggest gripe is that the ""Decking"" and fights in when you are jacked-into systems could have been much better.  They are fun, a bit different ....but they could have really be much more unique and really set the game above and beyond.The mix of ""classes"" and the system is  very nice and quite varied.  I suspect I will replay this at least one more time and cyber the heck out of myself (I am doing the smg/samurai/mage-thing the first time).This is a very a fun game and for the price of a large pizza it can't be beat IMO.Caveat: While I have 30+ hours so far, I have never played any other ""Shadowrun"" game, ever.  No pen and paper, no old school PC games, nothing.  BUT, I am old enough to have been around when it was created (we actually played Gamma World 1e back then) and I have several friends that love this setting.  I have grown to like it myself, even if I have never actually gamed it, until now.			"

												Better than Shadowrun: Returns in every way, this game is pretty great in terms of story and characters. The combat mechanics are still half-baked and simplistic, but enjoyable enough to keep you going. Prepare to read A LOT, for writing is the main strength of the game. If you aren't able to immerse yourself in the character and a setting, you probably won't enjoy it that much.Overall a must buy rpg that gives you this delicious taste of a good story that a lot of triple-A titles missing nowadays.

												A splendid little RPG. By little, I mean it's not a 100+ hour epic teaming with side quests and continents to discover. It's much more narrow in scope. The main quest, small cast and the handfull of non-essential missions are sublime. It has no filler. Every minor character brings in a charming spark and all the environs are dripping with cyberpunk grime. The turn-based mechanics are expansive and invite many possible successfful choices. The one caveat is the team inventory system is unexplained, but gets cleared up once you make the mistake of trying to equip a party member with superior items.			"

												This is a good game--not a great game, but a good solid game.  I toyed with the idea of giving it a ""thumbs down"" not because I dislike the game, but because Steam's rating system is ridiculously simple and I don't feel the game currently deserves its 95% rating.The strength of this game is the story, and more specifically the storytelling.  This is done mostly through very well written, descriptive, and immersive text.  The story also offers several interesting moral choices for the player and I believe some of the choices I made did affect the plot at later points.   The Shadowrun universe is also fantastic, with an interesting mix of fantasy and sci-fi elements, and a lore that is dystopian and post-apocalyptic.  RPG elements to the game are also quite strong.  There are a number of skill categories to put your points into.  The developers balanced the availability of skill points well; I felt like my choices mattered and impacted the character in predictable ways.  There are several different classes and races to choose from as well, and everyone should be able to create a character they care about and enjoy leveling-up.There are some areas where the game falls a bit short.  XCOM: enemy unknown is my favorite game, so that gives you a sense of how much I enjoy good tactical combat.  Combat in Shadowrun: Dragonfall is turn-based, and it does contain a cover system, but everything is simplified to a great extent.   After having played XCOM I really missed the ability to rotate the screen (some portions of the maps are difficult to see well), and I also missed the wrinkle that elevation introduced into XCOM's combat.  Generally I would say that the combat becomes fairly straightforward and repetitive after a while, as the different enemies and layouts don't have the complexity necessary to encourage different strategies for success.  Enemy AI is serviceable but not impressive.  Game difficulty is balanced decently.  I played most of the game on ""hard"", but did tone it down to normal for a particular area that did have a significant difficulty spike.  There are a good number of different guns, spells, shamanic tokens, decking gear, and body augmentations you can purchase for your character, but many of them are limited to certain classes, and therefore will not be directly usable by your main character.In the game you control your character as well as up to three additional shadowrunners that you meet along the way, and who tend to hang out at your main base.  You have some control over these characters' development in the form of fairly simple skill trees (as opposed to the more classic XP-attribute system used for your main character).  You can buy equipment for them, however your ability to equip new gear for these characters does seem someone restricted and is less straightforward than it is for your own character.Overall I really did enjoy this game.  Contrary to many reports, I did not feel this was a GOTY candidate, and I also feel that Steam's inadequate rating system has inflated this game to a 95% score.  The story is excellent, RPG elements and variety are quite strong, and combat is mediocre.  RPG fans, particularly those that love a well-told, complex story, will really enjoy this game.			"

												I enjoyed this more than the first, even though I like the first. It was more fleshed out had more depth to characters and story. There were some interesting moral choices which are always fun and give it that personal story touch.I enjoyed the characters wanted to get to know them and their stories and enjoyed gaining their trust.I just enjoy this world, its gritty got attitude and I like that, I love the Cyber Punk theme. Magic Metahumans and Corporations to bring down whats not to love.Im also a fan of Hairbrained Studios they get the job done and are working to improve. Anyway recommended.			"

												I played for about 10 minutes, then it froze. But that was cool. I'm pretty sure the game had already run out of fun at that point.After that, I bit the bullet and played for 20 more minutes. I found out my saved games wouldn't load. Alternating saves. Neither would load.I verified my files, re-installed the game, did the whole damn dance. No dice.I started over, this time saving across many different files. Until none of them worked anymore past a certain point.Something to keep in mind: I've never completed the first mission. This game is a pile of bugs held together by sticky bug guts.Wait for it to go on sale. Good for about 10 minutes of fun before the fact that it's just a rancid pile of horse bowels catches up with it.			"

												I have really mixed feelings about this game, and wish Steam had a 'maybe' or 'neutral' option for the recommendation.  Without that, I have to err on the side of not recommending it. The GoodThe actual combat is fun enough.  It's turn-based strategy style.  There are a good number of decisions to make without being overwhelming.  The biggest of these are which of two guns to use, which special skills to use and in what order, and where to position yourself (mostly about accuracy vs defense).  Whether using guns or magic or fighting through a summoned creature or drone, skills include: wide range or spread shot, stun, damage over time, armor breaking, and various buffs.  Choosing which to use in which order (they have cool-down times so you can't just spam 'the best skill') is probably the most fun aspect.The stories are complex and multilayered.  The plots are amazing.  And the political and philosophical aspects are deep (though easily ignored if you're just into it for the steam-punk-ish fantasy).The BadThe stories are almost entirely told through walls of text.  There's no animation, no voice acting, minimal cut scenes, etc, to tell the story for you.  And even when story could be told through gameplay itself, it's done through more pop-ups to read.  (For an idea of what I mean, think of games like Dragon Age or Skyrim, where you find books that explore the lore and history of the worlds.  In this game, the whole story is kind of presented that way, not just the lore and history).  The cash and shop system is pretty lame.  You only purchase things for your main character, so the vast majority of shops and goods just get in the way (eg. if you're a spell-caster you have no interest in the summoning totems, guns, drones, spirit magic, implants, hacking tools, etc).  It'd be great if you could purchase gear for your team as well.  On top of that, it mostly feels like you're just buying upgrades, rather than choosing different gear for different strategies.  There's a little bit of the strategy thing (like stun grenades vs direct damage grenades), but it's really minimal, and the upgrades are too essential to waste what tight money you have on optional things anyway.The decking/hacking/matrix aspect seems like it should be the most unique aspect to the game... but it's just simplified version of the usual combat.  Same effects, same strategies, but only one character, fewer abilities, and simple graphics.  It really should be some unique kind of minigame; or at least involve a very different style of combat.There is little or no point to exploring.  All that happens if you explore is: you wait a minute for your character to run to where you want; you see a white magnifying glass icon; you click on it and get a useless amount of money or low level healing pack.  That is, you don't uncover interesting enemies, side plots, unique items, secret areas, mini-games, etc. All in all, I enjoyed the game while I was playing it, but when I wasn't playing it I had no drive to hurry up and start again.

												I love Shadowrun Returns, and I've been playing SR since Sega Genesis. Seeing as this had a better rating I figured I would love this too. Sadly that is not the case. There is something VERY wrong with the difficulty of the game. I failed the first mission maybe 10 times before calling it quits. Every shot I fired seems to miss and every shot the enemy fires gets a crit. This is the case even with the difficulty set on easy. IMO starting your game with an unbeatable mission doesn't make for happy players. Maybe I suck at tactics? Seeing as I got through SR Returns just fine I doubt that is the case.			"

												Yea, im gonna write this 1 hour into the game. Never really loaded an RPG this many times because it makes no sense to be honest. Im in a room where i gotta survive for 10 rounds and the cover system makes no sense. You cant hit♥♥♥♥♥♥but get flanked all the time. Making no sense. Like the game, the combat is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at the moment. Im sitting here screaming ""AND YOU HIT FROM THERE?"" missing bullets 1 meter from the back, getting hit by some dude over the room behind cover, critical flanked. Seriously? Too bad, when the games seems fun, with a fun setting. How can you make combat so simple and ♥♥♥♥ it up. Gonna keep plauing hoping that when i get past this room (and its not as it is deep right now, all got 2 spells), just keep spamming shots with 30-40% and hope you do better. Dont get kill by a grenadir, and they all hit with aoe. Im screaming in the pain from this combat. Ok, got further. I still do think that it is a X-com Enemy Unknown type based shooter, like Fallout Tactics with the cover system, but i dot think its alittle hard to know where the best cover systems are, or it just plainly does it abit different and you got to get used to it.Alot of reading, which is good if you like or, or not if you dont. The writing makes the dialugoe and situations very discriptive.			"

While not graphically/technically impressive for 2014, it has a consistent and appealing aesthetic that suits the theme.

Non-combat solutions also are handled pretty well, common enough to make most related skills worth it, and not under or overly rewarding.All I can really do as far as criticisms go with this game is nitpick at its combat/character building balance issues which aren't that bad relative to many other RPGs anyway.

												If you like a good story with choices and character attributes that influence the dialogue and general story and if you like tactical turn based combat (although a bit simplistic), this is for you. Compared to Shadowrun Returns this one's got a cleaner UI, but it's still not quite ""there"" in terms of user friendliness and some things could in my opinion still be improved.However, apart from that the game was a blast for me. I really like the characters, the writing, the mystery, the conspiracy. If you're not interested in that, don't buy the game. You definitely play this for the story foremost.			"

												Setting is a really strong point for Dragonfall as well as graphic and music is. Dialogues are well written and engaging. Companions likeable, especially Dietrich. The biggest flaw is linearity, the hub design, which Harebrainded Schemes had tried to hide under a few tricks, like having a choice in which order to take most missions, or having an ingame internet forum from which the player may get a feeling of being a part of a bigger world. The missions are fun, often having contradicting objectives, and a few ways of doing them. Some of them are outsanding like the Lodge mission when the player  is assigned to the team consisting entirely of strangers, with whom he must cooperate, even if the squad looks like it is going to fall apart any minute. Combat is fun, but playing on very hard is advised to make it enyojable. Encounter design is very strong, which is especially evident in APEX mission in which the player has to defend 3 points with 4 people against the swarm of enemies, some of which can stun the player for a turn. Althrough the game is short, the quality od content is very good. It's a great improvment over Shadowrun Return, which shows HBS as a skilled developer. Game managed to make me a fan  of the setting.			"

												This game is cool in a lot of ways. I liked the graphics, the story seemed cool, and the combat seems in-depth enough to get interesting. I felt however the fights lasted too long. I might go back to it at some time if I have more time it just seems kind of too detailed.			"

												This game, just like its previous incarnation, was a really well thought out and implemented game - I've really enjoyed both games across multiple platforms and devices - it works *great* on my Surface Pro 3!  The game is very engaging, but still easy to put down and pick up later.  I also really appreciate that they let others develop levels, though most aren't as good as the basic versions.			"

												""condition people to expect nothing and the least little something gets them all excited"" - Jane Lane, Daria""it's better than bad, it's good"" - Log ad, Ren and StimpyThose quotes adequately explain the insane disproportion of positivity in relation to the relatively unremarkable offerings of the new Shadowrun franchise. But relativity is what makes objectivity in reviews so elusive. Shadowrun was the first taste of traditional cRPGs that most of us had sampled since the Infinity Engine was still current...or at least relevant. To many that's enough to merit a 5 star rating a glowing review. To me, the memory of Black Isle's/Bioware's living worlds inhabited by engaging, sympathetic characters; memorable plots; and writing/design that truly let you feel like you were playing a role is still too fresh to think much of Shadowrun's bare-bones world, interesting-if-not-endearing characters, and feeling that your role was that of an information-gathering machine whose only choice was the tone in which to deliver queries.Everything from the hub-and-mission style progression to the pathetic sparseness of the hub save for quest/item vendors made me perpetually aware that I was playing a game with very simple and obvious mechanics. What makes the 90s cRPGs legendary is their success at transcending their medium and giving you a personal experience in a rich, complex, fantasy world...which is why Shadowrun's relative game-y-ness and shallowness in every RPG aspect was such a disappointment. There are some for whom mechanics alone define an experience (looking at you: Icewind Dale players) and if you're such a person, you may very well find something to love in Shadowrun. If, however, you crave immersion, an engaging world and endearing characters, just play through the old classics again.			"

												Setting is a really strong point for Dragonfall as well as graphic and music is. Dialogues are well written and engaging. Companions likeable, especially Dietrich. The biggest flaw is linearity, the hub design, which Harebrainded Schemes had tried to hide under a few tricks, like having a choice in which order to take most missions, or having an ingame internet forum from which the player may get a feeling of being a part of a bigger world. The missions are fun, often having contradicting objectives, and a few ways of doing them. Some of them are outsanding like the Lodge mission when the player  is assigned to the team consisting entirely of strangers, with whom he must cooperate, even if the squad looks like it is going to fall apart any minute. Combat is fun, but playing on very hard is advised to make it enyojable.

												Overall a fantastic game which I enjoyed more than the other turn-based RPGs I've played recently. Extremely well-written story, which was deeper and more nuanced than I was expecting. Characters are well fleshed out and you grow to care about them. The atmosphere is quite melancholy but there are some light-hearted moments. The political points the game tries to make are presented very well, without ever getting to be too preachy. This is important if you feel like I do about many other games where you're coerced into the most conservative way of thinking in order to succeed.If I had a complaint or two they would be that the game is quite linear, and also quite short. Since there isn't enough XP points to utilise, it doesn't actually feel like you ever really get to be very GOOD at shadowrunning, seeing as every mission inevitably winds up in a shoot-out. A bit of irony there. There are barely enough 'Karma points' to master even a couple of skill trees for the character you're building. For example, I barely made it past around 60% on three skill areas, and ONLY three. But also I do regret playing as a Shaman - even with decent enough conjuring control the spirit always gets away, or worse starts attacking you. It was a risk not really worth taking in most scenarios. I even failed a mission because the spirit was killed - surely an avoidable bug!But anyway, I've played a lot of RPGs and this one can hold its own against the best of them, in my opinion. If you want endless battles however, it might not be for you...			"

												A solid story and interesting setting that are marred by the game's execution. The actual strategy mechanics are extremely basic and slow, the UI is sluggish and glitchy, and the engine has some significant problems. Graphics and animations tend to not be important (see: Avernum) but they have the same stupifying effect that they did in Wasteland 2. It's like playing with Lego men. The UI's problems really manifest in the boring virtual reality/rigging sections, where buttons, skills, and movements frequently freeze the game and require bizarre input sequences to fix. The combat rebalance mod takes some of frustration and monotony out of the system but a Shadowrun game shouldn't need a day 1 overhaul mod like a Bethesda game. I enjoyed the story enough that I wanted to play the fan campaigns and main story again, but trying to restart the game with the terrible beginning characters was too droll to tolerate. The skills require heavy point investment to become useful so the builds lack variety. At some point you get three instead of two action points which makes combat less tedious. The downside is that the AI never gets this bonus and the combat sequences become too simple. Instead of making smarter opponents the game just throws waves of them at you.For the price I paid for this on sale ($1.27?) it was a good game, but the dev studio has a lot of work to do if they want to cultivate a fanbase with this new series. This is the director's update of an improved expansion to the first game, which means I have no desire to play the original reboot and am avoiding the next installment (Hong Kong). People comparing this to strategy games like X-Com or Jagged Alliance in their reviews are really overselling it.			"

												Although I haven't finished this, I am far enough into it (16 hours) to be quite comfortable giving this an easy thumbs up.I really haven't played an isometric RPG since Fallout 2, well, not that there's a wide range of them out there. But that's a rather difficult act to follow. On the whole the combat is actually quite similar, though this does not have Fallout's body targeting system. That's honestly not a particularly big loss. I do think the combat could use a slightly better tutorial for newcomers, but in a few fights one gets the hang of it all the same. The AI is not overly punishing to you on normal. The game does have combat difficulty levels that allow you to twek your experience as you see fit.Overall the story is quite good, and very well written for a video game, and I think is the biggest draw here. A RPG without a good story is just an immense slog. It's unusual to play a RPG that is neither a Japanese or American game and as such brings in a few different influences and ideas. I have to say, combining high fantasy stuff like elves and orcs and dragons with cyberpunk dystopia, it really doesn't add anything to the game world for me at all. At first I found it very hard to get my head around putting them together, or why one would do this. But it's also not enough to detract from what is an excellent story full of characters that have that video game just-enough-depth to be interesting. I enjoy how this is a game full of grey choices, where things are very rarely black and white. You will often not really be sure if you're helping the good guys or not, and really have to rely on your own feelings (or, if you like, your own persuit of money) to guide you.The game has mod support through Steam Workshop including some fully functioning custom campaigns, and the game comes with an editor. I have not played any of these yet nor have I fiddled with the editor itself, but this is a clear bonus for those that really enjoy the game and want more.On the whole I'm very comfortable calling this an excellent, and somewhat underplayed RPG title, that is far superior to certain larger franchises' offerings.

												This game is pretty good story wise and content wise my first playthrough shows 47 hours logged on steam, take some 2 or 3 hours with pauses here and there.Balance wise the various classes are still largely unbalanced, magical classes seem to still be the worse and not very advisable as all you need from them is mostly buffs. However unlike shadowrun returns there are a few more options making weapons other than rifles viable even if not as good.Combat is ok as it was before, but the AI is pretty dreadful. Harder difficulty doesn't means that the enemy plays better, it merely gives them better hit chances, in fact even full cover and high quickness and dodge mean nothing as they still hit almost every single shot from a mile away, They probably also have more hitpoints or more armor to make them tougher and they seem to have a nearly unlimited amount of grenades to throw at you, they also crit a lot. Meaning, difficulty is very artifically generated. The ideal process was that the easier you set the game the more limited the abillity for the AI to plan ahead. Instead they took the lazy way as most developers do and just increase damage and toughness.Overall I give it a 7 out of 10 and that's only because the story is really good. It's definitely worth the money on a good sale like the 80% I got on it. Definitely not worth it at it's full price so take my recomendation with that small caveat.			"

For example, using katana (chi focus) + stride + haste and shurikens, sniper & pistols, rifle with full auto & shotgun, melee tank, spellcasting, support character ...

												There have been quite a few attempts at Shadowrun incarnations throughout the years and some of them (remember that Xbox 360, online-only first person shooter?) have failed pretty spectacularly. For those who still fondly remember the days of Jake Armitage running the shadows of Seattle on the SNES, “Shadowrun: Dragonfall” is easily the definitive Shadowrun experience currently available. While I enjoyed the overall noir style and the retelling of the “Universal Brotherhood” pen-and-paper adventure from the first game, “Dragonfall” really ups the ante in just about every way. The NPCs, locations and team members are all significantly more memorable and interesting, with the differing personalities of your four main companions particularly shining through. Much more so than the Seamstresses Union from the original “Shadowrun Returns,” the Kreuzbasar feels like a living home base you'll actually care about. Over time while interacting with the area's characters you'll start to feel like there's an actual purpose to your various missions beyond just monetary gain and self-preservation. The Director's Cut version is definitely the way to go, re-arranging the combat display, adding in new animations, popping in a few more side-quests for your companions, and finally giving the ability to control how your team mate's abilities advance over time. The toolset being readily available for fans to make their own adventures also means there's loads more content to explore beyond just the main storyline. Harebrained Schemes knocked it out of the park with this one, and hopefully one day they'll manage to grab up some of those other FASA roleplaying games that have gone defunct, like the criminally underrepresented Earthdawn.

												Game is good, but I just can't help but feel a little disappointed with how rough it is.  Combat and movement could use a lot of polish. The writing is quite good, but I found myself getting bored trying to wade through playing the game so I could see more of the story. I could really rate either way, but in the end I didn't finish the game before it got old, so I will go thumbs down. I would say your money would be better off invested in a different game.			"

												AS it is now, this game gets unplayable after some time, i am doing bloodline mission now, and i am having battle freeze bug almost every fight. It became so frustrating, that i do not enjoy playing it anymore, despite the fact that the story is decent  and i would like to know the ending, but for now, it is impossible for me to end even this quest. Such a shame, giving the fact that this bug was reported long ago, and it is still there. Otherwise it could be a good game, but since i am unable to finish it, i can;t judge it favourably.			"

												I liked most of this game. But frankly, much like Shadowrun: returns it becomes progressively more of a slog. The point of playing against a computer in a turn based game is not to have to suffer through their ♥♥♥♥ing turns. I don't care where they ♥♥♥♥ing move. Their animations are stupid. Stupid. Too much of this game focuses on stuff that is entirely irrelevant and unwelcome. For instance - tactics. You might think if you know a room is full of enemies that you could suprise them. Nope. Never happens. You can't even position your team to defend yourselves. And don't get me started on traversing large areas in the tedious combat mode. Go here. Then go here. Then walk towards the same objective you've been walking towards once more. Other games have solved this♥♥♥♥♥♥ Civilisation doesn't have this damn problem.I still haven't finished it -because I'm so sick of the ♥♥♥♥ing slog. It used to be fun. I remember the missions when it was fun. But this is a problem with too many games. Too many ♥♥♥♥ing games get positive reviews from people playing the first 75% only for the game to fall apart after that. And you know what? No one changes those damn reviews. ♥♥♥♥ this game. ♥♥♥♥ this game so hard. They've poisoned the bits that were fun.			"

												I'd probably give it a neutral if I could.The way people have overhyped this is kind of ridiculous though, I mean anyone with half a brain could of come up with the story so I'm really not sure why people think it's such a great story? It's pretty simple and hardly exciting. I'm a fan of turn-based combat so I'm not against the combat in the slightest and that's what really made me carry on playing.I'm at the last mission and to be honest it feels kind of short, and I wasn't even really playing the game for long periods of time either. Small city, not many upgrades, other crew members are pointless when the team you're given from the start are good enough.Graphics (7/10) Cyberpunk theme which is cool enough.Story (5/10): You have to be rather simple minded to actually believe that this was a well thought out story.Gameplay (8/10): Best part of the game, and that's the turn-based combat... XCOM comes to mind.Overall (6/10): Don't be mad!Looking forward to Hong Kong none the less. "

It is also addictive, game calls you to come back and finnish it. Only thing that i really didnt like is that the game is linear. The developers gave options on some side quests, but the game is still very linear. You cant go to other locations if you need/want, only when you go on mission on that location. But there are also good aspects of a game, and those are more, and I can recommend this game for turn based isometric strategies funs.			"

												One awesome and superb game!Better than previous game in almost every aspect.Great and intriguing story. Atmosphere is great and a real ""Shadowrun"" experience.Your companions have their own stories to tell (and it matters how you behave with them) and they can level up.Turn based battles are fun.Every mission can be completed in different ways.Depending on skills you develop, you can solve problems in different ways.Dialogues are way better, with multiple choices (including etiquettes and skills as dialogue options).Moral choices are not always black and white, and can sometimes have smaller impacts later.More weapons, equipments, cyber upgrades, spells...Decking is fun.Dante is one great dog.There is a DRAGON in this game (duh!).The only thing I didn't like are occasional bugs that often require loading save game files.Overall, for the fans of good old turn-based story-driven RPG experience, this is a game they should not miss! Probably one of the better games in the last few years.Really looking forward to sequel! :)			"

												I have mixed feelings about Dragonfall. I give it thumbs-up not because it's very good, but because it's not actually bad.  Percentage-wise I'd give it 65%.It's decent in all ways, but it's too simple in design. The story is good and well told, though often too verbose.The RPG element is limited in that often no matter which speech interactions you choose ultimately lead to the same conclusion.  There are some instances where an NPC dies or not depending on your tactic, but they were not relevant.Tactically the battles feel rather ackward because you're often not sure if you're in proper cover.  Visually even in cover your characters look like they're beside it or not close enough.  I'm a big fan of 3rd person turn based tactical (grid) shooters, and this is combat-wise the worst I've played.  The original X-COM had a better feel/execution, really.The game is also very linear.  You may choose which fetch quest you do first, but you are funneled  down a very obvious path always.The new Shadowrun series does nothing better than any other game (except be a Shadowrun universe), and does most things just under average (except the story which is just over average).The biggest issue of all though... It's too simple.  The story is somewhat complex, but the design, fighting, roplaying aspect, tactics and characters feel like they stepped out of SNES/1996 design.  It's a good game for 12 yo. even though it has adult themes.Is the journey/time invested worth the story?  Unfortunately not in my opinion.  "

												When magic, man, and machine combine, you get: That's right! An Irreverend Opinions look into Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut.---The BlurbIt is the dark future of the post-awakened world.  Magic is now a thing people have to not only accept, but deal with - along with multinational corporations taking over everything, and the collapse of the usual political scene.  In the midst of all of this, the anarchist free state of Berlin comes under an extreme threat after a run into a rich manor goes horribly wrong.  Turn-based tactical shooter RPG where choices do really impact the story.The GoodAn interface to die for.  Everything is pretty much self-explanatory, from moving to swapping weapons in mid combat, to how skills are increased.  The layout is just as easily interpreted, allowing players to make easy decisions to what they would like to do in order to achieve their goal.Multiple paths to achieve the goal, allowing for versatile approaches to the same target objectives - from bullying others and blowing enemies away, to sneaking by in a clandestine fashion, to simply convincing your enemies that you're actually meant to be there.Having improved on Shadowrun: Returns, the team has now managed to expand even further on their storytelling skills, and the plot not only differentiates depending on decisions you make, but how you make them.  NPCs and companions can have permanent repercussions as a result of this.The lore of the game world is also just as rich, with plenty of details about what has occurred throughout the new history, which also lends to the storytelling as it can change how certain decisions might be made.As eminently moddable as it's predecessor, Shadowrun: Dragonfall comes with the ability to not only craft your own modules for the improvement of the game, but it is also an extremely simple matter to be able to get access to community-released content through the Workshop.Graphics are fun and evocative, with a 'paperback detective novel' feel.  The world is highly detailed, giving flavor to the encounters and a distinct impression of what the characters have had to learn to endure.A slew of personal customization options exist, allowing for more unique characters than most games.  Further options (dress style, weapons, etc) can be picked up as the game progresses.The AI has been greatly improved, both in terms of companion decisions and enemy actions, leading to a much more intricate puzzle to unlock.Increasing the difficulty does not just increase enemy hitpoints, but can change up the type of encounters, the size of them, and what is expected for a 'success'.The BadDragonfall's sound and music quality is a little underwhelming, though hardly a priority as the game can easily be played with your personal music player of choice in the background.  The game's sound effects are harder to replace, but are workable without breaking immersion.Character companions can sometimes be poorly equipped (Looking at you, Blitz) with lackluster performance thanks to terrible skill and stat priorities.  While this can be somewhat corrected by improving their gear, the split for the player's character is either ""full support"" or ""ignore the rest of the team and be superman"".The system's method of handling decking means that players will have to handle two maps separately.  Unfortunately, that's just a flaw in the basic game system (Shadowrun ruleset), and not something that can be easily fixed.The UglyGame will sometimes crash out, or freeze, needing a game restart to fix.Likewise, on occasions decker characters (the game's term for 'hackers') will be unable to interact with anything while in the net, making the game then require a restart to fix - unless it happens again and again.  A short workaround for this involves opening the character's personal sheet and closing it again, though this does not work for every player.SuggestionsSome small work can be done on the bugs, but otherwise a very well-polished game.Sound quality could be improved, but is hardly essential.The Summary10/10, would play again.  And have.  Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a must-have for fans of sci-fi, roleplaying games, and tactical shooters.  Looking forward to the proposed release of Shadowrun: Hong Kong.---If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												A promising idea that stumbled through its execution.Pros:- Shadowrun environment is rich with morally ambiguous decision-making and touch decisions and this game forces you to make some tough calls.- There are lots of options for different player specs in dialogue.- For being an independent studio the dialog text is reasonable.- Hard difficulty was pretty punishing.Cons:- The battling system is beyond frustrating. Several rounds per battle I'd have a clear advantage over the adversaries and spend the entire round missing even though everyone had 78% chance to hit. The probability of that happening once per playthorugh--let alone once per battle--is completely unforgiveable. Sometimes the battle breaks itself and the game sits there doing nothing for 15 minutes before restoring control to my characters.- Decking is not very in-depth and was clearly a distraction for the developers.- Auto-saves feature a ""rewind time"" option which is amazing except it only saves on transitions meaning you have to replay the entire level if something goes bad at the end.- The game gives you the impression that it's almost over when really you have another 6 hours to go in a single mission, then at the end throws a bunch of revealing facts that you have to make snap judgements about with very few  options that 'let me think about this and talk to my crew' .I would not recommend this to anyone other than the hardcore iometric, read-only, turn-based strategy gamer. The relaince on battles coupled with a frustrating battle system doesn't justify the story or the setting.			"

												A huge improvement over the first game (which I still enjoyed immensely). The choices have more weight to them and NPCs feel alive with the dialog presented. I loved the story and quests in the base campaign and you always have that feeling of wondering what's going to happen next. Being able to customize your skills how you see fit was wonderful, and allows you to make your own kind of character. The ability to easily create your own campaign with the editor is pretty neat, and adds for more to do once you finish the main game. The UI for menus can be annoying at times, and it is clear that it was designed for a mobile platform. During battles the UI is never a problem though and was easy to use. The only things that bothered me was the shoehorning of homosexual relationships (it was fine for one of the main story lines, but is it really necessary to have multiple characters reveal their sexuality when it has nothing to do with the story?) and how human ""racists"" were horrible and evil  and you couldn't choose to side with them if even if you wanted to  no matter what whilst some metahumans were actively prejudice to the humans and no one batted an eye. The prujudice metahumans were presented much less crazed, of course. I guess it's something to expect from a developer in Seattle, so I can forgive it since the game overall was very good.Shadowrun: Dragonfall is definitely worth the money and will keep you busy for a decent amount of time if you do all the side missions. Buy it if you like rpgs with good story and dialogue.			"

												Awesome Game!Relatively short (30 hours for a single play through) but is filled with incredible detail that makes you want to replay it again.  The story is highly involved, so if you miss the days of reading text and using clues to solve problems then this is the game for you!  If you want to play a game where the developers solved all the problems for you, then I suggest you look elsewhere.Winning on hard modes requires strategic planning of your character, your team, and how you deploy the troops during battle.Essentially, this game makes you think.  And that is something I have been missing from the RPGs that have been coming out lately.			"

												If you like RPGs with lots of dialogue but want a change of combat from the usual fps, this is for you. On the flip side, if you like isometric tactics games but want a story with more substance, this is also the game for you. The restrictions placed on customizing your teammates is actually downright disappointing. But it DOES make the game very easy to get into. Less mess, Less fuss. The dialogue in this game is also overall very nicely written. This game gets a Scone out of 10. I'm eating a scone right now.P.S. GLORY <3			"

												Highly recommended to Shadowrun fans and those who enjoy turn-based tactical shootouts.The original Dragonfall DLC already fixed many issues with Shadowrun Returns, this standalone version clears up most of what remained and provides an experience that may not be 100% tabletop-authentic in its rules but definitely gets the feel of Shadowrun right.

												Its XCOM with a much better setting, story, and characters. Actual well written dialogue! The setting is great, especially if you are a fan of William Gibson novels / Neuromancer . Make sure to skip normal mode and go straight to hard on your first playthrough, its meant to be moderately challenging. There are also a ton of user created campaigns, so there's a lot of value for your $ here. There is even a Neuromancer campaign in the works, and a remake of the Sega classic. Highly recommended!

												Don't read this and think that this is a terrible game. It's not. It does have a sort of niche appeal, but it's not bad by any means. However, it certainly does NOT deserve the ""overwhelmingly positive"" score. It should be very positive at best, mixed at worst.There are three major problems I have with this game. 1:  The frustrating glitches. There is a late section of the game which represents one of the best designed tower defense sections I've ever come across, where you are protecting the AI, APEX. Or at least it would be well designed if it weren't for the fact that it contained no less than two run ending glitches. First, if you try to save during the later stages, it will immediately crash and the save will fail, forcing you to start over. Secondly, when you ""die"" in the matrix, you are expelled and take damage to your physical body. However, in this mission, you are accompanied by an AI that has no physical body, so, if they die, the game will get confused and just...stop, so you have to restart from the last save. If you think this isn't too bad, then listen to this: I had to restart this section no less than NINE TIMES because of these bugs. 2: The music. God help me the music. It is undenyably good, but it loops. And it loops. And it loops. When I got through the first few chords of the hub town music, I realised that the sound design was pretty good, but lord above was it going to grate after a few minutes of it endlessly repeating. I have never been so right, and you will end up spending several hours in the hub town, stuck either with this never-ending music loop or cold silence as you mute it.3: The story should have been good. It really should. The setting is imaginative, and the characters often threaten to become interesting. BUT. It is sooooooo badly told that it doesn't even matter. Everything, from the opening of doors to standard dialogue  to the deaths of major characters, is communicated in massive text walls. Of the time I spent playing this, I would guess that at least a third of it was spent reading over-long, irritating blocks of text while the bloody music loops in the background. I don't have a problem with reading. Communicating in nothing but written words is fine. But keep it short and snappy, a sentence or two per text box. Not an entire chapter with every dialogue, though this is rather ironic coming from my mouth, seeing the length this review is turning out to be.As I said, this is by no means a bad game. It is a game with many brilliant ideas, with a fascinating setting that, despite trying its hardest to make dragons boring, makes me interested in the ploys and backstories of the characters. I like how the choices you make can sometimes make some sections easier later on, or come back to bite you in the backside. One nitpick here is that some missions are locked off if you annoy a certain company, which struck me as rather stupid, but it doesn't really affect the game all that much, so I won't dwell on it.  The combat is akin to that of XCOM, and is certainly more expansive than that in XCOM EU, but, for reasons I can't quite put my finger on, it doesn't quite feel as polished. The game also drags on for a little too long in my personal opinion, and combat isn't particularly balanced. Pistols and SMGs are basically just inferior versions of the assault rifle, magic missiles and throwing weapons are just trash, so there is literally no reason to use them. This makes the characters that default to pistols, SMGs or throwing weapons straight up inferior to those who use shotguns or rifles. Also, decking isn't particularly well tutorialised, or tutorialised at all, but I'll let it slide because there is literally only one point in the game when you are forced to use it, as mentioned above.The game includes some brilliant puzzles and complex moral choices, characters you sympathise with and characters you want to punch in the face, an original (if somewhat predictable) storyline and setting and meaningful RPG elements. If you belong to the niche crowd that thinks this excuses the innumerable flaws with the game, then go ahead and check it out. Just remember to mute the bloody hub town music or it will soon be stuck in your head for the rest of the week, no matter how much you want to pry out the memories of it with a fish slicer, Otherwise, spend your money on more polished games like XCOM or Mass Effect, which both seem to have inspired this game to a certain degree, and accomplish much the same things much better, though with less style and originality.

												★★☆☆☆With proper graphics, and cinematic storytelling, this could be the greatest game.  Without them, its a cheap knockoff of XCOM combat, interrupted by walls of text.  Kickstarter raised nearly 2million dollars to fund this, no excuse for it to be lower quality than a 20 year old PS1 game.  + Interesting Lore+ Dialogue choices+- Quicksaving, not so quick loading+- XCOM style combat.  No cinematic cameras, clunkier controls, buggy cover, and several other problems drag it down.  +- While the ""Karma"" system provides a deep and fully customizable character sheet, the way its presented is unintuitive.  - Weak graphics- RNG based combat- Weird healing system- Can't rotate the camera- Decker seems the most viable class- Very few options, no options for controls- Interaction points disappear, unless you hold Alt- Story is told via walls of text, with no animation whatsoever- Talking to NPCs takes 2 clicks, the first one only walks to them			"

												I'd love to review this game positively but despite being a graphically unintensive and comparably primitive title, the application fails to load on my Core i5/ 16 GB RAM/ 780m iMac -- a machine with literally ten times the hardware required.A badly coded piece of trashware. I'd recommend buying it for the iPad instead but since they don't seem to care about their Mac users...just skip this mess.Definitely AVOID.2/10.  And only because it didn't damage my OS install.**Addition**I find it amusing and suspicious that some posters have downvoted my harsh review anonymously.  What kind of score should I have given the a game that will not run on my system?  Should I be happy to simply buy a Steam thumbnail?  The game was offered on Steam for Mac and it's a comparatively primitive game compared to most triple A titles.  If the developers weren't prepared to make a game that would run effectively on a platform...don't offer it.  I wouldn't be surprised if some of the downvotes were smurfed/issued by the game developer themselves or some irrational fanboys.			"

												The gameplay itself is quite good and that's enough for some people, but the game's storyline is very bleak and depressing. This is coming from someone who has played and beaten Fallout 1, Fallout 2, Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, Wasteland 2, and other ""depressing"" games, but unlike those games the depressing part isn't the atmosphere or looks, it's the fact that in Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut, there is no redeeming quality to the ending. This may not seem like a big problem at first, but despite everything you and the character you have made have been through during the course of the game, the ending will make it seem like all of the effort you have put into getting this far was useless. I have no problem with the combat system or the way the stats work or any of those things, what I don't like is the crushingly depressing story and the way it seems like something good might come at the end and it never does. I've played through this game two times and have tried to enjoy this game despite that, but the awful bleakness in this game is more then I can bear and more then I've felt in any other game. Normally I love games like this but this one I give 3 out of 10.			"

												I really want to like this game, but I don't. It has good elements to it: isometric, cyberpunk, and it's AP turnbased. I even kinda like the magic using in a cyberpunk setting. What holds me back from liking this game is the story. I just don't buy it. While I wouldn't call the writing bad by any means there's just something about it I find distasteful. Also I hate the fantasy races. Elves, Dwarves, Trolls, and the social hierarchy of the fantasy races. Something about it really turns me off.I can't say it's a bad game though. In all regards I -should- like it.			"

												I tried so hard to play to play this game. It just doesn't personally hold up to my standards, which are right around where Pillars of Eternity and Divinity Original Sin are. This game is unfortunately just so very bland. The animations from just about every ability, whether it be magic, or a gun, or a sword, all don't carry hardly any weight to them. They are bland looking as well. Most of them look the same with a different sound effect or slightly different color.The music in this game is the only high point. The music is oh-so-good. Not much more to say about it. If music is your thing, then the title screen will sell you.The battle system in and of itself is boring, even on higher difficulties. Not much strategy involved when there is little room/time to even get proper positioning before a battle starts. I understand this doesn't have to be the case every single time, but in this game, it is the case just about every single time. This may as well be a cover shooter with not-enough-depth in the form of an Isometric RPG.Story may have ended well but for the halfway or so through the game I believe I was, it was not sold for me. I was so...so bored.. I was going to give Hong Kong a try next, but that will unfortunately never happen. I'm disappointed.			"

												this is a great game but it's no where near as good as the sega genesis ""shadowrun""not even close.i dont normally like the turn-based games. i find them boring and dull. this game is still pretty fun regardless.somehow they manage to pull it off good enough to where it still feels somewhat like the old shadowrun, but not alot.the scenery looks like shadowrun should. it looks very cyber-punkish.the graphics are great, at least i enjoy them.the game play is good though i wish it was more like the older shadowrun games and not turn based.one thing i will note about the gameplay is it's a set story, as of yet anyhow. you don't talk to and do side missions for the mr johnsons, like in the older games. you are pretty much on a set path and that path is all there is, you find cheap little missions that are on the path and so far lead you in the same direction you are already going.don't get me wrong, i do like this game a lot and still recommend it. i just really wish they would make another sega genesis style shadowrun game....or even remake that one.my overall game rating 8 of 10NOTE: all shadowrun games basically get the same review as they are the same...if they revert back to being better, like the sega genesis original, they will receive better reviews			"

												Don't listen to the bad reviews of this game, it's simply amazing.  I have far more than 8 hours on record, because I play offline frequently.  I loved the characters, the story, the combat, and of course the great Shadowrun theme.  I don't doubt that some people have game freezes, but I have not, and I'm playing on a laptop with Intel graphics running Windows 7.  Have not finished the game yet, but I'm getting close to the end I think.  If you want a good Cyberpunk game, and have already played all the good Deus Ex games, it's hard to go wrong here.  I always loved the Shadowrun tabletop game, but could never find anyone to play, and this really scratches the itch.  10/10 from me, and I am literally baffled at the 75% ""recent"" positive ratings.  This game is WAY better than that.  If you like Cyberpunk games, and there are not that many good ones, give this a try.  Looking forward to playing Hong Kong after this.Edit - Well, I finally got bit by the combat freeze.  Spent three tries and about 2.5 hours trying to beat Apex Rising, and rifht after I finally beat it...  Freeze.  Eff.  That.  Crap.  I love this game, but that's just too much for me, especially since I've read the save freeze problem happens again after this mission.  I'm lowering my rating to 7/10 and not even finishing it since it looks like I may not even be able to.  I'll just watch a let's play.  It's really sad they didn't fix this since so many reported it already.  Can't recommend it now since it seems like so many people have had their time wasted with something the devs should have fixed by now.  Not playing Hong Kong, or any other game from these guys now.

												Pretty fun game. Try to do the side quests and discuss a lot with side characters as just pushing the main story will get you through the game too quick without perspective.Tactical combat is fun but not very challenging IMO. You get nice support abilities but I found it was sufficient to load everyone with heavy guns and mow down the opposition. Well I figure very hard might change this up, but at the core, this is a roleplaying game above a tactical game.I must say though it was disappointing that they shoehorned your decisions into some sort of canon ending by the books and in the end there are just 2 endings: Everything goes to hell or shoehorned canon. (Despite there being 5 or 6 possible outcomes of just the final mission, it changes nothing)			"

												Worse than the first part. Being german the texts are really ridiculous. They are mixing in german words within the english text all the time and it sounds like they've been taking notes from street signs. Really horrible. Wouldn't be that bad if there was an actuall german translation like in the first part. But Harebrained Schemes only had enough money left for a useless language menu where you can only choose english and of course a 5 star trip to Berlin for authenticity reasons.My english is pretty good but common. Harebrained Schemes, would you guys like playing a game like this in say Japanese  or French or whatever?Didn't play long yet, but it seems they didn't really improve the engine or fix more than a couple of bugs. Graphics are still hilarious, ""Berlin"" looks like a house in Sims. The music says ""turn me off"" after about 5 seconds. The flashy concept art may catch some kids but to me it looks unfinished, like the rest of the whole game. Not fun, don't buy.			"

												80's punk train ride!Get ready for a heavily scripted and instanced game with glass walls all around you.  The game quickly becomes a screen clicking game in between the scripted combat scenes.  If you can only click on people/items, etc that affect the story, then why make holding ""alt"" the way to show the options.  Just make them always on since it's the only thing you can do.The story may be interesting, but when the only option is to click on the 1 person in the entire club you're alowed to talk to, it doesn't feel very immersive or compelling.  You can only move from one small scene to the next with clearly defined boundaries of who you can talk to and where you can go.  And come on, it's not like there's voice acting, so it would only take a few lines of text for a random npc to add atmosphere instead of only giving conversation options to people who can advance the story.

But DLC can't be reviewed on Steam so I do it for this version.It's a great RPG even if a bit short. Its writing is great and among the best for CRPG, and it has great choices and consequences. Some choices and consequences offered to player are very interesting, it's close in quality to some of the best choices in Mask of the Betrayer. That's choices that make the player think and wonder about interesting subjects. The companions are well developed and they have a real personality, some are or can be quite attaching.The combats are very good, each are carefully tuned and designed, this make them diversified and with a good difficulty. The class system is mainly skills based, it's solid design coming from the original IP Shadowrun PnP RPG. There's a good diversity of builds, and it's an interesting mix of close combat, long range guns, cyber, and magic, the whole is fairly well balanced and quite interesting.It's not a world based RPG, but it uses a large hub evolving along the game progression, and with missions well designed with a good non linearity and size. If you put care in the end details, it's a multi layer end showing some effects of some key decisions, it's very interesting.Overall, it's so good that it already feels like an instant classic. I warmly advise it and to a large category of players.			"

												The space selection for where you want to move is, at times, cut off and really touchy because of very poorly placed detection. That's not the worst of it by a long shot. 1 hour in an the UI BREAKS. I can rarely click on what i need to and stops showing me exactly where i clicked. Even when I clicked, at times, no one would move. LOL that's so bad. I got this game for free but don't pay more than $3 for this. It'll break after an hour.It's been a year and the game still has this problem.More like Shadowrun Away: Dragonfail			"

												If you enjoyed Shadowrun Returns for the combat, you'll probably like this fine.  If you enjoyed it for the story, as I did, I can't imagine you'd like Dragonfall much.Compared to Shadowrun Returns, this game is pretty disappointing.  The story, which was the highlight of the previous game, is dull.  Almost every NPC you meet is hostile and diskish, or smug and pointlessly criptic.  There are walls of text that reveal little of interest about the story or the setting.  The game also has that Mario Kart feel where it is always trolling you.  Enemies have rediculously high dodge ratings, making combat a frustrating chore.  Enemies use AoE attacks, especially those that stun you, a lot.  The game also constantly gives you choices, but whatever you pick, the outcome is the same, making you feel like your engagment and interaction with the story is pointless and you may as well just click through without reading, since the game ignores your responses.  It's not necessarily bad, but it's boring, and it's irritating more often than it is fun.			"

Great world, great characters, but only offers the illusion of choice. Finished the game unsatisfied.			"

												Its my first Shadowrun and my Last.I love TES, Fallout, Deus Ex, Xcom and Mass effect so I think I can say I am acquainted with RPGs and Round based Strategy.This however entirely disappointed me.No Voice Acting, the reading gets tiring really quickly.You are forced to play the playstyle your Race gives you as each Race has different Caps for Attributes, Humans being the worst with having no high Attributes at allIts a Round Based Strategy Game so why bother putting ""Karma"" in Social Skills to avoid Combat when you can solve anything with Physical Force.Its not like they dont deserve it. Every single Person in this game is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.The Writing is some of the worst I have ever Seen.The Story is heavily scripted and Side Missions can barely be altered. Dont buy this game, expecting any Freedom of Action. One particular Mission has you go either Silent or loud. Silent is a straight Line of Action, no diversity allowed. Aswell as the Outcome of the Mission being a scripted ""♥♥♥♥up"".How does the Charity Man, who's ""Eyes widen in surprise"", when you donate 500$ to reach the Final Charity Goal, pay you 22K$? You would imagine he'd use this insane amount for Charity, given his Occupation. Especially when right before your character can say ""50K? Do you know what you can buy with that kind of money?"". I dont think the Developers knew what they were doing here. Half of the Money you earn goes directly into the ""50K Pool"" but any money you earn after having reached that 50K still goes into the Pool, resulting in loosing half the Cash a Job Pays.Some People have some really bad Memory Issues, forgetting who you are and repeating the same Dialogue, or even forgetting who you are and blocking previously done alternate Dialogue Line.Half of the Promotional Screenshots arent in the game. Either that or I missed Quests.The Second Screenshot shows the boss being killed, thats how little they care about the game.If this is the Devs ""Biggest Game so far"" they successfully scared me away from the Franchise.At least ONE thing they did rightThis is one of the Worst Games I played that calls itself a ""Videogame"".In a way it is so bad, its almost amusing.Every Single Ending is bad, some making no Sense at all. You might aswell just play mods and dont play the 4 Story Missions which are boring and tedious anyway.And on a Side Note.As a German I just hate the use of Occasional German Words because das ist just stupid. Imagine Jemand talks Zwei Languages auf einmal. That just sounds Dumm and Nutzlos.Ist that wie someone reden sollte?If they want it to take place in Germany then have them talk German with English in Brackets.On a Positive side, you can play Jack from Mass Effect 2 and fight Feral GhoulsNow excuse me while I play high Quality RPGs			"

												There I was, wondering when I will ever play a decent round based tactical rpg again...turns out, I just was looking in the wrong corner. Shadowrun: Dragonfall, has complex and well written characters, lots of optional quests, deicions, decisions, decisions, you great a character like you should in a role playing game...to sum it up, it brought me back to play this genre again, and I'm sure you will enjoy it too.

												I'm surprised at all the really positive reviews for this game. As someone who really likes turn based RPGs, I thought this game would be great.I can't remember being so disappointed in a game recently, everything is so poorly done. First big drawback - no manual. There is some poorly written in game help, but that's no substitute for a manual. I have no experience with the Shadowrun universe, perhaps if I had the concepts would have made more sense to me.Probably the biggest issue for me is the graphics. Usually I don't care about graphics if the gameplay makes up for them. Here the gameplay is lacking and the graphics are really poor. Everything looks cartoonish and too small. The interface is terrible - they should have at least had tooltips given the lack of documentation.			"

												Uninteresting and unlikeable characters who have silly conversations no one would ever have.  Many conversation options are just the illusion of choice, with only 1 option disguised as 3 or 4 differenly worded selections.  Some areas are better than others.  Too often though one moral choice is railroaded down the player's throat with no consideration given to other reasonable and valid means of resolving an encounter.  It is especially grating when it happens in a simple dialog encounter which would only require a few more lines of text and no additional gameplay.Finally the old selection and movement bug from the previous game returns which requires a complete exit from the game and restart.

												This game very much reminds me of the original Mass Effect game: incredible writing, amazing background and setting, good character design and development, but absolutely garbage when it comes to combat or inventory management.I want to keep playing because I'm very invested in the story and roleplay, but the awful combat makes it very difficult to keep pushing on. To go into detail, it's as if tabletop/D&D and XCOM had a disgusting baby, so they hid it ina basement its whole life to et rid of it, and then 15 years later someone finds it and brings it out to the light. It's archaic, finicky, and difficult to navigate giving the interesting menuing and locked orthogonal camera view. I'm not a rookie to either of these combat styles: I've played tabletop D&D for a while, I've the original Fallout under my belt, I've played through StarWars KotOR, I've hundreds of hours in XCOM and XCOM2, and I've spent a long while playing Pillars of Eternity. This game's combat essentially takes all of that, and then puts it together in the worst way possible, making a disgusting abomination featuring a nonsensical cover system and a Line of Sight mechanic that I still cant figure out after 10+ hours. Dawn of War 2 has a better cover system.I love what I've seen so far when it comes to the story, but I can't give this a recommendation due to how terrible the game as a whole is.			"

												Couldn't get into it. Feels like the game punishes you for it giving you too many options. I was doing the opening mission and there were no less than 4 choices in dialog that I couldn't access, and at least two majorly affected gameplay. If you want to replay the same missions over and over with no reward for doing so, you might like it because you'll get different results. I personally don't, because the dialog isn't that great. It isn't bad, but it doesn't grab attention either, especially since it isn't voiced over. If you want a game that has a better class system and better story, I'd go for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines (you need to patch it, which is easy to do). For RTS (on Steam), I'd go for Breach & Clear: Deadline or XCOM: Enemy Unknown. This one is a combination of both and probably has more hours in it than Breach & Clear: Deadline, but it was annoying to me. For example, can't skip the ""cutscenes."" They're not horribly long, but even by the time I got through the first mission I got sick of watching guys run into a room for a few seconds, then pop up some uninteresting text dialog. I like the turn-based combat; that is not what I think is annoying. The part that's annoying is interacting with a computer, sitting there for MEH dialog, then sitting there staring at nothing for two seconds, then it pans over to some guy who doesn't even have a special animation for the event come in, take up a few more seconds, and spout some more text. I know seconds don't seem long, but wait til you're unable to move and you know boring text dialog is your only reward for waiting.And the combat isn't even good. Compare this to XCOM: Enemy Unknown (which is two years older) and this feels pretty mediocre. Because the text is so bland, you don't really get a feel for the character's personality either. At least with voice overs even if the text is MEH you can still get a feel for the characters.Call it personal opinion if you like, but to me, seeing ""wink"" in the dialog 2 or 3 times in the opening text means that literacy is not the friend of this game. Oh yeah, that's another thing. The text reads like this:--------------------------[Person doing thing or showing an emotion]Mediocre dialog here.[Possibly another thing being done or emotion being shown]--------------------------It makes it hard to read. Your eyes have to jump around to even find the dialog, which is so bad that apparently they feel the need to emote it for you. I'm all for the emotes, but not in game dialog.5/10			"

												One of the few rare games, where the STORYLINE IS BETTER THAN THE GAMEPLAY.other examples could be Portal, fallout and starcraft 1's singleplayer.now im not saying that the gameplay is bad by any means. it's good, standard turn based strategy with a few RPG elements thrown in between each level. every character has a nice selection of abilities and weapons and every level has a nice selection of useful items and props to assist you defeating the enemy. but the game's story, characters and world - are so compelling,  likable and intruiging that it completly overshadows the rest of the gameplay, and you will very quickly  play the game much less for fun as for pushing the plot forward and seeing how the characters develop.every character especially your teammates have great, belivable and complex personalities, you can talk to them, even during missions and hear their insightful comments of the situation, their dilaouges are brilliantly written. and if you will talk with them enough, you will discover secrets about them that will eneble you to do secret levels.same with NPC's even the usually ignorable shopkeepers are now bright and colorful and fun to deal with. the only good comparison i have with this is Tristram from the original diablo - everyone loves Griswald, Cain or Adria, and similar NPC's can be found here.just too bad there is no voice acting, also this game presents real moral choices. moral choices that have impact. not like skyrim that you can murder a whole village or save the world and no one will care. usually you will have to choose between doing the moral thing or earn more money, and sometimes morality is not even clear, so the game will have you to think hard.anyone who is a fan of good stories, must get this game. gameplat is also great			"

This game , although it's kinda retro is freaking awesome.....what strikes me as odd is back when it came out they had less technology and they did more with it and now they have more technology and developers seem to do less with it. This game will suck you in to the story and you will actually feel like you are a part of it. It's freaky , it's entertaining and the time just goes by quickly. I got all three for 15 bucks and I'm only on this one , very cool game.			"

												Dragonfall is easily the weakest of Harebrained Scheme's ""Shadowrun"" games.Despite its RPG pedigree, most of your time spent ""playing"" will be in combat. As it is with all the worst RPGs, it essentially feels like two games: combat, where prioritizing Health is a necessary evil and where all your companions are more useful than you; and dialogue, where you always wish you had more Charisma.Well, I say always... my second run through Dragonfall I mixed things up. I chose Elf straight-up for its Charisma advantages and based my build around that. I grabbed Willpower as a backup to make myself a sort of glass-cannon diplomancer...and in every fight, because I was the party leader, I was shot first. In fact, even in fights where I ran away, I'd invariably be prioritized and shot. Because Dragonfall is two games, both miserable.			"

												I recently consumed every other high-ranking or goty RPGs, so I decided to try on shadowrun series.Compared with other mainstream RPGs, like Wasteland2(94/100), Pillars of Eternity(97/100), Inquisition(97/100), Divinity: Original Sin(95/100), X-com(100/100), Shadowrun(75/100) is definitely a tacky, cheap version of old school RPG.I expected more like deep stories, complex/exquisite character build system, but there's no such thing. AIs are too dull, so you can just wait until they come and kill themselves. There's no explicit advantages, disadvantages, or differences between classes or weapons, so all you have to do is attacking same enemies with similar skills without any specific tactics.Considering the fact that the price is nearly 0, I don't want to be too hard on Devs. However, I don't think you should waste your time to stomach this tacky game only because it's cheap. If you have high expectation and standards for story-driven, decent build mechanism RPGs, don't waste your time on this one.			"

												This game bombards you with loads of stuff about stats and playstyles to start off the game with you having no real idea of how it's going to work. It should have introduced elements and let you pick a style of play based off what you liked. Corny fanfic-y writing and giant walls of text in a video game, when I read that fake curse word I spent a good five minutes laughing. If I wanted to read I would buy a book where the writing is actually good.  I know it seems a little harsh to judge this game on story, but a lot of it's selling points are on style and story. I'm going to think that because they hit you with a giant wall of text to start the game. The gameplay is XCOM. It's XCOM. You think you bought Shadowrun: Dragonfall. No you bought XCOM. If you loved XCOM buy it, but for people like me who can't stand the spacebar inducing writing skip it.			"

The environment feels constricted and there's no heart to it at all, just systematic boring blahblah quests and paper thin characters. The team NPCs range from bland to annoying and I didn't see any character or plot development that would make me want to continue playing.The graphics are fine but the music and sound effects are terrible and have to be muted after the first few hours.

												Look at this game makes me think we moving backwards not forward.I mean we had Fallout 2 in 1998 and Jagged Alliance 2 1999, an dFallout Tactics doest help.And comparing Shadowrun: Dragonfall to those three games? Noo..Drganofall is C rate title. Not B, not A, but C. Unfortiently like many these days.And I know I know, it suppose to be standalone add on to Shadowrun Returns. But still should have more to it? Dragonfall is very well written, has really good story. I give you that.It makes you want to follow and discover it. What happend? What else? What did he do after?And you get a lot of options to choose from. You can play like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or like  saint and everything between.But story, which is written in plain text...so yest there is A LOT of reading,  is not everything.So what else have this game when comparing to three OLD game I mentioned before?Nothing.What this game offers new? Improved? Nothing. Only story.Gameplay itself is very simplified. 1.You dont need to look for items, most of the times, since they will lit up themselves to be picked up.2.Your team follows you like mindless sheeps all the time, until combat begins. Then you can give them orders.And you can equip them before mission starts, not in mission. You cant change anything then. You cant swap items between your team , in betwen combat scenes.3. You dont have much choice. I mean not in storyline but In any action.I remember in fallout 2 i shoot somebody by accident. And I had to kill whole town. I know it sound weird but this is to show how very shallow gameplay is here.4. Weapons/armor are without any addons. Go to Jagged Aliance 2. Similar storyline but in current times.You have your weapons, you can add/make attachments, choose right ammo ..etc etc.. different types of armor, modyfi it. Million thing to do.Here you can buy a gun/spell/armor/deck, or better one, or just add improvment to your body. Thats it.5. Graphics are at most average. We have 21 century. Game is back in 20 century.6. I had around 7-8 crashes during 2 days gameplay. But I wont write it down as a con since it always can be circumstantial. Yet BF4 works fine :P7. You are not free much there. You have main location and all usual points to check out. And quest locations.There is now world to roam free to.This game feels like cheap knock off from Fallout 2 and Jagged Aliance 2, and dosent and even Fallout Tactics beats it.Simplfifed dumbe down game. Pros:- story,Cons:-simplified/dumbed down gameplay,-poor graphics,-lack of proper team managment,-small locations,-no free world to check out,""C"" class title.I dont recomend this game for more than 8 euro.

												Screw this game.  It's poorly designed garbage and here's why.1. No tutorial.  The game throws you into your first mission and suddenly there's combat, it then says ""Hey, feel free to read a bunch of text to learn how to play the game but don't worry, it'll be incomplete and less than helpful"".  It says ""you only get so many AP per round"" for insance and doesn't tell you where you can see how much AP you have or how much your different actions cost.  At one point there was a clickable thing that said I could summon an air spirit (no explanation for why I was suddenly able to do so, I just could because of reasons).  Then every round that the air elemental went it asked how much AP to give it.  ????  Is this coming from the character who summoned it?  There's a thing that says escape chance, am I spending AP to keep it enslaved?  No I guess not because the more AP I give it the more chance it has to escape.  And then it took several turns for me to realize that the reason my Shaman couldn't cast his attack spell is because it apparently costs 1 AP per round to keep the elemental going (I finally did figure out where the AP costs of things are no thanks to the game).  It was all very confusing.2. Pages and pages of poorly written dialog.  Seriously every character is super angsty and their all trying to prove how tough and edgy and badass they all are constantly.  Then again, this is like some Shadowrun groups I've played with so maybe a bit accurate.3. Confusing interface.  This goes back to 1 a bit but thanks to the near total lack of any kind of tutorial, and the help menus being less than helpful, I had no idea how to work the interface.  For example: I made a Dwarf decker because I freaking love deckers in Shadowrun.  I still haven't the slightest clue how to find out in my inventory what F***ing programs I have equipped or even own.  I bought a program from the nice program vender dwarf outside the safehouse and I saw that I had less money.  It even took me to my equipment screen at which point I clicked my deck (makes sense as the place to equip a program since the game didn't tell me otherwise).  And that was it.  I now have less money and I have no way to look and see that I have a new program.  I can't even tell if there are other programs that I have or if my deck was completely empty of programs when I talked to the girl.  That's actually the final straw that brought me here.  Very lousy game design if you ask me.In short, if you like X-com style turn based combat play X-com.  This game is a steaming pile and a waste of your money.			"

Clunky graphics, sub-par shound, a sterile world with little interactivity, etc.  In this day and age a game like this deserves maybe $2 at most.If you like Shadowrun/cyberpunk type stuff, do yourself a favor, save your money and wait for Cyberpunk 2077.  You'll find a game there themed like this, but it's graphics, story, gameplay, etc. will blow your mind.			"

												After playing it for some hours, I can safely say that this game is garbage from all points of view I can think of.Gameplay-wise, it's incredibly dry. You don't even get to decide when to initiate combat, stealth is not a thing, and there's a ridiculously limited amount of elements in a given scene with which you can interact. The combat is ok, but nothing worth praise.The story is an endless deprotagonizing railroaded trip where you're ordered around to do errands, knowing nothing of the big picture and ultimately having no power over the setting and the story, while the NPCs handle the real important stuff. Not for one second have I felt like I'm the protagonist of the story. Just an errand goon. This was sadly true of the previous chapter of this game, and things haven't improved in the slightest. I remember that the biggest moment in the previous Shadowrun, when you prepare to fight the final boss, is when the really cool NPCs come out and steal the scene. Depressing, and Dragonfall isn't any better. I gave the Shadowrun franchise a second chance and I regret it.Poorly scripted, horribly written, this is everything that was wrong about pen&paper roleplaying games from the nineties.			"

												this game sucks. I just bought it today, and there are so many glitches. The enemies disappear from my screen randomly, and you use up a turn because you can't even see the enemies. I have a top of the line ASUS republic of gamers laptop, from 2014, I'm sure it's not anything on my end. I can't pass the first mission, my characters miss the enemies most of the time. I'm playing on mornal difficulty. I've been playing RPGs for almost 30 years, don't tell me to L2P. Oh, did I make n00b mistake of choosing to play as a melee character as my first toon??? Oh WOW another RPG where the mele class SUCKS. (looking at you, path of exile)I try to use a health pak or whatever, and the game doesn't tell you why you can't. I assume it's because I'm too far away from the target? Maybe, but there is nothing on the screen that tells you how many action points you have left and how many a given action costs for health paks. I want my money back. I knew I should have bought divinity instead. I just played wasteland 2 (I played the first wasteland back in the early 90's and got to the rank of Supreme Jerk while most of you were still in diapers or not even conceived yet), and wasteland 2 is by far way better than this shadowrun game. You can't even rotate the camera in this game. It's so limited, so lame. I want my money back STEAM and please consider NOT selling any more games from this ""studio"" (I use the term loosely)-very unsatisfied customer.			"

												Long loading times plus the very crappy RNG makes it a frustrating game. Combat is sloppy and suffers from too much streamlining. There are many problems with positioning and how you initially approach combat. The ever adverse RNG stats (you will often miss every action you attempt, even if flanking or at point-blank) throws any attempt to engage tactically out the window. Feels a lot like a tablet game. Do not make the mistake to think that this can stand on it's own as a CRPG.			"

												This game is trash.Luckily I bought this game on sale, and saw it had positive reviews -- I even double-checked on metacritic, but overall this game is a HUGE dissapointment.  Don't let people trick you into the ""battles are fought XCOM style.""  The battles are few and far between, and usually only consist of a few room, where the enemies hide behind a chair or desk, while you and your team unload on them from across the way with shotguns.  The fights are a joke, the graphics are mediocre at best, the music will have you turning off your speakers.This game looks like it's straight out of 1997 and be prepared to run back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, performing the most mundane tasks.  The premise is cool (orcs, elves, trolls are real in the world, and public, a la Hellboy), until it spirals into a laughable plot about coorporate dragons trying to rule the world.  And be prepared to read ALOT .... like Stephen King alot, because there sure as hell isn't any gameplay here.I quit 66 hrs in.  I don't even care to finish this POS.			"

There's an actual mission where a supposed racist is ""saved"" and to repent for his sins...he has to move in with a bunch of racist who hate his race.  The left never sees their own hypocrisy.

												Great game for anyone who loves turn based strategy games, all the combat is turn based whilst the rest of the game is real time. They have taken the fiddling around with useless junk out of the game leaving the game with a much more enjoyable experience. No longer do you have to search every crate box etc, just the ones that are highlighted and in those are items that you actually use and when you are carrying too much there is an option to send it to your stash for keeping (which means you cant use the item until you recover it from your stash at base). This is a great feature and prevents useless trips back to areas already visited just to collect junk that you could not carry whilst you were there. Great game, took all the teadious aspects of micro management out of the game (unlinke wastelands (waste of money)) leaving you with a very enjoyable experience at a reasonable price!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------changing review to a negative as been waiting over 1 week for support to answer why the game suddenly stopped working with no the decncy of a single response from steam support.

												I'd have to call this a big step backwards. True the graphics have been improved, but the interface is much harder to use. Frequently items, spells, etc. don't show up when the mission actually starts, which leaves you short a key spell, item, etc. I was always ambivalent towards being able to build up the NPC runners, so that's also a somewhat unnecessary improvement for me. I'm switching back to using original Dragonfall or DMS since I enjoyed both of those much better than this version.			"

You have to make a chose of either equiping yourself or saving every single cred to hire a team which is outrageously expensive. To top this off, the game likes to give you weak companions (can't deal damage cause they miss and can't take damage cause of low armor and HP) and then swarm you with up to 10 enemies at a time.

												Shadowrun universe offers something for everyone - you can use magic, summon elementals, hack into matrix and get through code or send everyone to hell with drones and rifles. This combined with our world, twisted by awakening of magic creates really interesting setting for the Players.Dragonfall story is really solid and focuses on your team, which creates great pace of progressing, without losing sixth world vibe. Character development is really easy to understand and straightforward, allowing you to focus more on what you would like to do than worrying about numbers and mechanics. You forge your own path - and only yours. This mean that while you have company, they level up and get stronger with less of your influence which gives a nice feeling of being leader, but not playing out their characters - it's more like playing with them.Mechanically, it's really easy to get into the fight - you have a pool of action points which you can spend on movement, attack, skills, reloading, healing. Cover system is similar to what you probably know from X-Com, however here it actually makes sense and works. All rolls and chances are taken down to minimum, so it's easy to work your way out throught the battlefield. Which does not mean that it's easy to survive - even on normal difficulty, wrong move or bravado can cost you a lose. Overall, it's one of the best isometric RPGs you can get. It takes about ~24 hours to get through story, so it's a decent lenght to pay a good dime for it and not feel robbed. Also old timers with 9-5 work can easily chill with it after getting home and still play it in some decent manner of time.TL;DRBuy this.			"

												One sentence review: The game combines a very enjoyable combat system with an engaging plot + RPG elements. You spend most of your time on 'runs', which are the 21st century, post 'magical awakenening' equivalents of classic RPG dungeons. It is clear that all of these missions are very well thought out, with an excellent balance of combat and non-combat puzzle solving (think: exploration, using dialogue to achieve non-combat ends, hacking computers, etc.). This makes each run memorable and unique. The developers are at their best with unique missions formats: for example in one mission your 'decker' (computer hacker) needs to hack a computer system (with its own unique turn-based combat system) of a compound you are infiltrating while you are in it, challenging you to balance the combat in the digital and real worlds (for example the decker needs to bring the turret security system onto your side while fighting anti-infiltration computer programs). The combat system is excellent turn based, tactical combat. Different characters bring different strengths to the battlefield, and its up to you to figure out how to maximize your team's effectiveness. There is a major strategy component in terms of rationing your resources: during any one run you do not get to restock on items, and so you have to tactically use them based on how hard any one fight is. Because all of your companions enter each run with their own items there is no feeling of 'saving the items until the ultimate boss' (they restock after each run) - you want to spend them on each run and its fun to figure out when its worth to use a re-usable magic ability vs lobbing a one-time use grenade. Combat probably provides the most replayability, with radically different strategies coming from using magic vs. melee/ranged weapons vs. drones to defeat your enemies. The RPG elements are also great. All of the major chracters have fantastic backstories, and I have spent considerable time learning and reading all of them. This is my first introduction to the Shadowrun universe, and the game delivers a fantastic intorduction in terms of allowing different character backstories/the main plot to paint the picture of how this world came to be. The RPG element also provides some replayability, with different dialogue options available based on what sort of skills you bring to the table (for example a medic can talk about surgeries better) - but note it is not limiting in terms of learning about the universe so it does not force a replay (otherwise I would consider this sort of replayability cheating!). Overall a fantastic game. The cons worth mentioning:- The difficulty settings are off. I'm playing on the highest difficulty and am breezing through most of the game (compare this to Throne of Baahl difficulty on Bauldar's Gate where I am re-loading every 10 minutes). Note: even 'breezing through it' I find some of the combat challenging so a veteran strategy player will not be dissapointed, though the real sadists among you might be. - I've noticed a pattern where many of the dialogues boil down to ""tell me more"" or ""stop talking"". Additionally while many of the diologues give you options on what to say, they all lead to the same response (for example you can either chastise or forgive a rogue character, but they will simply give you the same apology dialogue in response). Though a con, the pro of the overall engaging dialogue mentioned above still dominates here. Basically I think of this as an out for people who already know the backstories and just want to move the game forward.			"

												Growing up as a tabletop roleplaying gamer in the nineties, one of the game I played a lot (a LOT) of was Shadowrun. Flash forward a couple of decades, it wasn't a game I thought too much about in a while. But the first Harebrained Schemes game (Shadowrun Returns) managed to intrigue me. I played it, and it amused me for a while, but it was fairly linear, and while the story was good, none of the characters were very memorable. Shadowrun Dragonfall is very different though, miles better in my opinion. The non-linear nature of the middle part of the game was great, the central area (the Kreuzbasar) was really fun to walk around and talk to people, if a trifle big. But the best thing about the game were the characters. All memorable, all flawed in their own way, but still realistic as people (even if not all of them were 'people'). If you like turn-based video RPGs with good plots and well written characters, and have a soft spot for fantasy/cyberpunk crossover games from the nineties, I would heartily recommend this game.			"

												There's so much to love about this gem. It's wonderfully written (a great improvement over the previous installation, which felt to short and to underdeveloped), from the great flavor text on the loading screen to the dialogs you have with your team mates, to the twisting cyberpunky plot. I do hope there'll be many more like this. If you like RPG with the ephasis on role, you'll love this.			"

												Poorly paced, haphazard design. Little to no bugs encountered, a little try hard on the story line.Overall very playable but short in content, with most of it being repeatative.Probably the worst iteration of cyber-hacking that I have experienced. Being just a watered down version of the ""meat-space"" tactical combat, only digital graphics.Had a few very genuine moments in the script and writing. Would love to see this re-done with more time/team/funding. Has all the precipts of awesomeness.Would recommend, but ify value so look for a sale depending on your gaming budget.			"

												Overall a very good game. Very similar to the first iteration Shadowrun Returns: Dead Man's Switch (which I liked slightly better actually). If you haven't played that, go get it (only $2.99 on sale). If you played Dead Man's Switch, the mechanics in Dragonfall (turnbased combat in real and cyberspace) + isometric graphics + no-voice text dialogs will be basically the same. But with more weapons, spells, implants, etc, better story in my opinion, and with some limitations fixed to large extent. However, the UI is buggier, so save often.What changed:+ for most ability checks you can now use a team member (about 7 times in 10, the other 3 times it still uses only the main character)+ for each mission you can loan weapons/spells/programs/consumables to team members which you will get back after the mission is over (except any consumables that were used, of course)+ humor - there is one mission where I actually got to laugh out loud at the final turn of events (won't give you spoilers but whether you get to see this depends on how you deal with that mission :)+ more complex battles - armor reducing AI, AI factions, stun guns, multi-point defense...+/- you can save almost anytime now - which makes decisions less important unfortunately but helps dealing with UI bugs- buggier UI may freeze on you in battle and you cannot apply abilities nor move (going deep into character or load game menu and then backing out sometimes fixes this)			"

												I almost always prefer games based on the gameplay mechanics alone.  Shadowrun: Dragonfall is well designed and a joy to play, but truly it was the story(!) that put it over the top.  The integration of a specific existing cultural influence, Berlin, in a post-apocalyptic world added more to the ambiance than any completely fictional setting.  Highly recommended.			"

												I love this game, I was expecting to  refund it but it was surprisingly good. The Story is great. The Characters all have great background stories. Different outcomes from your actions as well, you can   be a cold, only for the money shadowrunner or a good guy(boring).  This is a story driven game, every mission has purpose and consequences.Graphics are not the best, it is a indie game, but the art style of the citites are nice. It gives that cyberpunk feel, great for cyberpunk fans. A modern CRPG.The Gameplay  is ala Baldurs Gate and Xcom. You only are in charge of buying gear for your main character, which makes item management easier. You can equip your Party with consumable items like Health items, grenades, drugs , spells etc. The combat system is similar to Xcom, turn based cover system. You gotta use cover alot and each action consumes action points. There are multiple solutions at times, which adds replay value. The game is a challenge. You will lose or restart so that your favorite character will survive. Oh and there are mods in the steam workshop. This game gives you a lot for a low price. If you don't mind to read a lot of text, like a challenge, story driven, turn based, tactical RPG then this game is for you.			"

												I'm revising my review to give it a thumbs up. Not all games are perfect. Not all games are big-budget masterpieces. Shadowrun: Dragonfall is obviously a budget game; there are design decisions in this game that were clearly made to keep the budget down (no voice-acting, isometric game on flat, 2D canvas; all of this easier to program, and costs less to make). I am taking these things into account for this review. This isn't a Fallout 4 game or a Baldur's Gate 2. But what this game is, is mostly good, with some bad elements that don't cripple it, but do stunt it. This game still has flaws. But I think in the end, the good stuff wins out. If you are a fan of RPG's combined with turn-based tatical combat, then this probably is something you need to play. Bad Stuff First1) There's a learning curve. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it can make it difficult to know what to choose when leveling up a character, or how to take advantage of the environment when you're in a fight. Expect to hit Google or the game message boards here on Steam to figure things out (like what those circles on the ground are for, and how to use them).2) Encounters can be very difficult, to the point where they seem unbalanced in favor of the enemy. Save often. If you're persistant, like I am, you're probably going to stubbonrly replay a failed combat over and over to get through itt. That's not exactly ""fun"". Fortunately, this game, much like XCOM, seems to have a bit of a reverse difficulty curve (though not as steep). The early missions, with fewer action points and tools to fight with, can be difficult against the large number of enemies you'll face. 3) The writing. This game has no voice-acting so there is a lot of reading involved. I don't think that's bad thing. I grew up on text-based MUD's, so reading is no issue. And I understand the decision to do it that way - keeps the budget down. But the writing is not very good in places. It feels like the writers are trying too hard to impress (look at my writing chops!) instead of just conveying. Good StuffThis game will get some comparisons to XCOM, for the tactical, turn-based combat with cover. And that's a somewhat valid comparison. But I think a better comparison might be an older game like Fallout 1 or Fallout 2. The combat is really very much like Fallout 1 style combat, with some XCOM amenities (like to-hit percentages, and a lot of fancy skills). It's an old-school, fixed isometric view with good art and a promising story setup. The designers do a good job of providing the player with multiple options for completing some quests. This is, in fact, a very strong point for this game, and something other games should pay attention to. For instance, you can opt to go the diplomacy route instead of firing weapons, or you can opt for hacking instead of gunslinging (reminded me of System Shock back in the day), etc. Missions can have more than one way to progress, and your ability to advance through a mission will depend largely on the talent of the team members you bring with you. Example: a quick way into a building might be bringing a decker along to hack your way in, but if you elected to take a more ""all muscle"" group with you, you might have to do some dumpster-diving to find a key-card to get into the building. It's nice when designers give gamers these options, and I respect Dragonfall for doing it. The story is engaging. The combat, once you get past some of the early, annoying missions, is actually pretty fun. Bottom line: I think there are so few of these style of games on the market that are any good, that Dragonfall needs to be played and given time to sink in. I made too quick of a judgement on my first review. It's not a flawless game, but it's a game worth playing IMO. And it has it's moments that make it worthwhile.			"

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a cyberpunk top down tactical RPG.Summery: Shadowrun is an old school style RPG with turn based grid combat and a heavy emphasis on story. The Story: The story is compelling and well written. The game provides many dialogue trees and allows you to make tons of decisions. Even without any voice acting the characters and their backstories left an impression and i found myself coming up with voices for them in my head. No bad voice overs or poor performances here folks! The amazing lore of this game melds sci fi cyberpunk with magical fantasy concepts. Ever wanted to create a machine gun wielding troll who uses robot drones? What about an elf hacker who can make contact with the spirit world? What about a katana wielding street samurai who can use explosives and spells? Well now you can!The graphics: The fidielity is nothing to brag about but the artstyle is 100% gorgeous. I loved exploring this cyberpunk world. The world is run-down and trashy yet beautiful and full of detail. Everything from dilapidated apartment complexes to corporate laboratories have been masterfully crafted.Its obvious the artists put care into creating these stellar enviroments and character portraits. The game is a beautiful work of art. The Gameplay: While not as deep or complex as other tactical RPG's the gameplay here provides depth without overwhelming the player with overly complicated concepts. You level up and buy gear. you create a class and try to capitalize on its abilities. Your party members can fill in the gaps, and depending on who you take on a mission things can go a variety of ways. The mission design is nice because almost everything has multiple solutions that are determined by the skillset of your team of shadowrunners. A hacker can bypass security and jack into the matrix giving you more options. A shaman can interact with the spirit world, talk to ghosts and even summon entities to the battlefield. Some classes specialize in droids and drones that can provide heavy combat support or enter small vents that humanoids have no access to. The outcome of your mission is not only determined by the classes but also the personality of your character. Many confontations can be avoided simply by saying the right things and convincing people that you aren't a threat. This doesn't just depend on a stat based speech check like many other RPG's. It also depends on the species and peronality traits of your character. Some characters are experienced with the streets and have an easier time interacting with gangsters and runners. Other personalities are more corporate or security/law enforcment oriented. This means your character will be able to say different things based on his/her personality. The music: Both the ambient and combat music are some of the best i have ever heard. The soundtrack sets the tone perfectly and is honestly a highlight of the game. Many missions have unique music specifically designed for that location. This means that you won't have to hear the same songs excessively often like in most other games. You could easily listen to the music outside of the game and still be amazed. This is one of the best game soundtracks on the market! The verdict: This is a near perfect game and a must-own for any shadowrun fan or cyberpunk junkie. Even though i loved shadowrun: returns i must say that Dragonfall is a vast improvement. If you dislike tactical turn based RPG's then maybe give this one a pass but you will be missing out on one of the greatest and polished lore universes of all time. I give this one a BIG thumbs up!

												TL:DR? just skip to the bottom sectionSo let me just say that the short commings of Shaowrun:Returns have been addressed, all of them;the mediocre writing,character portait variety,the job systems, even the combat feels a bit crisper and the locations are all...more appropriate somehow.I've been a Shadowrun fan since I started reading the novels at the age of 9. The content was dark, deep,mature. It had magic and technology, Never Deal with a Dragon blew my mind onto the wall, into the matrix as it were. I remember listing Robert Charrette as my favorite author for many years during those lame english and reading classes, above Tolkien Stood Mr.Charrette at least in my mind and at the time.I remember playing The Snes game when i was in my early teens and not quite feeling the same rush, there was a lot of clunk, the matrix seemed more like a video game, the dialogue really tried. But I couldn't play it until almost a decade later with the help of an old nintendo  secrets guide book i found for a dollar.Then the Genesis  version, I personally feel this game holds up today, the combat was a  little weak but it had megaplex runs, a very solid matrix system, locations, loved it.I never played that fps that came out for the pc, ::shrugs:: heard bad things,SR:Returns: felt a lot like the original snes title to me, I felt that was both good and bad, nostalgia is a powerful drug it seems, the premise here was great , they put a lot of work into it you could tell, but it fell short in a lot of places. Every run felt very generic from what I recall, the combat felt really weak,the story was pretty thin to me but now I know why:They were getting their money together for Dragonfall.                                BOTTOM SECTION                                              BOTTOM SECTIONDragonfall is really what they should have released os SR:Returns,there's more available to make your characters feel different instead of just every character having to be a jack of all trades,I feel like My characters (professional shadowrunners with many successful missions under their belt) hit their marks more often and therefore made me want to throw my computer into the the deepest floor of the deepest trench of the ocean far fewer times than the Shadowrun Returns deadmans switch.But the real seller here is they nailed the story, they made strong characters, they give you decent dialogue options and make the characters again feel different and fit better in the story. The diversity of conversation and action options have been improved and really this game would stand out in contrast of it's earlier counter-part. But beyond any of that the game FEELS like Shadowrun, Dragonfall captures the essence of SR at least to me.			"

												This game is similar to X-Com Enemy Unknown and Wasteland 2.   It is a decent turn based game and I enjoyed it but it wasn't amazingly awesome.  Since I played over 30hrs of course I have to recommend it.   however,  I am annoyed when I play turned based games and they aren't as good as Jagged Aliance 2 which should have set the standard. (ie. where if you shoot someone with a bullet at point blank range it causes major damage no matter what the gun).   That's my main gripe.  This game is unrealistic in that sense.  The skill tree wasn't the best. Story line was decent.  Lots of twists.			"

												A relatively casual tactics RPG. Level of gameplay depth is accessible to newcomers to tactics games, but may not sate the appetites of veterans. Otherwise, the story, environments and extension of workshop content carry the game.Biggest gripe about the mechanics is the propensity to miss in the early third of the game. You start with low stats early on in the game, like any RPG, and it's usually offset by your opponents' relatively low stats as well. So even if you have a low hitrate, your opponent has an equally low dodge rate, and thus, your real hit chance isn't absurdly low. This is where Shadowrun differs, and could have used a lot more feedback in testing. You will spend the first hour or two just standing in front of your opponents' face and having your shotguns/melee/anything miss, miss, miss, miss. Your enemies too. Miss, miss, miss, regardless of difficulty, because you both have such♥♥♥♥♥♥stats that no one can achieve higher than a 40% hit chance, no matter how optimal your scenario is. A RNG-dependent, tedious ten turns later, you'll come out on top, then stack points into hit rate/smart link weapons/upgrades. And then the game is a cakewalk, no matter your difficulty, because you can suddenly hit multiple people half a map away with your shotgun, and likely crit them for all their HP. Every time you start a new campaign, user-created or not, it feels like going through the same arduous process. Could use some tweaking there...			"

												I ignored Dragonfall because of it's underwhelming predecessor Shadowrun Returns, only to pick it up when the director's cut came out and I saw it praised everywhere I went.  Now having played it a lot I can say it's one of the most enjoyable RPGs I've had the pleasure of being surprised by.From the start you ARE a shadowrunner, working a job WITH these characters you wish to get to know. All in a setting that can so completely capture you and never let go. Whether or not it lasts more than one playthrough is difficult to say. There's a lot you can do differently to affect the world storywise while the gameplay might not be ""deep"" and interesting enough for everyone.For me personally this is in the top 5. Highly recommended.			"

												If you've played the base game (Shadowrun Returns), this is very similar but everything jacked up to 11. There's more story (still a good one, with the wild twists I've come to expect from Shadowrun), you have a set of teammates with their own backstories that offer sidequests and achievements (I'm a sucker for achievements) AND A DOG, and such a wide range of skills to use in combat. This series, specifically this game, has completely changed my mind about turn-based combat and point-and-clicks. I highly recommend it.My only complaint is that as I got further into the game, it would freeze after I issued commands (tell team to walk somewhere, have to wait 30 seconds, etc.), but the issue quickly went away after lowering my settings.

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall may very well be my favorite RPG ever. While shooting your way through your obstacles is an option, so is thinking your way through them. It rewards intelligence and charisma in equal, and sometimes greater, measure than brute force. It's also an incredibly atmospheric game, where the top-notch writing captures more than a fully voiced dialogue or intricate animation ever could. S:D doesn't get caught up in trying to explain the whole world it takes place in. Instead, it shows you the way the world is structured through your interactions with the various characters you meet.The main crew you run with are all fully fledged characters, each wholly unique with interesting backstories and different personalities. It's incredible to see how their reactions towards you, and others, are changed by your interactions with them, and you can effectively mold them along certain paths. Glory is certainly the best example of this, but I found myself particularly gravitating toward's Eiger's character. She isn't a typical NPC groupie by any stretch of the imagination, but rather an effective foil.I won't go too much into detail about the storyline, but needless to say that it was absolutely incredible and made me feel 100% invested in the game.5/5 stars.

The act of pursuing the main story line fills in a lot of the background, which helps bring you into the setting more than in Shadowrun Returns.Still, it isn't as polished as something like Wasteland 2, so I wouldn't recommend buying it off sale.

												TL:DR? just skip to the bottom sectionSo let me just say that the short commings of Shaowrun:Returns have been addressed, all of them;the mediocre writing,character portait variety,the job systems, even the combat feels a bit crisper and the locations are all...more appropriate somehow.I've been a Shadowrun fan since I started reading the novels at the age of 9. The content was dark, deep,mature. It had magic and technology, Never Deal with a Dragon blew my mind onto the wall, into the matrix as it were. I remember listing Robert Charrette as my favorite author for many years during those lame english and reading classes, above Tolkien Stood Mr.Charrette at least in my mind and at the time.I remember playing The Snes game when i was in my early teens and not quite feeling the same rush, there was a lot of clunk, the matrix seemed more like a video game, the dialogue really tried. But I couldn't play it until almost a decade later with the help of an old nintendo  secrets guide book i found for a dollar.Then the Genesis  version, I personally feel this game holds up today, the combat was a  little weak but it had megaplex runs, a very solid matrix system, locations, loved it.I never played that fps that came out for the pc, ::shrugs:: heard bad things,SR:Returns: felt a lot like the original snes title to me, I felt that was both good and bad, nostalgia is a powerful drug it seems, the premise here was great , they put a lot of work into it you could tell, but it fell short in a lot of places. Every run felt very generic from what I recall, the combat felt really weak,the story was pretty thin to me but now I know why:They were getting their money together for Dragonfall.                                BOTTOM SECTION                                              BOTTOM SECTIONDragonfall is really what they should have released os SR:Returns,there's more available to make your characters feel different instead of just every character having to be a jack of all trades,I feel like My characters (professional shadowrunners with many successful missions under their belt) hit their marks more often and therefore made me want to throw my computer into the the deepest floor of the deepest trench of the ocean far fewer times than the Shadowrun Returns deadmans switch.But the real seller here is they nailed the story, they made strong characters, they give you decent dialogue options and make the characters again feel different and fit better in the story. The diversity of conversation and action options have been improved and really this game would stand out in contrast of it's earlier counter-part. But beyond any of that the game FEELS like Shadowrun, Dragonfall captures the essence of SR at least to me.			"

												Played the entirety of it, so it's not horrible. But squad-based RPGs have really come a long way since this kind of interface and it feels antiquated. If the nostalgia is enough for you, go nuts, but the pain points of yesteryear come shining through.			"

												I really enjoyed this game.  If you like turn-based tactical combat and RPGs in general, you will like this.  Story was good, and the characters were very cool and memorable.  If you don't know the background on the world -- it is an interesting mix of cyberpunk and fantasy.  The only drawbacks are that it is a bit linear (but better than the previous installment), and the cover mechanic is hard to master without some research.			"

												One of the few games able to recreate the wonderment and magic of table-top RPGs. The story is well-constructed, features plenty of twists and turns and pulls you onward as only the best role-playing campaigns do. To boot, it has rewarding turn-based combat that boasts a depth that belies the relatively few skills available to characters. NPCs have been very well-written and aid in creating the sense of place that makes Dragonfall really shine. This is a game that rewards intelligent thought and committed role-playing. If that sounds like your bag, then you owe it to yourself to run the shadows of the Flux State.			"

												I clump this one together with the recent Pillars of Eternity game. Neither of them really managed to grab my attention for any meaningful length of time. The writing and dialog is overall rather bland, the world building seems amateur, and the combat feels derivative and like I've played it before. Nothing wowed me.			"

												A review based on 1 playthroughAfter Shadowrun: Returns this game is like a breath of fresh air. I was really dissapointed in the plot of the fist game, but this is something way different. There is no relegious cult nonsense, that was in the Returns, instead you get a real story about a group of shadowrunners. The game develops characters really well and all of them have their own opinion, that doesn't always match yours. Your teammates can even start arguing with you about what the group should do. I should also point out that game has several endings. Writing is great overall.In case you never played any shadowrun games, combat is pretty simular to xcom series. Dragonfall has improved from Retuns, but it still missed some things. For example, you can't place each member of your group where you want while not in combat, so when you open a door you stand in the open waiting for your enemies to shoot you. It's better than being in combat all the time after your first encounter, but frustrating nontheless. Gameplay is pretty solid in my opinion.Soundtrack is worth listening out of the game. Composers did their job well.			"

												Having played the Roleplay version with friends, the PC versions of the game were never going to have the flexibility or humour that a room full of people can manage... that being said they are still very good.Shadowrun Returns was a great start but it played like a demo: it simply didn't have the length to allow each class to shine. Dragonfall changes all that. There are enough missions, with enough variety, to reward many different builds. You can play as a tank and just smash your way through the game, or as needle and weave your way round opponents avoiding many of the fights... or try for a little of both.			"

												I can't really tell you why, but I have avoided buying this game.  I bought it at a very low price thinking that I MAY someday play it, but once I had it, I avoided playing it.  I think it is the style of the artwork, or the cyberpunk theme, or ...I don't really know.  One night I installed it out of sheer boredom and WOW!  What a great game!  The in-game art and animation is great (though I'm still not a fan of the ""painting"" style images that are there.  The gameplay is fantastic and DEEP.  Far better than Wasteland 2 (which I really liked).  I kind of regret not playing this game earlier, but I am glad I had it when the time came.			"

												Really enjoyed this game.  Though to be honest, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did Shadowrun Returns.  Returns had a truly classic SR story, and Dragonfall goes for the gusto with its story.  The only real prob was the whole 'do random runs to earn enough money to continue the story' thing.  Otherwise it's pretty good.  The end of this game is pretty epic as well, as far as story and making it your own go :)			"

												There are a ton of people that have played / reviewed this game but I figured I'd take a run at doing this from a story perspective. In a genre where open worlds are becoming king, the script on Dragonfall is absolutely amazing. Alternate endings, great dialogue and some real world problems. There will be points in the story where you have to make some very hard decisions where neither are good or bad, they just are. And they have serious implications.All the great game play, cool magic / matrix mechanics aside, the story is what makes this game worth playing.John.			"

												EDIT: Changed recommendation to positive. Many of the below bugs have been fixed, and the game is quite enjoyable, but please be aware that some critical game-breaking bugs do still exist and it seems that HBS has no intention of fixing them.(Old Review)I love the gameplay, the characters, and the story. But this game is too buggy to enjoy. I've encountered four extremely frustrating bugs that have required me to restart levels or lose progress, and countless other bugs that have negatively impacted my experiene, some of which have been detailed in patch notes as fixed, but seems to have not been the case. The four major bugs I encountered were as follows:1. A summoned minion ""escaped"" from my control (game mechanic), but the level gave me the game over screen and I was forced to restart (bug).2. The enemy's turn never ended. Game just hung at the end of the enemy's turn. Because you cannot save during an enemy's turn, I was forced to load an earlier save file.3. My mouse cursor wouldn't let me select any tiles. Had to save and quit.4. During the save and quit of bug three, however, my game crashed and the save did not take.I have emailed reports of some of these bugs to the developers (luckily they have a system set up for bug reporting), but I could not do detailed reports for all of them due to the nature of some of them. As I said, I think that this is a great game, but it's too frustrating to play at this time. (This review will be rewritten once the game is more stable.)			"

												This is an story-driven game without animations, cutscenes, not even simple illustrative images (like Phantasy Star IV for example)... nothing, only text and basic graphics. The choices you have in dialogues are almost the same and most of times makes no difference.The character creation seems very cool at first, but become frustrating during the game. The game is so small and linear that the way you builds your character do not make much difference. Your abilities are only for combats and to unlock small events.In battles, taking cover do not seems to make much difference. ""Seems"", because you can not trust the hit change. Is ridiculous how many times you miss shots with 99% chance to hit. The battles are almost no-brainer.Replay is terrible. The game is too linear and most of it is text, replaying the game means reading the same story again.Shadowrun Returns has the same problems and this one do not improve anything. Except that this game is little bit bigger.			"

												The game is pretty cool if you don't mind reading quite a bit. It's 15 dollars though so can't really hire voice actors for that. The game itself plays awesome. I really enjoyed the story and the characters and just the universe of shadowrun. However I couldn't finish the game because it kept freezing on me towards the end. When I was in the building where you have to take out the AI I literally tried that mission probably ten times before I just gave up. It just kept freezing over and over so I couldn't finish or go on. So ♥♥♥♥ it I'm done.			"

												This review is fairly late on my behalf, I finished the game quite a while ago so I may not be as descriptive as I could be. Firstly this game has many gamplay improvments over shadowrun: returns and if you enjoyed that game you certainly will enjoy this game as well. The reason I felt implored to write this review however is that the story of this game was simply amazing. At first I had my trepidatons, but there are so many characters to talk to an learn about that it kept me interested and pushed me to keep playing. The ending is where I feel I finally was rewarded, there is a level of depth and interest that strikes a perfect balance. I suggest this game, as well as the previous installment to anyone who has not tried them. Though I would suggest playing them in order of release.			"

												Dragonfall is an excellent follow on to the first Shadowrun game.  Whereas the first one was a linear story, Dragonfall has a few ""side quests"" so to speak, but for the most part it is a linear story you follow.  The story is simply amazing and really sucks you into the Shadowrun world.  There is more interaction with your NPC's that made the game much more enjoyable.  Each NPC had their own side quest.  My only annoyances would be with the inability to equip/fully train NPC's (exception is the few skills you can assign to NPC during the progress of the game).  My main complaint is the incredibly horrible load/save times, inexcusable for a game of this simple graphics.  All things consider I highly recommend it, and will be picking up Shadowrun Hong Kong next time it goes on sale.Pro+Fantastic story that really drives deep into the Shadowrun world+Great turn based combat that puts you in different challenging positions throughout the whole game+NPC story lines+Lots of gray area decision making, where there was not always an obvious choiceCons-Game load times were incredibly slow for a game of this type, there was no reason for this-Inability to customize your ""party"" of NPC's, you cannot assign their points or pick their outfit-Inability to trade items to your NPC's during a mission (such as giving them a med pack)			"

												Do you yearn for the olden days of CRPGs like Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment? Do you enjoy turn-based strategy games à la X-Com: Enemy Unknown? If the answer is yes to either of these questions, you probably want to check out Shadowrun: Dragonfall. The story is neither unique nor packed with surprises but it is, however, very well written and delivered, drenched in a classic cyberpunk/noir setting. Your party members all have their own backstories and side-quests to discover that will keep you just as interested - if not more so - than the main story. If there is one down side to the game, it's that I wish there was more. That's where the Fan Missions come in.A word of warning, in case you don't already know: There is absolutely no voice acting in this game, so be prepared to do a lot of reading.			"

												I originally played Dragonfall as DLC for Shadowrun Returns. I did not, in fact, expect that many changes, but reviewers pointed out that this was not the case. This was not merely polishing a gem in the rough.This was, in fact, adding far more complexity and depth, and making Dragonfall into a much fuller and rounded-out game in its own right.The Director's Cut missions stand out immediately - not just the new personal missions, but all additional 'runs. More options, more colorful choices, expanded dialog, and a hint of what would be added further in Shadowrun Hong Kong as the team matured and progressed in the design of the game.Play this. Until Hong Kong came out, this was the best of Shadowrun as a non-tabletop game.			"

												It's really just another campaign in the style of Shadowrun: Returns, with a few additions.  You now have a permanent squad, and no longer have to spend money hiring mercenaries (still an option, though).  I played through it on hard, and I was overflowing with gold trauma kits, advanced and platinum medkits.  The permanent squaddies can also level up, though your choices for customizing them are very limited.  I found it a waste of money to give them their own weapons or outfits, but loaning other items to them such as trauma kits, medkits, drugs and grenades is essential.Beware of missions where squad mates can die permanently.The problems with SRR still remain.  Most annoyingly, you can only distribute items to your squad through the stash (total item inventory, outside of the 6 items you can have on-hand per character), and only at the very beginning of a mission BEFORE it autosaves.  Also, aside from the main character, you can only get people in your squad to pick up items during combat, which is absurdly autistic.  This is the only time you can control other members of your squad, aside from skill options showing up in dialogue sometimes; ie. use squad mate to hack console, requires decking 3.  HBS needs to get its♥♥♥♥♥♥together and fix that.I don't know if SRR was like this, but the roleplaying feels more open than before, and the story is little less whacky and off the deep end near the end of it, unlike SRR (slight spoiler for people that haven't played SRR either).  You can get into arguments with your squad mates, and (probably) have them ditch you.  The game is replayable and there's probably at least a couple roleplaying paths I never bothered to venture down on the first play through.  I'm only in the first fight and I'm already frustrated by very hard difficulty (which will probably even make certain missions demand perfect item usage, given the item stash issue).  The stash issue was complicated by how annoying it is whenever a character would run out of items, and how, if my main character's inventory is full, I'd have to put loot in the stash rather than be able to give it to squad mates that actually need it.The game is really nothing special, and rather plain for a tactical RPG.  Back when I reviewed SRR, I was pretty new to tactical RPGs, so I may sound a little more enthused in that review.I'll give this one a 6.5 out of 10.  Honestly, if you like shadowrun, I recommend getting SRR too, if its cheap.  I'll wait for a sale before I get hong kong.			"

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall remains true to the Hairbrained Schemes Shadowrun Trillogy and makes a number of significant improvements to both the story line and gameplay.As I mentioned in my review of Shadowrun Returns, this trilogy is not an action packed beat-em-up and you need to be in the right frame of mind to read an emerce yourself in long dialog and the plot to get the most ouf ot this game. Dialog skipping will take away most of the enjoyment. "

												The Shadowrun universe at first seems - well - campy. Technology and magic run amok in its world, one filled with orcs and elves as well as cyberarms and the Matrix. But this game takes that wild chaotic concept and polishes it into one of the finest cRPGs ever made. The plotline is compelling, the party members fascinating, the gameplay incredibly fun, and the design asthetic absolutely gorgeous. If you're looking for an RPG to immerse yourself in, look no further.			"

												They have stuck to their guns. I like how this series doesn't fix anything that isn't broken. This game just continues on with another story, but only adds great new graphics and weapons, yet it sticks to the original archetecture. I would definitely recommend this game, but only if you are a fan of the series. Shadowrun first was released on the NES, and it was a big hit. I am glad to see these guys are still doing business, they are honest, and they aren't out for your wallet.			"

												Dragonfall isn't the perfect turn-based RPG by any means, however the pros of this game greatly outweigh the cons. Dragonfall uses the shadowrun mechanics and setting to tell a stunning sci-fi tale. You take the role as the leader of a group of shadowrunners and go on missions that allow you to play as whatever type of person you want. Want to murder everyone? Go Ahead. Want to make deals and be sly? You can do that too. The way you play is very customizable from how you fight and what you know, down to the actions you take.Pros:-Solid RPG with choices throughout that affect mission endings and story.-Good plotline and story-Lots of replayability story wise and battle wise-Very customizable characters-Has some well made mods for even more play time and new experiencesCons:-The game still has freezing problems-A Decker is almost entirely necessary all the time-Battles are frustratingly slow at times			"

												It's really just another campaign in the style of Shadowrun: Returns, with a few additions.  You now have a permanent squad, and no longer have to spend money hiring mercenaries (still an option, though).  I played through it on hard, and I was overflowing with gold trauma kits, advanced and platinum medkits.  The permanent squaddies can also level up, though your choices for customizing them are very limited.  I found it a waste of money to give them their own weapons or outfits, but loaning other items to them such as trauma kits, medkits, drugs and grenades is essential.Beware of missions where squad mates can die permanently.The problems with SRR still remain.  Most annoyingly, you can only distribute items to your squad through the stash (total item inventory, outside of the 6 items you can have on-hand per character), and only at the very beginning of a mission BEFORE it autosaves.  Also, aside from the main character, you can only get people in your squad to pick up items during combat, which is absurdly autistic.  This is the only time you can control other members of your squad, aside from skill options showing up in dialogue sometimes; ie. use squad mate to hack console, requires decking 3.  HBS needs to get its♥♥♥♥♥♥together and fix that.I don't know if SRR was like this, but the roleplaying feels more open than before, and the story is little less whacky and off the deep end near the end of it, unlike SRR (slight spoiler for people that haven't played SRR either).  You can get into arguments with your squad mates, and (probably) have them ditch you.  The game is replayable and there's probably at least a couple roleplaying paths I never bothered to venture down on the first play through.  I'm only in the first fight and I'm already frustrated by very hard difficulty (which will probably even make certain missions demand perfect item usage, given the item stash issue).  The stash issue was complicated by how annoying it is whenever a character would run out of items, and how, if my main character's inventory is full, I'd have to put loot in the stash rather than be able to give it to squad mates that actually need it.The game is really nothing special, and rather plain for a tactical RPG.

												I originally played Dragonfall as DLC for Shadowrun Returns. I did not, in fact, expect that many changes, but reviewers pointed out that this was not the case. This was not merely polishing a gem in the rough.This was, in fact, adding far more complexity and depth, and making Dragonfall into a much fuller and rounded-out game in its own right.The Director's Cut missions stand out immediately - not just the new personal missions, but all additional 'runs. More options, more colorful choices, expanded dialog, and a hint of what would be added further in Shadowrun Hong Kong as the team matured and progressed in the design of the game.Play this. Until Hong Kong came out, this was the best of Shadowrun as a non-tabletop game.			"

												This game was a big surprise.  It's a tactical SRPG set in the Shadowrun Universe, and I think it counts as the first REALLY GOOD Shadowrun game.Pros:1.  Very interesting combat system.  There are lots of different skill trees to play, and the mashup between having deckers (hackers), summoners, magicians, sword samurai/etc makes the combat pretty chaotic and super interesting.2.  Strong writing - lots of choices to make.3.  On rails enough so you don't get lost, but lots to explore.Cons:1. Somewhat buggy combat in the matrix.This is a classic though, definitely pick it up.

												I very, very much enjoy this game. The writing is top-notch, I *love* the story, I love the art and atmosphere, I love the universe (anarchist Berlin with magic, guns, hacking, radioactive wastelands, and dragons/elves/trolls/orcs/dwarves? Sign me up!). The gameplay reminds me of the isometric games of old. The turnbased combat feels solid and has *just* enough tactical weight to feel fun.Most important of all is that I feel like my choices have weight. It's that intangible, hard-to-describe feeling that the decisions that I make are *real*, not just paths I am trundling down. Now, I know that behind the scenes that is exactly what is happening but I feel like the writing really does a great job of hiding it and making the world feel real. Same goes for the relationships with my fellow shadowrunners. HBS really has it nailed down. They have a vision and really stick to it. They are targeting a certain niche and they have hit a home run.If you like RPGs, if you like cyberpunk, if you like turnbased combat, if you like great writing, if you like cool 2D art, then you owe it to yourself to pick this up. One of my favorite RPGs of the last 5 years.P.S. - HBS really supports their games after release, too. I recently played through this for a second time after quite a while and I found extra story options added, new art, new dialog, a more stable game, etc etc. They don't just throw a game out and then ignore it. They should be lauded for their continued support. It made the decision to buy Shadowrun: Hong Kong a no-brainer.			"

												Smoother and better than the previous game, still the same setting, the likable story. The easy flow and the nice way to treat the specific setting. New smoother game interface and some more items and fleshed out characters make this an even better way to spend some hours.The only negative I have really is that the game is rather short and replayability with the main story isn't that great. The challenges can be overcome differently with differently selected hero and load with different setup of characters but not opt in the few fleshed out characters seems an obviuos waste.Warmly recommend this game to Shadowrun fans and CRPG fans of tactical slower paced game where story and feeling matters more than flash of substance and suchg things. This is scaled down and no in game dialouge etc. You spend time reading. :)			"

												Better than the first, high praise indeed, and the directors cut added a further handful of welcome features.- Functional character building systems that allow a range of tactical options. - Fun turn-based combat that doesn't grow tedious. - A more flexible approach to choosing missions and side-quests that the first game cried out for. - Most importantly, a narrative that is as well-written and evocative as the games licence is underappreciated. Someone needs to hand Hare-Brained Schemes the budget to create an 80+ hour campaign. What they have created with Dragonfall is as close to RPG perfection as a ~15 hour game can get.			"

												An excellent little gem of an RPG with a tight contemporary story, engaging characters, snappy dialogue and more roleplay options than most AAA RPG's. The player dialogue options are a particular highlight, with plenty of flavour and skill options to make me feel like my character was truly mine. Combat is fun and tactical (if occasionally a little drawn out) and there are often ways to avoid combat altogether, should you choose. Companion characters are all fun and narratively relevant (Glory, in particular, who's story you get to explore in depth with the directors cut content). None of the side content felt arbitrary; everything added something to the narrative experience with no filler just for the sake of bloating the play length. The atmosphere and visuals are cohesive and it's beyond refreshing to play an RPG that isn't in another medieval inspired fantasy world.  Fully recommended.			"

												Wait. You're seriously still thinking about picking this up?Shadowrun: Dragonfall was already one of the best things to come out of Kickstarter and the Director's Cut somehow manages to blow it out of the water. Smart writing, one of the coolest settings in RPG history and a cast of some of the best characters I've seen in a LONG time. If you can't love a game where you can play a cybernetically enchanced Ork packing automatic weapons and a bad attitude, I'm convinced there's no hope for you.The art style is great. The story is great. The combat can be damn difficult at times, but it's great. Overall, what sets this game apart from the pack are some of the best designed quests I've come across.  Pick this one up, it's a throwback to what made CRPG's king in their heyday.With all the shady stories surrounding crowdfunding, this is a studio that has gotten it right every step of the way. This game is a labor of love and it shows.			"

												While many people were upset by the first releases campaign (Dead Man's Switch), for the lack of open-ended gameplay, and lack of memorable party members, the Dragonfall expansion fixed all those complaints. In fact, Dragonfall probably should have been the game they made from the get-go. Now that they've made the Director's Cut a standalone, you don't even have to buy the first campaign to play the much more fleshed out second campaign. Definitley pick up this game if you are a fan of shadowrun, cyber-punk Deus-Ex-ish games, or RPGs in general.			"

												I'm fairly new to the whole isometric RPG kind of experience, but once I had a friend explain a few things stat wise to me this game is amazing. The story is written so well you want to keep reading it rather than play the game sometimes. The combat is pretty addicting if you like strategy. I love the turn based aspect of it. If you like pen and paper RPG games this is for you. This game is so superbly done that I bought Shadowrun Returns yesterday and will be pre-ordering Shadowrun Hong Kong. If you're in it for graphics and flashy stylish battles don't buy this game. If you like top down, pen and paper RPG mechanics with a turn based combat system this is the game for you. Well worth every penny on sale or full price.			"

												Okay, so I played Shadowrun Returns. I was a big fan of the setting, so I was excited to see how it would translate to the digital realm. Dead Man's Switch was good, if a bit uninspired. The game mechanics were great, brilliantly capturing the feel of the tabletop game. Art and music were similarly excellent. Overall, I thought the game was promising but hadn't reached its full potential. Then Dragonfall came out, and I started hearing reports of how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amazing it was. I thought that the hype had to be overblown, after all, it was only a DLC expansion to a pretty good digital representation of Shadowrun.Then the expansion got a standalone release, and I finally decided to play it. It's bloody amazing. The writing is nuanced and complex, the characters are fantastic and deeply compelling, and the gameplay is further fine-tuned from Returns into a damn near perfect package. In short, I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game.			"

												This was my first time playing Shadowrun games. Fortunately it is not a very big handicap if you have no previous knowledge of the game world. There are plenty of references to stuff that happened in previous game but no big deal if you skip those or give a wild guess what happened.Gameplay is smooth, the cover system is an interesting touch and gives plenty of tactical opportunities instead of running into a fight head on. The only complaint about the combat would be that it is a touch on the easy side. Really awesome soundtrack.			"

												I'm would recommend this game, especially if you played the earlier installment of the series.NOTE: Played on hard difficulty.Pros- The story is really good. Well written with a descent number of plot twists. It definitely kept me engaged. Strongest point of the game.- The characters are fun and have their own distinct personalities. - Plenty of optional content for extra funNeutral- Combat is like in the previous Shadowrun. I didn't really enjoy it much the first time. It lacks variety and skills are not very fun. A lot of times it makes more sense to walk to point blank range and shoot, rather than from cover, even if you are basically walking into the center of the fight.Cons - The AI isn't very good. Sometimes, but especially on the first turn, they walk near you but don't attack. I've seen AI walk back and forth doing nothing else during their turn, most often when you try to bait them to come to you.- You can't see your team stats when not on mission or just before a mission. It's annoying when you want to buy stuff from them and want to check if they have can even equip it.- Looting is awful. Even if your team members have open slots for items, you can't let them take the loot, so it goes to your stash for the next mission.- Some interfaces (like adding items pre-mission) could've been done much better.The pros outweigh the cons though, which are annoying than anything else. TL;DR - Overall, it's a pretty good game, with lots of content and a good story.	 "

												Really, really good modern take on the classical RPG. Combat is pretty complex (not so much as an actual tactical strategy game, but close enough), so is the character advancement system, there are quite a few battles that you can skip through various scripted means (smooth talking or activating various environmental actions), the characters are well developed and each of your team mates has a story that you get to discover along the way (by ways of optional missions) and the story is really, really good and well written.Even if the spell gets broken from time to time, when you can see through the dialog, to the not so subtle jabs at modern society, the game really gives you a feeling of writing your own story by giving a lot of dialog choices and quite big story-related choices that will heavily affect the ending. If you've got an aversion for stories of anarchism, a bit of social justice, ecology or accumulation of wealth and power in the hands of the few, you might not like the story that much (although the dialog choices you're given allow your avatar to rebuke all that).There's also quite a bit of point-and-click adventuring to be done and the game's mechanics avoid turning it into pixel hunting, which is great.Just keep in mind that it's still an isometric classical RPG with some modern twists. If you're not a fan of running around and talking to people, don't expect miracles. It is also not an open world RPG and even if it manages to not feel very linear through a couple of tricks, it is very much a linear experience.			"

												Really fun tactical SRPG with old school 2d backgrounds (awesome, gritty artwork and steampunk subject matter).  I bought Shadowrun Hong Kong first and couldn't get into it, so I was very skeptical about this one, but after reading the reviews decided to give it a shot.  Interestingly, both games have almost identical game engines and are set up very similarly, but the way this game flows makes for a completely different experience.  I've on[y played through the first few missions, but the story so far is really engrossing and very easy to follow, where Hong Kong was very disjointed and difficult to understand (at least for me).  Anyway, just so you know, you cannot rotate the screen as you can in most SRPG's.  At first I thought this was a negative, but after getting used to it, I think it works out just fine particularly given the art style.Anyway, great game with a great story so far.  Big thumbs up.H			"

												Smoother and better than the previous game, still the same setting, the likable story. The easy flow and the nice way to treat the specific setting. New smoother game interface and some more items and fleshed out characters make this an even better way to spend some hours.The only negative I have really is that the game is rather short and replayability with the main story isn't that great. The challenges can be overcome differently with differently selected hero and load with different setup of characters but not opt in the few fleshed out characters seems an obviuos waste.Warmly recommend this game to Shadowrun fans and CRPG fans of tactical slower paced game where story and feeling matters more than flash of substance and suchg things. This is scaled down and no in game dialouge etc. You spend time reading. :)			"

												As others pointed out, this is a vast improvement over the original Shadowrun Returns. That one played much like an endless tutorial, but Dragonfall at least offers the illusion of nonlinearity, the illusion of a vast open world  -- even though the story is pretty linear, and the world is in fact pretty cramped. But, the illusion works.It's not a faultless game by any means: I found the combat rather simplistic (and the AI often broke my suspension of disbelief), the matrix sequences are uninteresting, and I missed a more complex cyberware system as well. The choices were often lacking in depth, and rarely seemed to affect anything. But then again, the illusion often works, and the decent writing and the moral complexities it sometimes offered helped through the cracks.			"

												This game is definitely in my top 10 games of all time. It's a perfect mix of everything that makes a great game: excellent gameplay, fantastic visuals, a captivating narrative, and a rich game world. All of these elements blended together make for an extremely enjoyable and satisfying playthrough.The gameplay boils down to leading a group of four characters, of which you can customize to some extent - and yes, your main character has a lot of customisability options, from hairstyle to race and then your skill class - through levels based around the story. I played as an elf decker, allowing me to jack in to the matrix and hack open doors, take control of turrets, and gain visibility of rooms close by through security cameras. Apart from deckers, there are a bunch of different classes to choose from, such as the street samurais, riggers, and mages. There are also plenty of weapons to choose from - pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles, assault rifles, grenades, throwing weapons, spells, summoned spirits, and even drones!Now to touch on the combat. In a nut-shell, it's XCOM. But further to that, once you're in a mission (that you accept for your team to complete, often assigned by some elitest wanting you to do his dirty work for him in return for a sum of money) you are able to walk around the levels picking up items, looking for clues and advantages, and talking to people. Engage in combat, however, and you see XCOM-styled tactical turn-based strategy take place on your screen. I had no complaints about the combat! In addition to this, your character can gain karma based off of certain actions that you perform, whether it be helping someone out or completing a mission. You then spend your karma points on certain skills, much like most RPGs.Overall, I only encountered a few minor bugs that hindered my progress, but they were nothing game-breaking. It's possibly not the type of game that you would want to playthrough again, but given the variety in races, classes, and choices to be made throughout the story, you may find yourself wanting to return to the shadows to run for one last time.This game is a must-have for turn-based strategy fans and RPG fans alike. I highly recommend buying this and playing it through! Enjoy! :D			"

												I loved this game. I never got around to playing Dragonfall on the original Shadowrun Returns, and when this showed up in my library a few months after I had completed Dead Man's Switch, I couldn't help but give it a go at last. I was not disappointed.			"

												First, I got angry at HBS for making SRR a nice, but honestly, a 6/10 game. For some reason, I still replayed it in full, though. I liked how simple, laconic and yet beautiful it was.Next, I got surprised by an amount of work they've put into Dragonfall. They've poured their souls into it. Finally, a game title that actually improved A TON over time. 8/10.After that, Director's Cut was released with even more polish and variativity, so much needed UI upgrades and such. At that stage, I think I secretly became HBS fan, seeing them as new gods of gamedev, who can actually make their products better and better with time, without succumbing to some wild marketing plan one day. Also, Dragonfall became my favourite game, replayed for like 5 times now or smth. 9/10.Now, there is Hong Kong being released the day after tomorrow, and it's the first game I ever prepurchased in my life. Because I know for certain those guys will deliver. Because I started with pirated versions of their games, and then bought all of them out of respect. My only regret is that I haven't been able to participate in Kickstarted campaigns to help make those games even better. But for their next Shadowrun project (hopefully there will be one) - I know I will.Overall, that's the reason I'm recommending this game (and series) and putting a 10/10 mark onto it.			"

												This was more of an impulse buy since I've always been a fan of the Battletech series by the now-defunct FASA corporation. Since this was also their IP, I thought I'd give it a whirl, especially considering the rave reviews it got. And boy, did it deserve them! This game is turn-based RPG tactics at its best, where you get to know and develop your team over a series of missions. The setting is super-cool (can't get enough of cyberpunk), and the story is indeed memorable. I just hope that Shadowrun: Hong Kong lives up to the hype as well. Definitely a must-buy!			"

												If you are a fan of PC RPGs like Baldur's Gate and Fallout (pre-Bethesda), give this game a shot. The story is well-told, and the characters are as well-developed and memorable as any you'd find in the turn-of-the-century glory days of the genre. It may be short and linear compared to other games in its niche, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly from start to finish.			"

												I very, very much enjoy this game. The writing is top-notch, I *love* the story, I love the art and atmosphere, I love the universe (anarchist Berlin with magic, guns, hacking, radioactive wastelands, and dragons/elves/trolls/orcs/dwarves? Sign me up!). The gameplay reminds me of the isometric games of old. The turnbased combat feels solid and has *just* enough tactical weight to feel fun.Most important of all is that I feel like my choices have weight. It's that intangible, hard-to-describe feeling that the decisions that I make are *real*, not just paths I am trundling down. Now, I know that behind the scenes that is exactly what is happening but I feel like the writing really does a great job of hiding it and making the world feel real. Same goes for the relationships with my fellow shadowrunners. HBS really has it nailed down. They have a vision and really stick to it. They are targeting a certain niche and they have hit a home run.If you like RPGs, if you like cyberpunk, if you like turnbased combat, if you like great writing, if you like cool 2D art, then you owe it to yourself to pick this up. One of my favorite RPGs of the last 5 years.P.S. - HBS really supports their games after release, too. I recently played through this for a second time after quite a while and I found extra story options added, new art, new dialog, a more stable game, etc etc. They don't just throw a game out and then ignore it. They should be lauded for their continued support. It made the decision to buy Shadowrun: Hong Kong a no-brainer.			"

												The best story I have ever experienced in a game. The effects your choices have on the world are massive, and you often have several ways to resolve situations, none of which are obviously good or bad. There's no voice acting, all of the story is told through reading text, and I jumped in terror at one point in the game. That's how good the writing is. I literally had nightmares about the story, and the effects my choices had. The characters in Dragonfall are some of the most memorable I have ever encountered in any medium - Glory is my favorite character in any videogame I have ever played. I haven't even mentioned the actual gameplay yet, which is also nearly perfect. Seriously, buy this game, it is amazing.			"

												My favourite RPG of 2014 and one of my all time favourites, Shadowrun Dragonfall signals the return of isometric RPGs and excellent, uncompromising writing.Gameplay: Evidently takes many cues from XCOM Enemy Unknown, you have Action Points (AP) which give you a limited number of actions you can do before the character must wait til the next turn. Not nearly as unforgiving as XCOM however, as your party is for the most part more than capable of tanking several shots without issue. Those familiar with the Shadowrun PnP game may also notice certain systems have been brought over, such as wounds which only allow you to heal the most recent attack. The combat system is also based on percentage values, including the melee, so there are probably times where characters will miss 85% shots, but on the other hand, will make 25% when you least expect it which makes for some tense situations provided you don't savescum. There are certain situations where you can utilize special skills such as Charisma in order to bypass a difficult situation, and even avoid fights outright.Graphics: Overall has a very simple, almost cartoon style theme. Characters have a model and a more detailed portrait to properly draw you into conversations. Environments are well done, and really capture the advanced tech/low life atmosphere of the Cyberpunk genre, as well as the strangeness of magic. Animations are simplistic, most of them you'll see while in combat, though if I had to list a complaint, it's that melee attacks have no weight or sense of speed behind them, and feel very unsatisfying to watch.Sound: The music is absolutely great, and again, captures the cyberpunk aesthetic with its low key and dark electronica. The tracks that really stand out however are the ones that incoporate different styles to properly the convey your situation. Combat sounds very visceral, with each weapon having a powerful sound to accompany it to make it that much more satisfying when you get a hit on an enemy, though the rifles sound a bit underpowered. There is no voice acting, which I feel is great since it adds to the immersion, and you can decide for yourself the tones, inflections and accents with which the characters speak.Writing: This is Shadowrun: Dragonfall's biggest strength, and the biggest reason why this is one of my favourtie RPGs ever. The characters are extremely well written, I guarantee you'll end up loving each member of the cast as you go through the story and get to know everyone, seeing them grow and change. Dietrich is a spitting image of a man from a bygone era, a living love letter to punk and an absolute badass that savours the good things in life. Glory is a runaway who turned to desperate measures to escape her past, turning herself into a killing machine, Eiger, a mountain of a woman and a former special forces operator, she gets the job done one way or another, and though you might butt heads at first, there's no one else you'd rather have in a gunfight. And it's not just the main cast that's well done, side characters have their own stories and personalities which offer you insight into not just the world, but also Shadowrun lore. The main story of Dragonfall is guaranteed to capture your attention and will leave you with some tough decisions which the game leaves up to you to decide whether it's good or bad.I cannot reccomend this game enough, and it's well worth it even at full price. Those of you who tend to look at the the game length to determine value should note that a full playthrough should take around 24 hours of game time, and add to that subsequent playthoughs where you can take different paths. I can't wait for Shadowrun Hong Kong, and what Harebrained Schemes will unveil in the future.			"

												Haven't played the other Shadowruns but only found good things about Dragonfall.An old fashioned rpg that has a futuristic cyberpunk setting.Pros:A wide variety of different roles that players can specialize in, music that is fitting and adds a lot to the environment, high details in the tilesets, custom made games by users, a nice story to tie everything together with multiple twists with decent numer of side quests, plenty of choices that add different consequences towards the ending of the game.Cons (all minor):Combat is turn based and can be somewhat slow with some strange hit percentages, no new game+, some skills being tied together (such as charisma being the prerequisite for conjuring/summoning), plenty of etiquettes not being used.Overall still a very solid game and would recommend to anyone who enjoys turn based rpgs with plenty of dialogue and options. After the main story I'd recommend trying some of the user-made campaigns.			"

												The game is long and immersive, the characters are nicely-rounded and at least 2 of your party members are not a dead weight/useless bullet attractors.The writing is solid, I've rarely been presented with dialogue options none of which I would prefer, and there aren't all that many exposition dumps: 2 or 3 throughout my 15 hour playthrough. The storyline progresses smoothly with rising and falling tensions and ties up nicely at the end. Not to say that there aren't occasional contrivances (""Help me! -- Okay, but I don't have the required X. -- Then I'm going to kill you!"" tier), but nothing as bad as, say, Pillars of Eternity nonsense. The gameplay itself is nice and functional, discounting the following: a) Pointing the mouse at an enemy and aiming at them are not always the same thing, especially with other characters in the way; b) no rotating camera on the horisontal axis, so you are stuck with one point of view (which leads to point (a) often than not); c) interaction animations are really long (it isn't noticeable when the dialogue prompt appears or the level transitioning occurs, but teeth-grindingly awful when you're picking up several items in a row, with the pickup animation being uncancellable and it messing up with your highlight mode). Everything else is, as I said, fine.Also, much better than Shadowrun Returns, although that's not too big of an accomplishment.			"

												This review is fairly late on my behalf, I finished the game quite a while ago so I may not be as descriptive as I could be. Firstly this game has many gamplay improvments over shadowrun: returns and if you enjoyed that game you certainly will enjoy this game as well. The reason I felt implored to write this review however is that the story of this game was simply amazing. At first I had my trepidatons, but there are so many characters to talk to an learn about that it kept me interested and pushed me to keep playing. The ending is where I feel I finally was rewarded, there is a level of depth and interest that strikes a perfect balance. I suggest this game, as well as the previous installment to anyone who has not tried them. Though I would suggest playing them in order of release.			"

												One of the greatest story driven games I have played recently. Dragonfall charmingly meshes fantasy and cyberpunk tropes into one amazing story that mixes the epic and grandious with very gritty and human experience. Gameplay serves to suppliment tension and risk, and adds a mechanical progression to non-combat aspects without being intrusive, but maintaining a sense of progression.Very much worth playing.			"

												Dragonfall is an excellent follow on to the first Shadowrun game.  Whereas the first one was a linear story, Dragonfall has a few ""side quests"" so to speak, but for the most part it is a linear story you follow.  The story is simply amazing and really sucks you into the Shadowrun world.  There is more interaction with your NPC's that made the game much more enjoyable.  Each NPC had their own side quest.  My only annoyances would be with the inability to equip/fully train NPC's (exception is the few skills you can assign to NPC during the progress of the game).  My main complaint is the incredibly horrible load/save times, inexcusable for a game of this simple graphics.  All things consider I highly recommend it, and will be picking up Shadowrun Hong Kong next time it goes on sale.Pro+Fantastic story that really drives deep into the Shadowrun world+Great turn based combat that puts you in different challenging positions throughout the whole game+NPC story lines+Lots of gray area decision making, where there was not always an obvious choiceCons-Game load times were incredibly slow for a game of this type, there was no reason for this-Inability to customize your ""party"" of NPC's, you cannot assign their points or pick their outfit-Inability to trade items to your NPC's during a mission (such as giving them a med pack)			"

												I still don't like the GUI in this game, even coming back to it again from Shadowrun Hong Kong.The story is decent, not much to complain about there. Campaign-wise the Shadowrun games are about as strong as they come, but they always leave you wanting more after you're done playing through them.The big problem with this developer is that they keep adding campaigns as new games. Dragonfall used to be a DLC to Shadowrun Returns, which was perfect and allowed community creators to use both Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall DLC content in their own campaigns.But then Dragonfall was moved to its own standalone release, breaking workshop content for Shadowrun Returns, forcing community creators to re-make their creations for the new game's GUI and particulars, and now with Hong Kong having been released these people are porting their creations over yet again.

They called this event... The DragonfallShadowrun: Dragonfall- Director's Cut manages to have an even more engaging story than it's predecessor, proper companions with great side stories, improved combat UI and an epic soundtrack. GameplayIf you've ever played an isometric RPG before, this is it. You point and click, moving your character around the environment. The combat system requires you to be tactical, no matter what difficulty you are on. You can't stay out of cover and only use single bullet attacks and hope to win every combat encounter- the last mission has some very tough encounters in particular. You construct your Shadowrunner around several different classes, which are the Street Samurai, Decker, Rigger, Mage and Shaman, each of whom have different starting builds and different proficiences. The game's replay value really opens up with not only that but the amount of different dialogue choices and branching paths throughout missions. In conclusion, another solid game in terms of gameplay from Harebrained Schemes. StoryAs someone who hasn't had the good fortune of playing the tabletop game, Shadowrun Returns and Dragonfall have been the perfect introduction to the world. Everything is very immersive and easy to get, and if you read all of the text, it offers a lot of insight to the interesting story. I won't spoil any of it here, but you have to play Glory's side quest to truly see the best of this great game. In conclusion, a great story that actually makes some deal of sense. Graphics, Atmosphere & SoundAnother solid presentation from the developers, with graphics looking just like you'd expect. The animations are good, though perhaps a few more might have made the now-dull seeming combat animations better. The atmosphere immerses you in the Dragonfall world. The last five-six hours I played, I played inside the world, essentially. It's all very well done, with all of the descriptive text and emotive language used within the dialogue bringing to life many of the characters. The decrepit places you end up going are very immersive, as well. The sounds of gunfire, magic and blood splattering are all clear and what you'd expect. It's the music that really brings the sound to top quality- I enjoy the sounds that they've managed to entwine into their songs, my favorites being primarily the main theme, Glory's theme, and the final boss' track. ConclusionIf you are at all a fan of RPGs, cyberpunk, lots of reading, choice and a great story, this game is very much worth at least a look, but it really should be a purchase. The asking price is not too high, the gameplay easy to pick up and learn, and the story really engages you. There's never been a better time to jack into the Matrix, folks!			"

In contrast to the first Shadowrun, there was a break in the story momentum - at some point you need to take several side missions to earn enough money to continue with the ""main"" story mission.

												Dragonfall was definitely worth the 5 bucks I paid for it during the Holiday Sale. A good game. 8/10 overall. If you're a fan of games like X-Com and FF Tactics then pick this up. Dragonfall does have its flaws but they aren't bad enough to make the game not worth playing.Now to the complaints: I'm pretty sure the RNG needs to be tweaked. As with any game when the chances to hit are 99% or lower, don't be too surprised when you miss. You wont make every 99% shot, but the amount of 90%-99% shots that I missed was ridiculous and incredibly frustrating. On normal difficulty it isn't bad enough to make you lose a fight over, but on harder difficulties missing 1 or 2 near 100% shots can really make you want to rage quit. There were also times when I would miss multiple coin-flip shots consecutively. Now this will happen with any game that uses an RNG, but if there isn't a flaw with this games RNG then I have extrodinarily bad luck. The pathing of my teammates was a HUGE pain in the♥♥♥♥♥at times. Sometimes I would direct my character to move a long distance across the map and run into an enemy on the way there and when combat starts half of my team has to spend 2 rounds catching up because they hadn't even started moving yet. Also, getting my team to position itself properly before opening a door to a room full of enemies was impossible. They move when they want to and stop when they want to and there's nothing you can do about it. Like with the RNG it's not a game ruiner but extremely annoying.At times during combat I would have trouble getting the game to select the enemy or tile that I wanted to move to because too many characters/objects are too close together. This could usually be solved by zooming the camera in but it's still annoying.Sometimes equipment will just disappear. I lost a grenade launcher and the most expensive deck (hacking device) in the game because of bugs. Even though I had the money to replace the deck I couldn't buy a new one because the game wouldn't let me equip it. Luckily it was near the end of the game and it didn't ruin the playthrough but if it had happened halfway through I would have had to start all over.Dragonfall is one of those really fun games with lots of minor flaws that add up to prevent it from getting a perfect score. Still an 8/10 isn't bad. In fact it's a damn good game. A great story with fun choices that effect the outcome, interesting characters with unique personalities and combat that never gets boring. If someone made a list of the Top 10 Indie games on Steam, I'd be surprised if Shadowrun Returns/Dragonfall wasn't on the list.			"

												Holy hell I bought this game on Wednesday and I had dumped 24 hours into it by Friday.The story in this game is dark and gritty and just amazing. Be warned that there is a TON of reading which normally puts me off, but in this game they just do it right. When one of your companions is telling you how she saw her mothers flesh blacken and melt from the fire she conjured to murder her father you just can't help but sink your teeth into it. Overall the game just feels like they hired a few graphic designers to illustrate their amazing story. Speaking of illustrations, most characters (even minor ones) get their own unique character portrait. I found myself reading through page after page of dialogue without ever once feeling the need to skip to the ""who do I need to kill"" part.The combat is completely turn based so if you love XCOM or Wasteland then you'll pick it up pretty quickly. Everything is about cover here. You often have to make the decision whether to put your mage on the ley line and boost their power (which is normally in the open) or to put them behind a box? Do you risk sending forth your melee specialist to hack some baddies up and face the wrath of their shotguns next turn? Make your choice and live with the consequences. I do have a few very minor gripes about combat though: first you can't take cover behind a door frame or corner and shoot around it, instead it counts as blocking terrain that no one can see or shoot through; also some of the spells looks like recolors of other spells which is a bit disappointing. Overall though combat is solid and even punishing on higher difficulties.Dark gritty atmosphere, tactical combat, and a refreshing new character development system give it a 10/10 in my book.			"

												First of all, the lore is refreshing. The turn based combat is well done. The story well written. It's not AAA title, no audio conversations, 3D visuals etc. So get your reading specs up, because you will need to read a lot. Great experience to be honest, sometimes wish it was even better in terms of visuals but it would take some of its charm away. Workshop campaigns can also be added to prolong this game. This is a fantastic addition.Highly recommended.			"

The combat, while a it could probably have been fleshed out a bit more, is still very fun to play. I mean common, you can have a mage tossing fireballs one second then an orc unloading an SMG into a robot the next. Then there's the story. There my be a few spoilers ahead, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. You start pulling what you and the shadow running team you're on think will be ""Milk Run"" or an easy job. Then things go crazy as you stumble into a world filled with danger and conspiracy. You will have to fight to keep you and your team alive. With a host of new enviroments and characters in this new addition, the atmosphere alone is worth your money.All in all I would give it a 92/100, see ya latter chummer's			"

												Truely one of the greatest adventure RPGs I've ever had the joy of playing.It's a little heavy on the reading but if you're into story driven RPGs then it's only a good thing because of the quality of the narative.Combat follows the tried and tested turn based action with your character's skills doing all the hard work of putting your plans into action.

												One of the best cyberpunk games I've played in a long, long time. It has everything you want in both a fantasy game and a cyberpunk game. Elves, Dwarves, magic spells. Political and corporate intrigue, a dystopian setting, cybernetic enhancements, hacking. SR:Dragonfall seemlessly blends these two disparate settings into one beautiful whole.			"

												I am quite a fan of this one. Much like the first game, you pick your race of Human, Dwarf, Ork, Troll or Elf, all with somewhat differing stat paramenters (male/females have same stats), pick your class, all with their own unique ability sets and stat priorites, and allocate your points how you want. Then, get thrown real quick into a weird but fun sci-fi cyberpunk fantasy mashup.The custimization is real, the amount of optional content and quests you can do are both extensive and rewarding, and there are various perks for being your class/race of choice via extra dialog options and commands and whatnot. You also get some choice about your teamates and how they level up, picking different perks for them as well to suit your playstyle better. Comat is turn based and strategic. Your teammates can hide behind obstacles (""cover"") to boost their defense against enemy attack, but enemies can do the same. Each class will help out in different ways: A street Samurai will weild their weapon of choice with finesse, a Rigger will send in their mechical robot for extra fire, a Mage will buff allies and throw magic, ect. Most characters can dabble in at least a few different cateogories so they won't be a one trick pony in combat, but becoming highly proficent at anything will take a lot of points and unlock a lot of perks (including the ability to wear the best gear and weapons for said category), so make sure you decide what you wanna do best. Resoruces in this game are somewhat limited. There are some glitches but the ones I have run into were minor and never game breaking (hey Mona fighting in the basement with me instead of Glory) and from what I can tell there is no stat ""rerolling"" so if you don't like your character's build you are stuck with it til you start a new game. I don't feel like any particular ability one can unlock is a ""trap"" and ends up being useless, but depending on your class some are less than ideal. But you should be able to beat them came as whatever you want, especially if you aren't playing on the harder difficulties. This is a very reasonably priced gem. Fans of the first one should pick this up, or any turn based/tactical RPG fan. .			"

												Fans of Baldur's gate and Icewind Dale, don't pass up on this game. It's great. I have not had this fun in years. I was not expecting to become so engrossed in the story and the dialogue choices which was always interesting and fun. The creators here are creative and obviously know the code to make this work. And in addition to the included campaign, you can download separate fan made stories. Can't wait for the third installation which is in development. Download now, you deserve it.			"

												Buy this game.  Buy it.  Seriously.So, already having played and beaten the regular version ... I was surprised to see a Director's Cut for what I already thought was a great game.  The DC has new missions that give more flavor to the setting of Shadowrun-Berlin , and they went out of their way to give dialog and flavor to some of the more tangent characters in the game.  It's really worth it.  They cleaned up some minor trifles in dialog options, NPC placement, and tidied up a few minor plot holes that most people gloss over (except nitpickers like myself). Buy it for the new missions and upgrade options for the team.  Not being able to distribute or upgrade my team was a downpoint for me in the original incarnation; that they took the time to go back and address that kind of thing when they already had a good enough selling product really speaks to the caliber of the company.  Good on them.  I will keep buying DLCs as long as they keep putting out this grade of work. Score: A+			"

												I suppose I need to state from the start that I'm a biased source.  I've loved Shadowrun since I first played it on the SNES, which led to the SEGA, which then led me to the source material.  So needless to say that I loved this game.I have to say that as someone who loved the source material that this game stays very true to that.  That's not a comment I make lightly.  The gameplay is pretty quick, the combat moves at a reasonable/fast pace, the mechanics are sound and balanced.  The main story and the side quests are solid, there aren't any large gaps or Deus Ex moments in the game.  I'm not normally a completionist, but I certainly played through the game a ridiculous number of times.			"

												First of all do not count my hours played on this version of the game as I played the DLC version on Shadowrun Returns for many hours.  That being said this campaign is leaps and bounds better than the one that came with the original game.  This is understable since they had just finished building their engine and wanted to get it out the door.  Dragonfall is the game refined if you will.  -More choices-More Characters-Better Writing-More Dragons!This campaign is what tactical rpgs are all about!  It sets the bar super high for their next endevor Shadowrun: Hong Kong and I look forward to it.  Anyway, should you buy this game?  Do you love Shadowrun?  Do you love tactical rpgs?  Did you like Shadowrun Returns freshman campaign but thought it could be more?  Well, guess what, this is more.  Yes, buy it!  You won't regret it! "

												i have much more than 1.3 hours playtime FYIi dont see what the big deal is, oh yea wait i do its hype and people are still caught up in it. ive only played it on my laptop so far but i gotta say. frustration is a big part of the gameplay style, throw in some mediocre graphics, its just another x-com/fallout tactics gameplay offspring but that doesnt make it good by default. apparently it does 87 meta critic score WTF are these guys cheating. i mean the game is ok but its not that good. not even by a little.i dont really care if they are a good dev team with common sense, it should be standard. it certainly doesnt impact the playability of the game.bad stuff in the game. includes tiny combat areas, linear story with no replay value or random generated combat areas, really frustrating save scumming is neccasary as the game hs no effective autosave like this. dumb economy its like they couldnt be bothered to do the maths or equip team gui for a normal economy and team managment and instead took the easy road. The cut scenes consist of two profile pictures having massive conversations in comic book language only the pictures never change, its boring and they really go on for like ever so if your normal and skip boring underdeveloped   cut scenes because you have more than 1 brain cell dont epect to get any kind of story line because you wont find one here. The death system is just so annoying for egsample the ammount of times you will finish a zone but your main charecter is incapasitated only to die and get game over because you have no more revive kits even though you just completed the zone is simply the most pointless experience you will have and relive for the duration of the gamegood stuff in the game. its steampunk pretty fun to look at. nice cybernetics upgrades in the doctors. its not full of bugs. even though you can only develop your own charecter it is a solid rpg based stats system and you can unlock quite nice powers along the way. i cant think of anything else but let me put it this way it is a pretty good game and has some excellent qualities but its not woah amazing its just mediocre so buy it if you wanna but dont expect 87 meta critic review to live up to expectations because it wont. i still recommend it as it is acctually quite good but offset by plenty of rubbish.

												Great Game, Having never played The tabletop version Nor the Original shadowrun returns I bought this game because there are not many tactics style games that i remember from my earlier days. Games such as Final fantasy tactics or Disgaea. I bought Xcom for the same reason but i didnt like it very much, I guess I set the bar too high but this game is one of my top tactics games now...well top 5 anyway, I bought this while I was waiting for Massive Chalice to be at a playable level and now I am hooked. I have only played the original story line once (And on Normal Too....) Since then I branched out into the Workshop items, Which i love and they look to be flourishing more now, this game will keep me tided over for a few hundred more hours yet. Great Buy. Great price. Look forward to hong kong....Or Shadowrun online..			"

The Npc-s are three Dimensional, with their own Background, Motivations, Agendas, and Personailities, fitting in perfectly with the Setting. I Haven´t Played Shadowrun since the 1st Edition Tabletop RPG and as Shadowrun Returns came out, I was happy to see the Franchise revitalized on PC. It was a good game, and it felt like Shadowrun. Dragonfall takes it a step further by immersing the Player more deeply in the Setting. Its a great Story-Driven RPG Experience, well worth your time!It is highly recommended to any RPG Enthusiast.

												It may be a little late to write a review for Dragonfall - especially when you own this game already for quite a while (like me). But I'm playing it again right now, so it may be still a good idea. Well, Dragonfall is not perfect. For instance it is quite difficult (perhaps even impossible?) to give objects from your inventory to one of your party members. Or the story, especially the Dragonfall story, is at times really cheesy when it's adoring and worshipping Monika and the romantic criminal life in anarchist Berlin. Don't get me wrong - Shadowrun IS a scenario which romanticises a criminal Robin Hood life. But neither in Dead Man's Switch nor in Hong Kong is it as obtrusive and embarassing as here.  I'm very much with Lucky Strike, a NPC runner which you can hire for missions, who is expressing just these thoughts. But - doesn't matter at all. Dragonfall has an unbelievable atmosphere, and as soon as you start the game you surrender to it. Having said that it HAS a lot of advantages. The story, though cheesy, is more detailed and more epic than the story of Dead Man's Switch. And even though the story of Hong Kong is probably even better, Dragonfall has by far the superior matrix system. And that, although the matrix of Hong Kong was supposed to be an improvement. Typical case of making things worse by trying to improve them. Worse to an amount that I stopped playing at some point and never bothered to start again. Also Dragonfall has a lot of excellent user campaigns in the Workshop. ""Antumbra"" for instance or ""Mercurial"" are real classics, and you don't see a difference to a professional campaign designed by the developers. Hong Kong has only one campaign, I believe. Don't know anything about it's quality. But six or seven or even more high class scenarios for Dragonfall compared to just one - that speaks out loud enough, don't you think? So, without any doubt Dragonfall is the best Shadowrun game for PC up to now. And having said that, I don't believe there are many games to follow. Shadowrun is a game system which definitely hasn't aged well. In a peculiar way it seems to have fallen out of time, and so probably Dragonfall will be it's ultimate legacy. At least as long as we talk about PC games ...			"

												Let me state something we already know: 2014 was not a good year for video games. Titanfall died within a month, Destiny was a bloated monstrosity, and the less said about Unity, the better. There were a few good games, but most were lost in the avalanche of crap. And through it all, this game was criminally undermentioned. Shadowrun Returns marked the franchise's glorious return to the video game scene. Although it had its problems, it was generally agreed to have been a good first attempt. Harebrained Schemes did it seems like less and less developers do nowadays and *listened* to the complaints of the players.And here we have Dragonfall. In a lot of ways, it plays a lot like a much linear Fallout 1 & 2. Isometric view, combat dominated by 'action points', and entire sidequests that can be completed earlier or bypassed entirely with the right skill/speech checks. Your comrades, the other mercanaries that make up your shadowrunner group, are also all very interesting characters with their own demons and reasons for being the way they are. One of the greatest things about the Director's Cut is where in the original Dragonfall they merely hinted at tying up some loose ends, in the DC you actually get to accompany them as they try to bury their past once and for all. Like Fallout? Get this. Like Cyberpunk? Get this. Fan of the Shadowrun tabletop of old? Oh, you better believe you should get this.			"

												I haven't finished the game yet, but so far I love it.+ Some of the best writing I've encountered in game so far, both story- and characterwise+ Cyberpunk Berlin is a fresh and fascinating setting, and as a german I am thoroughly charmed by how well done the ""german stuff"" in this game is.+ Great soundtrack+ Seems very balanced so far. I play on normal, and while combat is sometimes challenging it never felt unfair.+ Quests (or ""runs"") can usually be completed in more than one way, and often without violence.+ Plenty of ways to customize your character build.+ You get a lot of great content for your money+ Haven't encountered any bugs so farI could write more, but really all of these points have been mentioned by others, also I'm really tired so if you like rpgs with great stories this one is an easy recommendation.

												I just put 33 hours into beating this game and now I just want to play again. As other reviewers have mentioned, Dragonfall's story is *fantastic*. Finishing this game is like finishing a good book; you'll ruminate for the rest of the day about the characters you've connected. The game is very text-heavy, but there isn't really any tedious world-bullding/ lore-heavy reading, it's almost entirely conversational. The game is gorgeous; HBS did a great job building a really vivid cyberpunk world. What I like about the RPG system in this game is that it doesn't feel restrictive at all; you can branch into anything you want. The combat is fun, if sometimes a bit tedious. The main reason I'm inclined to play it again is that there are things I definitely things I missed/decisions that I made which I'd like to revisit. Overall, a fantastic game. with ~30 hours of story, it's easily worth 15 bucks. I got it on sale, but had I known I would enjoy it this much, I would've easily paid full price.			"

												First some background:  I played the Linux version.  I like RPGs, but have never played a Shadowrun game before.  I played the game maybe 20-30 hours (Steam thinks I played more than that because I left it going overnight a couple times).Shadowrun Dragonfall may have been my most pleasant gaming surprise this year.  I was expecting to try out a low-budget, rough experience (because indie game) with technical issues (because Linux).  Instead I found that this game was ton of fun, polished both technically and in gameplay/story.The Shadowrun universe combines Gibson-style cyberpunk (e.g. deckers, cybernetic augmentation) with traditional Tolkien fantasy tropes (e.g. magic, elves, dragons).  Some people might find the world too weird, but for me (and I suspect a lot of game players, who have experienced a lot of sci-fi and fantasy already), it was a refreshing twist.  The story takes place in a gritty city, which seems to be on the brink of chaos.  Different factions and corporations plot against each other for control.  Think Planescape: Torment meets Deus Ex.Besides a thought-prokoving setting, the game also has a well-written plot.  I don't want to spoil anything, but suffice it to say that the beginning of the game springs a plot-twist on you, and the intrigue builds from there.  There are often moral dilemmas without clear-cut right or wrong answers.  The plot builds to an exciting climax, and at the end I felt like my choices had real consequences.I also liked the gameplay, but I admit that some gamers will think this is the weakest aspect.  It's a straightforward turn-based campaign.  And in the past I've found turn-based games like Fire Emblem: Awakening or XCOM:Enemy Unknown to be boring and repetitive.  What saved the gameplay of Dragonfall for me were two aspects.  First, excellent pacing.  The game doesn't just give you wave after wave of enemy to mow down.  Most encounteries have some twist to them, or advance the plot or characterization---the game doesn't force unnecessary repetition on you just to pad the game's length.  Second, I enjoyed the character customization, which gives you plenty of flexibility.  For instance, my character was a physical adept, who used magic and cybernetic implants to run up and attack machinegun-toting enemies with a sword.  There's a lot of reply value---I'm curious how it would have played if I had focused on sniping, or casting magic spells, or controlling drones.About the technical issues, the game never crashed on me.  Other than one mission (involving a powerful computer system) which seemed a buggy, causing me to have to reply sections, I did not encounter any issues.  The game's art style is consistent and detailed and builds atmosphere well, but is all in 2D.  The interface was very streamlined and never got in my way, which is more than I can say about a lot of AAA games.  The soundtrack became a bit repetitive, but set the mood pretty well.  There was no voice-acting or animation.In summary, Shadowrun: Dragonfall has a well-written plot that takes place in an interesting setting.  Its turn-based gameplay appealed to me because of the good pacing and interesting RPG aspects.    You may not enjoy it if you're looking for innovative tactical gameplay.  And you definitely won't like it if you're looking for state-of-the-art graphics and sound.  However, you'll probably love it if you enjoy games that have good writing, setting, characters, and RPG aspects.			"

												Better than the first, high praise indeed, and the directors cut added a further handful of welcome features.- Functional character building systems that allow a range of tactical options. - Fun turn-based combat that doesn't grow tedious. - A more flexible approach to choosing missions and side-quests that the first game cried out for. - Most importantly, a narrative that is as well-written and evocative as the games licence is underappreciated. Someone needs to hand Hare-Brained Schemes the budget to create an 80+ hour campaign. What they have created with Dragonfall is as close to RPG perfection as a ~15 hour game can get.			"

												Dragonfall, like it's predecessor Dead Man's Switch, isn't for everybody, but if you're favor a good story with really credible characters instead of the common fancy looking (but usually dumbed down) RPG, you have to try this one. Some improvements on DMS, but mostly it's the same mechanics. The combat is similar to the last XCOM (streamlined classic turn based combat). The game isn't open world, but on the other hand, you probably have more impact on the story than in most ""open ended"" AAA titles. I play lots of games, but it was a while since I enjoyed the story and the characters this much. Similar to Deus Ex, depending on the character you play, most of the missions will/can unfold differently. What I found a bit lacking is the interaction with the environment. The maps are nicely drawn, but most of them feel sterile. No Ultima or Elder Scrolls-like messing with useless clutter in the levels. Not happens often, but when I finished the game, it was the same feeling when finishing a good book and regardless you finished, you still think about the world and the people you spent time with.Pros:- good story- fleshed out characters- decisions having an effect- streamlined combat (for newcomers)- visually appealing for an isometric RPGCons:- somewhat bland environments- could be more optional missions- streamlined combat (for people used to old school RPGs: no turning, no stance, no rate of fire etc.)Would you like it?If you prefer: story, slow pace, simple combat, missions allow different approaches - play it.If you prefer: action, 3D, fancy visuals, skipping text, casual, being the ultimate badass who always solves everything - forget about it.

												I have only just started playing this game, but might I say what a truly *phenomenal* effort by the developer into this product.  I greatly enjoyed the original pen & paper Shadowrun RPG back in the early 1990s while in university, and Dragonfall comes oh so close to recreating those old campaigns, in the present day, on the PC.  Can't wait to see what the rest of this game has in store for me, and, what the next game Shadowrun: Hong Kong will bring to the table. "

												Short review: this is the best RPG since Vampire: Bloodines. More similar to the old Fallout games (first and second one), I can honestly say this is better than those classics.Shadowrun Returns was a great effort at reviving Shadowrun, but it had some significant flaws. Dragonfall improves heavily on almost every aspect.If you're an RPG fan at all, you should just buy it.Need more? This game is a close 2nd place to Planescape: Torment for best writing in an RPG ever. Each mission feels unique, like each one was a carefully thought out pen & paper session. There are multiple solutions for every obstacle. There is a ton of optional content (there's an entire series of missions I never did because I absolutely loathed the party offering them, which I guess says something for immersion!). The most fleshed out and creative take on the approach to an end boss encounter I've ever seen.If you played Shadowrun Returns and thought it had some flaws, they fixed a lot of the problems;-Almost all of the combat skills are useful now (Shadowrun Returns was shotguns/rifles and nothing else). -You can now use your party members for skill checks.-You have (limited) development choice over your other party members.-Money is no longer ridiculously tight.-There are more opportunities for matrix running.-A little less linear.No really, you should buy this. Anything negative I have to say is just constructive criticism for the developers. I'll list that now.Negatives:-Matrix combat is still just a reskinned version of regular combat. Developers, all you have to do is literally just copy the matrix combat from the Sega Genesis Shadowrun game and you'll be golden.-There are still some loser skill paths (Shaman magic is inferior to mage spells, only 2 of the 8 social etiquettes are used all game).-I wish it gave you more control over your money and equipment loadout. The overall goal of the game is to raise a certain amount of money to pay off a character. A huge chunk of the money you make each mission is automatically set aside for this ""payoff fund"". You only end up getting to keep about 1/5th of the money you make each mission to spend. Your party members all have their own equipment that is upgraded automatically as the game goes on. While their equipment isn't bad, it's never the best of the choices you have to buy. Worse, you can't even buy better equipment and swap it out; their equipment is locked and all their weapon slots are usually full. I would have rather you got to keep more money from each mission and have the entire responsibility of equipping your party on you.-Combat difficulty, for the most part, is too easy. I was playing on Hard which was still too easy. It's mostly because the enemy AI is pretty bad. It never uses all its action points for attacking and will only attack once per round, like it HAS to both attack and move every turn. If enemies are in a good cover spot, instead of sitting there and attacking a bunch of times, they will attack once then move, often to an inferior position.The only combat challenges were missions where you don't get to use your full party and...cheese encounters. The most unfortunate aspect of combat is that the enemy ALWAYS gets the first turn, even in situations where you take them totally by surprise, like kicking in the door to a room where the enemy had no clue you were there. Snuck into a building and overhear through a door that a bunch of enemies are stoned and watching cartoons? They will still snap to attention and get an entire combat turn before your elite, alert team of mercenaries recover from the door kick. In fact, opening room doors is the single deadliest thing you will do. Your party will be bunched up outside the door because they're still in non-combat follow mode. Before you get a chance to spread out, the enemy will get to chuck several grenades and area effect spells at you. If they have mutliple mages, your party will mostly likely be completely crippled and dying before you even get to do anything.What's really annoying is those ""first turn cheese"" combat encounters prevent you from turning the difficulty up to the highest level, Very Hard, for a real challenge. Regular combat is mostly too easy on Hard, but if you crank it up to Very Hard then the first turn cheese encounters will wipe you out before you even get a turn. You can only change the difficulty from the main menu, so you can't just quickly lower the diffiulty for first turn cheese before turning it back up (well you COULD, if you wanted to sit through 5 minutes of quitting and reloading each time).I really hope their next game fixes the difficulty by making the AI smarter (all they have to do is not give up good cover and use all their actions points attacking when they're in a good spot) while getting rid of the enemies always getting first turn.-The wonky hit percentages of Shadowun Returns are still present. The game tells you your chance of hitting an enemy, but no way is the actual hit chance what it tells you. You will regularly miss five 80% chances in a row, while anything under 45% is pretty much a guaranteed miss. It's way too consistent to be bad luck. There has to be some kind of hidden negative modifier they don't tell you about (they start off fairly accurate then get less so as the game goes on, leading me to believe it's the enemy dodge skill that goes up as the game progresses). Wish they would fix this to accurately show the chance to hit.Seriously just buy it.			"

												This is a fantastic successor of the first Shadowrun RPG from HBS. The first one was fine as it were, but Dragonfall is near perfect on many levels. First and foremost: this game ""feels"" exactly like Shadowrun should feel, the world they created fits the atmosphere of Shadowrun perfectly. It is like playing one of the good (there are some mediocre ones around) shadowrun novels and for this, is simply absolutely enjoyable. It is a solid RPG with a convincing system of character advancement, a solid, Shadowrun typical story, and a nicely fleshed out environment. Of course ist is rather linear an not at all a shadowrun sandbox, but that is a) not a problem, because the game is great as it is and b) on the given budget just not possible. The grahpic presentation is really good, a fitting cell-shading / comic style approach, that depicts the entire shadowrun world nicely an with love and care for detail. Add a soundtrack that has a good futuristic ring to it paired with typical, well working atmospheric elements for danger / combat / bleak and eerie feel and voila - a great Shadowrun game it is! 10/10 from me - I honestly don`t know, how a Shadowrun game could do something decidedly better than what has been put together with Dragonfall. It could be larger, more open storywise etc. but these are aspects that are limited by the funds that were available to the devs. I can hardly wait for the next installment ""Shadowrun Hongkong""...

												I enjoyed this one and found it more memorable than Shadowrun Returns. Why? I'm not exactly sure. I played a melee character this time around and while he was weak at the start he was a beast by the end. The story is enjoyable but the way you are made to do side quests is extremely forced.+ The game looks great.+ Most of the side quests are fun, if forced.+ Enjoyed the story.+ The supporting characters are interesting. I especially liked Glory.- Forced side-questing.- Didn't find the matrix segments much fun.Playtime: ~ 28h8/10			"

												I was and am a big fan of SRR:Dragonfall. The game has some of the best writing I have ever seen in an RPG, the dialogue choices you make in the game can have an enormous impact, and while the RNG-based combat system sometimes almost forced me to chew on my keyboard in frustration, it nonetheless feels rewarding. Yet you could see, you could feel that some things just were missing from the game - The backstory of some character felt unfinished. Some dialogues were buggy and could be repeated ad nauseam. The combat mechanics, while not bad, could have had a bit more depth.In comes the director's cut. Glory now has her own run which explains her mysterious past. As do Eiger, Blitz, and even some characters that practically got no light in the original version, such as the shady Dr. Ekzibel. The combat system has been partially revamped, with the armor of characters now being a finite resource that can be stripped from enemies (and your own runners) by special attacks or plain old gunfire, drastically increasing the use of Glory's claws on the battlefield. Then there's UI changes, some new pieces of music, and even some new endings.In short, the director's cut solves the majority of the problems which Vanilla Dragonfall had. And given that Dragonfall itself already was one hell of a good game, the director's cut makes it fantastic.			"

												Having not played the original Shadowrun Returns, I bought this one because of the reviews saying this one was way better than the original. It is a fun tactical game, but I hope you like reading because it is very dialogue heavy. Also, if you want to be able to make use of any of the special dialogue options, you will most likely have to invest in a lot of the base skills like charisma, decking willpower and strength, otherwise you just have to play with what options are there by default.The game is definitely the type where you want to choose a specialty and stick with it if you really want to be good at anything. I tried to make a street samurai/decker combination and i ended up with a mediocre mix, with Blitz being a superior decker and my combat being on par with Eiger. Some of the combat can be tricky at times, but with the trauma kits the odds of dying are very slim.Without giving away anything, i think the best ending was essentially the bad ending. Most of the other endings were kind of tame and brief.			"

												This game is quite good. Not perfect, but even having just finished the game, I am already second guessing decisions much, much earlier in my playthrough and wondering how things would have gone at the end if I had chosen differently.The tactical turn based combat is well done. I really like how they implemented decking as well; it's basically a second parallel cyberworld going at the same time as the ""real"" world, but at 2-3x the speed; so, when a character is decking, they get a few turns in the system for each turn of tactical shooting in real time. It's a nice way to implement that idea.Looking forward to Hong Kong now.			"

												This game was brilliant.  The characters are deep and very well written, the story is intriguing and entertaining, and the combat is fresh and fun.   Dragonfall is an improvment to this series in all aspects.  The UI is easy to understand and looks much crisper than in Returns. My only issue with the game is that I think the hit percentages are off. There were multiple instances of having a 99% chance to hit and I would miss multiple attacks in a row.  Thats it....the one thing that stopped this game from being perfect.Do yourself a favor and buy this game. It is well worth your time and money			"

As a result, unlike the previous game I wasn't bummed out about the fact the game is pretty linear. There's some customization to your party members which is a welcome improvement from the last game. All the various skills and combat abilities are more fleshed out and useful. Can't wait for the Shadowrun Hong Kong game.			"

												Shadowrun has always been a franchise I wanted to get into, but after trying the Xbox 360 shooter and experiencing a bit of shellshock from the learning curve, followed by a pretty powerful craving for turn-based strategy, good storytelling and a mix of science fiction and fantasy, I decided Dragonfall was the train to hop on. The theme of races underlying the main story arc is one of my favorite aspects so far, as social and racial discrimination is something I would like to see games discuss more. It is done extremely well here, and the characters are all fascinating, and the way that your character can tie into the overall narrative makes the game feel much more immersive than one would perceive at first glance. Another hugely entertaining feature is the setting. The German interspersed throughout the dialogue makes for unique conversations in the game and the use of distinct language for each character gives them their own personalities, and the things that are part of their backgrounds make them unique. This is not the typical role playing crew that the player works with, instead they have identities that make you care about them and what they think about you. Not being able to please them leaves you yearning to try again, and not many games are capable of making a person care so much about fictional personas.Lastly, the tactical gameplay is brilliant. Fans of Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics would be right at home, and would be delighted to see the seamless transition of narrative exploration to combat, and how efficient the design of the flow of gameplay works. It makes the game addictive and purposeful, as preparation for combat has a meaning behind it, and that's something I often found tedious about other strategy focused titles I have played. For 15 dollars, this is a steal of a game, better than most of the games I have payed 50 plus dollars for. If you're on the fence about this game, give it a try, because this harkens back to the best RPGs have ever had to offer, and it will not cost you as much as those games often do.			"

												A great follow up to Deadman's Switch (the original Shadowrun Returns campaign) Hairbrained Schemes (HBS) once again delivers!  Another well thought out plot that is arguably better than the first.  More emphasis on the runners (party members) that you keep around as part of your close-knit team and that's ok with me!  It realy allowed for a feeling of comradery.  Another 15(ish) hour campaign, coupled with UI, combat, balance and other various improvements, HBS knocked another one out of the park.  I simply cannot wait for their next installment in the Shadowrun universe.			"

												I had a great deal of fun with this game. I'm not sure that I would dive back in any time soon, but it grabbed me and kept me moving forward like few games manage to do in a world of countless options.I loved the Shadowrun setting, and found Berlin to be an intersting backdrop for the story to take place. With the added cotent found in the Director's cut your character's party members feel like fully realized aspects of the story rather than just extra chess pieces to move about in combat. In truth I feel like the strongest part of this game is its narrative, while the mechanics do their best to keep some options and sense of growth layered into your story progress it seems all to easy to fall in to rote patterns of engagement for just about any combat. I rarely felt the need to shake up my party composition, and gearing up felt rather shallow as an expereince. There were certainly options to be had, but when I found one that worked nothing pushed me to mix it up. At best I would just check the shops for the next ""tier"" of the same spell, armor, grenade, etc.In short I recommend this game to you for its: Strong writing, intersting cast and setting, accomindation for varied styles of play, and a game engine that tries its best to stay out of the way of the previously mentioned items.

												Loved every second of it.  Really captured the Shadowrun vibe I remembered from PnP days perfectly, and the combat was enjoyable and deep enough.  Only minor quibbles - the Chi skill tree for Physical Adepts seems underpowered, it was too easy to miss at point blank range even with very high skill in Shotgun, and on Very Difficult using NPC deckers was frustrating in a couple spots.  Seems like the balance of combat skills could use some tweaking but it was still fine.  A great game and gives me high hopes for SR:Hong Kong.			"

												Extremely gorgeous game; the isometric view left a lot of flexibility for the artists to create truly interesting backgrounds.The story is great, with some interesting moral choices to be found not only in the main storyline but also in the optional objectives.The writing and exposition could use some work, but given the sheer volume of it I am more than happy to dismiss that.The combat is very fun and harsh should you make a mistake, but there is an excellent 'rewind' save system so you never lose too much progress. Each class has a plethora of unique abilities and each encounter is very satisfying.Some dialogue trees feel empty and limited, and occasionally you are forced to make arbitrary decisions or are given choices with regards to certain situations that you are never given again, even in the same situations; for example, I was occasionally given the option to 'look from the astral plane' down onto a keypad to see which keys are contained in a passcode, but sometimes I was not. When and where I could use this ability on a keypad was completely arbitrary. Similar situations to this one are frequent in dialogue and decision trees.The game has some UI issues resulting from being designed to be played on a tablet, such as occasionally moving your units to an incorrect spot and wasting an action point. Other than those points, I highly recommend this game.			"

												This is a really great turn-based strategy game. The tactical strategy by the player has to be thought out to some degree, such as hiding behind walls, crates, etc to avoid enemy fire. The leveling system is fun, giving some pretty good advances to the character, like new special attacks, or, my favorite, drone upgrades. The storyline is actually very good, however there is a lot of reading involved if you want to really digest the complexity of the story. But the dialogue is good and the characters are a lot more personal in this sequel than they were in the first game. The battles can be a bit more tedious, especially one in near the end, where the battle lasted about 20-30 minutes and there was no way of ending it sooner. There also is not a lot of exploration or loot involved for those who like to go digging and finding items, treasures, etc. But one of the positives that makes up for it is that you can choose quest endings, or even betray a whole team you agreed to help to kill them, take their money, and still finish the quest. These options that the player can choose really add to the immersion of the game as you can make decisions that hurt the team or make them happy.Overall I would give this game a 7/10. Definitely recommend purchasing it, especially when on sale!			"

												1st 10 hours of the game was so-so, things were very linear. The REAL DEAL is the next 15 hours - incredibly difficult decisions to make. Affects the outcome and my soul :DBig plus for giving teammates story and personality, making them less like a random hired-gun I don't care. Love that team leveling up screen - choose 1 out of 2 skills to advance. This provides me a lil bit of control without having to micromanage everyone. I can't be bothered to plot 20 points into 5 different skill trees. (In other games I will usually click on the ""auto-level up"" button and tweak from there)     Overall a big improvement compared to Shadowrun Returns. "

												This is a fantastic tactical RPG, and absolutely the most ""Shadowrun"" video game I've ever played. It gets the feel of being a runner just right -- you're constantly in danger, constantly in the dark, and never sure when you're ahead of the game and when you're just a pawn.If you played the original Dragonfall, this is an enhanced version of that game, so don't go into it expecting an entirely new experience. It is, however, substantially enhanced, and is worth playing even if you've already played the original. There are several new missions, some of which allow you to explore the backstories of your team members, and quite a bit of new dialogue and character interaction. In terms of gameplay, the changes are iterative and not revolutionary; this is still fundamentally the same game as Shadowrun Returns. But basically all of the changes are good -- the game displays more precise information in a more compact form, and that enables you to make better in-combat decisions. The new armour system is also a plus, adding a bunch of new strategic depth to both equipment selection and combat itself. The game still badly needs some form of ""undo move"" option for situations in which you intend to attack a target and accidentally click the hex next to it, though. In my experience, there is only one significant bug in this game, but it's a frequent occurance and quite annoying: periodically, when in the matrix, it will become impossible to interact with the world for a short while. The UI will still accept input, so you can open menus and whatnot, but there's no way to target anything. Usually opening and closing the menu a few times appears to clear it up, but it's still irritating. The game also appears to become a bit unstable if it's been running a long time, and the AI starts behaving a bit erratically. This also resulted in my once having to reload from an old save because, after combat, the game switched to ""neutral turn"" and never emerged.Overall, this game is a definite improvement over the original Shadowrun Returns, and is very much worth a play if you have any interest in tactical RPGs, even if the ending is a bit of a flop.

												Short review: this is the best RPG since Vampire: Bloodines. More similar to the old Fallout games (first and second one), I can honestly say this is better than those classics.Shadowrun Returns was a great effort at reviving Shadowrun, but it had some significant flaws. Dragonfall improves heavily on almost every aspect.If you're an RPG fan at all, you should just buy it.Need more? This game is a close 2nd place to Planescape: Torment for best writing in an RPG ever. Each mission feels unique, like each one was a carefully thought out pen & paper session. There are multiple solutions for every obstacle. There is a ton of optional content (there's an entire series of missions I never did because I absolutely loathed the party offering them, which I guess says something for immersion!). The most fleshed out and creative take on the approach to an end boss encounter I've ever seen.If you played Shadowrun Returns and thought it had some flaws, they fixed a lot of the problems;-Almost all of the combat skills are useful now (Shadowrun Returns was shotguns/rifles and nothing else). -You can now use your party members for skill checks.-You have (limited) development choice over your other party members.-Money is no longer ridiculously tight.-There are more opportunities for matrix running.-A little less linear.No really, you should buy this. Anything negative I have to say is just constructive criticism for the developers. I'll list that now.Negatives:-Matrix combat is still just a reskinned version of regular combat. Developers, all you have to do is literally just copy the matrix combat from the Sega Genesis Shadowrun game and you'll be golden.-There are still some loser skill paths (Shaman magic is inferior to mage spells, only 2 of the 8 social etiquettes are used all game).-I wish it gave you more control over your money and equipment loadout. The overall goal of the game is to raise a certain amount of money to pay off a character. A huge chunk of the money you make each mission is automatically set aside for this ""payoff fund"". You only end up getting to keep about 1/5th of the money you make each mission to spend. Your party members all have their own equipment that is upgraded automatically as the game goes on. While their equipment isn't bad, it's never the best of the choices you have to buy. Worse, you can't even buy better equipment and swap it out; their equipment is locked and all their weapon slots are usually full. I would have rather you got to keep more money from each mission and have the entire responsibility of equipping your party on you.-Combat difficulty, for the most part, is too easy. I was playing on Hard which was still too easy. It's mostly because the enemy AI is pretty bad. It never uses all its action points for attacking and will only attack once per round, like it HAS to both attack and move every turn. If enemies are in a good cover spot, instead of sitting there and attacking a bunch of times, they will attack once then move, often to an inferior position.The only combat challenges were missions where you don't get to use your full party and...cheese encounters. The most unfortunate aspect of combat is that the enemy ALWAYS gets the first turn, even in situations where you take them totally by surprise, like kicking in the door to a room where the enemy had no clue you were there. Snuck into a building and overhear through a door that a bunch of enemies are stoned and watching cartoons? They will still snap to attention and get an entire combat turn before your elite, alert team of mercenaries recover from the door kick. In fact, opening room doors is the single deadliest thing you will do. Your party will be bunched up outside the door because they're still in non-combat follow mode. Before you get a chance to spread out, the enemy will get to chuck several grenades and area effect spells at you. If they have mutliple mages, your party will mostly likely be completely crippled and dying before you even get to do anything.What's really annoying is those ""first turn cheese"" combat encounters prevent you from turning the difficulty up to the highest level, Very Hard, for a real challenge. Regular combat is mostly too easy on Hard, but if you crank it up to Very Hard then the first turn cheese encounters will wipe you out before you even get a turn. You can only change the difficulty from the main menu, so you can't just quickly lower the diffiulty for first turn cheese before turning it back up (well you COULD, if you wanted to sit through 5 minutes of quitting and reloading each time).I really hope their next game fixes the difficulty by making the AI smarter (all they have to do is not give up good cover and use all their actions points attacking when they're in a good spot) while getting rid of the enemies always getting first turn.-The wonky hit percentages of Shadowun Returns are still present. The game tells you your chance of hitting an enemy, but no way is the actual hit chance what it tells you. You will regularly miss five 80% chances in a row, while anything under 45% is pretty much a guaranteed miss. It's way too consistent to be bad luck. There has to be some kind of hidden negative modifier they don't tell you about (they start off fairly accurate then get less so as the game goes on, leading me to believe it's the enemy dodge skill that goes up as the game progresses). Wish they would fix this to accurately show the chance to hit.Seriously just buy it.			"

												By far the most fun I've had playing a turn based strategy game in a long time.  Re-playability still being tested.--The Good- The gameplay was intuitive and (with a handful of exceptions because Trolls are tall) fluid.- Soundtrack was always on point with the 'feel' of the gameplay.- Despite being 2D the game's graphics grabbed me; sprites and backgrounds were bright without falling prey to being cartoony, or dark without being drab.  Most of the time it didn't even register with me that the game wasn't 3D.- Both micro (battlefield) and macro (character-building and story based decision making) decisiosns felt like they influinced the other in a variety of ways.- Storytelling was top-notch from the over-arching tale down to several NPC's stories.--The bad- Unable to re-size fonts, and high reolution with a ton of reading made me need to walk away a few times.- Game-play challenges do not come from AI, but from volume of opponents - this frustration is not unique to this game, and it does not suffer from it as badly as many others, but it is still present.- While Karma was balanced (Never felt like 'super-man'), money was never in short supply.  I frequently used combat drugs, always updated my gear, and yet I always felt like I was in the black... even though one of the main points in the game involves scrambling for money.--The Ugly- The only major frustration I had was mis-clicks that resulted from trying to move my team to squares immediatly above other actors.  For about 1/3rd of a second it shows movement to that square, then it highlights the (again, drecking Trolls) sprite in the square beneath my real selection.			"

												Thouroughly great. An original story, in an original setting, with great environments.Shadowrun: Dragonfall even includes some interesting moral quandries not often found in RPGs, and even lets you play them out. Its attention to detail in every regard, from loading screen text, dialog choices, and little clues along the way, make every outcome feel like its own reward.If you play a certain way, combat can get easy towards the end, but frankly this might be a welcome respite given how hard it can be early on. In this way, it reminded me of Final Fantasy Tactics.All in all, a new perspective on tactical RPGs, and a great one at that. Here's hoping for many more.			"

												Not Quite as good as Returns. The Gameplay is much improved but the whole ""save the world from everything and everyone"" feels distinctly not very shadowrunny. And the overall story arc is far too grand for me, Without spoiling there were parts of this game where I felt very distinctly that I was no longer a shadowrunner, too many missions done for nothing, the entire game is a revenge quest which doesn't make sense in the shadowrun world where death is the only consant.That's not to say it's all bad I Loved the hub based missions but I felt like they were not exploited to their fullest potential, and felt more like a filling mechanism than an actual game mechanic. If I were to change anything about this game I would make that part significantly longer, in fact I would make it the main point of the game rather than an ancillary action you take while waiting for the game to end. Overall I would recommend the game, anyone who enjoyed the first will enjoy the second thanks to it's marvelously improved combat but it's story leaves a lot to be desired.			"

												This is a really great expreince for CRPG players!I have allot of fun with this game it always bring me back to finish the game as the story, gameplay and the interactions in the game kept me going. The story telling of this game is fantastic, the combat is fun but not great (combat need to have allot more interactions within the environment and more combat options as there aren't that much and sometimes there are bugs on combat especially during loading a save game) but it's the gameplay (interactions with dialogue, companions conversations, environment ect.) and the story that really kept me going to finish this game. One thriller game I'd say! One of the best CRPG games I have played in 2014! P.S - I cannot wait for Shadowrun: Hong Kong!			"

												Has all of the storyline and subtlety of the classics with a streamlined interface and intuitive micromanagement. Role-playing done the right way, with a lot of emphasis on who your runner is and how they get things done- both within your party and without. Not a loose tie-in, but fanatically faithful to the lore of the setting.There are flaws, misteps, and the occasional bug, but it does nothing to dim the overwhelming appeal.  10/10			"

												It's like Shadowrun Returns with some extra additions. I liked the original campaign a little more than the previous game. It gave me a feeling of Fallout 1 or 2. I also loved the variety of weapons and especially those miniguns. Awesome power and gore resulting effects.The game also continues having the usual long text descriptions and dialogs, which is cool from one perspective, as you feel like playing a PnP RPG, with a very descriptive DM, but on the other hand you get a little bit tired of reading.Anyway, this game is recommended, like the previous one.

												If you look past the faulty game play, the story is very intriguing. It helps you get immersed in the game, but the reward system is a threshold to overcome, especially in the beginning of the game. I am a veteran RPG-player and I am used to scavenge the corpses of the enemy characters for money and loot, but I was denied this pleasurable game concept here. To read all the conversations is tedious work and some of them are very long. Sometimes I had the feeling that I was reading a science fiction novel and playing in between. The story has classical thriller elements and surprising moments, which involve you emotionally. It also presents you with very interesting moral dilemma’s, where you have to make choices that have little to do with immediate rewards or missions objective. ( I wonder if they got this concept from DOS…) So you could say that what ever the game lacks in gameplay, it compensates by good story telling. Long story short for a low budget production, this is a great game.			"

												Best RPG I've played in a long time, though it hit a snag when I had to replay a later mission THREE times due to a bug with quicksaving. After I came back and beat the rest of the game, I was less angry, but that really killed the momentum.It was a great experience besides that, with the writing alternating between badass and hilarious, almost always hitting the mark at whatever it was attempting. Not quite up there with Planescape, but very good. You can roleplay many different kinds of characters, and generally no matter what you choose there's unique ways to solve problems or get hidden dialogue. There's some moral choices to make, and unlike the newer Fallout games, they're actually more interesting than a choose-your-own-adventure novel. The endings are pretty dramatically different in their consequences, but all could reasonably be chosen by a ""moral"" player.Combat is pretty entertaining, though the AI is dumb sometimes and the game's still a bit too easy on Hard difficulty. The earlier missions were balanced, but I steamrolled the last two. Almost every mission has at least one exciting twist which keeps things interesting, eg your team has to fight security while your hacker character battles another hacker in cyberspace for control of the turrets, etc. You will not be bored.Although the character archetypes are quite different, customization is sort of impractical beyond picking 2-3 key skills and pumping them for the whole game. Your teammates also manage their own gear and stats, with some limited skill choices on your part. No complaints about that actually, it makes sense and works pretty well. You can hire temporary mercenaries for missions to replace them, but there's absolutely no reason to because it costs money, they're not noticeably better, and you miss out on dialogue. Overall, Dragonfall doesn't have the technical depth of Wizardry, Diablo II, or even Final Fantasy. The main draw of the game is the setting and the various ways you can react to it, not min-maxing.I beat the game ~100% in about 30 hours, which is pretty decent, but for some reason it still feels short. I wish you could get more small shadowruns, like the Genesis game had, in addition to the handful of long and detailed jobs that make up this one. There's all these systems - the jobs list, the online message board, the character progression - that give the illusion of a big world, but ultimately there's a limited amount of money and stat points in the game, and you don't have that much agency in where you go. At least the modding tools could potentially put the engine to fuller use. As it is, Dragonfall is great, but there's some wasted potential also.Overall, judging just on the base campaign, Dragonfall is an easy recommendation. My only real hard complaint is those damn bugs. It's important that you be able to trust the game not to break when you do something wrong, or you know, save.			"

												Very good RPG which does a damn good job immersing you in the Shadowrun setting. Interesting story as well. Definitely a better game than Returns, and being a Kickstarter backer the money spent has been very well worth it.You get immersed in the story, your nuyen (credits) aren't infinite and you have to carefully upgrade your skills. Spreading your karma (skill points) too wide can gimp your character and it is heavily recommended to focus on 1-2 ""combat groups"". Combining decking with rifles is doable, but if you also spend points elsewhere you might not get the abilities and hit percentages needed for later. It is thus best to basically focus on two main attributes (Strength, Quickness, Willpower, Intelligence, Charisma) and a subset of combat skills of attribute chosen. One big minus in my opinion though is that Charisma attribute is very useful as high Charisma unlocks some powerful persuasion options throughout the game. While you can easily play without spending points in Charisma, I felt that higher Charisma would have made my playthrough much more enjoyable.Combat is nice and simple, but it has some flaws. First is that at times you have no idea if an enemy is within line of sight and I often place a character in a position where he logically should have a line of sight, yet he is not which can screw up your tactics. A visual aid of some kind would have been nice. Second, you should be able to enter turn-based/combat mode yourself, as a few times I have managed to sneak up on an enemy and other times you know there are enemies around the corner or behind the door (like after hacking security cameras, revealing their presence). Getting my team in position that way would have been pretty good.Looting. When you pick up items during runs, you can only add them to your own inventory or send to your stash. An option to give some items to your fellow runners would have been welcome.Dialogue is for the most part good, with numerous dialogue choices and options. Depending on what skills you have, you can get extra dialogue options too, like higher Biotech can give insight into medical info, whereas Strength can be used to intimidate or Charisma to charm. Charisma also gives etiquette perks which unlocks extra dialogue for certain categories like Shadowrunner, Street, Gangs etc. There are a few dialogue choices where you can use fellow party members to do a task, but too few. You should have been able to use party members' skills in dialogue too if your own character is not able to, like using shaman to resolve magic-related dialogue options if required skills are there.The missions themselves are pretty good and you usually have different ways to do them. How you do them will not change the story progression, but will have an effect on what rewards you get and how your party members react.Overall, the game is fun and challenging and the choices you make have some consequences but not gamechanging though. If turn-based RPGs with thought-out dialogue and stories is your thing, Dragonfall is heartily recommended.			"

												One of the greatest RPG experience of the last few years setted in a unique, beautifully, crafted world with some truly well written characters and dialogues, an engaging, thrilling and mysterious plot for an all around basically perfect game.A down note that doesn't concern the game: it would be nice to be able to play the old Shadowrun Return ""Dead Man's Switch"" campaign on the updated engine without messing with the files of the games.Other than that I'd like to thanks the developers of this beautiful game, you people really made something amazing.

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a cyberpunk top down tactical RPG.Summery: Shadowrun is an old school style RPG with turn based grid combat and a heavy emphasis on story. The Story: The story is compelling and well written. The game provides many dialogue trees and allows you to make tons of decisions. Even without any voice acting the characters and their backstories left an impression and i found myself coming up with voices for them in my head. No bad voice overs or poor performances here folks! The amazing lore of this game melds sci fi cyberpunk with magical fantasy concepts. Ever wanted to create a machine gun wielding troll who uses robot drones? What about an elf hacker who can make contact with the spirit world? What about a katana wielding street samurai who can use explosives and spells? Well now you can!The graphics: The fidielity is nothing to brag about but the artstyle is 100% gorgeous. I loved exploring this cyberpunk world. The world is run-down and trashy yet beautiful and full of detail. Everything from dilapidated apartment complexes to corporate laboratories have been masterfully crafted.Its obvious the artists put care into creating these stellar enviroments and character portraits. The game is a beautiful work of art. The Gameplay: While not as deep or complex as other tactical RPG's the gameplay here provides depth without overwhelming the player with overly complicated concepts. You level up and buy gear. you create a class and try to capitalize on its abilities. Your party members can fill in the gaps, and depending on who you take on a mission things can go a variety of ways. The mission design is nice because almost everything has multiple solutions that are determined by the skillset of your team of shadowrunners. A hacker can bypass security and jack into the matrix giving you more options. A shaman can interact with the spirit world, talk to ghosts and even summon entities to the battlefield. Some classes specialize in droids and drones that can provide heavy combat support or enter small vents that humanoids have no access to. The outcome of your mission is not only determined by the classes but also the personality of your character. Many confontations can be avoided simply by saying the right things and convincing people that you aren't a threat. This doesn't just depend on a stat based speech check like many other RPG's. It also depends on the species and peronality traits of your character. Some characters are experienced with the streets and have an easier time interacting with gangsters and runners. Other personalities are more corporate or security/law enforcment oriented. This means your character will be able to say different things based on his/her personality. The music: Both the ambient and combat music are some of the best i have ever heard. The soundtrack sets the tone perfectly and is honestly a highlight of the game. Many missions have unique music specifically designed for that location. This means that you won't have to hear the same songs excessively often like in most other games. You could easily listen to the music outside of the game and still be amazed. This is one of the best game soundtracks on the market! The verdict: This is a near perfect game and a must-own for any shadowrun fan or cyberpunk junkie. Even though i loved shadowrun: returns i must say that Dragonfall is a vast improvement. If you dislike tactical turn based RPG's then maybe give this one a pass but you will be missing out on one of the greatest and polished lore universes of all time. I give this one a BIG thumbs up!

												Don't try to play it unless you want to spent ~30 hours with it! Highly addictive! More runs, weapons, enemies... everything! The story gets less linear, so save your game progress,  because you may want to try to do some things in a different way again. Action scenes are more complex. Expect to be more tactical than in the Shadowrun returns predecessor. Expect to use magic, explore matrix and hack machines. Expect to die, accept your own mistakes and try again. The graphics may look like from previous millennium, but you will not even notice it during game play. One small disappointment is the reading experience. All the dialogs are happening in too small text area.			"

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is one of the best RPG's I've ever played in my 15 years of RPG gaming. Shadowrun Dragonfall does Shadowrun right, eschewing cliches and setting the game in 2054's Berlin for a change of scenery.The engine has been polished since ""Shadowrun:Returns"" and it actully lets you save the game now instead of resetting all your progress when you eat a bullet RNG style. Combat is turn based vastly improved upon in the games newer engine. If you enjoy tactical combat, a unique and mature story, and memorable characters with a vibrant cyberpunk flavor Drgaonfall will not disappoint you.   "

												This review is related to the Shadowrun: Dragonfall director’s cut (my review of the older version is together with the Shadowrun Returns, as the older version accounted hours in that game). This version of the game brought some modifications to the older version that significantly changed the gameplay, in some ways for better and in other ways for worse.The new missions included were very nice, besides giving you the opportunity to gain more karma and increase your stats to a higher level by the end of the game. I really liked the missions entering into the story line of the team characters, something that I missed in the first version. Also, the additional ending that allows you to complete the project is really really nice. It definitively made my replaying of the game worthy. Finally, now you can improve certain characteristics of your team mates to make them less useless in combat (most of them still pretty useless in the hardest difficulty, but it was an improvement).However, the new rule for critical hits really sucks… You cannot give a critical hit when your target has any cover. So, you have to break their cover somehow in order to deliver significant damage - by unbalancing them, hitting them on melee, whatever… In the hardest difficulty level, this new rule made the combats last an eternity (and not more difficult), especially on the final part, which has a lot of enemies and the first thing they do is take cover. I hated this modification as it made the final part of the game boring. Even though, the game still great to play and the history lines should please any Shadowrunner fan. Definitively worth playing.			"

												This is a fantastic tactical RPG, and absolutely the most ""Shadowrun"" video game I've ever played. It gets the feel of being a runner just right -- you're constantly in danger, constantly in the dark, and never sure when you're ahead of the game and when you're just a pawn.If you played the original Dragonfall, this is an enhanced version of that game, so don't go into it expecting an entirely new experience. It is, however, substantially enhanced, and is worth playing even if you've already played the original. There are several new missions, some of which allow you to explore the backstories of your team members, and quite a bit of new dialogue and character interaction. In terms of gameplay, the changes are iterative and not revolutionary; this is still fundamentally the same game as Shadowrun Returns. But basically all of the changes are good -- the game displays more precise information in a more compact form, and that enables you to make better in-combat decisions. The new armour system is also a plus, adding a bunch of new strategic depth to both equipment selection and combat itself. The game still badly needs some form of ""undo move"" option for situations in which you intend to attack a target and accidentally click the hex next to it, though. In my experience, there is only one significant bug in this game, but it's a frequent occurance and quite annoying: periodically, when in the matrix, it will become impossible to interact with the world for a short while. The UI will still accept input, so you can open menus and whatnot, but there's no way to target anything. Usually opening and closing the menu a few times appears to clear it up, but it's still irritating. The game also appears to become a bit unstable if it's been running a long time, and the AI starts behaving a bit erratically. This also resulted in my once having to reload from an old save because, after combat, the game switched to ""neutral turn"" and never emerged.Overall, this game is a definite improvement over the original Shadowrun Returns, and is very much worth a play if you have any interest in tactical RPGs, even if the ending is a bit of a flop.

												where to begin, Harebrained studios has deffinatelly upped their game.I'm told that Dragonfall was origionally going to be an expansion for Returns, I'm glad they made it stand-alone, because it does stand alone. it has been some of the best Shadowrun experiances I have had outside the pen and papper games I love.so what's in the tin? 41 hours of single player campaign, that's how long I played it. according to steam anyway, a couple of restarts in that, but the single player campaign is epic. it did have some moments where it started to feel like it was grinding down to a crawl, but it was always a worthwhile moment at the end of the run, very few happy ones, but such is the world of Shadowrun.The biggest let down for me playing the game was that my character didn't work, in pen and paper I play a Face, I talk, I bribe, I swindle and I intimidate. I solve problems with my brain and my mouth, and when it goes sideways I bring along an old friend of an LMG to bark a little louder. that doesn't quite work in this game, skills like ""intimidate"" are nowhere to been seen, there are ocasional etiquete and charisma checks in runs, but not every run, and I never had a run that didn't go squirrelly and end up with blood spilt. but that didn't take away from the fun too much, and I can see why they did it, that was always one of the problems, when new guys came in it took almost a full session to go through the books with them and build a character, too many skills to dabble in.the brightest thing in the game for me, was character devolopment; I loved my runningmates by the end, especially Glory. each of the major characters had a history, and a personallity, and you could get them to open up to you, and devolop that personality. I found myself rushing through paid jobs so I could go talk to people again and learn more, and try to help them. It made me drunk with the possibilities of the world again, like it did when I first cracked open the books and started reading, there was a world behind the characters in the game, and I got to be a part of it for a while.the only thing I would want to see in a next game at this point, is to see some of the origional skills put back in, and maybe the ability to get a closer to some of the characters, I wanted to kiss Glory by the end, but never was that an option.one last parting remark, this game convinced me to break rule number one, ashamed as I am to admit it; I made a deal with a dragon...run while you still can.

												Recommended, although a bit short. Game content wise, the official campaign lasted roughly 30 hours for me, user generated content held my interest 40 or so hours. There's many different viable character builds, and dialogue choices to make. A few plot twists kept things interesting. Very text heavy. I would recommend this game if you're looking for a quick, fun fix of story-driven tactical rpg. There's a finite amount of missions (optional included), and thereform nuyen (currency), so unless you use the cheat console your character cannot have everything. The combat is not as strong as XCOM, but the game makes up for it with lots of atmosphere and story. I wouldn't play the main campaign again though, since the story was the main driving factor and I used the cheat console to explore all the different character builds. Novelty wears off, it's a one and done game, but well worth 15 bucks.Some things that could be improved upon:Customization of party members other than your main character is minimal. Their equipment is set, their stats are set, etc. Not enough optional missions outside the main storyline. The few optional missions are carefully scripted side stories. The entire game feels very scripted, even with the choices.			"

												I have only just started playing this game, but might I say what a truly *phenomenal* effort by the developer into this product.  I greatly enjoyed the original pen & paper Shadowrun RPG back in the early 1990s while in university, and Dragonfall comes oh so close to recreating those old campaigns, in the present day, on the PC.  Can't wait to see what the rest of this game has in store for me, and, what the next game Shadowrun: Hong Kong will bring to the table. "

												Short review: this is the best RPG since Vampire: Bloodines. More similar to the old Fallout games (first and second one), I can honestly say this is better than those classics.Shadowrun Returns was a great effort at reviving Shadowrun, but it had some significant flaws. Dragonfall improves heavily on almost every aspect.If you're an RPG fan at all, you should just buy it.Need more? This game is a close 2nd place to Planescape: Torment for best writing in an RPG ever. Each mission feels unique, like each one was a carefully thought out pen & paper session. There are multiple solutions for every obstacle. There is a ton of optional content (there's an entire series of missions I never did because I absolutely loathed the party offering them, which I guess says something for immersion!). The most fleshed out and creative take on the approach to an end boss encounter I've ever seen.If you played Shadowrun Returns and thought it had some flaws, they fixed a lot of the problems;-Almost all of the combat skills are useful now (Shadowrun Returns was shotguns/rifles and nothing else). -You can now use your party members for skill checks.-You have (limited) development choice over your other party members.-Money is no longer ridiculously tight.-There are more opportunities for matrix running.-A little less linear.No really, you should buy this. Anything negative I have to say is just constructive criticism for the developers. I'll list that now.Negatives:-Matrix combat is still just a reskinned version of regular combat. Developers, all you have to do is literally just copy the matrix combat from the Sega Genesis Shadowrun game and you'll be golden.-There are still some loser skill paths (Shaman magic is inferior to mage spells, only 2 of the 8 social etiquettes are used all game).-I wish it gave you more control over your money and equipment loadout. The overall goal of the game is to raise a certain amount of money to pay off a character. A huge chunk of the money you make each mission is automatically set aside for this ""payoff fund"". You only end up getting to keep about 1/5th of the money you make each mission to spend. Your party members all have their own equipment that is upgraded automatically as the game goes on. While their equipment isn't bad, it's never the best of the choices you have to buy. Worse, you can't even buy better equipment and swap it out; their equipment is locked and all their weapon slots are usually full. I would have rather you got to keep more money from each mission and have the entire responsibility of equipping your party on you.-Combat difficulty, for the most part, is too easy. I was playing on Hard which was still too easy. It's mostly because the enemy AI is pretty bad. It never uses all its action points for attacking and will only attack once per round, like it HAS to both attack and move every turn. If enemies are in a good cover spot, instead of sitting there and attacking a bunch of times, they will attack once then move, often to an inferior position.The only combat challenges were missions where you don't get to use your full party and...cheese encounters. The most unfortunate aspect of combat is that the enemy ALWAYS gets the first turn, even in situations where you take them totally by surprise, like kicking in the door to a room where the enemy had no clue you were there. Snuck into a building and overhear through a door that a bunch of enemies are stoned and watching cartoons? They will still snap to attention and get an entire combat turn before your elite, alert team of mercenaries recover from the door kick. In fact, opening room doors is the single deadliest thing you will do. Your party will be bunched up outside the door because they're still in non-combat follow mode. Before you get a chance to spread out, the enemy will get to chuck several grenades and area effect spells at you. If they have mutliple mages, your party will mostly likely be completely crippled and dying before you even get to do anything.What's really annoying is those ""first turn cheese"" combat encounters prevent you from turning the difficulty up to the highest level, Very Hard, for a real challenge. Regular combat is mostly too easy on Hard, but if you crank it up to Very Hard then the first turn cheese encounters will wipe you out before you even get a turn. You can only change the difficulty from the main menu, so you can't just quickly lower the diffiulty for first turn cheese before turning it back up (well you COULD, if you wanted to sit through 5 minutes of quitting and reloading each time).I really hope their next game fixes the difficulty by making the AI smarter (all they have to do is not give up good cover and use all their actions points attacking when they're in a good spot) while getting rid of the enemies always getting first turn.-The wonky hit percentages of Shadowun Returns are still present. The game tells you your chance of hitting an enemy, but no way is the actual hit chance what it tells you. You will regularly miss five 80% chances in a row, while anything under 45% is pretty much a guaranteed miss. It's way too consistent to be bad luck. There has to be some kind of hidden negative modifier they don't tell you about (they start off fairly accurate then get less so as the game goes on, leading me to believe it's the enemy dodge skill that goes up as the game progresses). Wish they would fix this to accurately show the chance to hit.Seriously just buy it.			"

												A cRPG that mixes fantasy and cyberpunk to create a refreshing new blend! The gameplay is simple, but complex and the flexible stat/spec system allows you to build your character however you like regardless of your class. That said, the essence system is a nice mechanic that discourages and prevents characters from becoming all-powerful mary sues of all trades. The story was also quite intriguing, and though I was a tad bit apprehensive, being a newcomer to the series and universe, I have not been let down. I -would- appreciate a little more ""fantastical"" influence in the story and characterization of metahumans, however it is possible this was an intentional design and is an inherent quality of the pen and paper RPG *shrugs* As I said, new to this universe. On a more somber note, I would like to suggest to HBS to craft longer narratives with more branching arcs/choices and outcomes. It's a pity the linear nature of this game restricts it so that one playthrough is all that is needed to exhume its treasures. Furthermore, I do feel that a game with such potential for mods ( it includes an editor ) should have more to choose from, and it's a pity the community isn't larger - though what does exist is fantastic. As such, BUY THIS GAME and GET SHADOWRUN HONG KONG to boot, you deserve it and so does HBS.In summary, the price I picked SR:DF up for (5.09 CND ) was a flat out steal for the experience it has provided, and despite some minor flaws, they have not prevented me from enjoying this game thoroughly and I fully intend to spend my hard earned money subsidizing HBS' well crafted games; nothing like supporting indie studios that operate from the heart! Now buy the game before I drekking ventilate you, dandelion eater!			"

												Great storytelling.Game is simple enough for beginners and neophites but also is a must have for all who enjoyed the RPG version of the nineties. Atmosphere of the Shadowrun is quite impresively rendered... The story is streamlined without railroading too much to bestow a feeling of free play. Lower difficulties allow for less than optimal characters and team composition.All and all Sr:Dragonfall is mind blowingly awesome on the first playthrough and can even be replayed a few times to explore different character builds or story options...Fantastic game for Cyberpunk and RPG fans alike!

												1st 10 hours of the game was so-so, things were very linear. The REAL DEAL is the next 15 hours - incredibly difficult decisions to make. Affects the outcome and my soul :DBig plus for giving teammates story and personality, making them less like a random hired-gun I don't care. Love that team leveling up screen - choose 1 out of 2 skills to advance. This provides me a lil bit of control without having to micromanage everyone. I can't be bothered to plot 20 points into 5 different skill trees. (In other games I will usually click on the ""auto-level up"" button and tweak from there)     Overall a big improvement compared to Shadowrun Returns. "

												Though I enjoyed the original Shadowrun Returns, it pales in comparison to Dragonfall. The setting, an anarchist city state in Berlin, is quite interesting. Having a consistant & interesting cast of characters that accompany you on missions with their own personalities & playstyles is an enourmous improvement over the previous game's hiring random runners. There's a lot of content here in addition to the main story missions and the game will take you all over the place for a variety of fun missions. One of my top rpgs, highly recommended.			"

												This game is huge.Graphism & animation not exceptional, especially if you compare with x-com or even blackguard. But artistic direction is very good, well as far as you like cyber-punk stuff. To be honest, 1st shadowrun ""revival"" (shadowrun return) was released on tablet, so it can give you an idea of the visual : buttons are huge, game look like it can be played with a touch screen. Fortunately, dev scale them to fit for PC monitor. Dragonfall wasn't released for tablet if i'm not wrong but he kept and revamp the visual menu of the original.Tactical combat aren't the best i've seen but it make the job : they are fun to play and you feel the rise of power of your character. Thing is you can really often skip fight and take a non violent path to success mission. It's not a bad thing but this path is near 50/50 of the game so for me i have to keep in mind that it is not a pure tactical game as ff tactics or x-com cause if not i stay a bit frustrated not having my daily dose of tactical violent fight haha. You can of course play heavy & loud but i feel like it's missing something about this game, so much the dialog are nice to read.Definitly this game is about his story, main and side stories. New here are the companion quest which are all nice to do. They are lot of text to read too, no cutscenes, all are describe writing so if you want to feel the story you have to read. Not a big deal for me, game is in english only and i'm a french native but it don't really bother me much more, so great is the story that i stay focus.Story can be common for who are familiar with cyberpunk and hard teck sci-fi (like W. Gibson or P.K.♥♥♥♥♥♥ but i'm not so much familiar so i find it really really nice, especially today where most games don't really got great story. Can talk about Sin city 1st part for Shadowrun Return and a mix of The Lawnmower Man or Ghost in the shell for dragonfall. Nothing less.			"

												A wonderfully written adventure in which the abundance of character and style is more than enough to brush aside any minor frustration caused by dubious RNG, stat balancing or lack of control of companion inventories.The main plot is among the ones of the best RPGs, the companions are so masterfully crafted that hiring a mercenary for one mission feels like betraying your brothers in arms, the tactical XCOM combat is both engaging and challenging, and the isometric 2D art of a cyberpunk Berlin is jaw-dropping.Dragonfall is a nod to pen and paper, old-school RPG. Heavily text-based, it will not be for everyone, but it will reward you hundredfold if you pay attention to the NPC dialogues and immerse yourself into the lore. The setting somehow manages to mix fantasy elements with a cyberpunk dystopia background effortlessly.The haunting ""Unexpected Consequences"" ending from the Director's cut is easily one of the most memorable gaming experiences I've had.

												A must-have for every person out there enjoying tactical, story-driven sci-fi games.When i first started playing i immediatly fell in love with the well-written characters working alongside the player character. The gameplay improved a lot in comparison to the first game, Shadowrun Returns, although the graphics stayed almost the same.The story has some nice little twists that really catched me off guard and i still regret one of the main choices i made. The missions are mostly well made, only one (raising money) dragged on at times.Over the course of the game the development of my own character came up a little short, but you could make up your own story and i think a closer look to your own past might've really destroyed this 'be anyone' aspect of the world/game.Overall i can recommend the game this game to anyone willing to overlook the pretty old graphics and the small, but well-written world.

												The game itself, the story, characters and gameplay are extraordinary, the world of Shadowrun, which sadly i only found out recently, is an example of Cyberpunk done right.The combat of the game is really fun, if turn-based combat are not your thing, maybe you will find it boring. The atmosphere is really good as well, giving you all the feels a world like this could give you, with all the megacorporations and race discrimination, yeah, the game is set in a world where other races exists, such as elves, dwarfs and orks, it combines Cyberpunk with Fantasy and it works just fine. If you are looking for a good rpg with a cool combat system and story, i strongly suggest Shadowrun Dragonfall, but make sure you check out the first game, Shadowrun Returns, it's really good as well.

												Recommended, although a bit short. Game content wise, the official campaign lasted roughly 30 hours for me, user generated content held my interest 40 or so hours. There's many different viable character builds, and dialogue choices to make. A few plot twists kept things interesting. Very text heavy. I would recommend this game if you're looking for a quick, fun fix of story-driven tactical rpg. There's a finite amount of missions (optional included), and thereform nuyen (currency), so unless you use the cheat console your character cannot have everything. The combat is not as strong as XCOM, but the game makes up for it with lots of atmosphere and story. I wouldn't play the main campaign again though, since the story was the main driving factor and I used the cheat console to explore all the different character builds. Novelty wears off, it's a one and done game, but well worth 15 bucks.Some things that could be improved upon:Customization of party members other than your main character is minimal. Their equipment is set, their stats are set, etc. Not enough optional missions outside the main storyline. The few optional missions are carefully scripted side stories. The entire game feels very scripted, even with the choices.			"

Role-playing done the right way, with a lot of emphasis on who your runner is and how they get things done- both within your party and without. Not a loose tie-in, but fanatically faithful to the lore of the setting.There are flaws, misteps, and the occasional bug, but it does nothing to dim the overwhelming appeal.  10/10			"

Pro: Great characters, excellent writing and not an ounce of busywork padding, every quest is interesting.Con: The combat & sound design leaves something to be desired, i.e. I wasn't having much fun using my spells or shooting my rifle.Neutral: No voice acting, also not limited VA like in other CRPGs like Baldur's Gate. I think this was deliberate to not have it interfere with the before mentioned excellent writing which describes characters' reactions nicely.			"

												By far the most fun I've had playing a turn based strategy game in a long time.  Re-playability still being tested.--The Good- The gameplay was intuitive and (with a handful of exceptions because Trolls are tall) fluid.- Soundtrack was always on point with the 'feel' of the gameplay.- Despite being 2D the game's graphics grabbed me; sprites and backgrounds were bright without falling prey to being cartoony, or dark without being drab.  Most of the time it didn't even register with me that the game wasn't 3D.- Both micro (battlefield) and macro (character-building and story based decision making) decisiosns felt like they influinced the other in a variety of ways.- Storytelling was top-notch from the over-arching tale down to several NPC's stories.--The bad- Unable to re-size fonts, and high reolution with a ton of reading made me need to walk away a few times.- Game-play challenges do not come from AI, but from volume of opponents - this frustration is not unique to this game, and it does not suffer from it as badly as many others, but it is still present.- While Karma was balanced (Never felt like 'super-man'), money was never in short supply.  I frequently used combat drugs, always updated my gear, and yet I always felt like I was in the black... even though one of the main points in the game involves scrambling for money.--The Ugly- The only major frustration I had was mis-clicks that resulted from trying to move my team to squares immediatly above other actors.  For about 1/3rd of a second it shows movement to that square, then it highlights the (again, drecking Trolls) sprite in the square beneath my real selection.			"

												This is a fantastic successor of the first Shadowrun RPG from HBS. The first one was fine as it were, but Dragonfall is near perfect on many levels. First and foremost: this game ""feels"" exactly like Shadowrun should feel, the world they created fits the atmosphere of Shadowrun perfectly. It is like playing one of the good (there are some mediocre ones around) shadowrun novels and for this, is simply absolutely enjoyable. It is a solid RPG with a convincing system of character advancement, a solid, Shadowrun typical story, and a nicely fleshed out environment. Of course ist is rather linear an not at all a shadowrun sandbox, but that is a) not a problem, because the game is great as it is and b) on the given budget just not possible. The grahpic presentation is really good, a fitting cell-shading / comic style approach, that depicts the entire shadowrun world nicely an with love and care for detail. Add a soundtrack that has a good futuristic ring to it paired with typical, well working atmospheric elements for danger / combat / bleak and eerie feel and voila - a great Shadowrun game it is! 10/10 from me - I honestly don`t know, how a Shadowrun game could do something decidedly better than what has been put together with Dragonfall. It could be larger, more open storywise etc. but these are aspects that are limited by the funds that were available to the devs. I can hardly wait for the next installment ""Shadowrun Hongkong""...

												This is a really great expreince for CRPG players!I have allot of fun with this game it always bring me back to finish the game as the story, gameplay and the interactions in the game kept me going. The story telling of this game is fantastic, the combat is fun but not great (combat need to have allot more interactions within the environment and more combat options as there aren't that much and sometimes there are bugs on combat especially during loading a save game) but it's the gameplay (interactions with dialogue, companions conversations, environment ect.) and the story that really kept me going to finish this game. One thriller game I'd say! One of the best CRPG games I have played in 2014! P.S - I cannot wait for Shadowrun: Hong Kong!			"

												Buy this game.  Buy it.  Seriously.So, already having played and beaten the regular version ... I was surprised to see a Director's Cut for what I already thought was a great game.  The DC has new missions that give more flavor to the setting of Shadowrun-Berlin , and they went out of their way to give dialog and flavor to some of the more tangent characters in the game.  It's really worth it.  They cleaned up some minor trifles in dialog options, NPC placement, and tidied up a few minor plot holes that most people gloss over (except nitpickers like myself). Buy it for the new missions and upgrade options for the team.  Not being able to distribute or upgrade my team was a downpoint for me in the original incarnation; that they took the time to go back and address that kind of thing when they already had a good enough selling product really speaks to the caliber of the company.  Good on them.  I will keep buying DLCs as long as they keep putting out this grade of work. Score: A+			"

												Simply wonderful.It's been a long while since I've played a game that had a storyline this good. Here, it is all about the writing. The dialog is fantastic. There's ton of magical lore about the Dragonfall world. The characters in your team all have interesting backstories you can explore. There's heaps of decisions you get to make, which might or might not have an impact further down the line. And the main storyline is truly engaging and well thought out. What a great ending too (there's more than one actually).If you're not a fan of reading a lot of text in games, this game might not satisfy you, though it's combat and other game mechanics are still very good. If you like a nice story though, you HAVE to give it a try.			"

												First some background:  I played the Linux version.  I like RPGs, but have never played a Shadowrun game before.  I played the game maybe 20-30 hours (Steam thinks I played more than that because I left it going overnight a couple times).Shadowrun Dragonfall may have been my most pleasant gaming surprise this year.  I was expecting to try out a low-budget, rough experience (because indie game) with technical issues (because Linux).  Instead I found that this game was ton of fun, polished both technically and in gameplay/story.The Shadowrun universe combines Gibson-style cyberpunk (e.g. deckers, cybernetic augmentation) with traditional Tolkien fantasy tropes (e.g. magic, elves, dragons).  Some people might find the world too weird, but for me (and I suspect a lot of game players, who have experienced a lot of sci-fi and fantasy already), it was a refreshing twist.  The story takes place in a gritty city, which seems to be on the brink of chaos.  Different factions and corporations plot against each other for control.  Think Planescape: Torment meets Deus Ex.Besides a thought-prokoving setting, the game also has a well-written plot.  I don't want to spoil anything, but suffice it to say that the beginning of the game springs a plot-twist on you, and the intrigue builds from there.  There are often moral dilemmas without clear-cut right or wrong answers.  The plot builds to an exciting climax, and at the end I felt like my choices had real consequences.I also liked the gameplay, but I admit that some gamers will think this is the weakest aspect.  It's a straightforward turn-based campaign.  And in the past I've found turn-based games like Fire Emblem: Awakening or XCOM:Enemy Unknown to be boring and repetitive.  What saved the gameplay of Dragonfall for me were two aspects.  First, excellent pacing.  The game doesn't just give you wave after wave of enemy to mow down.  Most encounteries have some twist to them, or advance the plot or characterization---the game doesn't force unnecessary repetition on you just to pad the game's length.  Second, I enjoyed the character customization, which gives you plenty of flexibility.  For instance, my character was a physical adept, who used magic and cybernetic implants to run up and attack machinegun-toting enemies with a sword.  There's a lot of reply value---I'm curious how it would have played if I had focused on sniping, or casting magic spells, or controlling drones.About the technical issues, the game never crashed on me.  Other than one mission (involving a powerful computer system) which seemed a buggy, causing me to have to reply sections, I did not encounter any issues.  The game's art style is consistent and detailed and builds atmosphere well, but is all in 2D.  The interface was very streamlined and never got in my way, which is more than I can say about a lot of AAA games.  The soundtrack became a bit repetitive, but set the mood pretty well.  There was no voice-acting or animation.In summary, Shadowrun: Dragonfall has a well-written plot that takes place in an interesting setting.  Its turn-based gameplay appealed to me because of the good pacing and interesting RPG aspects.    You may not enjoy it if you're looking for innovative tactical gameplay.  And you definitely won't like it if you're looking for state-of-the-art graphics and sound.  However, you'll probably love it if you enjoy games that have good writing, setting, characters, and RPG aspects.			"

												Really enjoyed this game.  Though to be honest, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did Shadowrun Returns.  Returns had a truly classic SR story, and Dragonfall goes for the gusto with its story.  The only real prob was the whole 'do random runs to earn enough money to continue the story' thing.  Otherwise it's pretty good.  The end of this game is pretty epic as well, as far as story and making it your own go :)			"

												Being the second game of the Shadowrun series of Harebrained Schemes, Dragonfall excels in storytelling and more (little?) different storylines, based on your decisions. The grafics ain't much different from Shadowrun Returns, except that you get a lot of all new Berlin parts of course, where this episiode is playing (first game was in Atlanta, iIrc). - Anyway, if you are into this Fantasy-Cyberpunk setting and are looking for a new adventure and don't mind the kinda simple grafics for our modern times, you gotta play this one, you shouldn't be disappointed. Really, the ending ... well, I don't wanna spoil something, but I was playing probably more than of the last half hour of the game a few times again and again, because I wanted to see a few different endings. ;-) Much appreciated.

												One of the few games able to recreate the wonderment and magic of table-top RPGs. The story is well-constructed, features plenty of twists and turns and pulls you onward as only the best role-playing campaigns do. To boot, it has rewarding turn-based combat that boasts a depth that belies the relatively few skills available to characters. NPCs have been very well-written and aid in creating the sense of place that makes Dragonfall really shine. This is a game that rewards intelligent thought and committed role-playing. If that sounds like your bag, then you owe it to yourself to run the shadows of the Flux State.			"

They are basically the main way this game unfolds and they are fun to experiment with.It's good when you stop and read everything carefully sometimes :)			"

												If you look past the faulty game play, the story is very intriguing. It helps you get immersed in the game, but the reward system is a threshold to overcome, especially in the beginning of the game. I am a veteran RPG-player and I am used to scavenge the corpses of the enemy characters for money and loot, but I was denied this pleasurable game concept here. To read all the conversations is tedious work and some of them are very long. Sometimes I had the feeling that I was reading a science fiction novel and playing in between. The story has classical thriller elements and surprising moments, which involve you emotionally. It also presents you with very interesting moral dilemma’s, where you have to make choices that have little to do with immediate rewards or missions objective. ( I wonder if they got this concept from DOS…) So you could say that what ever the game lacks in gameplay, it compensates by good story telling. Long story short for a low budget production, this is a great game.			"

												Best RPG I've played in a long time, though it hit a snag when I had to replay a later mission THREE times due to a bug with quicksaving. After I came back and beat the rest of the game, I was less angry, but that really killed the momentum.It was a great experience besides that, with the writing alternating between badass and hilarious, almost always hitting the mark at whatever it was attempting. Not quite up there with Planescape, but very good. You can roleplay many different kinds of characters, and generally no matter what you choose there's unique ways to solve problems or get hidden dialogue. There's some moral choices to make, and unlike the newer Fallout games, they're actually more interesting than a choose-your-own-adventure novel. The endings are pretty dramatically different in their consequences, but all could reasonably be chosen by a ""moral"" player.Combat is pretty entertaining, though the AI is dumb sometimes and the game's still a bit too easy on Hard difficulty. The earlier missions were balanced, but I steamrolled the last two. Almost every mission has at least one exciting twist which keeps things interesting, eg your team has to fight security while your hacker character battles another hacker in cyberspace for control of the turrets, etc. You will not be bored.Although the character archetypes are quite different, customization is sort of impractical beyond picking 2-3 key skills and pumping them for the whole game. Your teammates also manage their own gear and stats, with some limited skill choices on your part. No complaints about that actually, it makes sense and works pretty well. You can hire temporary mercenaries for missions to replace them, but there's absolutely no reason to because it costs money, they're not noticeably better, and you miss out on dialogue. Overall, Dragonfall doesn't have the technical depth of Wizardry, Diablo II, or even Final Fantasy. The main draw of the game is the setting and the various ways you can react to it, not min-maxing.I beat the game ~100% in about 30 hours, which is pretty decent, but for some reason it still feels short. I wish you could get more small shadowruns, like the Genesis game had, in addition to the handful of long and detailed jobs that make up this one. There's all these systems - the jobs list, the online message board, the character progression - that give the illusion of a big world, but ultimately there's a limited amount of money and stat points in the game, and you don't have that much agency in where you go. At least the modding tools could potentially put the engine to fuller use. As it is, Dragonfall is great, but there's some wasted potential also.Overall, judging just on the base campaign, Dragonfall is an easy recommendation. My only real hard complaint is those damn bugs. It's important that you be able to trust the game not to break when you do something wrong, or you know, save.			"

												Very good RPG which does a damn good job immersing you in the Shadowrun setting. Interesting story as well. Definitely a better game than Returns, and being a Kickstarter backer the money spent has been very well worth it.You get immersed in the story, your nuyen (credits) aren't infinite and you have to carefully upgrade your skills. Spreading your karma (skill points) too wide can gimp your character and it is heavily recommended to focus on 1-2 ""combat groups"". Combining decking with rifles is doable, but if you also spend points elsewhere you might not get the abilities and hit percentages needed for later. It is thus best to basically focus on two main attributes (Strength, Quickness, Willpower, Intelligence, Charisma) and a subset of combat skills of attribute chosen. One big minus in my opinion though is that Charisma attribute is very useful as high Charisma unlocks some powerful persuasion options throughout the game. While you can easily play without spending points in Charisma, I felt that higher Charisma would have made my playthrough much more enjoyable.Combat is nice and simple, but it has some flaws. First is that at times you have no idea if an enemy is within line of sight and I often place a character in a position where he logically should have a line of sight, yet he is not which can screw up your tactics. A visual aid of some kind would have been nice. Second, you should be able to enter turn-based/combat mode yourself, as a few times I have managed to sneak up on an enemy and other times you know there are enemies around the corner or behind the door (like after hacking security cameras, revealing their presence). Getting my team in position that way would have been pretty good.Looting. When you pick up items during runs, you can only add them to your own inventory or send to your stash. An option to give some items to your fellow runners would have been welcome.Dialogue is for the most part good, with numerous dialogue choices and options. Depending on what skills you have, you can get extra dialogue options too, like higher Biotech can give insight into medical info, whereas Strength can be used to intimidate or Charisma to charm. Charisma also gives etiquette perks which unlocks extra dialogue for certain categories like Shadowrunner, Street, Gangs etc. There are a few dialogue choices where you can use fellow party members to do a task, but too few. You should have been able to use party members' skills in dialogue too if your own character is not able to, like using shaman to resolve magic-related dialogue options if required skills are there.The missions themselves are pretty good and you usually have different ways to do them. How you do them will not change the story progression, but will have an effect on what rewards you get and how your party members react.Overall, the game is fun and challenging and the choices you make have some consequences but not gamechanging though. If turn-based RPGs with thought-out dialogue and stories is your thing, Dragonfall is heartily recommended.			"

												While many people were upset by the first releases campaign (Dead Man's Switch), for the lack of open-ended gameplay, and lack of memorable party members, the Dragonfall expansion fixed all those complaints. In fact, Dragonfall probably should have been the game they made from the get-go. Now that they've made the Director's Cut a standalone, you don't even have to buy the first campaign to play the much more fleshed out second campaign. Definitley pick up this game if you are a fan of shadowrun, cyber-punk Deus-Ex-ish games, or RPGs in general.			"

												I picked this game up on a sale, and I have to say it was worth the money. One protip is that R reloads gun, in first fights I run out of bullets and  ended up whacking enemies (until I Googled it) - also remember jack of trades is master of none (and create your own character).A few of the sidemissions we're quite hard, otherwise I played it through on Normal without too many re-tries. There is quite much dialogs to read, presented in a bit of ""system shockish"" manner with text boxes and options, but the story is good.  "

												Turn-based strategy game with fantasy elements melded into a modern day world.  It had a good storyline with plenty of background lore with plenty of meaningful choices in the game, all that end with the death of someone, somewhere, somehow.  The biggest problem with the game is that sometimes it decides my computer isn't worthy of playing the game and will decide to crash.  Good story, XCOM combat system, great lore, and meaningful dialougue choices.  Game doesn't run the smoothest and can crash, which isn't bad at all.			"

Some of the combat was the enimies just running acrossed the map to kill my main character and ignoring the others. The writing was okay for the story. It didn't have anything that gave me a reason to give a crap about it.Others liked it more then Returns. There are a few things better about the game. I rather think Returns was more enjoyable. The open UI was a major turn off to me. Returns UI was closed and cleaner looking to me. Yes, even though it was open and easier to see I fumbled with it.  "

												What a wonderfully written adventure. Since it does little voice over, I'm for a story that is still good but to the point. Say a lot with a little, this is the best game I think I've played that has done that. Reading wasn't a chore because it was concise. The combat went for the quick skirmishes route vs long tb encoutners, both are good, just stating the way they went. Pretty good character building. Game isn't really long, which I like, I like games that are good, but don't over stay their welcome, which to me means getting bored with repetitive actions. Game was super in pace, get in get out, smiles all the way.			"

												Really, really good modern take on the classical RPG. Combat is pretty complex (not so much as an actual tactical strategy game, but close enough), so is the character advancement system, there are quite a few battles that you can skip through various scripted means (smooth talking or activating various environmental actions), the characters are well developed and each of your team mates has a story that you get to discover along the way (by ways of optional missions) and the story is really, really good and well written.Even if the spell gets broken from time to time, when you can see through the dialog, to the not so subtle jabs at modern society, the game really gives you a feeling of writing your own story by giving a lot of dialog choices and quite big story-related choices that will heavily affect the ending. If you've got an aversion for stories of anarchism, a bit of social justice, ecology or accumulation of wealth and power in the hands of the few, you might not like the story that much (although the dialog choices you're given allow your avatar to rebuke all that).There's also quite a bit of point-and-click adventuring to be done and the game's mechanics avoid turning it into pixel hunting, which is great.Just keep in mind that it's still an isometric classical RPG with some modern twists. If you're not a fan of running around and talking to people, don't expect miracles. It is also not an open world RPG and even if it manages to not feel very linear through a couple of tricks, it is very much a linear experience.			"

												I started with Shadowrun Returns, So far this is the best Shadowrun game yet.  Great atmosphere, excellent story, fun gameplay.  If you enjoy games like XCOM you'll most likely enjoy this game.  If you enjoy Shadowrun, you'll enjoy this game.  As turn-based strategy games go, this game really provides a good sense of action.  Those moments when you out maneuvere and shoot your way out of an ambush feel pretty damn rewarding, especially when you can maneuver your team to creat intersecting lines of fire.  I can't say much in terms of character customization, but building your character abilities is pretty enjoyable.  Abilities and how they're executed seem improved and weapons like the sniper rifle feel incredibly gratifying to wield.  I was distracting teams with some shadowrunners in the front while my sniper character started picking off or finishing my opponents off.  Incredibly satisfying game I think is still worth picking up...sale or not.			"

It wasn't perfect, I can't count the number of times I clicked trying to attack and moved my character, and there were a few bugs (one of the NPC's text repeated after clearing a ""tree"") but overall I don't have many other complaints.That said, even though this was a better put together game, I think I enjoyed playing the first one more.

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is great! But it is also not Baldur's Gate.If you go into Shadowrun thinking you will have a similar experience, you will be dissapointed with the lack of custommisation of your fellow shadowrunner and the lack of a large pool of NPC to chose from, which cripple the replayability and the fredom of exploration the mechanism (you can chose to hire mercenaries, but I am the kind of player that prefer to play character and not ""stat sheets"").But Dragonfall have a so many strong points that if you give it a chance, you will be glad of your time spent in game. You will want to know more about your crew and you will defenitly care about the world around you.Also, my favourite thing about the game it that it throws a lot of different setting during missions which really help establishing the universe of Shadowrun and make me wanna play the tabletop version.

												If you played the first game (Shadowrun Returns) and liked it, you'll probably like this one too. It expands on a few things (more weapons, etc.), but plays very much like its predecessor. If you haven't played any of the HBS Shadowrun games, to me they seem like something of a cross between the ""interactive novel"" style of a jrpg and the combat of a turn-based squad tactics/strategy game. The combat is fun, though not always challenging in a strategic sense (sometimes not in any sense).My two biggest complaints are the same as from the first game:1) The game feels a little too short. Not to say I didn't feel like I got my money's worth (especially since I've gotten them all on sale), it just felt like it was over pretty quickly in both cases once the story really took off. 2) I didn't enjoy the Matrix bits at all. I appreciate what I think they were trying to do (keep it somewhat true to the source material, and make it more than a skill check), but I didn't personally enjoy it.That said, I still like them quite a bit. Without giving spoilers, this second one made me consider my actions a bit more in a couple of places, which I liked. I also enjoyed the wider variety of cyberware & weapons. One of the key points to an rpg for me is the character options and progression, and this game definitely scratches that itch. I will probably go back and play through again at some point with a different character type.So yeah, not perfect, but still quite good.			"

												This is an excellent game that I was initialy unsure of due to the turn-based isometric style approach. That said, I really enjoyed the original XCOM and UFO games when they first came out (a very long time ago now) and soon took to this game. It can be fairly unforgiving if you charge in FPS style and expect to get away with it, often resulting in your team being crippled and no way to recover other than to forfeit the mission on harder levels.The dice rolling can be a little odd at times, with your top shooter missing frequently at point blank range yet making long range shots more often than not. It almost seems as if once they start to miss they keep missing? This does add to the tension though, and there is a genuine fear that you might not make it through, unlike most FPS/RPGs where you can simply take cover and wait for the auto heal to fix you. There is no auto heal when you drop out of combat and the next wave are just around the corner.However, the game is very enjoyable, particularly as you start to notice the small details and get more into the story. The old cliche of 'you get out what you put in' definitely applies to this game. Stick at it, grind out a few weapons and upgrades and you will be up and running in no time. One tip - when decking, take as many offensive programs as possible, plus APs. This will massively speed up your progress and forget the shields once you have an AP helping you. Am not finished the game yet but will be playing it again soon to race through another few missions.			"

												The director's cut version of Dragonfall is pretty much the strongest Shadowrun game that is currently out there and will most likely remain so until Shadowrun: Hong Kong comes out. Its combat and class system is one of the most engaging thing I've played since XCOM: Enemy Unknown and due to its narrative merging of both science fiction and fantasy I felt it has one of the most creative class systems in any tactical role playing game. While, the game isn't that approachable due to the plethora of choices and potential room for you to make a mistake in the game when building your character its most likely going to give you a very rewarding experience thanks to to its narrative and combat mechanics.You can find the full review for the game here: http://mouseandcontroller.blogspot.com/2016/09/shadowrun-dragonfall-directors-cut.html.

												This is a very good sequel of the first game. The focus is more on the team and the team work this time. I really liked the fact that if you spend time on the teammates' history, you can play side quests too.There are only minor issues in the game. The decking sometimes got confused and you cannot do anything, but furtunately a quick save / quick load solves this problem. The only irritating thing is the chance to hit handling. I simply too often miss with 65+ chance, playing on normal difficulty. So, either the game is lying to me or I am too unlucky, but when I missed 3 out of 4 with 83% to hit, I was a bit angry...Overall opinion: 9.5/10. For me, this game - alongside with the first and third part - is absolutely one of my favourite!			"

												While I pride myself on being a pretty nerdy guy, I had never had any experience with Shadowrun in any of its incarnations. Now that I've played Dragonfall, I'm starting to regret that lack.\This game is great. Not just for a Kickstarter. But genuinely great. The characters are rich and detailed, the dialogue is tight, the plot epic and the combat is challenging yet fun. In fact, I'd say that while I was playing Dragonfall, I caught myself thinking that I hadn't enjoyed an isometric RPG like this so much since Baldur's Gate 2.So Shadowrun. For those of you that are unfamiliar, the world of Shadowrun is ""fantasy cyberpunk"" setting. If you're having trouble processing that, just imagine a usual vanilla fantasy world with humans elves, orks and dwarves. Magic poofs in every corner. Got it in your head? Now give the humans cybernetic implants, hook the elves up with sniper rifles, provide some rocket launchers for the orks and robotic drones for the dwarves. Add a souped up version of the internet (called the Matrix which is true VR you can deck into). Finally dip it all in post apocalyptic dystopia where the governments are mere puppets of the mega corps (which are, of course, run by immortal dragons). Everyone is tagged, tracked and monitored. Just mindless corp slaves. Sounds pretty cool, right? And it is!You show up in this cavalcade of madness as a ""Shdowrunner"". See, unlike the rest of society you and those like you aren't owned body and soul by the corps (at least not to the same degree as most of society). That makes you valuable. That's because Megacorps can't go and declare full scale war on each other. It's bad for business. So what do they do? Corporate espionage, sabotage, extraction, data hacking and the occasional assassination. Of course, they can't use their own guys for that, it'd be too incriminating. What they need is a ""deniable asset"" namely, a Shadowrunner. A person living on the edge of society with no background, no history, no ties and most importantly, no connection to the Corps. Just looking to make a buck in a crappy world.As Dragonfall begins, you have just hooked up with an old friend of yours in Berlin for a job. From there you'll explore an enclave of other refugees from society call the Kreuzbasar, help your team work through their problems (and they DO have some pretty heavy ones), do what you can to influence the world for good or ill, get caught up in so many conspiracies that you might need a spreadsheet to track them all and might have possibly sacrificed your body (and your humanity) for shiny cyber parts. By the end of the game, you'll have gone through a few plot twists and have had your share of surprises along the way.Gameplay wise, it could best be described as if you took X-COM crossed it with an old school turn based RPG. Surprisingly enough, it works great. When out of combat, you and your squad are free to roam around the area (no need to take up action points). When enemies are detected you drop into X-COM style combat mode. You have 2 action points that you can use to move, fire weapons, cast spells or use other special abilities. Cover and deployment are vital as the AI will actively seek to flank you and has a fondness for chucking grenades. Some abilities will take up all your action points but are very powerful so you need to use them wisely. Other abilities allow you to fire off more rounds in one go, thus creating a veritable bullet storm, but drains your clip rapidly which forces you to reload more often.The combat is deeply impacted by the class you choose in Dragonfall. All classes have some amazingly differing and complementary uses. The classes are naturally based around the Shadowrun universe, so if you want to be a frontline fighter you'd be a Street Samurai wielding a variety of guns, close combat weapons or both. Mages are still squishy and useful for buffing, AOE and provide vital support to your frontliners. Riggers use a variety of drones to do their fighting while Deckers slip into the cyber Matrix and can hijack enemy bots, cameras and gun turrets. As you level up you get to spend karma to improve your character. Where you spend karma not only impacts your combat effectiveness, but also what sorts of dialogue and actions you'll have access to. Your team doesn't spend karma but you can choose one of two skills each time they level.Shadowrun: Dragonfall, has almost everything going for it. A few little quibbles exist, like sometimes your character moving instead of attacking and the lack of minimap. But those are minor and I'd say negligible for what you're getting. Epic story, great setting, memorable characters and really fun combat system all tie together to make this game a real gem. Hare Brained Schemes is currently working on a sequel call Shadowrun: Hong Kong, and if it's anything like Dragonfall, I'm getting it right off the bat.			"

												Great game! I played the campaign just once and according to steam it took me 44 hours to finish it. There were no big differences between this game and Shadowrun Returns in terms of gameplay. For me, it was just a new campaign which was very awesome. I liked the fact that some decisions can take you to different paths. For example, some decisions make you avoid fighting against some enemies thus helping you save munition and supplies for when you really need them later in the game. Overall great game. I recommend it!			"

TLDR: Lead your team of gunslingin, magic-casting, tech-implanted, matrix-hacking Shadowrunners through turn-based tactical combat to A) gtfo alive, B) fulfil the terms of the contract, and C) save the world from a terrorist necro-dragon.Missions play like the ground combat in all my favorite Space Opera books, likePeter Hamilton's Mandel Files and Night's Dawn seriesNeal Asher's Agent Cormac seriesIain M. Banks' Consider Phlebas (the crew of the ""Clear Air Turbulence"")If you're not familiar with space opera, here's a typical plot:The hero has a Problem, he teams up with a crew of mercenaries. Generally some or all are ""boosted"", meaning their basic human body has been augmented with cyberware [1] or bioware [2] upgrades.The hero and his crew follow a trail of clues using digital networks and physical legwork to solve the Problem. Soon it goes bad [3] and a firefight develops. The remaining crew regroup, mourn the fallen, and use what they learned to finally understand the Problem and develop a Solution.Unfortunately there are some complications that will have to be resolved before the hero can deploy the Solution and go get the girl...[1] e.g. targeting implants, links to networks and AI's[2] e.g. combat drug glands, cyberware-controllable muscles[3] e.g. teammate is turned, aliens get angry, employer turns out to be evilMechanically, combat is like X-Com with way more hp. I enjoy it, and a good thing too because my Troll with Intelligence 1 can't seem to talk his way through a whole mission without bashing heads "

												The first time I played this game was when it first came out... and I didn't like it.  I didn't like it because it had a Baldur's Gate look so when I went in I was expecting an open non-linear world with tons of locations and that whole deep RPG experience.  However I gave it another shot and it kept me up till 4 am and I'm not the sort of person to do that.  In my opinion I don't believe this game was meant to be a deep RPG, however it has a deep and immersive story that has you guessing up until the end.  NPC development is excellent and the world around you is reactive.  You do something bad to someone and you get an email from them later in the game telling you what a poophead you are and vice versa.Many games have branching dialogue but in reality they have a few choices, all of which lead to the same answer.  While Shadowrun also has some of this, it also has A LOT of situations where you can do or say something differently and it would radically affect an outcome.  There are a lot of big decisions to make.  I often find myself thinking back on a particular situation and wondering what would have happened had I done things differently... that's when you know a game is good.			"

												Great game I really enjoyed playing. I used to play Shadowrun as pen&paper rpg 15 years ago and read a lot of the novels. The game captures a lot of the spirit and has great storytelling. There are a lot of moral choices to make, the missions offer a lot of different approaches, in most cases even non violent ways to solve problems. So there is some replay value, making other coices or playing a different class or skillset. A slow playthrough with doing nearly all side missions took me about 40hOn the technical side the game is an indie game and has no AAA graphics, but they are more than enough to get the job done. There is no voice ove, so you have to read a whole lot of text. But the story and dialouges are well written. There are some minor bugs that don't appear often, but in one of the endgame missions there seems to be an issue with saving during the combat part, which boosts the difficulty level a lot.			"

												Compelling narrative, beautiful cyberpunk visuals, decent turn-based strategy gameplay, good music. And reading. Lots and lots of reading.The story of Dragonfall is conveyed entirely through blocks of text. There is no voice-acting, no animated cutscenes. Personally, I don't mind. The story was strong, the characters were likeable, and as a whole I really enjoyed it, but I know that'd be a major turn-off for many.The game is littered with choices and dialogue options that dramatically change the narrative, but not the game. The story escalates, and you'll likely end up regretting some of the decisions you made, but for the most part the game itself will remain exactly the same no matter what your choices are. Your choices only matter if you roleplay.Seriously. If you don't care for reading, or don't care about role-playing or story, this game is not for you. In fact, it'll probably bore the hell out of you. But if you do? Give Shadowrun a go.			"

But noooo, they just drop you in the muck, and you're suddenly fighting for your life, outnumbered 3-1 and attacked from all sides while still trying to figure out basics like ""how do I attack? How do I use this ability? How do I heal my team?""			"

												Other than a few bugs and glitches, probably the best cyberpunk RPG series of all time. It was a bit funny, seeing the german words, names and locations incorporated in the game so well. Well, as much as the game presents a dystopia of sorts, I could live in the F-state in Berlin. The world is massively immersive and if it wasn't for the next game from the franchise, which is Hong Kong, shadowrunning was never as satisfying and badass as in this game.I am not even a cyberpunk maniac and I still consider this game as one truly worthy of spending my money on.If you haven't bought it yet and you find yourself an RPG fan, I advise you to skip on a pizza and make the purchase.And I haven't even touched the topic of the gigantic fan-made modding community it has.8/10			"

												This game is simply addicting. If you enjoy games like xcom and invisible incorporation then this game is for you. It has an amazing story and the dialogues are clever and not meaningless. I have played the missions multiple times in order to try different weapons and tactics, try new skills to unlock optional objectives and gain extra points, and every time I play a mission all over again I discover something new. The game does not cease to surprising me ! I found the 2D game engine and the design pleasing to my eyes. (Important if you spend your whole day at work in front of a computer screen). The drawings of the surroundings are very nice too.Tip: Melee attacks (including throwing knives) flush the enemies out of their cover.			"

												It may be a little late to write a review for Dragonfall - especially when you own this game already for quite a while (like me). But I'm playing it again right now, so it may be still a good idea. Well, Dragonfall is not perfect. For instance it is quite difficult (perhaps even impossible?) to give objects from your inventory to one of your party members. Or the story, especially the Dragonfall story, is at times really cheesy when it's adoring and worshipping Monika and the romantic criminal life in anarchist Berlin. Don't get me wrong - Shadowrun IS a scenario which romanticises a criminal Robin Hood life. But neither in Dead Man's Switch nor in Hong Kong is it as obtrusive and embarassing as here.  I'm very much with Lucky Strike, a NPC runner which you can hire for missions, who is expressing just these thoughts. But - doesn't matter at all. Dragonfall has an unbelievable atmosphere, and as soon as you start the game you surrender to it. Having said that it HAS a lot of advantages. The story, though cheesy, is more detailed and more epic than the story of Dead Man's Switch. And even though the story of Hong Kong is probably even better, Dragonfall has by far the superior matrix system. And that, although the matrix of Hong Kong was supposed to be an improvement. Typical case of making things worse by trying to improve them. Worse to an amount that I stopped playing at some point and never bothered to start again. Also Dragonfall has a lot of excellent user campaigns in the Workshop. ""Antumbra"" for instance or ""Mercurial"" are real classics, and you don't see a difference to a professional campaign designed by the developers. Hong Kong has only one campaign, I believe. Don't know anything about it's quality. But six or seven or even more high class scenarios for Dragonfall compared to just one - that speaks out loud enough, don't you think? So, without any doubt Dragonfall is the best Shadowrun game for PC up to now. And having said that, I don't believe there are many games to follow. Shadowrun is a game system which definitely hasn't aged well. In a peculiar way it seems to have fallen out of time, and so probably Dragonfall will be it's ultimate legacy. At least as long as we talk about PC games ...			"

The combination of music and aesthetic really set the mood for a dark and distopic Cyberpunk adventure.On the bad side the game does not make a very good job of explaining some of the combat conceps which will leave you having to do a little guesswork.

												Awesome cyberpunk setting, amazing story and varied characters. Combat is also surprisingly in-depth and fun. This is an upgrade to Shadowrun Returns in almost every way. The devs have even included a nice mod-kit for the budding modder to make something special.There are, however, still a few bugs left in this game, namely armor and HP not updating properly whenever you upgrade your equipment. Using Quicksave too often also makes the game act up (some save files don't load up at all sometimes). My advice is to save often but not to the point of abuse and to save in different slots.Despite those caveats, this game comes highly recommended!			"

												Awesome story, really engaging. Tons of replayability. Great game overall. However, the combat gets very old and frustrating really quick in my opinion and it's mainly because of one thing: ""Missed, Missed, Missed, Missed, Missed, Missed, Missed."" You will see this more than anything in the game, ""Missed, Missed, Missed, Missed, Missed."" I once played for over 3 hours trying to see this new ability I gave one of my crew and I didn't get to see it because of ""Missed, Missed, Missed, Missed, Missed."" It literally missed every single time I tried to use it. I tried using it up close, and mid range and at a distance when the target was in the open. I even had her buffed with accuracy but noooooo!! ""Missed, Missed, Missed."" So infuriating. It eventually got to the point where I just used cheats every time I got in combat just to bypass it. That's pretty sad. I usually like turn based combat but this was ludicrous. That said, in no way, shape or form does that detract from the rest of the game. It is an exceptionally good game that kept me up all night saying ""Just one more mission"" because I wanted to see more of the story. The characters are fascinating and the theme is superb. This is the only Shadownrun game I've played so yeah, very impressed. Totally worth the buy.			"

												Better than the first, high praise indeed, and the directors cut added a further handful of welcome features.- Functional character building systems that allow a range of tactical options. - Fun turn-based combat that doesn't grow tedious. - A more flexible approach to choosing missions and side-quests that the first game cried out for. - Most importantly, a narrative that is as well-written and evocative as the games licence is underappreciated. Someone needs to hand Hare-Brained Schemes the budget to create an 80+ hour campaign. What they have created with Dragonfall is as close to RPG perfection as a ~15 hour game can get.			"

												This game quite clearly will feel like it was made using a template. It feels like the mod of a game that also felt like a mod. The story is very good if you're into cyberpunk genre. There is a lot of dialogue and text to read, and it's all written with some attention to detail and dramatic flair that we expect from professional fiction. The gameplay though...The gameplay can be divided into two modes roughly. One mode is going moving your character around on screen from an isometric perspective and looking for things to click on. The other big part of gameplay is ""X-Com"" like combat. The problem is that the system is ""miss heavy"" especially in the first few hours of the game. If you really enjoy fallout 1 and 2 this may be appealing to you, but for me it's incredibly boring. I would reccomend if you can stand a system like that however.			"

												First of all do not count my hours played on this version of the game as I played the DLC version on Shadowrun Returns for many hours.  That being said this campaign is leaps and bounds better than the one that came with the original game.  This is understable since they had just finished building their engine and wanted to get it out the door.  Dragonfall is the game refined if you will.  -More choices-More Characters-Better Writing-More Dragons!This campaign is what tactical rpgs are all about!  It sets the bar super high for their next endevor Shadowrun: Hong Kong and I look forward to it.  Anyway, should you buy this game?  Do you love Shadowrun?  Do you love tactical rpgs?  Did you like Shadowrun Returns freshman campaign but thought it could be more?  Well, guess what, this is more.  Yes, buy it!  You won't regret it! "

												Buy this game.  Buy it.  Seriously.So, already having played and beaten the regular version ... I was surprised to see a Director's Cut for what I already thought was a great game.  The DC has new missions that give more flavor to the setting of Shadowrun-Berlin , and they went out of their way to give dialog and flavor to some of the more tangent characters in the game.  It's really worth it.  They cleaned up some minor trifles in dialog options, NPC placement, and tidied up a few minor plot holes that most people gloss over (except nitpickers like myself). Buy it for the new missions and upgrade options for the team.  Not being able to distribute or upgrade my team was a downpoint for me in the original incarnation; that they took the time to go back and address that kind of thing when they already had a good enough selling product really speaks to the caliber of the company.  Good on them.  I will keep buying DLCs as long as they keep putting out this grade of work. Score: A+			"

												Holy hell I bought this game on Wednesday and I had dumped 24 hours into it by Friday.The story in this game is dark and gritty and just amazing. Be warned that there is a TON of reading which normally puts me off, but in this game they just do it right. When one of your companions is telling you how she saw her mothers flesh blacken and melt from the fire she conjured to murder her father you just can't help but sink your teeth into it. Overall the game just feels like they hired a few graphic designers to illustrate their amazing story. Speaking of illustrations, most characters (even minor ones) get their own unique character portrait. I found myself reading through page after page of dialogue without ever once feeling the need to skip to the ""who do I need to kill"" part.The combat is completely turn based so if you love XCOM or Wasteland then you'll pick it up pretty quickly. Everything is about cover here. You often have to make the decision whether to put your mage on the ley line and boost their power (which is normally in the open) or to put them behind a box? Do you risk sending forth your melee specialist to hack some baddies up and face the wrath of their shotguns next turn? Make your choice and live with the consequences. I do have a few very minor gripes about combat though: first you can't take cover behind a door frame or corner and shoot around it, instead it counts as blocking terrain that no one can see or shoot through; also some of the spells looks like recolors of other spells which is a bit disappointing. Overall though combat is solid and even punishing on higher difficulties.Dark gritty atmosphere, tactical combat, and a refreshing new character development system give it a 10/10 in my book.			"

I have had my eye on the recent Shadowrun releases, but caught a break when I got them from Humble Bundle.

I still have yet to play Shadowrun:Hong Kong, but I do plan on playing it pretty soon. I highly recommend this one.			"

But noooo, they just drop you in the muck, and you're suddenly fighting for your life, outnumbered 3-1 and attacked from all sides while still trying to figure out basics like ""how do I attack? How do I use this ability? How do I heal my team?""			"

												Compelling narrative, beautiful cyberpunk visuals, decent turn-based strategy gameplay, good music. And reading. Lots and lots of reading.The story of Dragonfall is conveyed entirely through blocks of text. There is no voice-acting, no animated cutscenes. Personally, I don't mind. The story was strong, the characters were likeable, and as a whole I really enjoyed it, but I know that'd be a major turn-off for many.The game is littered with choices and dialogue options that dramatically change the narrative, but not the game. The story escalates, and you'll likely end up regretting some of the decisions you made, but for the most part the game itself will remain exactly the same no matter what your choices are. Your choices only matter if you roleplay.Seriously. If you don't care for reading, or don't care about role-playing or story, this game is not for you. In fact, it'll probably bore the hell out of you. But if you do? Give Shadowrun a go.			"

If you're used to XCOM, the combat sections feels like a bad XCOM game.  :-/  It's still good, don't get me wrong, but it definitely doesn't match XCOM and you can't help but make the comparison because of how similar it is to XCOM.

												I started with Shadowrun Returns, So far this is the best Shadowrun game yet.  Great atmosphere, excellent story, fun gameplay.  If you enjoy games like XCOM you'll most likely enjoy this game.  If you enjoy Shadowrun, you'll enjoy this game.  As turn-based strategy games go, this game really provides a good sense of action.  Those moments when you out maneuvere and shoot your way out of an ambush feel pretty damn rewarding, especially when you can maneuver your team to creat intersecting lines of fire.  I can't say much in terms of character customization, but building your character abilities is pretty enjoyable.  Abilities and how they're executed seem improved and weapons like the sniper rifle feel incredibly gratifying to wield.  I was distracting teams with some shadowrunners in the front while my sniper character started picking off or finishing my opponents off.  Incredibly satisfying game I think is still worth picking up...sale or not.			"

												This is an excellent game that I was initialy unsure of due to the turn-based isometric style approach. That said, I really enjoyed the original XCOM and UFO games when they first came out (a very long time ago now) and soon took to this game. It can be fairly unforgiving if you charge in FPS style and expect to get away with it, often resulting in your team being crippled and no way to recover other than to forfeit the mission on harder levels.The dice rolling can be a little odd at times, with your top shooter missing frequently at point blank range yet making long range shots more often than not. It almost seems as if once they start to miss they keep missing? This does add to the tension though, and there is a genuine fear that you might not make it through, unlike most FPS/RPGs where you can simply take cover and wait for the auto heal to fix you. There is no auto heal when you drop out of combat and the next wave are just around the corner.However, the game is very enjoyable, particularly as you start to notice the small details and get more into the story. The old cliche of 'you get out what you put in' definitely applies to this game. Stick at it, grind out a few weapons and upgrades and you will be up and running in no time. One tip - when decking, take as many offensive programs as possible, plus APs. This will massively speed up your progress and forget the shields once you have an AP helping you. Am not finished the game yet but will be playing it again soon to race through another few missions.			"

												Improves significantly upon Dead's Man Switch with the expected hallmarks of writing, strategy and immersion. I defintely liked the upgrades they did to the companion system and fleshing out great personal content for each - a trend I would love other RPGs to follow who either mistake quantity > quality of companions, or treat them little more than NPCs who help to punch enemies for you.The main plotline is fantastic with interesting twists though the difficulty of the campaign dips towards the endgame - granted, I did complete every possible mission and sidequest so I was as prepared as possible. Speedrunners should find the normal difficulty hard enough. Also worth noting that even at this stage the game does have number of minor bugs which have not been fully resolved. Nothing game breaking.Easily recommended - great example of old TB RPG done right.9/10			"

There are a lot of different RPG Elements and you can find the ""classical"" Shadowrun weapons and spells. Strategy and your choice of skills/ fellow shadowrunners matters and you get rewarded for thinking about your team mates and your own skills. Dragonfall has a unique and detailed story with plot twists that you cannot really forsee and the story is quite rewarding for those who pay attention and to those who read every text and immerse themselves in the story.

												If you like the first Shadowrun game(Shadowrun Returns) by Harebrained Schemes, you'll like this one.  The game is almost a perfect second effort by this developer, with a few exceptions that I could find:1. In Shadowrun Returns, you had the ability to click on your character and go into ""combat mode""(turn-by-turn mode for each of the characters under your control) even if no enemies had seen you yet(or there were no enemies even on the level).  That way it would allow other characters under your control to pickup items.  It also allowed you position all your characters optimally(behind as much cover as possible) before opening a door.  I wish that they had kept that feature in this game.  For example, if my character is a decker or street samurai with no conjuring skill, a spirit talisman is useless to my character on that level.  I have to wait until the level is over and play the next mission with a shaman in my group in order to use that spirit.2. I wish I could have seen Eiger, Glory, Dietrich, Blitz, and Dante(if he ""joins"" your team"") stats at any time, especially while shopping around in the Kruezbasar.  It was frustrating to buy a spell and not be sure(and worse, wrong) whether or not Dietrich has a high enough spellcasting/conjuring number to be able to use that spell.  Same goes for weapons for Eiger/Glory.3. I wish I could have had the ability to move items between characters under my control while on a mission/level.  For example, if I want to move a grenade or medkit from my character's possesion to another character's possesion.4. There were times that I successfully cast a Mind Wipe spell on an enemy and although the status of that enemy would read ""Mind Wiped"", it would still attack my characters.  I only noticed this happen with Firedrakes and the enemy mages in the final level.  If the developers intended that Mind Wipe would have no effect on certain enemies(and it wasn't just a bug), they should have had those enemies say ""Immune"" when the spell hits them, rather than ""Mind Wiped"".  I enjoyed playing this game and was rather addicted to it until I completed it, so my list is just intended as suggestions for the developers to improve an already great game, as well as things to keep in mind for additional games.

												Great game I really enjoyed playing. I used to play Shadowrun as pen&paper rpg 15 years ago and read a lot of the novels. The game captures a lot of the spirit and has great storytelling. There are a lot of moral choices to make, the missions offer a lot of different approaches, in most cases even non violent ways to solve problems. So there is some replay value, making other coices or playing a different class or skillset. A slow playthrough with doing nearly all side missions took me about 40hOn the technical side the game is an indie game and has no AAA graphics, but they are more than enough to get the job done. There is no voice ove, so you have to read a whole lot of text. But the story and dialouges are well written. There are some minor bugs that don't appear often, but in one of the endgame missions there seems to be an issue with saving during the combat part, which boosts the difficulty level a lot.			"

Like Shadowrun Returns it takes about a split of a second to fall in love with the future painted up by Harebrained Schemes and while it was a while ago now that I played, I still remember my companions from Dragonfall very fondly. Eiger is too this day my absolute favourite Troll ever. I wanna cuddle her and give her space both at once. It's complicated.The story is also incredibly memorable, taking some classic elements of the fantasy genre and completely reimagining them into the cyberpunk context of the game.

												I'm speechless. The dialogues are high level. It's a game you that you need to read a lot. But you get rewarded for reading because it's so well written. The choices you make along the way are meaninful and the game makes them hard for you to make. I don't recall another game's story that blew my mind this hard. Wow.			"

												This is an excellent game that I was initialy unsure of due to the turn-based isometric style approach. That said, I really enjoyed the original XCOM and UFO games when they first came out (a very long time ago now) and soon took to this game. It can be fairly unforgiving if you charge in FPS style and expect to get away with it, often resulting in your team being crippled and no way to recover other than to forfeit the mission on harder levels.The dice rolling can be a little odd at times, with your top shooter missing frequently at point blank range yet making long range shots more often than not. It almost seems as if once they start to miss they keep missing? This does add to the tension though, and there is a genuine fear that you might not make it through, unlike most FPS/RPGs where you can simply take cover and wait for the auto heal to fix you. There is no auto heal when you drop out of combat and the next wave are just around the corner.However, the game is very enjoyable, particularly as you start to notice the small details and get more into the story. The old cliche of 'you get out what you put in' definitely applies to this game. Stick at it, grind out a few weapons and upgrades and you will be up and running in no time. One tip - when decking, take as many offensive programs as possible, plus APs. This will massively speed up your progress and forget the shields once you have an AP helping you. Am not finished the game yet but will be playing it again soon to race through another few missions.			"

												Lovely game with excellent writing. Those who are more interested in getting right to the gameplay will probably find the story segments too lengthy. But for those who play games for story and characters, this is a definite pick up. Gameplay is also pretty fun if you like more tactical, grid systems.			"

												The quests/dialogue are surprisingly well desgined and written that imo puts the quests in games like Fallout4, AC, to shame, tho still mainly based on heavy descriptive text as the only way of presentation, the overall plot till the last moment is intense, suspenseful and well done, perfectly integrated into various meaningful and impactful choices.The combat however is a bit boring and slow, tho fresh and seemingly strategic at first, everything quickly boils down to take cover, take cover, take cover and shoot. There are also frustratingly too many misses (i appreciate their effort to mimic xcom, but without the deadly damage and expendable friendly units, every miss just gets frustratingly dumb), not that there is any depth to the combat tho to begin with, Nevertheless a really enjoyable ride and overall a pretty good game that is worthy of the price tag and your time if youre an RPG fan.

												Enjoyable storyline, interesting gameplay. I particularly like the turn-based style they designed. The graphics are original and stunning, I loved the creativity in the design of the maps and the detail given to each area. I thought the story was well developed, really up until the very end I was still interested. Yet, there are some very -very- annoying problems throughout the game.For one, the probability of missing is atrocious. You could fire, 3 times in a row, 75+% hits and miss all three. For a turn-based, strategy combat game, this completely takes out the strat and leaves entire battles to chance.Two, there are some really basic failures in moving around the maps and interacting of objects, indicating that there was sloppy testing. I occasionally needed to click something 4 or 5 times to get it to intereact properly; and I would have to get my mouse right into a proper sliver to indicate I wanted to move to a square next to another character.Three, there are some options in the game that are entirely useless. I barely used Dietrich and some of the ""etiquettes"" language options are never used, or used only once, in contrast to the ""Street"" etiquette, which I saw at least 5 times. Decking was a silly exercise, read other reviews for elaboration.Overall, would recommend buying on sale, at least 15-20% off. Otherwise, not worth it for an unpolished game.			"

												Futuristic turn based RPG with an overall Lo-Fi profile (Crowdfounded). Like the turn based parts that are pretty much reminding of the XCOM series. The options in developing characters make the game deeper than UFO. But: if you don´t like to read tons and tons of (acceptable or even good) storytelling, which is necessary to understand what you play, then you might better stay off this bugfree well crafted product. I personally really dislike reading that much and can´t play longer than 30 minutes at time. But because this works perfectly both on Windows (I play on 10) and Linux (Mint) I really appreciate the efforts. In my mid 30´s the story is acceptable, but at times sounds a like childish sci-fi. But hey I also dislike Star Wars and similar, so this shouldn´t be too important to you.			"

												(No spolier brief review). 8/10.This game improves substantially on its mediocre predecessor, Shadowrun Returns. You do not need to play Shadowrun Returns before playing Dragonfall. They are independent, though you would appreciate Dragonfall more if you've experienced the cyberpunk-fantasy world and learnt the gameplay mechanics playing Shadowrun Returns. Dragonfall has a compelling story, varied gameplay scenarios, good characterisation and improved environments. The plot is twisty and involving. Aside from the usual infiltration and firefight missions, there are great scenarios like a timed mission that is pulse-racing, and also a tense set-piece to fend off against waves of enemies.There were two very challenging hair-pulling missions, but overall the game is engagingly challenging but not overly difficult. This is a budget indie turn-based game, so don't expect graphics. Dragonfall is highly recommended!			"

												The tale woven by this game is simply beautiful. The writing is astonishingly thoughtful, and each character has been sculpted with such intricacy that you will fall in love with some, hate others vehemently, feel embarassed by the intelligence of one, laugh at the wit of the next- there is a social interaction within each conversation that is more engaging than any other dialogue system I have encountered before. Finally: the game play is still engaging after 40 hours of play time and always satisfyingly strategic. I could not recommend this game more for anyone who is not an FPS-only type gamer. Thank you HBS.			"

												I love this game, I was expecting to  refund it but it was surprisingly good. The Story is great. The Characters all have great background stories. Different outcomes from your actions as well, you can   be a cold, only for the money shadowrunner or a good guy(boring).  This is a story driven game, every mission has purpose and consequences.Graphics are not the best, it is a indie game, but the art style of the citites are nice. It gives that cyberpunk feel, great for cyberpunk fans. A modern CRPG.The Gameplay  is ala Baldurs Gate and Xcom. You only are in charge of buying gear for your main character, which makes item management easier. You can equip your Party with consumable items like Health items, grenades, drugs , spells etc. The combat system is similar to Xcom, turn based cover system. You gotta use cover alot and each action consumes action points. There are multiple solutions at times, which adds replay value. The game is a challenge. You will lose or restart so that your favorite character will survive. Oh and there are mods in the steam workshop. This game gives you a lot for a low price. If you don't mind to read a lot of text, like a challenge, story driven, turn based, tactical RPG then this game is for you.			"

												An excellent continuation to Shadowrun Returns. Dragonfall - Director's Cut is a brilliant iteration of Harebrained Schemes' take on the Shadowrun universe. It is both more polished and less linear, with Berlin being more fleshed out than the seemingly generic Seattle of the prequel. Furthermore, the designers haven't forgotten about gameplay, which is improved beyond the expected simple tweaks. With well written characters, main storyline and side quests all intertwining it is a solid RPG the likes of which we don't get as often in any genre. In Shadowrun/Cyberpunk, it is simply brilliant if not unique.			"

												By far the most fun I've had playing a turn based strategy game in a long time.  Re-playability still being tested.--The Good- The gameplay was intuitive and (with a handful of exceptions because Trolls are tall) fluid.- Soundtrack was always on point with the 'feel' of the gameplay.- Despite being 2D the game's graphics grabbed me; sprites and backgrounds were bright without falling prey to being cartoony, or dark without being drab.  Most of the time it didn't even register with me that the game wasn't 3D.- Both micro (battlefield) and macro (character-building and story based decision making) decisiosns felt like they influinced the other in a variety of ways.- Storytelling was top-notch from the over-arching tale down to several NPC's stories.--The bad- Unable to re-size fonts, and high reolution with a ton of reading made me need to walk away a few times.- Game-play challenges do not come from AI, but from volume of opponents - this frustration is not unique to this game, and it does not suffer from it as badly as many others, but it is still present.- While Karma was balanced (Never felt like 'super-man'), money was never in short supply.  I frequently used combat drugs, always updated my gear, and yet I always felt like I was in the black... even though one of the main points in the game involves scrambling for money.--The Ugly- The only major frustration I had was mis-clicks that resulted from trying to move my team to squares immediatly above other actors.  For about 1/3rd of a second it shows movement to that square, then it highlights the (again, drecking Trolls) sprite in the square beneath my real selection.			"

												I started this immediately after completing Shadowrun Returns and what a vast improvement Dragonfall is. That's not to say Returns is bad, its just that Dragonfall does everything better. You have a fully fleshed out core crew to run with this time, each with their own stories, and a nice hub to operate out of which is a character all its own. There's multiple ways to go about runs and some extra runners to choose besides your core crew. It doesn't feel quite as linear as Returns did but the story and setting are much more expansive, complimented by another great soundtrack that adds so much to the atmosphere.My only complaints are building the crew's skills is a bit shallow and I wish you could control each crew member individually outside of combat. I encountered a couple of minor bugs where I had to either reload to an earlier point or restart the game, nonetheless its still easily a 9/10 game.			"

												Hi there!First and foremost I will mention that I do not plan to provide a synopsis as there is a pretty good one on the store page already.If you've played Shadowrun Returns: Dead Mans Switch and enjoyed it I can say with certainty that you will enjoy this game, myself I played DMS and quite enjoyed it.Story:The story in my opinion is excellent, the side stories are also excellent.I often found myself lost in several of the stories as the game progressed, especially your crews story missions.(Glory, her quest line was awesome...not because I have some sort of crush on the character...no not at all)If you're familiar with the SR universe you already know what atmosphere to expect from a game set in the SR universe.Gameplay:If you like turn based combat, top down point n' click RPG's that require the ability to strategise then look no further.This vs SR:R DMS it's more refined and it's more of a challenge, a rewarding one at that.Music:Has all the same music as SR:R DMS and some more, it's all fitting for the story and genre.Final Thoughts:In one of the final scenes before credits you and your team go back to your safe house and each member of the team has their final piece of dialogue summing up their thoughts and feelings on how the game turned out, this scene had me a little bit sad because I had to say goodbye to these fictional characters I grew way too attached to by the end of it because for the 42 or so hours I played...we went through some stuff.(A testament to how well written the plot and characters are in this game.)Bottom line is....I recommend the purchase and if you're unsure about it put it on your wishlist and wait for it to come on sale because it's worth paying for.Laters Chummer.

												Good story telling/character interaction. Well laid out missions. Improves on Return with more challenges. One mission in particular had me almost annoyed to the point of no return as it kept crashing over and over, and nothing anynone else worked. This is the Apex mission, and had to re-load about 8 times and go through a 20-30 min battle each time just to get to the crash point. Finally worked on my eigth try. No advice worked other than just to re-do as I wasn't using any spells, summons, quicksaves, etc.			"

												Great Game. A must buy if on sale for sure.  During summer sale its dumb not to get it at this price. Made me want to get back into the lore of Shadowrun.  Much like Xcom.  Story had a few interesting endings (all text based mind you, stories) But the choices they make you go through really challenges your mind as to how you want to play your character because they have some pretty dynamic results so you're really always second guessing yourself (in a good way)  Like damm, I should of said something else , I feel like a Jerk etc.  But the well writen endings are top notch too.  Gut checking sick sometimes.			"

												Extremely gorgeous game; the isometric view left a lot of flexibility for the artists to create truly interesting backgrounds.The story is great, with some interesting moral choices to be found not only in the main storyline but also in the optional objectives.The writing and exposition could use some work, but given the sheer volume of it I am more than happy to dismiss that.The combat is very fun and harsh should you make a mistake, but there is an excellent 'rewind' save system so you never lose too much progress. Each class has a plethora of unique abilities and each encounter is very satisfying.Some dialogue trees feel empty and limited, and occasionally you are forced to make arbitrary decisions or are given choices with regards to certain situations that you are never given again, even in the same situations; for example, I was occasionally given the option to 'look from the astral plane' down onto a keypad to see which keys are contained in a passcode, but sometimes I was not. When and where I could use this ability on a keypad was completely arbitrary. Similar situations to this one are frequent in dialogue and decision trees.The game has some UI issues resulting from being designed to be played on a tablet, such as occasionally moving your units to an incorrect spot and wasting an action point. Other than those points, I highly recommend this game.			"

												This is a really great turn-based strategy game. The tactical strategy by the player has to be thought out to some degree, such as hiding behind walls, crates, etc to avoid enemy fire. The leveling system is fun, giving some pretty good advances to the character, like new special attacks, or, my favorite, drone upgrades. The storyline is actually very good, however there is a lot of reading involved if you want to really digest the complexity of the story. But the dialogue is good and the characters are a lot more personal in this sequel than they were in the first game. The battles can be a bit more tedious, especially one in near the end, where the battle lasted about 20-30 minutes and there was no way of ending it sooner. There also is not a lot of exploration or loot involved for those who like to go digging and finding items, treasures, etc. But one of the positives that makes up for it is that you can choose quest endings, or even betray a whole team you agreed to help to kill them, take their money, and still finish the quest. These options that the player can choose really add to the immersion of the game as you can make decisions that hurt the team or make them happy.Overall I would give this game a 7/10. Definitely recommend purchasing it, especially when on sale!			"

												1st 10 hours of the game was so-so, things were very linear. The REAL DEAL is the next 15 hours - incredibly difficult decisions to make. Affects the outcome and my soul :DBig plus for giving teammates story and personality, making them less like a random hired-gun I don't care. Love that team leveling up screen - choose 1 out of 2 skills to advance. This provides me a lil bit of control without having to micromanage everyone. I can't be bothered to plot 20 points into 5 different skill trees. (In other games I will usually click on the ""auto-level up"" button and tweak from there)     Overall a big improvement compared to Shadowrun Returns. "

												As others pointed out, this is a vast improvement over the original Shadowrun Returns. That one played much like an endless tutorial, but Dragonfall at least offers the illusion of nonlinearity, the illusion of a vast open world  -- even though the story is pretty linear, and the world is in fact pretty cramped. But, the illusion works.It's not a faultless game by any means: I found the combat rather simplistic (and the AI often broke my suspension of disbelief), the matrix sequences are uninteresting, and I missed a more complex cyberware system as well. The choices were often lacking in depth, and rarely seemed to affect anything. But then again, the illusion often works, and the decent writing and the moral complexities it sometimes offered helped through the cracks.			"

												Really fun tactical SRPG with old school 2d backgrounds (awesome, gritty artwork and steampunk subject matter).  I bought Shadowrun Hong Kong first and couldn't get into it, so I was very skeptical about this one, but after reading the reviews decided to give it a shot.  Interestingly, both games have almost identical game engines and are set up very similarly, but the way this game flows makes for a completely different experience.  I've on[y played through the first few missions, but the story so far is really engrossing and very easy to follow, where Hong Kong was very disjointed and difficult to understand (at least for me).  Anyway, just so you know, you cannot rotate the screen as you can in most SRPG's.  At first I thought this was a negative, but after getting used to it, I think it works out just fine particularly given the art style.Anyway, great game with a great story so far.  Big thumbs up.H			"

												This was such a great game! The story was amazing, well written and engaging.  I started over after realizing the stores add stock at certain points in the game. Check them often! The end scene (or what I thought was the end scene) gives you many choices to manipulate the ending to reflect your own moral compass. Afterward, there's an epilogue that ties everything together nicely.The only negative comment I have is that all of these Shadowrun games are standalone games. You don't get to import your character and continue where you left off.Hairbrained Schemes did a fantastic job. I'm going backward and beating the first, and then I'll pick up Hong Kong. I hope the continue to make expansions!By the way, if you want to use your team mates to full advantage, play a mage or adept. All other classes are represented, and represented well!			"

												Absolute pearl. One of the best RPGs I've tried in a long time. Plot/setting felt very fresh after mainly having done Bioware games for a while.Combat got a bit repetitive towards the final mission, and I had regular issues in combat with taking actions I did not intend to and having to reload - not bugs, just the GUI occasionally being a nuisance.Too many RPGs punish you for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stuff, forcing you to occasionally glance at online resources if you're not willing to miss out on content.

Having a consistant & interesting cast of characters that accompany you on missions with their own personalities & playstyles is an enourmous improvement over the previous game's hiring random runners. There's a lot of content here in addition to the main story missions and the game will take you all over the place for a variety of fun missions. One of my top rpgs, highly recommended.			"

The effects your choices have on the world are massive, and you often have several ways to resolve situations, none of which are obviously good or bad. There's no voice acting, all of the story is told through reading text, and I jumped in terror at one point in the game. That's how good the writing is. I literally had nightmares about the story, and the effects my choices had. The characters in Dragonfall are some of the most memorable I have ever encountered in any medium - Glory is my favorite character in any videogame I have ever played. I haven't even mentioned the actual gameplay yet, which is also nearly perfect. Seriously, buy this game, it is amazing.			"

												So, I've read a lot of reviews for this game, and they're generally very positive, which I feel doesn't tell the whole story.SR: Dragonfall does have a great story, and is initially very fun. Reminiscent of games like Baldur's Gate or Fallout, but once you get deeper in, it has some really terrible design deicions, that make it a frustrating experience to play.Whenever you start a mission, you have to pick out your team, before you know what you're going up against. Some missions it's great to have a sniper, other missions you'd rather have your shaman with you. The problem is that you don't get any intel on these sort of things before starting, and once you've started the mission, you can't reselect your team members. Not even if you fail the mission and die, which leaves you stuck with a losing team combination, trying the same mission over and over. Tied in with this issue, the games auto-save system always overwrites the latest autosave, so if you want to be able to go back more than one save, you have to save manually all the time. If you don't and you make a mistake (such as selecting the wrong team mates, or bringing the wrong gear), then you're back to being stuck. The first time I played through, I got to the final battle, brougth the wrong crew with the wrong gear, and couldn't finish the mission. Didn't have anything other than the auto-saves, and literally had to start a new game from scratch. There was just no way to beat that mission with the team I had brought, and no way to select a new team and new gear after you died.There are also problems with the balancing of the different classes. If you pick a melee class, such as physical adept, you won't get very far in this game. You do less damage, you have to spend action points just to buff yourself up to do halfway decent damage, and once you get into close combat, the enemy just moves away and shoots you from a distance again. Close combat specialists spend 90% of the action points running around trying to get to their targets. On the other hand, going ranged combat and stacking points in rifle is just so much stronger than any of the other options, that there's really no reason to attempt anything else. A street-samurai with ranged combat spec does the same damage as a damage specced mage, but can take a hell of a lot more punishment.So yeah, SR: Dragonfall has a nice story and a cool atmosphere, but these design choices can seriously cut down on the fun you'll have.

												A neo-anarchist cyberpunk dream game. Highly recommended for fans of Planescape: Torment and Fallout 1 & 2. Without giving spoilers, I laughed out loud at the cleverness of one particular sidequest-- a run for bioware enhancement samples for a disgraced doctor. (A bit like the tone of the dystopian movie Brazil.)Although Shadowrun character creation is daunting (I played with character builds alone for 5+ hours), I'd buy all the game devs a soykaf for the solid central storyline and side missions.

												I just finished the Director's cut, having played the first version.The game was replayable and the five new missions were interesting (one is especially funny, and one is especially sad).Pros :- Berlin is a wonderful setting (the anarchist state is such a good idea !)- The cyberpunk aesthetic is very well rendered- A well balanced and challenging enough turn-based tactic game (if played in ""Very hard"" mode)- A good mix between RPG and tactical games- Excellent side stories (the NPC become very interesting, like real people, not just assets)- The player faces real choices, and sometimes hard dilemmas.- ReplayableContras :- Minor bugs- Some PC templates and carreers are weak as their main attributes are not useful during the RPG phase (ie. Physical Adept) ; at the opposite stand the Decker and the Shaman.- The inventory (objects cannot be given during the mission, only before)- A little bit short (25-30 hours)Conclusion : A very well written and immersive story, a love letter to the cyberpunk genre and a very good turn-based game.Let's call it a gem.By the way, it is even better than Shadowrun : Hong-Kong, and much better than Shadowrun Returns, which story lacks of a good twist.

												This is really an amazing game. I've owned it for over a year, and started it up and made a new character with different builds more then a few times, and only saw the first few missions in the game trying them out before stopping again.Just recently came back to it and decided to finish it, and that is something I recommend everyone interested in the Shadowrun Universe to do, play it through all the way to completion, the end and everything leading up to it really ramps up and plays out amazingly.There are almost infinite options for how to play the game and where you end up based on the full range of Shadowrun stats and character build options, cyberware, spells, consumables, team story lines, team upgrade options, team mate choices.The biggest thing that stood out to me with Dragonfall is just how many really huge choices you have to make in the story arc, that have really different impacts on the way it plays out. There are a few really big choices in the game that had me legitimately needing to decide what my characters feelings and point of view on that would be and what they would want out of it, because they aren't good and evil, they aren't right and wrong, they are all gray and may be good for some people or bad for others. I love RPGs but I am normally all about stats and loot and building a great fighter, not caring as much about the characters perspective, but this game really engages you in actually thinking about your character from that angle in your choices.I really enjoyed all the different ways you have access to overcome different fights or challenges, through charisma, or etiquette, spellcasting or strength, viewing things in the astral plane, or using the matrix and hacking to bypass things.It is a lot of reading, but well worth it IMO, it does a great job of making you WANT to know the answers to the questions you have, you really feel invested in it by the end and there are some crazy turns you don't see coming but make you even more interested and needing to know more, and I think some of the conversations near the end of the game are insanely deep, with many branching options that are very fulfilling and don't leave you feeling pigeon-holed or wanting, and let you talk your way out of things, and don't leave you feeling like it didn't matter either way which most games with choices do.Would 100% recommend to anyone interested in great stories, deep stat/character build RPGs, tactical/turn based combat, Elves, Dwarves, Orks, Trolls, Dragons, Magic, Martial Arts, Sniping, Grenade Launchers, Shotguns, Futuristic, Hacking, Cyberdecks, and all the other cyberpunk goodness of the 6th world.

If you are a fan of table top gaming then this really captures that fealing at a high level. Dialogue is good and response choices are decent. There are multiple endings to the game as I experienced at least two of them.There are only two minor negatives. 1) The game didn't seem to like tabing out during gameplay. 2) The variety of hand-to-hand weapons was a little skimpy, with no magical weapons at all that I found.It will run on lower end PCs which I think is a big plus these days because some of the newer games have very high minimum hardware requirements.

												A must-have for every person out there enjoying tactical, story-driven sci-fi games.When i first started playing i immediatly fell in love with the well-written characters working alongside the player character. The gameplay improved a lot in comparison to the first game, Shadowrun Returns, although the graphics stayed almost the same.The story has some nice little twists that really catched me off guard and i still regret one of the main choices i made. The missions are mostly well made, only one (raising money) dragged on at times.Over the course of the game the development of my own character came up a little short, but you could make up your own story and i think a closer look to your own past might've really destroyed this 'be anyone' aspect of the world/game.Overall i can recommend the game this game to anyone willing to overlook the pretty old graphics and the small, but well-written world.

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is a narrative-driven cyperpunk/fantasy RPG with turn-based combat, and it's one of the better gaming experiences I've had in recent years.-----PRO:-The story is second to none with some of the best prose I've ever read in a game.-A small but unique and memorable cast of major characters.-Turn-based fights break no new ground, but the combat is diverse and manages to be mostly interesting.-Graphics are simple, but the stylish art conveys a gritty mood that's true to the franchise. A clever character creation system matches a 2D portrait to the chosen 3D preset.-GREAT soundtrack.CON:-Low-poly character models, and a lot of animations are very stiff. A fair number of blatantly recycled assets appear over and over throughout the game (and this applies to ambient audio as well).-Certain fights are just too long, sometimes devolving into frustration, and get in the way of moving the story forward.-The game is at times a bit too ""retro"" for its own good (e.g. describing a ventilation diagram in great detail instead of just showing it). Also, the video game-ified Shadowrun ruleset can make progression feel like a highly restricted crawl, and too few dialogues compensate for this by allowing team members to pick up the slack for the player character's weaknesses.-Non-crew shadowrunners for hire need to bring a bit more to the table, or there needs to be more chances to earn disposable income. As it is, money is precious, and the hirelings just aren't worth it.-Late in the game, a few moderately important NPCs are missing portraits. I don't know if the art budget ran out or what, but these omissions were very noticeable.-----All in all, despite a handful of minor issues, Dragonfall is a must-play for anybody interested in old-school-inspired role-playing with an A-grade story.

												I absolutely love this game. Everything from Shadowrun Returns was made even better, and I really appreciated having a real crew and stories to become invested in, regarding my team - instead of (mostly) hiring strangers to go on runs with me.All of the over the top cyberpunk flavored film noir meets fantasy meets futuristic dystopia you'd expect, is present. Even so, there are some parts of this game that really really got me this time around (especially Glory's backstory, damn!). And there are so many plot twists and levels of conspiracies throughout.If there is one complaint you see a lot about these games, its that they are too linear and should be far more open world. I don't agree with this. I understand the idea and sentiment behind those types of comments, but that set up works far better in a tabletop game with a DM, than it would in a video game. If anything, I approve of the much deeper connections and invested interests you make from having a more detailed storyline, and you can't really have that both ways.All in all its an improvement over Shadowrun Returns, which means I have nothing more to say about this game, other than clicking ""recommended"". Go ahead, jack into the matrix. "

												I must say, I've had a great time with Shadowrun: Dragonfall. The intro mission pulled me in and the story of the game made me see the game through without playing much of anything in the meantime. The atmosphere makes any fan of cyberpunk feel right at home. The main storyline is interesting, with good buildup. The ending act left me a little bit unsatisfied as it comes out with a few predictable twists, but it's a great ride nonetheless, with good characters, good character development (talking about your teammates) and varied main and side missions.The levels itself are not vast, but they have enough areas to go through that it does not feel like a small game. Exploring every part of the levels is rewarded, atleast in some small way.The ""normal"" combat in the game is not bad by any means, I personally enjoyed it. It's XCOM-style, turn-based gameplay, mixing gunplay, magic, explosives, gadgets and drones. It's quite a bit of fun when it goes your way and RNG doesn't mess up your plans.The weak link of the game is the matrix-hacking sequences. The problem with them is that they are boooring, tedious to get through, fighting through repeating wave of enemies over and over again and you have to make every step in turn-based mode, making it that much slower.tl;dr- interesting main story- lots of morally grey choices- fun combat (when it goes your way)- tedious matrix (hacking) sequences- varied builds			"

I love RPGs but I am normally all about stats and loot and building a great fighter, not caring as much about the characters perspective, but this game really engages you in actually thinking about your character from that angle in your choices.I really enjoyed all the different ways you have access to overcome different fights or challenges, through charisma, or etiquette, spellcasting or strength, viewing things in the astral plane, or using the matrix and hacking to bypass things.It is a lot of reading, but well worth it IMO, it does a great job of making you WANT to know the answers to the questions you have, you really feel invested in it by the end and there are some crazy turns you don't see coming but make you even more interested and needing to know more, and I think some of the conversations near the end of the game are insanely deep, with many branching options that are very fulfilling and don't leave you feeling pigeon-holed or wanting, and let you talk your way out of things, and don't leave you feeling like it didn't matter either way which most games with choices do.Would 100% recommend to anyone interested in great stories, deep stat/character build RPGs, tactical/turn based combat, Elves, Dwarves, Orks, Trolls, Dragons, Magic, Martial Arts, Sniping, Grenade Launchers, Shotguns, Futuristic, Hacking, Cyberdecks, and all the other cyberpunk goodness of the 6th world.

												One of the best stories I've ever experienced in a video game. (Sadly not THAT high of a bar to pass) Rivals the stories of KOTOR 1 and Planescape: Torment quality wise. Gameplay reminds me of XCOM, so if you like that, you'll like this. Absolutely recommend it. I've even started reading one of the books now.Oh yeah, the soundtrack is phenomenal too. youtube it.			"

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is an isometric-view cyberpunk RPG with tactical turn-based combat set in 2054, and the first expansion to Shadowrun Returns. After the Awakening in 2012, which brought back magic and fantastic creatures into the world, it was plunged into chaos. Now, over forty years later, dragons and corporations rule the lands. You're one of the Shadowrunners, mercenaries for hire who are ready to do all the dirty work undercover, provided the clients are willing to pay enough money. After leaving your old team and city you worked in, you join Monika Schäfer in Berlin on a simple ""milk run"". Unfortunately, not all is well as you're about to stumble across a conspiracy as old as the Awakening itself...Well, let's start with the most obvious, how the game looks like. While the models aren't incredibly detailed or anything, and the backgrounds are entirely in isometric 2D, they are very rich in details and heavy atmosphere. Exploring the dark streets, sewers and labs of anarchistic Berlin is not something you'll find everywhere. You don't know what awaits you in the shadows, and the thrill of exploration, knowing that behind the next door could wait a squad of enemies, is something quite nerve-wracking at times.Sound design. While the sound effects I'd say are some of the most basic and generic ones, they're more than sufficient. This game has a very well-made soundtrack however. Most of it is electronic, something that fits the cyberpunk theme, but occassionally you get things that stand out and are really nice to listen to, like Horn and Ivory, Catharsis or Calling All Runners.Gameplay, outside of combat you're leading your team of Shadowrunners through various locations, talking to NPCs and using your skills, wits and deduction to proceed further in. In-combat, the game is a turn-based cover-based tactical strategy, where gunplay, magic and melee combat all thrive together. To note from me, even the normal difficulty setting can be plenty challenging for a player and is more than a worthy choice for your first playthrough.You can obviously create your own character and choose how to upgrade your abilities: there is a lot of options to choose from. From the five races, human, elf, dwarf, ork and troll, each having their own innate stat bonuses. Amongst the abilities, we have melee weaponry, gunplay with different types of weapons like rifles and shotguns, cyberdecking (hacking), rigging (using drones), spirit summoning, a few different schools of magic (shamanism, sorcery and chi channeling)... You can either use a premade class of sorts for your character or take it in your own hands with how you want to customize. Buying gear, including permament body enhancements called cyberware (which can be replaced but never removed once installed) which strengthen your abilities far beyond what weapons and armor can ever give you, but at the cost of losing Essence - which is your main catalyst for magical spells.The story is detailed and engaging. I often found myself just wanting to go through at least one more mission before hopping off to see what happens. Your team members all have their own stories to tell with their own side missions to complete, and there are major conspiracies to uncover. My only major complaint is that about half of the game revolves around gathering enough money to pay for the information you need towards your main goal so the story just kind of stops save for restoring extra DVDs with data and some mentions here and there for side stuffs and jobs.Another thing I really like is the amount of choices you can make during the course of story. All of them have an impact on your environment, with rumours spread around and different aftermaths. The choices you make when conversing with your teammates have an impact on how they change. Most importantly, there is almost never a clear good vs evil option - just different shades of gray, leaving it up to you to choose the one you think is morally right, knowing well that the potential consequences can be world-changing.Shadowrun: Dragonfall is an old-school RPG, and a hidden gem amongst its kind. It's dark, atmospheric, and hard at times, specifically tailored to satisfy those who like old, difficult games with a lot of depth to them. It's the kind of thing where you just want to uncover all of its secrets and find all the hidden details about the plot. I heavily reccommend this to anyone who enjoys RPGs and / or turn-based strategy games - both kinds of players will feel right at home.			"

												Changed my vote from negative to postive after finishing the game. I still think the game have some design choises that hurt the game. But aside them there is a good read to be found, no joking about that. If you found the story in games like pillars of eternity or Divinity original sin to be weak or dull, give this game a chance if it is on sale. Very mature story, characters and dialogs are on point and some twists will eat your mind in reflexion. I could go more on detail about what makes the story so good but trust me, since planescape torment i haven't read wall of texts so well delivered.			"

												I played it, it was fun, not that difficult, almost a clone of Shadowrun Returns.  Game is pretty linear and battles are X-Com-esque (although more stripped down).  Story kept me going until APEX matrix level, which became an exercise in tedium.  The constant respawn whenever you enter or reenter a section is pretty awful game design.  I didn't want to go through the thing again (took a bit of time) so I read the rest of the story (not much left) and uninstalled.  Very meh but worth a playthrough if you get it at a deep discount.

												At first I have to admit, I am a Shadowrun fanboy and I really, really love this Storyline (which starts really slow but sucks you in after a cuple of hours) and also the genere.I don't think, like others say its too easy. To me the gameplay feels just fine, if I'd like it to be more of a challenge I'd go up one Difficulty, there are 5 available, I play it on ""normal"".What bothers me though is, after several hours (about 20 to 25) into the game it seems like more and more underperforming / bad programmed and I am pretty sure my machine has slightly more power this game needs (I5-4690K, 16GB ram, Gtx 1070, not overcklocked at all). I got several black screens while loading a save, it judders occasionally and sometimes gets stuck for a few seconds (3 -10) while i can scroll but neither move nor use abilitys. Thats kinda frustrating.There are as well a few things wrong with the gameplay itself:1. Walls do not usually count as coverage. I think thats very strange.2. The AI is really weak sometimes (running between 2 points instead of seeking coverage, shooting, etc. ...) - Occueres not too often but sometimes.3. Visibility arround corners or sometimes even in a straight line is programmed really, really bad. What happend to me once for example: Despite one character standing in a straight line to another witout any obstacles between them, they couldn't see and therefore buff / heal each other.I bought this game on sale and enjoyed playing it very much to this point. Nevertheless, if you are easy frustrated by the issues I mentioned above, you might get it on sale to give it a try or wont get it at all. I would recommend it to fans of the Shadowrun universe because of the flair and the story. I love it and would buy it again, but it's not perfect at all, keep that in mind before you buy it.			"

												Excellent game. The story is nice, non-predictable and with several plot twists. At first I wasn't sure whether I like the more open worldy feel over the very straight narrative of the predecessor SR Returns. But ultimately, I enjoyed doing these side quests, especially those that reveal more about your party members. I liked the Glory side quest in particular. Game mechanics are solid and what you would expect from a turn based combat fighting game. You got guns and magic and drones to fight with. And you got skills for each character which you can level as you progress. The decking/matrix stuff is still not that interesting and basically just fighting in a different setting, but that's okay, too. Very warm recommendation.			"

												I absolutely love this game. Everything from Shadowrun Returns was made even better, and I really appreciated having a real crew and stories to become invested in, regarding my team - instead of (mostly) hiring strangers to go on runs with me.All of the over the top cyberpunk flavored film noir meets fantasy meets futuristic dystopia you'd expect, is present. Even so, there are some parts of this game that really really got me this time around (especially Glory's backstory, damn!). And there are so many plot twists and levels of conspiracies throughout.If there is one complaint you see a lot about these games, its that they are too linear and should be far more open world. I don't agree with this. I understand the idea and sentiment behind those types of comments, but that set up works far better in a tabletop game with a DM, than it would in a video game. If anything, I approve of the much deeper connections and invested interests you make from having a more detailed storyline, and you can't really have that both ways.All in all its an improvement over Shadowrun Returns, which means I have nothing more to say about this game, other than clicking ""recommended"". Go ahead, jack into the matrix. "

There is a good enough story, until now I didn't need to do a lot of grinding or side quests, but the different choices one has don't seem to affect the long run / end game. They sure enough change the outcome of the current mission but there are no consequences?The mechanics are simple enough to have a good start and can be challenging enough to keep you interested. The music is ok, the sound in general is good (gun shots etc). Playing on 'normal' I had to replay one mission because I made a rather big mistake, but other than that it could be a little harder.

												I must say, I've had a great time with Shadowrun: Dragonfall. The intro mission pulled me in and the story of the game made me see the game through without playing much of anything in the meantime. The atmosphere makes any fan of cyberpunk feel right at home. The main storyline is interesting, with good buildup. The ending act left me a little bit unsatisfied as it comes out with a few predictable twists, but it's a great ride nonetheless, with good characters, good character development (talking about your teammates) and varied main and side missions.The levels itself are not vast, but they have enough areas to go through that it does not feel like a small game. Exploring every part of the levels is rewarded, atleast in some small way.The ""normal"" combat in the game is not bad by any means, I personally enjoyed it. It's XCOM-style, turn-based gameplay, mixing gunplay, magic, explosives, gadgets and drones. It's quite a bit of fun when it goes your way and RNG doesn't mess up your plans.The weak link of the game is the matrix-hacking sequences. The problem with them is that they are boooring, tedious to get through, fighting through repeating wave of enemies over and over again and you have to make every step in turn-based mode, making it that much slower.tl;dr- interesting main story- lots of morally grey choices- fun combat (when it goes your way)- tedious matrix (hacking) sequences- varied builds			"

												Dragonfall is without a doubt much better than Shadowrun Returns (Dead Man's Switch aka DMS). The game feels longer, with a more intriguing story and overall more meaningful choices. If you enjoy isometric, story-rich, turn-based, post-apocalyptic, team-building combat this is a good one. Story - *Some spoilers ahead*The comparisons to DMS is inevitable. Dragonfall's story to me was much better than DMS - there was more at stake and certainly much deeper connection to each of the team's characters. In DMS, you start the story based on a friend's dead man's switch triggering you to find his killer and collect the money held in escrow. Along they way you collect team members through the storyline. Dragonfall throws you into an existing team, with your old friend as the leader. Immediately the team members each have unique personalities. The motivations are much stronger for you to resolve the story and the grand conspiracy at the end of Dragonfall is much more interesting than DMS' cultist bug spirits. You also get to see each character grow, as you support and work through their problems with them (and maybe go through a few missions to help each of resolve something from the past). Overall, fantastic writing and I actually felt like choices mattered. I actually wanted to replay stuff and try different dialogue options.GameplayThe gameplay in Dragonfall is largely similar to DMS on the surface level. It's isometric turn-based combat, with a lot of different dialogue options that can open up depending on what skills/etiquette your character has. I roleplayed as vegeance incarnate as a decking rigger that dabbled in magic. In DMS, it really seemed that it doesn't matter if you were a jack of all trades, and whilst Dragonfall didn't punish you too harshly for it, it's highly recommended that you become a master. I also felt that Dragonfall allowed for more varied non-combat approaches which were nice. GraphicsSimilar graphics to DMS - again the character portraits are a bit ugly.SoundThe music was actually quite good this time aroundOverallWould definitely recommend buying, especially as a pack together with DMS and Hong Kong.

												Great game overall.  If you like Shadowrun, or cyberpunk in general this might be right up your alley.  The game is much improved over Shadowrun Returns in terms of its mechanics, structure, and pacing.  I personally found the writing, story and character development to also be much more enjoyable and fleshed out than Returns managed.  The only thing I would suggest you consider is if you're okay with a somewhat darker tone, since this one leans more towards the black trenchcoat side of the spectrum than the pink mohawk.Pros:+The writing (The dialogue in particular is great and the story sets a fairly consitent tone)+Never takes itself *too* seriously (Yes this is a somewhat dark story but it never forgets that it is a Shadowrun game and as such has some silly stuff as well)+Mechanically the game is fun and most possible builds seem pretty viable, even on Hard difficulty+Replay value (Both mechanically rolling different characters and narratively making different choices)+Your core team of runners is almost always available and you don't have to hire on mercs or be a jack of all trades+The soundtrack sets the mood wellCons:-Too many unavoidable ambushes (Open a door, enemies get free shots on you and you cannot position your team manually, often leaving them clumped and prime targets for AoEs)-Over-reliance on a few of the etiquettes, others are fairly uselessI think that this game is a gem and probably the best computer RPG I've played since Baldur's Gate II.  At several points the game allows you to make your own connections to what is going on (What is your relationship to Monika? What sort of Shadowrunner ARE you?)  I love that it allows you to have teammates do things if your character can't deal with certain skillchecks (Have a low strength decker? Get Eiger or Glory to force a door for you!)  At its best it feels a bit like an actual tabletop RPG with all the dice-rolling abstracted out.  Even at its worst it's a pretty fun tactical RPG.  I'd absolutely recommend it to anyone who wants a good RPG or digs Shadowrun's aesthetic.			"

												As you can tell by my playtime I loved the hell out of this game. As a writer I can honestly say that this is some of the best writing I've seen in an RPG. There's a lot of text to go through, but you never get tired of it like you can in some games. It seems simplistic at first glance, but it's a lot of fun.			"

												Pros:-Great Story-Gameplay is solid, classic turn based combat off of the table top version-The talent tree actually does alot and effects how you play-The characters are really well developed and diverse in personality-The setting is amazing, visually and allNuetral:-Lots of Text (not really con if you don't mind reading) and there is no voice acting, which I feel in the end helps becuase they could put more diversity in the conversations for less money-Pretty Long storyCons:-Not really that difficult, I only had 1-2 encounters that really stopped me, and the strategy never gets too much deeper than flanking, take good cover, and optimizing the posisiton and weapons of your team-The UI for configuring your team confused me at first, but you get used to it-The team discards any items you give them at the end of an encounter-The hit boxes can be quite annoying to trigger sometimes			"

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall is the second part of the Shadowrun series by Harebrained Schemes and while I was not really satisfied with its predecessor Shadowrun Returns, Dragonfall gets almost everything right. Play time is longer, the gameplay is a little improved. Technically the game is still neither really beautiful nor impressive, but the screenplay is outstanding. Character design and quests are made with a lot of passion and the story is very good. In addition, the many different ways to skill your character and the many ways to solve quests (talking/hacking/fighting/drones...) will keep you well-entertained till the end, maybe also for a second playthrough.If you want to play an RPG with great story, screenplay and character design and entertaining turn-based combat in an original scenario (ufortunately there are not too many games set in the Shadowrun universe), this is for you.

												Where Shadowrun Returns built the foundation, Dragonfall raises the buildings, and the Directors Cut creates an empireBetter UI, smoother combat, and a more fleshed out storyline that has sidequests that don't detract from the main objective. The other Runners, rather than just drop-in, drop-out guns for hire, can now be fully eschewed for a cast of characters that are creatively written and endearing in unique ways. Each of their histories give an engaging insight into who they are, what they did in the past and why they are at your side now, along with a mission for each of their backstory conclusions if you uncover enough in the right fashion.I personally ran as a Rigger, with Eiger accompanying me at long range with sniper rifles, Dietrich in mid range and Glory doing close combat, but the choices of your class are up to you.This game, along with it's fellow titles: Shadowrun: Returns and Shadowrun: Hong Kong come on sale regularly with fantastic discounts for PC. It's worth getting, either on Steam, or on mobile.			"

												Excellent RPG! Engaging story, great characters, tough choices - together makes it feel like a true ""role-playing"" game where you carve out your style. Tactical combat, good set of options for character skills and gear, great atmosphere between the art, music, world-building. My journey went almost 30hrs with some replayed scenes and doing all side quests, and a memorable journey it was. My first Shadowrun Returns-era game, will be trying Hong Kong too.Edit: Few weeks later I will hear something that brings me back into the music of this game - really liked how the soundtrack fit the feel of the game!

 Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut Dragonfall c'est l'extension de Shadowrun Returns devenue un jeu à part entière. Du coup on est pas vraiment face à une suite. L'histoire est indépendante du premier opus et le moteur graphique est le même. Il y a toutefois quelques améliorations mais pas de quoi casser trois pates à un canard.On est en présence d'un RPG classique en vue isométrique (un cRPG à la fallout). On gère une équipe de shadowrunner (Sortes de mercenaires undergrounds) des combats au tour par tour. Tout au long du jeu, le joueur se retrouvera face à des choix moraux. Qui influenceront plus au moins la suite de l'histoire. Le tout est admirablement bien écrit et les drames contribuent à dépeindre l'ambiance de cet univers fantasy/cyber punk.Vous aurez le droit plusieurs fins sensiblement différentes mais aussi une alternative géniale et très sombre.Cependant, sachez avant de vous lancer dans l'aventure que le gameplay n'est pas parfait, l'IA est assez énervante avec ses comportements illogiques ""Salut, c'est moi le méchant et si je venais me mettre à couvert à côté de toi"". Mais le plus énervant est le spam de grenades, dès lors que vous avez au moins 2 personnages suffisament proches, les enemis se mettent à lancer des grenades. C'est systématique et d'autant plus énérvant que les couvertures et endroit souvent exigus où les combats on lieux favorisent la proximité des membres du groupe.Quoi qu'il en soit, Shadowrun Dragonfall est un excellent RPG à l'ancienne, et ce qui est assez rare à notre époque.

												Relatively a short one in terms of RPG's, but long enough to have a great storyline, awesome character development and some hilarious speech choices (especially for an egotist Decker).Warning: Be prepared for a lot of reading. This is the type of RPG where voice acting is not applied, and runs largely off imagination for this aspect. It's not a problem for most, but I realise some people don't like reading in their games.			"

												Fended off blood wizards and megacorporate security while scouring the matrix to free vat-grown sacrificial humans from their fate, this game achieves the juxtaposition of meat-/cyber-space that often epitomises cyberpunk action. I really, really enjoyed that. When it worked.Some of the gameplay systems are a bit questionable (ambiguous extremes in dialogue, insufficient information to form the ideal team, not being able to simply outfit your entire crew - despite the wide array of weaponry, spells and decker gear on offer), but it's an enjoyable enough narrative experience for fans of cyberpunk that it stands in spite of those flaws. The game is prone to softlock in the matrix, arbitrarily being able to fix itself after a variable amount of time: at least a few occurances in my twenty hours played, it's been alt-f4 worthy. There are a number of missable flags in this game, which in the context of playing with the sideaim of achievement acquisition is a bit disappointing. You even stand to miss out on missions outright if you're not consistently talking to everyone, or if you do things in a slightly incorrect order. That bothers me: it should at least be flagged that characters have unique dialogue. Saving early and often works to get around this, but my experience of the game featured some pretty lengthy save and load times (even playing on an SSD).Cool game. Happy to have experienced it.			"

												I heard about Shadowrun Returns through GameInformer, but did not actually get any of the new Shadowruns until this one came on sale. After many hours, I can happily say that I would have paid double for it. I recommend it with some caveats. It can be difficult to start, so I would suggest a guide and definitely not trying to build your character from scratch. The turn based gameplay and isometric view can be offputting, so beware. The story is solid but not anything the will win an award anytime soon. The thing that keeps the most invested are the small moments, such as being a total scumbag and taking the money because you need it. Or leaving someone to die because that is the only way you'll get out of there. The best way to put it is that it is a cyberpunk Fallout with magic. The original, isometric Fallout.TL;DR If you like slower, turn based gameplay with an isometric view, then this is the game for you. Otherwise, be cautious and test it out.			"

												This is a standalone story and you do not need to play the previous title to understand everything. Knowledge of the Shadowrun Universe is not required either to be immersed in the story.  In my opinion you can skip Shadowrun Returns entirely and just play this because in my opinion this is the best entry of all the Shadowrun Games (including the new one in Hong Kong).I really liked the plot, the characters and their backstories They made this whole universe much more believable. However I do not think the combat was objectively very good. I enjoyed it but at times I wished I didn't have to fight so much. Don't get me wrong, the combat is okay but it is not outstandingly good and I think it was a little bit bland at times. The plot and all the story elements were the fun thing for me. There is no voice-over though. Be prepared to read a lot. I heard this was a problem for some people nowadays.If you are interested in the Shadowrun universe, a dystopian setting and turn based RPG experiences you should definitely check this out.			"

												Shadowrun: Dragonfall feels like an ode to classic RPG's. Even though it lacks the 'real' Open-World and with it the sense of freedom and exploration, it still feels good. More in the sense of reading a cool cyberpunk book (yes, this game entails a lot of reading) and have it accompanied with artwork and a worthy soundtrack. The turn-based fighting system does everything right, still gets a little repetitive towards the end of the game. I guess this is your best bet, if you need to bridge the waiting time until we all get our cyberpunk fix with the new cd projekt game.			"

												Get your gear runner, it's time.One of the epitome's of Shadowrunning history, all fans of cyberpunk, fantasy, SR itself, Turn Based RPGs, etc. should play this game. The atmosphere and story alone are worth far more than the cost of admission, the gameplay itself is also very well refined. There is a bit to be desired for in terms of UI and especially time within the matrix, but it mostly has to to with the universe, so it still feels appropriately annoying. Get used to it chummer, not everything can be perfect. But those moments are still few and far between. So what are you waiting for?			"

												A big step up from shadowrun returns in terms of story. -You're given teammates that have unique personalities and backstories. -The characters in your hub town make you care about the world and people in it-writing is really good, dialogue trees rival those of triple-A titles like mass effect. Hare brained schemes really took the time and effort to listen to fans after shadowrun returns. The result is an alive cyberpunk world with a well written story that is definetly worth a buy.			"

												It's hard to judge Shadowrun games. If you own just Dragonfall - DC, you'll get it over with a couple of lines like ""amazing! Very cool story, engaging combat!"" but if you played Returns, Dragonfall and Hong Kong, it becomes a little harder.I think in this case it's about ""Quality over quantity"", in comparison to Hong Kong, Dragonfall really takes the cake for quality. Even so, even quantity overflows in comparison of what Dead Man's Switch in Returns has to offer. The main campaign of Dragonfall is one of the best out there, imho, even though I still need to dig in the mods (got a couple of titles that look promising) and to be completely honest, if I had played Hong Kong before Dragonfall... dunno, I think the spark wouldn't... spark. I fell in love with Dragonfall: The Flux State, Berlin, your party and the world around are SO passionate.Options for resolving the missions are WIDE. With wide I mean that I was not prepared for it: there are a ton. Having played Returns AFTER Dragonfall I can totally see the sheer amount of dialogue options they added.Combat is better than in Returns, and bugs are non-existant. Atleast, my run was glitch-free. I enjoyed it every minute and I would recommend this over anything.To notice that I did not know anything about the Shadowrun world before this game, and I've read a lot on the wiki just to get a shape of what those various events/tidbits you find about the world are supposed to really be (Hong Kong does this a bit more than Dragonfall, but still you'll find a lot of sidequests pointing you at things happening at other cities in the world, Chicago or Seattle included).The price is a bit hefty, but it's Returns all over again: a very good official campaign, and the campaign editor. Totally recommended.10/10			"

												My introduction to the Shadowrun series (yeah, I know playing a game that was originally DLC for another game, Shadowrun Returns) and I gotta say I'm pretty impressed. I really dig the setting first of, it's like if the characters and creatures of Dragon Age lived in the world of Blade Runner. The story is very good, it doesn't feel like it's over stating it's welcome and does a good job and keeping you on your toes as to what the big mystery is and it's a good pay off. The characters overall are very interesting though I wish there was more development with them, you look at older RPGs like Planescape Torment and the first two KOTOR games, I really felt like I got to know my party and they interacted with each other in interesting ways. Here, we get to know some of their backstories and what their personalities are but the game doesn't go much beyond that, there are no personal missions for the characters like in Mass Effect for example but they do a good enough job with them.The combat is good. It requires very good strategy and patience especially on the harder difficulties. The role playing is also very good, you can definitely play this game your own way and portray yourself the way you want, although all of the classes have their own limitations so don't expect a street samurai to be a hacking expert which is good, it makes the player have to work around their limitations for a solution instead of looking for the easy way out all the time. I don't like that you can't control your party members outside of combat. What if I'm approaching a room and I want my party members positioned in a certain way? Well, tough luck, You can't (still not as bad as the PS2 version of Persona 3 where you can't control your party members at all)The graphics are average especially with the character models, it's an indie game so I won't be too hard on it but artistically, it gets the job done. It's suppose to make you feel like you're in a dystopian city and it succeeds at that although I find the environments kinda samey. I'm not saying make it like Zelda with fire, water, forest environments or whatever but they could've definitely done more with it than gray hallways, sewers, and more gray hallways. Games like Deus Ex and System Shock I feel did a better job with freshening up the environments and levels while still being consistent with their worldThe music I also think is okay. There are some good tracks here and there but overall it's not a soundtrack I see myself desperating wanting to listening toOverall, It's very good game for fans of cyberpunk. It's not perfect, it's no Deus Ex, System Shock 2, or Snatcher but if you're looking for another cyberpunk game to hold you over until Cyberpunk 2077 finally comes out. This is a solid one to check out and I give it an 8/10			"
