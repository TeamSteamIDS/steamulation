												Evil Genius is a base-building strategy game, similar to Dungeon Keeper. You play as a malevolent mastermind during the cold-war era, with the sole aim of taking over the world. As with all plotting masterminds circa 1970, you have a secret base built within a mountain on a tropical island, and of course, what evil genius is complete without his evil henchmen? These fellas are under your total command and do all dirty work you task them with. You start off by hiring basic henchmen, which carry out menial tasks such as construction or basic room staffing. These henchmen then branch into three different paths: military; science; and social. These paths each have four henchmen types each, ranging from basic guards, to valets, and mad scientists. Henchmen aren't the only things you'll find in your evil lair. There's a variety of room types to be constructed, from barracks for the men to sleep, or security rooms to manage CCTV cameras and hold prisoners. Your base requires power, and your staff have many stats (needs) that must be met. By building each type of room you can meet the demands of your ever growing lair. As you progress, more rooms and various objects for rooms can be researched via your science minions, allowing more depth to your base as well as better ways to meet the ever growing needs of your minions. Finally, no evil lair is complete without traps. Throughout your campaign for world dominance, you're bound to draw the attention of various justice forces. From agents who snoop for incriminating evidence, to burglars trying to steal back ill-gotten gains, building traps can have all kinds of nasty effects on intruding spies. From simple pressure pads and toxic gas, to wind corridors of death, the game offers a wide selection of traps with endless customisation for you to build the ultimate defence against intruders. Outside of your lair, hotels can be built on your island. Pesky tourists want to visit, and in order to keep them busy these establishments can be constructed to help prevent them wandering into your base. Social minions such as valets will man your hotels, and ensure tourists remain outside the base. Hotels can have a variety of recreational objects for tourists to pass time. Away from your island is the rest of the world. Accessed via the world map, you can deploy your henchmen all over the world to perform multiple nefarious acts. From stealing money, to plotting schemes. Henchmen can also be deployed on missions in each region to build notoriety, as well as steal priceless artifacts, or even research that can be used for new objects and rooms. The game itself, in the spirit of most similar British games made in its time, has a strong sense of humour. These moments show in the little things, such as your evil genius gloating over agents locked in your prison cells, or torture scenes consisting of the torturer smoking a cigarette, whilst the unfortunate agent being interrogated begs for a puff. Visually, the game has aged amazingly well. Though the game was released in 2004, the clean and sleek aesthetic has allowed the game to remain as beautiful as it was at release. A rare accomplishment for many older games. Evil Genius visually competes with a lot of games released today. Overall, if you're looking for a base-building game, look no further than Evil Genius. This game is both incredibly fun and absolutely stunning, whilst having plenty of depth and an amazing sense of humour. The game only offers a campaign mode, but will easily keep you playing for around 50 hours or more. If you find yourself wanting more, there are sandbox mods available for you to just freely build the ultimate evil lair. A brilliant game, even by today's standards, and one of the best PC games to have ever been released.			"

												First : Dont Look at my Steam Hours,i played that game way before Steam a long time when it was released.An Evil Genius Tycoon as i would explain it in one sentence.Its pretty unique you cant find any game like this out there.You Play one of 3 Super Villains of your choice and start with bunch of money and handfull of workers on an abandoned island.Now you gonna begin to build your first super villain base inside an old hill,while the game goes on you can send your workers on the world map to every location and let them steal money or let them do missions like kidnapping a specialist ( example : you need to kidnapp and interrogate an police officer for train your workers to be an guard, this goes on with even more specialized experts as you go further into the game ,like scientists, snipers , technician .....)you have 4 types of workers, the normal workers ,an military tree ,an scientists / technician tree and an public worker tree which you need to run an hotel / holiday plant later on the game on your island as camouflage for your underground base.you need train facilitys for that and every worker needs to got though every stage to get trained to an later one inside a tree.and you need every type of your unit,example : only technicians in the scientists/ technician  tree can repair equipment and facility machinery.when your people doing missions or stealing money in an country too long it can get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and send agents,you can either avoid them or distract them or you lead them into deadly traps inside your base.you also need an mortuary inside your base for placing killed enemys agents there,very late in the game the countrys will send super special agents,for example a rambo like from th US and an chinese super agent from asia.The First Island you have isnt the only one,when youre further in the Game you will get on an bigger one dont worry,there is where its maybe a good choice to build an hotel / holiday plantthe game is very old now and im not sure which version this on steam is,there are to find 1 official and 1 community patch in the internet which make the game very playable,but without the steam overlay,atleast at me. you need to get into the game and it takes time to get that,if you wanten an super villain game and was disappointed with Omerta for example,you should try this, especially when its on sale.

Then i see it on steam (compleatly unware) and have to build my game hrs all over again like I'm new. Great game.

												One of my favorite games of all time. Where other games similar to Dungeon Keeper failed, Evil Genius succeeded in so many ways while also creating a world that was unique in itself. The goal of the game is to build an evil secret base on a deserted island and further your plans of world domination. Be careful, however, for the forces of good will do everything in their power to stop you from fulfilling those dreams. You control everything from a birds-eye view where you build rooms and objects via ""blueprints"" which Minions then proceed to purchase and place for you. The game overall is very smooth and challenging. After all these years, I still haven't managed to beat the game and I bought it when it first came out! All in all, I love this game and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to rule the world and throw foolish special agents into giant mixer bowls.			"

												Have you ever thought to yourself ""I'd like to play Dungeon Keeper 2, but instead of imps and demons, I'd like it to be part of a 60s themed Bond movie, complete with creepy villains, an evil lair and strokeable ♥♥♥♥♥*""? If not, why not? *Disclaimer. There's not actually a cat. I lied to you.Evil Genius is a comedic, spy-design dungeon-keeperesque game. It's funny, it's addictive, it's one of a kind and it doesn't get anywhere near the love and appreciation it deserves.It may be a little dated, but don't you want people to play with you when you get old? The graphics have held up surprisingly well and the gameplay is just as solid as it was in 2004. Bonus because of the age, it's pretty cheap now! Give it a chance.			"

												Buy Evil Genius.This game is a fantastic work that will suck down your hours into Satan's Chimney. The concept is simple: you are an evil genius who rules over a set of minions on an island. You defend your base from enemy agents (the ""good"" guys) and send minions out into the world to do evil deeds.  It's simple, but effective and engrossing. Before it was released on Steam, I had over 100 hours logged into this game spanned over 5 playthroughs. That's a few more than my traditional 0.5 playthroughs of most games.			"

												A slow paced and sometimes confusing game, Evil Genius has it's moments and is, by far, the most stylish and well executed game I have ever played. From the awesome 60's soundtrack to the quasi-futuristic design this game a joy to look at and listen to. The game puts you solidly into a 60's spy spoof  world from the opening cinematic to the final credits and is a great game for anyone who loves managment style (tycoon) games or for anyone who ever wanted to own their liar on a volcanic island.

												A childhood classic of mine, previously forgotten about until recently bumping into this on the steam store. Become an Evil Genius! I strongly believe this game has the perfect formula for RTS games, and this is over 10 years old now. The characters and scenario's are both interesting and comical, allowing you to indulge quality tongue-in-cheek humour wrapped in cartoon visuals. I've had more hours then I can think of on this game, prior to owning this on steam. Great to be able to do it all again. An absolute masterpiece and its a shame we never got to see a Number 2. Have yet to try the online version of Evil Genius but now I've had the opportunity to go back and play this wonderful game, it might just convince me to try it out. Thank you, Sierra Entertainment!

												Let me say one thing first.  I have played and loved Dungeon Keeper 1,2 as well as Evil Genius.  Saying Evil Genius is a clone of  Dungeon Keeper is to me like saying Chess(EG) is a clone of checkers(DK).  There are similarities but one is a lot deeper and harder to master than the other.  There is nothing before or since like Evil Genius.  There have been attempts to do something like Dungeon Keeper  with mixed results.  No one has to my knowledge has  even tried with Evil Genius.  It is also the only game I know where so many people(like me) are crying for a sequel.  The game does have some flaws involving minion, space and gold management.  The learning curve is very steep at some points and it is not always intuitive how you do some simple things like interrogate a prisoner.  Even with the bugfix patch it can be a little unstable.  For the first time through, expect that you will have to go to the glossery and the internet for help and that you should save often.  Even on easy mode, Marimba Mamba (the weakest superagent) is most likely going to wipeout  many of your high level minions, steal some of your ill gotten goodies and blow up your power stations while you are checking on an act of infamy.  On the plus side there is a lot of humor and some replayability.  The graphics are dated but it still looks good.  It is worth buying this game, even at its non-sale price.			"

												In its genre it's the best game I have played. Even better than Dungeon Keeper. It can be difficult to figure everything out in the beginning so it is worth having a look at one of the fan sites for tips. Just take the time to learn the mechanics and this game will keep on giving. I think that for 2004 this game was ahead of its time and it still looks good today.

This game IS genius.Inspired by dungeon keeper, EG castes you as a 70's bond villian with the world as your play thing, mange missions to increases you infamy while making fools of the forces of justice, also manage you lair built into a mountain on a tropical island, like DK you can have minions to command traps to lay and agents to fool or dispose of, you even henchman to do your bidding who are powerful enough to go toe to toe with ""Super agents"" 007 types who may eventuallly be sent to stop you.Apart from the genius gameplay this game also manages a wicked sense of humor with the characters and settings a little closer too Austin powers than James bond.Should you get this game?If you like Dungeon Keeper, then Get This game.If you like James bond or Austin powers then Get This game.If you like management sims or humor in your games then Get This game.An essentail modEvil Genius origionally shipped with a number of bugs, and the steam version has not seen all of them eradicated, so I highly advise people to download a small mod that takes care of these problems:http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1638920http://www.gamefront.com/files/20273223/Evil_Genius_Steam_Patch_exeSimply extract this into you EG folder and you're all set to go. The mod contains the official and unofficail mods combined with the bonus content CD for the best EG experiance,An unessential modThere is a another mod that fixes widescreen and resolution limitations, but I've found that it also creates som UI problems so I just play the game at its max 1280 x 1040 which I find satisfactory.One last small tweak.In your ""Evil Genius\DynamicResources\Config"" folder you can open the file called ""concept"" and adjust some settings with notepad..Change all sections for [GameCamera] MaxHeight, from 50 to 70 (or more if you want), this will allow you to observe much more of the action, and to detect intruders to your island more easily.

												An old favorite of mine. I distinctly remember just seeing this on an EB Games shelf when I was 14. I loved the box art at first glance and upon further inspection, I discovered that this game involved the building of a secret island lair, from which countless dastardly schemes could be unleashed upon the world. ""Perfect,"" said young Myself. The only reason I really remember this experience was because the oldest woman I have ever seen working at a video game store tried to get me to show her some form of ID because it was rated Teen. I told her I was fourteen years old and I didn't know of any kids my age who had IDs who weren't sheltered because I didn't know any of these kids because they were sheltered and sat at home playing games about learning and stuff and living life like an inspirational poster, only to dream secretly at night of escape and perhaps even breasts or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or whatever body parts they learned to like.Anyway, I bought this game, took it home and installed it and it ran horribly on my Compaq from the dark ages. I had what fun I could with it barely functioning, but ultimately it got tossed aside for a while UNTIL I GOT A DESKTOP THAT DIDN'T HAVE WINDOWS ME ON IT. I spent days installing games that I once thought were meant to run with the in-game models either upside down or simply invisible for the first time in double digit frames and with all of their visual effects present. I made my way through the pile and then suddenly arrived at this little gem from the past. I reinstalled it and away I went into my second world domination career. My apologies for the story. Moving onto the game, you are tasked with the objective of constructing a hidden lair somewhere on some unknown island (where bumbling tourists and slightly less bumbling secret agents happen to wander to) with the intent of world domination. You must start smaller, however, and your options slowly unfold for you as you progress. It's pretty much Dungeon Keeper in a Bond movie setting. Over time you will research new rooms and equipment to further your schemes. Unfortunately, over time your enemies will become much less forgiving as well. You will eventually have to build a front, an island hotel to lure tourists in until they grow bored and leave. You will have to capture skilled individuals to train specialized minions. But most importantly, you will carry out evil deeds from your control center. This brings us to the world domination portion of the game. This is basically a view of the globe on which you will place minion pieces used for stealing cash for your lair, plotting new heists and whatnot, and carrying out said shenanigans. These plots range from stealing the Eifel Tower to clubbing seals and to obliterating the city of Nashville, Tennessee, thus eliminating country music from the world; your singular act of goodwill throughout the course of the game. It's bursting with humor, much of it slapstick or parodic of spy fiction in general. If that's not your thing, you may not enjoy the game so much, but me? I can't get enough of it. I will say, however, that this is probably where the game struggles most. Playing from this sort of board game-like perspective can become pretty monotonous at times and you ultimately just spend a lot of time waiting. You have to keep a near constant check on it near the end of the game and this becomes nerve-wrecking once you're being bombarded by meddlesome agents at your home base at all hours of the day. Something in the interface to show a sort of minimized view of the information this screen provides during base construction/defense would have been nice.The game is pretty tricky to figure out and will probably take a few practice runs to get the hang of before you can really start progressing. I'd say the first half or so of the game is learning all the intricacies where the second half is more of a ""here's an island, go wild and work towards this ultimate goal"" sort of thing. This is an objective-based game and there isn't much point to just letting your base idly run without moving forward in the story a bit. In that aspect, it's not particularly open-ended and this actually does restrict it quite a bit. Don't go in expecting any sort of free mode. There will be none of that. Of course, if you want, you can totally give yourself all the items and a ton of cash and just make your island into an insane deathtrap for incoming agents.Which brings me to one of the game's strongest features: its base construction. You have a limited space in which to build your island stronghold and there isn't really one way you have to go about it. This is where the game most certainly gives you the most freedom. You can opt to have a very open base, with all of your rooms sort of running into one another for easy maneuvering. Or you can take the route of twisting, tight corridors chock full of traps both deadly and confusing to the enemy (or even your own minions if they're not careful). Your goal in base construction is more or less to keep your heat-generating rooms as far away from the entrance as possible, while keeping things like minion barracks and mess halls towards the front. Or you can always just fill the entrance corridor with flame pits and slaughter every intruder before they even get a chance to step through the door. The AI is just smart enough to keep you on your toes, yet dumb enough to get themselves into some silly predicaments fairly often. About the AI, though, it should be noted that your minions are not directly controllable while in your base (apart from your avatar and your handful of main henchmen), and this can lead to some awkward situations, often involving their unnecessary deaths or dismemberment.I could ramble about this game for a good while, but that's all I can think of off the top of my head that's worth mentioning. I would like to lay out some pros and cons, I suppose:+Wonderful base building; again, traps are a load of fun to play with+Great art direction and style; TF2 reminded me of this when I first saw it+Superb music+Lots of humor, though this is always subjective+Tough, but very satisfying to succeed at+Polish, polish, polish. I don't know of very many glaring bugs in the game-World domination feels kind of like playing a board game, which may not be what you'd expect from this and is also fairly monotonous/stressful as it almost always eats away your minions-Fairly steep learning curve. Some objectives are relatively unclear in their descriptions-Minion AI often leaves a lot to be desired. There is a henchman that will more or less destroy your base if he enters combatWould I recommend it? You bet. Almost every flaw present here can be looked past pretty easily. I know fun is a bad word, but at the end of the day, this game supplies loads of it.  "

												Old but gold - You are an evil genius, plotting world domination slowly but surely.Had this game way before it appeared on steam. Spent countless hours on it!  Micro managing strategy. Take over the world with 3 different plots. Design your base with YOUR traps to keep pesky agents away. Hire personal henchmen to do your biddings. Create a private organization from branches of Military, Science, and Concealment. Create a hotel on your island - concealment to keep tourists or agents from wondering about in your evil lair. Discover new technology for your lair with the science branch. Have your military protect the base and you from the agents of justice and perhaps re-enact an Austin Powers scene! Would bang/10			"

												9/10+ fantastic art style, everything is presented nicely+ best soundtrack in a game+ extremely original idea of a game, executed very well, balanced gameplay, a bit on the hard side if you want to master it, but not unfair+ addictive, great atmosphere- it's meant to be played all at once, you will forget things if you save and play it after many days, since there are no chapters or something like that, gameplay is continuous- as i said, might be too hard for some, but in management games it's all about balance and evil genius has great balanceso where is evil genius 2? waiting for it all these years			"

												Hello Evil genius. Do you want to rule the world? Do you want to steal money? Do you want to boss your minions to get to work? Do you like statergy games? Well We have the perfect combo for you.This is Evil genius. A game made back in 2004. With a top down view of a island which is your base. You will use your minions to dig out part of a mountain and make your base. In it. Place traps, power and even staff rooms. When the base is set. You must multitask between the world map screen and your base as agents will come snooping in trying give away your secrets!Okay enough of that talk. It is really hard to maintain between two things but oh, is it so much fun to see your base come to live. As you progress you have objects you must complete to carry on with your evil plan. Later you will unlock a second island you move to so if you make a mistake. You can learn from it and make your next base even better!I really do recommend this just cause of how it always keeps you on your toes. I even missed out some things of this game because I don't think I should spoil the surprise. If you like abit stratergy and multiplanning. Pick this up. You may not regret it.			"

												Evil Genius is essentially a strategy/management game, where you take the role of the titular genius, in his or her bid to spread their infamy around the world. The game itself takes place almost exclusively on a tropical island that is home to your evil lair. It won't build itself though; the building and improvement of your lair is the main focus of the game.The other main game element is the World Domination screen. The means, by which you actually make a name for yourself, collect resources and find new Henchmen.Henchmen are your specialist minions. They don't get involved in all the daily operations in your base, but instead are directly controllable and can be used to dispatch the forces of justice or can be sent around the world to help with any stealing or plotting currently going on.Throughout the game, tutorial videos become available to you, relating to both the world domination map and base operations. These are useful and certainly point you in the right direction.Anyone who enjoys constant challenge will find much to love in Evil Genius. The majority of the game's features function extremely well and the theme is rock-solid throughout.THE GOOD- Amazing sense of humor, style, and polish- Textures, filters, shading, and colors are used amazingly well- Sound effects, garbled speech, radio broadcasts and so on are wonderful THE BAD- The gameplay is a bit too slowDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

												Evil Genius is an excellent, if old game that is not without its flaws. Players are the Evil Genius, leader of the evil organisation that is planning world domination. The evil genius builds their evil lair, on their evil island. He brings in evil minions to do nefarious deeds and generally just manages the organisation's island lair. And he's evil.You begin by building your base, designing corridors and rooms and placing the neccesary furniture in them. A place for work, a place to let minions relax and recover, a power plant. And then you gradually unlock more rooms and more items, expanding more and more until you've outgrown the small first island. But that will be a while.During your growth, you're going to deal with agents of the forces of good, investigating your base for wrongdoing, and sabotaging, stealing, or outright assualting you. And for you to defeat them there are varying kinds of traps, misdirection, and just plainly having them taken care of by a minion with a gun(Or indeed, multiple minions)The basic gameplay is solid, and while it has a few annoyances in the minion and agent AI, it is still very enjoyable. Base building tickles all the right spots for those who want to be creative, and managing your evil base is even immersive in some ways as you get to be the big boss cartoon villain for a change. It provides you with every tool you may need to feel like you're in charge, with systems that are neither too complex, nor too simple to enjoy. The graphics may be a little out of date, but they are still perfectly fine in most cases. It is true that characters viewed up close don't look as shiny as they may be able to with today's graphics, but when zoomed out and inspecting your lair you will not notice much of this, with an artstyle that matches the game's theme. It remains even today a nice sight to see the corridors and rooms with your minions walking around in them.Sound design is well done, with the music being the best fit for the theme that I could imagine. All other sounds are very much what one expects of them, clean and clear so you can tell what's going on, and the only sound that becomes annoying is your blaring alarm. When you're dealing with a base under attack, you're going to want to keep the alarm on. But your ears will want it off after a while because it is loud and repetitive. More reason to finish off those intruders then!The game happens to also be laden with humour, as after all, you are a cartoon style villain of sufficient evilness, I highly recommend taking a look at interogations and reading the fluff text of your nefarious deeds on the world screen, almost every part of the game fits seamlessly into the others, with a unified theme that never seems to fail or fall apart except for technical reasons. But then, there are issues too. As there are always issues with games that will lessen your enjoyment. Luckily for Evil Genius, these issues are few. Specifically, they are twofold, though other flaws exist.Super agents, and the AI. The AI is the simplest to find, and simplest to complain about. It is incredibly simple, and even without resistance it will not go deep into your base, or pose a threat to your evil genius avatar. A little planning and you will always be safe, though you may lose all your minions as they too don't think about things. You will see a horde of minions happily run into an attacking army to repair the door that is being broken down, or to use a fire extinquisher on an item that is still being actively attacked.The agent AI is not much better. For the 'forces of good' they are remarkably bloodthirsty, with some super agents and soldiers shooting everything that moves on sight. They will enter a hotel and shoot all the valets, bomb the tourists' bedrooms, and declare their mission a success. They will destroy a cardboard target and explode the pressure plate triggering it, then get injured by their own explosion and go on alert because they took damage. The AI is, sadly, incredibly simple and completely incapable of making sense or anything resembling planning. That said, it is still functional, though the killing spree and indiscriminate destruction these agents cause will be most annoying as you can not tell a few highly trained minions to sit back, thus almost guarranteeing that you will be spending the next 30 minutes recovering from AI sillyness. And recovering is a slow thing, as everything is expensive, and income is low.As for the super agents, I won't spoil them. But I will say the complete anticlimax that is the final super agent is a shame. Instead of an interesting ability like the other agents, the only thing this one has is boosted stats and an interface screw. The best way to deal with his ability is to pause the game and fix what he messed up, which can take a while with bigger bases, and manually set everything back to normal. In the end, there is a lot I can say about Evil Genius, but even with its flaws it remains a very solid game capable of hours of enjoyment, unique and interesting with all the right things to make you feel like you are, indeed, the evil genius.

												There is no really need to write another review about this game, everything has been said already, but i make another review because this game really deserves it. I played this game for the first time many years ago, when i saw it on Steam i couldnt resist to play it again, this game is simply fantastic. The point of the game is simple, conquer the world, and to do this you need to build a secret base, steal money around the world, get notoriety doing acts of infamy and stealing legendary loot. It has the feeling of a 007 movie, but you are on the other side. This game is challenging and never gets boring, it makes you want to finish it over again, trying different ways, different building for your base. The part i loved most are the animations of the characters, they make the game humorous and hilarious, unforgettable the interrogation sessions, many times i let the enemies come inside my base because i was focused on the minions while training. Conslusion, buy this game, its great and worth all the money spent.			"

												Easily one of the best simulators where you play the bad guys on the market.Has lots of content, from resource management and minion management to traps and worldwide domination. It does not fall short in any catagory other than story, as there is not much of one, so there is much room for roleplay in this game. Small price tag adds even more to the value, and it's a great game to play to kill time, be it in one sitting or in short bursts. Has a charming humor to it, and the lack of any real dismemberment and bloody carnage further adds this charm to it. The game can be very difficult and very frustrating, especially the last half of the game, but it only adds to the flavour of the game.10/10, would lock Russians in a giant venus flytrap filled room again.

												What can you say about Evil Genius? A game highly inspired by Sharks with frikkin laser beams attached to their heads, Tuxedo'd super agents (damn them all!) with never a hair out of place running into your hotels, opening all your doors and foiling all my evil plans... Kill him, killl him and SALT THE EART... Ahem, I'm sorry. So Evil Genius is a lighthearted (although oddly tactical) game of how to be the Very Best Supervillain you can be.  Start with designing and building a secluded island base and move up to your very own volcano.  Employ henchmen and minions to do your evil bidding around the world.  Grow mad scientists to break the boundaries of physics for new traps, items and weapons! Pilfer, pillage and cause mayhem across the globe while torturing Persons of Interest and Super Agents in the most hilarious ways possible (cymbals, mixing bowls and moonwalking anyone?)It probably sounds like I'm a huge fan of this game and I am, there's not many games that could have kept me coming back literally for years to replay.  It's an oldie, but a goodie, very modifiable, oddly detailed in very peculiar kinds of ways and extremely survivable for long years of playing -  owned it since the first release day many moons ago and still playing it, just found it on Steam and bought it here too with obviously no rugrats... One day, hopefully the mythical EG 2 will be born, until then, I will be waiting with my monkey in a cage trap Mwahahahahaha			"

												A seriously underrated classic. Anybody who was twitching anxiously back in 2005 for Dungeon Keeper III picked up this game like a heroin addict picking up used syringes for their fix. Much to our surprise, we got an entertaining, visually interesting, and mentally tantalizing base-building strategy game with far more depth than you might assume going into it - and far more challenge, too.The premise is pretty simple: you're an evil genius just starting out on his road to world domination - but first you need a base of operations complete with your evil lab, your own private prison, your vault to store ill-gotten goods and your gold, your private sanctum for meeting with the world's biggest and baddest, and of course traps and security measures galore to keep out pesky special agents. What better location than a tropical volcanic island? The user interface and controls are easy to master and the tutorial takes about five to ten minutes to complete. But once you do that, it's on to figuring out how your minions work and function as they all have their own AI and need certain things to function at maximum capacity. Be prepared to make back-up saves and potentially start all over after having realized your entire lay-out for the base is inefficient and wrong. There's no shame in checking out a few guides for this one. Of course if you're an AbsoluteMadman(TM) then feel free to blow up the whole thing and start again - yes, you can do that.The game has tons of interesting features and you'll find yourself attached to all the characters, from your own avatar (this game begs for customizable avatars and not presets), your personal elite henchmen, and all your various science, military, and social minions. The game does a pretty great job explaining its features so I won't linger on that too long, and it keeps a steady stream of new toys for you to play with and make you engaged.A pretty great way to chew up an afternoon or seven. I highly reccommend it.			"

It's a game that the developers made for laughs, and by thor's hammer it does. One of the last true screw around games that was half decent. I love it, I played hours without steam and played acouple with steam. And after writing this review more then likely going to be playing it.

												Evil Genius is a resource management game, similar to Dungeon Keeper (as many have already mentioned).While the game is a bit old, and some of the controls, graphics, and mechanics are dated, the game is still pretty fun to play.You have a limited amount of space to build your evil lair, room by room, on a grid system. You can send agents around the world to sabotage, steal, kidnap, and make you money, all of which help you reach your main goal of world domination. Meanwhile you have to keep your Evil Genius safe in his lair by keeping snooping special-agents out of your base with traps and guards, and by distracting them with a fake hotel front.The game is a little short, and there are only 3 maps, but I still do recommend the game. Whatever shortfalls the game has are madeup by the gameplay, silly humor, and style.			"

												This Dungeon Keeper clone has style.Evil Genius is a sensational homage to spy thrillers in the form of a brilliant base builder were your main goal is to achieve none other than the cliché of world domination. Solid gameplay with enough depth to maintain interest, an abundance of humour and crazy cliché characters like Red Ivan the henchman who'll blow your stuff up whilst ""defending"" you or evil genius Alexis with her hunk bodyguards, Evil Genius offers hours of enjoyment and is likely to consume days of your life if you're not careful.Having first played this back in 2005 with a physical copy I obviously must have bias, and yeah much like Rollercoaster Tycoon I have plentiful nostaglia. For all you know I'm just a zealot, or maybe you'll just have to buy the game and find out yourself.			"

												Evil Genius is a RTS that could be categorized as slow paced.  I have found this to be true.  But, what it lacks in game speed, it compensates in humor and intriguing progression.

												Been eying this one for a while, but finally decided to buy it. And I'm glad I did. Graphics are a little dated, but then it came out in 2004. Even so, it runs well on Windows 10. And holy moley is it fun. There are a few issues though. You  can't manually save, and I'm unsure if it saves upon quitting. Plus the auto saves frequently happen in the middle of running a mission or middle of a nasty assault on your base. It also suffers from the same ""one more turn"" issue that Civilization has. But that's only bad if you have anything you need to do in the next 14 or so hours :)In short, great game.			"

												You are an evil genius who must manage a secret volcano base in the middle of the ocean. You will encounter tourists, spies, soldiers and super agents such as Jet chan and Sean Bond who you must defeat with clever trap placement. You automatically gloat and reveal your evil plan to these agents, should you capture them. You're in charge of global operations, nefarious schemes and yet also tasked with managing your internal affairs, meaning that trying to micromanage too hard will cost you just as much as trying to micromanage too little. I thrive on these types of games, using your brain and outwitting the AI or exploiting little hitches in the game rules rewards your efforts tenfold, where as being lazy or intentionally ignoring certain things will punish you greatly. Games used to be challenging, Not hard, Not easy, and this fits that definition perfectly. The majority of my friends wouldn't make it past the first level because of the level of ""skill"" involved in learning the game mechanics, even though it teaches you as you play without holding your hand.Zooming in to see the little details will often surprise you, everything in the game is animated and unique, as most games where before everything tried to squeeze onto an xbox hd.A must for any Tropico 4 fan.

You get henchmen to buld your base, guard it and even fool turists to try and keep your activities unknown. Sadly there are only 2 levels, but with all the reasearch and the length of time missions can take this is a game you can play for hours on end with the many different traps and science devices you can strap agents too, uncluding a laser like the classic bond film, Gold Finger.

												This game was amazing in 2004.  It set the standard for basebuilding that we have to thank many modern games for today.  The gameplay is fantastic, the premise is amazing, and there is enough versatility that the game has good replayability.  I would love a sequel.  If you don't mind the game being a bit dated then it is the perfect basebuilding game for you.			"

												Take the base building mechanics of Dungeon Keeper with the overworld map of X-com and set it all to a parody of the James Bond universe and you've got Evil Genius. In Evil Genius you play as an arch villian bent on world domination. You start out with a deserted island and a handful of hilariously inept workmen. As you build your base, steal money, hijack national treasures, kidnap specialists, and train your forces you'll move up the ladder of infamy. As you become more notorious the forces of Good will grow increasingly aggressive. Expect the initial annoyance of investigators and burglars to give way to invasions by sabotuers, soldiers, and even super heroes. Evil Genius is an easy recommendation to anyone who enjoys the dungeon building simulations ala Dungeon Keeper, or who likes the theme and setting of James Bond and doesn't mind a game that pokes fun at its foibles.

												Evil Genius is a game that ask the question: Do you want to be a Bond villain? Do you want to be the guy that steals an oil tanker, not for profits, but to dump it in a wildlife reserve. Do you want to be a true mustache twirling villain.The game is a Dungeon Keeper clone, letting you build your lair, improving the various rooms and attracting and upgrading your minions. You only have direct control of your #1 henchman the rest of your minions working on their with you giving them overall objectives to complete.Graphically it does for the same cartoonish look as Dungeon Keeper and it works quite well. The humor is great but often put too much in the background.Evil Genius is a great game but marred by some unfortunate mistakes. Much of the minion management quickly becomes a grind and the difficulty jumps quite a bit once super-spies appears.Definitely worth a buy from anyone that enjoys management games and/or mustache twirling.

												I've played this little gem a lot. So i just bought it on Steam to have it here too, now that it's on sale finally :-)What is it? It's overlooked, underhyped and underrated. Sadly.Take my beloved Dungeon Keeper (one of my alltime top10), take out the evil high fantasy stuff and put in the more-or-less real evil villain and CIA-stuff. And voila!It looks like ""Tropico"" and ""The Sims"" made love with ""Dungeon Keeper"" and ""No One Lives Forever"" in a gruesome gangbang and this is the outcome. ""Dungeon Keeper"" being the gameplay though, the rest defined the optics/theme.I won't dive into depths here, because there is said MORE than enough about this pearl.tl;dr:You've missed this 10yrs ago but are into RTS? Go get it!You've missed this 10yrs ago but are not into RTS? But you like evil villains and games that make a parody of themselves? Give it a try, it's just a few bucks anyway!It even runs fine on Win8.1.1, and with some easy ""hacks"" in FullHD (or more or less) in Borderless Fullscreen. What else can one wish nowadays?(http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=904360)Of course you have to value gamplay over optics, because the graphics are somehow dated.

												An interesting take on the micromanagement style game. It's a good deal of fun, basebuilding and minion management is interesting and very easy to pick up. The technology scaling is also a blast, leading to really entertaining trapbuilding (which could have been a game on its' own). The constant incursion of the forces of justice makes for a nice tense threat element, and the superagents can really do some damage if they have time.However the game is a touch buggy at times, so keep an eye out for stuck minions. This is fixed pretty easily though, check the steam community for mods and console commands.			"

												One of the classic oldies.  Its more or less a modern “Dungeon Keeper” where you play a dastardly James Bond Villain.  Manage your evil plots, henchmen, minions, and your secret lair in your diabolical plot to rule the world.On a more serious note, this is one of the best games I have ever played.  In fact I still own my DVD version of this (got this to support and review) and for an old game it still manages to hold up to its contemporary peers.  Its retro style graphics and orchestral music fit perfectly in this 70's facsimile of Ian Fleming's spy masterpiece.  Also anyone that plays this long enough should look online for a surprisingly large number of mods that are available out there.  Many are dated but still work with some tweaking.10/10 would plot again.			"

												Evil Genius, ever watched a spy movie and rooted for the villain instead of the spy who completely ruins the hardwork, effort and toil the villain and his organisation has put themselves through to get in a postion to threaten the world? This game is the answer to that question. Filled to the brim with spy movie cliches and references, this game really does turn the whole genre upside-down.I could go on about how this game is worth your time but that would lead me to nearly spoiling the entire game to you. Basically if you like the premise of Dungeon Keeper (The GOOD Dungeon Keeper mind you), then you'll enjoy this game. Last point I want to make, the soundtrack is fiendishly good to listen to.			"

 All of my reviews are based around my personnal opinion, they're not swayed by a majority of people liking or disliking it.  Better than  Prison Architect  Worse than  Dungeon Keeper 2 [www.gog.com] NOTE: Steam for some reason, hasn't included my entire playtime. My actual playtime is roughly around 6-7 hours. NOTE: All of my reviews are laid out in a particular format that fits the game. TL:DR Evil Genius was a hard one to review, but alas, I've finally done it, and I can say that I'm quite impressed. I first played this a couple of years ago but didn't really like it back then. I thought, since its sitting in my library, I'll give it another go. It has turned out a lot better than I thought it would. You play as an evil mastermind, tasked at building your own base and gaining noteriety around the globe by completing devious missions. Basically being a James Bond villian. If base building is your thing then yes I would recommend this! About Evil Genius is a base building game, where you play as one of three different evil masterminds and attain noteriety across the globe by completing missions. If you've played games like Dungeon Keeper, this will be very familiar to you. You are first placed on an island, with a few tasks to complete. You are also given a huge mountain. This is where you build your base. You are given a selection of rooms to begin with plus gaining more the more tasks you complete. Pretty much simple right? Gameplay Obviously, for the kind of game it is, your camera is set from above so you can manage your base easily. The game isn't as simple as it seems. Plenty of things can happen at any given time such as blackouts, attacks, e.t.c. The game gives you tutorials on how to do things when they're needed so in some ways the game does hold your hand. As I mentioned before, there are three different leaders to choose from, all of which, are different in their own ways. But no matter which one, you always start on the same island. People who are familiar to these kind of games will find it easy. Newcomers won't find it hard to adapt. Design/Graphics Being a game from 2004, the graphics, of course, are a little bit outdated, but that didn't bother me at all, and it shouldn't bother you. Everything is clear to understand, and there're different graphics options to fit your PC, some of which might make the game look better for you anyway. As of the design, I can say that the island you start on is a bit plain in terms of detail, but that doesn't really matter since you're trying to build a base anyway. The rooms are interesting and can have added detail anyway. It's one of those games that doesn't try to be lazy when making it. UI [User Interface] Again, for people unfamiliar to these kind of games, they might struggle on where to find things. Like I said earlier, there are tutorials on how to do things, but not everything. Sometimes the game leaves you to try and find out where things are and what they do. At some points I did struggle on finding my way through things, but again, you adapt. In terms of settings though, I never had a problem, nor should other people. Pros - Interesting James Bond feel- Unique Idea- Plenty of entertainment- Sinister soundtrack :D- The game is quite humorous at times. Cons - Can be confusing at times- Sometimes left at points where you have no idea what to do Final Recommendation Evil Genius is one of those games that doesn't look amazing, but when actually played, suprises you. The idea of the game is what intruiged me the most. Playing as an evil mastermind that made you feel like a villain of James Bond is excellent in my opinion. Although sometimes confusing, Evil Genius makes up for it with It's excellent features and the enjoyment of annoying other countries. :D Worth buying if you like these kind of games, or want to get into them.Final Verdict - 8/10.

Bought it on Steam because I lent that CD to someone ages ago and forgot who that person was.Still holds up today! Building a well thought out base and devious system of tunnels and traps into your evil lair to thwart any agents of justice really doesn't get old.

												Absolutely brilliant base-building game (definitely one of the best i've played), but unfortunately, although a secondary gameplay element, your interactions with the world powers can become a tad tedious.  If you can get hold of a resolution booster (I use Racer_S's universal res changer) the art style keeps it looking great on modern systems. It's also well worth editing your population.ini file (look for a guide online) to increase the maximum amount of minions; 250 feels like a balanced amount.			"

												This is a fun dungeon simulator, if a tad dated in mechanics and playstyle. It's the same sort of game as Dungeon Keeper, where you play as the villain creating a base which will be raided, but in this circumstance you're a James Bond villain who needs to send your minions out to accomplish certain tasks while dealing with secret agents in a faux-60s style.It's a lot of fun, but the mechanics can occasionally get in the way of the good time. If you're looking for a sort of simulation/strategy itch to scratch and want something a little different, it's certainly worth a look.			"

And you can hire minions and henchmen to keep the world's various spies and agents away, as well as commit various tongue in cheek acts of evil.  It has a bit of an unfinished feel, but I can whole-heartedly recommend this game for all the hours of enjoyment it has given me.			"

												The best 10$ I will ever spend.  While the name ""Evil Genius"" may sound like you're preforming feats of evil...  (which, you are), that doesn't mean that's all it about.  Even the pope after a few hours of this game would find himself swearing profusely about Secret Agents that won't leave his island.  With commands, agent tags, and base building tricks that no one would figure out, the glossary is actually a necessary tool.So far, the only flaw I find with it is that the controls need to be rebound to be more intuitive.  If that's really the biggest flaw I find in this game after having owned a physical copy for years and years and years (passed onto me by my brother) and then repurchasing the game on Steam to be able to play again, you know it's gotta be worth it.  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, drinks, rock and roll and all the other things I will inevitably spend 10$ on can never give me as much pleasure as this game does.Stop reading.  Go buy it.NOW.			"

												It's a nice game. You play as one of three evil geniuses, each with thier own starting henchman and power. You build an evil lair, hire minions, train the minions, and send them out to do DASTARDLY DEEDS! It's a lot like dungeon keeper, actually.			"

												A whole lot of fun, unique take on the real time strategy genre, and riddled with references to various spy spoofs.I'd thoroughly recommend to anyone, its possible to finish the campaign in a few days if you play it seriously, but with side missions and base design, you could end up spending a lot longer.

												Evil Genius is what happens when you have Austin Powers and Dungeon Keeper make a baby. Traps, minions, henchment, and a secret island base are all meticulously run by your Evil Genius. You defend yourself against the ever increasing interest from world governments trying to shut you down to each region's top secret spy.But what good is a top secret spy if you just shoot him? No, there's protocol. You gloat, you find his weakness, you cheat, you scheme, you start the unneccesarily slow dipping mechanism.At it's core Evil Genius is Dungeon Keeper with a more simple RPG aspect and a wonderfully done 1970's coat of paint. You don't control minions directly, and instead give orders to build, buy, or work through various influences. While a little buggy, and sadly only supporting 4:3 resolutions, the game still does remarkably well if you're a fan of this type of gameplay.It's definately a rare (be it unpolished) gem that has sadly been ignored by a the general public.

												For those of you who enjoyed playing the sims by trapping your sim in a small room with no doors or windows or bathrooms or food and playing loud music so they couldn't sleep while watching them cry and wet themselves waiting for the grim reaper to appear... this game is a MUST HAVE AT ANY PRICEotherwise, this game is worth $5 max (strictly because of its age). add it to your wishlist and buy it when it goes on saleits gameplay, humor, sound effects, and idiosyncrasies are 1st rate. the game is not perfect, as there are some design flaws and other problems, but it is pure delight to design a base and torture the do - gooders by putting them in a cake mixer. the gameplay is like a really twisted version of the sims meets austin powers (with plenty of james bond mixed in) with mechanics that are surpisingly deep. there are many games i play play in order to finish so i can get the storyline endingthis game isn't one of them. i play this game for the pure joy of playing it, i dont really care about the storyline, it is just fun and satisfying to play this game making your plans and being succesful while seeing it through (note, i played this game long before i added it to my steam library, so i have many many more hours of gameplay then is reflected by my hours played. i bought this as i had a new computer and no idea how and where and when i got it the first time, so i bought it on steam so i would always have it)			"

			A World Domination Simulator for $10.00USD only! Evil Genius gives you the role of the successful bad guy (for once) who gets to run his own evil lair and choice of how to dominate the world.		

Evil Genius: “It’s good to be bad.” And it certainly is; Evil Genius gives you the player the ability to be, well, an evil genius, bent on world domination! Take control of your choice of three evil geniuses and run you’re evil underground lair complete with expendable minions, gloriously crazy henchmen, a storeroom full of gold and treasures from around the world and a path to world domination. A solid game in its own right, Evil Genius harkens to the likes of the beloved Dungeon Keeper games or more recent games like Impire or, War of the Overworld. You must protect your evil genius as you complete objectives and running an evil lair, ordering acts of infamy upon the unsuspecting world and taking steps to completely ruling the world. You take an isometric view of the game and task minions to build rooms inside of a mountain, the rooms all with different purposes to aid you in your goals. The game is simple to get the hang of with a very comprehensive tutorial and laid back pace, you won’t be stressing out over anything going on as you attempt to conquer the world. Some gameplay design choices are odd and prohibit some of the games systems (such as building traps) to be near useless or too costly to use over other strategies. The game is also victim to going on too long before starting to feel too repetitive and easy. The style of the game feels very much like a comic book, lots of colors and stylized characters and minions. Music and sound are both low-key, music during gameplay is on the same song and same loop, it won’t really grab your attention and is decent ambiance, and the sounds of the various rooms are also low key with little beeps and boops, you have to zoom in fairly close to actually hear them.  The music while sitting on the main menu screen is very jazzy and awesome and, can easily make you feel like you already own the world, they just don’t know it yet. Overall, Evil Genius is a solid strategy and base simulator, if you even are remotely interested or loved the aforementioned Dungeon Keeper games, I highly recommend dropping the $10.00 USD and buying it for yourself, I also see it go on sale only during the major Steam sales for less than a couple of cheeseburgers at McDonalds so if you’re money is tight wait to pick it up and be sure you do, otherwise you’ll be waiting a while before another sale. -Thumbs Up from RoyialVideo Reviews at: www.youtube.com/user/RoyialNetwork "

												A fun, funny, and challenging game with plenty of gameplay elements to keep you occupied Evil Genius is a unique simulator. Taking control of this genius and his minions is fun but challenging. Players must keep in mind that while they are trying to opperate their base, minions will do their own thing. Your sort of at the mercy of these guys in some cases. This is where you might find a little flaw in the game. Sometimes minions won't do things as fast as you want or react to an intruder unless you tag or notify them. I had a tourist end up in my freezer. This guy walked right past a hallway full of minions and ended up in the freezer. Not to mention as I was locking the tourist up, investigators came in and started taking pictures. So be prepared for incompetence from minions. However, it does add to the challenge so I wouldn't completely call this a problem.While I'm technically still new to this game, I will say this game keeps me well entertained. From building to managing my minions on the world map, there's so much to do. Placing traps is also quite fun. Just make sure you get traps placed at the main entrance early. This may save you from having idiots trapped in your freezer. Just don't go too willy nilly on things you may not need right away. I had to start over after I accidentally wasted money on stuff I didn't need at that moment. Also, pay VERY close attention to how you use and distribute your minions. This is a crucial resource for making your lair run as smooth as possible. Keep this in mind when senting minions out into the world to do your bidding.Overall, This game is simple and just challenging enough that you will not get bored with it.			"

												I originally purchased this game before it was available on Steam, and gladly bought it again to have in my library.I still visit this game now and then, and the highlight of this is trap creation. I have created some simple ones, as well as some very complex ones, and it's always a joy to see them work perfectly.The humor is pitch-black, but pulled off well. It has a 60's spy vibe, and does it very well. The stylized graphics contribute to its lasting impression, and to the atmosphere.There are some drawbacks, such as needing to move to another location and essentially start again, and some super agents cannot be defeated unless you are at the new location. There are a few other glitches and annoyances, but they did not mar the game for me at all. I thoroughly enjoy this game, and if you're a fan of dungeon building games, this might be for you.			"

												I have played this game for a decade, since I first bought it in 2004. It was a huge part of my childhood, and I owe THOUSANDS of awesome afternoons to this here video game.I recommend this game, don't expect a fast paced, action packed strategy. Expect humour, cleverness, and challenge.People expect everything to happen instantly with games nowadays. Little effort is put into building an empire, which is exactly what this game demands. You're building an evil lair! Of course you need to grow your minion numbers! You are the Evil Genius in this game, Evil Genius' don't go out into the field, shooting the bad guys. No, they stay on the island, instilling fear and killing minions. They oversee the creation of a base, and tell minions and henchmen where to go in the world and what missions to undertake, not how to do them. They expect results, and will kill any hapless minions who don't shape up.  This game  is fantastic, give it a little patience, and throw away any preconceptions. Because you're the Evil Genius, not God telling each person to do something. I recommend this game, don't expect a fast paced, action packed strategy. Expect humour, cleverness, and challenge.			"

												To say that this is like a slightly more in depth Dungeon Keeper with a Bond Villain-esque type setting would be a very lazy to describe this. But it would be true nonetheless. That's not a bad thing by the way. If you like that sort of thing then you'll probably get sucked into this as much as I did and  while I think I am now 'done' with it I did get plenty hours of fun.It's good. Not perfect. But good. The core of the game is base building and minion management and that all plays out in a similar manner to how you would expect if you've played a game like this before but where it differentiates itself a bit from the mechanics of Dungeon Keeper is that aswell as having enemies trying to break into your base and take you down you can also send out your minions into the world on missions and whatnot. Sending them on missions will earn you income, blueprints or new special henchmen and they kind of work like a modern Facebook game might in that you send people on a mission and then you just wait 5/10/15 minutes or whatever it takes untill it's done and you get a mission report. This aspect of the game can be a little annoying as time gating is rarely fun but there's always plenty of stuff to do around the base while these are happening, or you can always just make a sandwich or something. It's ok. And no microtransactions obviously. The ai of your minions can sometimes be a bit dodgy aswell, but the game's 12 years old at the time of this review and frankly the ai can be a little bit dodgy at times even in modern releases like Prison Architect for example. So again. Like before. It's good. Not perfect. But goodFans of this sort of game will more than likely have an enjoyable time for X amount of hours			"

												Ok, here's the deal. You're playing an Evil Mastermind who wants to take over the world: Maximillian. Unless you're mad, female or cannot live without Lord Kane. You have bought an uncharted island far from any countries and now you're going to take over the world. Interested?Thought so. The game starts out pretty bluntly with you, three minions and a henchman.  You get objectives that you need to complete in order to progress in the game. And the objectives kinda goes like this: Establish a base, Learn the Advanced Stuff, Prepare to take over the World and then you start building a doomsday device because... the most easy way to take over the world is to hold the world ransom apparently.To your help you've got up to 100 Minions and ultimately 7 Henchmen that will ensure your security and that your goals become finished.But of course the Forces of Justice would want to prevent you from this so they send you their ""top agents"" that got nothing else to do than to try and mess up your base. These forces are called    S.A.B.R.E: European Agency that also protects Australia, South Africa and India.    H.A.M.M.E.R: The Soviet Union. Protects Russia, Eastern Europe and Cuba.    A.N.V.I.L: Communist China, protects the Philippines    P.A.T.R.I.O.T: Americans, protects Japan too.    S.M.A.S.H: Middle Eastern Agency, protects North Africa, Middle Africa, South America and Antarctica.I know what you're thinking: ""What a bunch of cretins. How can they possibly stop my mastermind plans of taking over the world?"" I would answer that they can't unless they bring in their super agents. Super Agents are agents that have sworn to demolish your base, kill your minions and steal that urn that you think would go well into your inner sanctum. The one you will find most annoying are the A.N.V.I.L Employed Jet Chan and he is your average martial artist hero that would love to run into a base full of heavily armed, evil minions without anything else than his knowledge of martial arts to back him up. And this isn't as suicidal in practice as it might sound. Jet Chan is pretty skilled at killing your minions and will with ease kill your toughest henchmen and taunt them afterwards.But what is a henchman? He is a very loyal lackey that possess an extreme amount of endurance. So much so that he can only be killed by Super Agents. He does have three lives though so don't worry if he goes down once but if he goes down twice then you better load an earlier saved game. He is also very strong and can deal out loads of punishment. Some can deal more damage (Jubei, The Butcher), others have useful special abilities (Jubei, Lord Kane, The Matron) and others doesn't have so useful abilities and become useless tanks (like Moko, Eli Barracuda and Red Ivan).In this game though, you don't control your minions. Instead they wander around the base and take care of themselves by their own initiative. So why do you have to be there watching your minions all the time? Because they're insanely stupid. They never take initiative and kill intruders, they always let them slip through your doors and even if they started to fight these agents they never seem to be in shape for doing so since they're prone to exhausting themselves in other activities, like manning the control room. If it wasn't for your evil intellect the whole secret base would fall apart. You do control them indirectly though: You can tag anyone except yourself and your henchmen which you want dead, captured or just confused. Your minions will then when they're either confronted by a tagged character or hear about a tagged character in the base loudspeakers, will drop everything they're currently doing and go and carry out the evil deeds.So what do I think of the game? The feelings are a bit mixed. The game have several bugs which can be fixed by various members of the Evil Genius community. I have myself fixed a few in my bugfix file that you can find on the file page. The agent AI is quite poor since these guys likes to break into the base by force which alert you right away about their indiscretion. The gameplay tends to become pretty linear since it's often just the usual scenario of trying to man the control room and keeping the agents out of the base.  During the first part of the game it's pretty fun to try and take over the world but after a while when you get a more secure and impressive base you start to feel that the game starts to run itself. The agents kill themselves because of their stupidity, the minions go about their daily lives and you just sit in your chair and watch them wander around in your pretty base. You can try beefing up the game with more minions and funnier henchmen but that doesn't add variety to the game and variety is what the game so desperately needs.The game is a pretty fun game that I enjoyed playing and although it looked more promising in the initial demo than in the finished game it still offers a decent amount of entertainment value. And this is one of these games that almost anyone can pick up and play since the difficulty is generally quite low. So I recommend this game for any casual gamers out there that wants easier games to play and those of you who just are looking for a fun game. If you're a hardcore gamer you might wanna skip this in favour for some other game like Dawn of War.			"

												For a very narrow audience, but I got everything I could ever want out of it. Absolutely amazing, I could not believe how many things I could do to those pesky agents intruding my base. It was absolutely staggeringThe controls are terrible, but that's what the game is based on - you cannot control your minions. You have to create an infrastructure that will be able to defend itself, in the meantime executing your subordinates to kill time, whenever you aren't taunting prisoners of course. I don't think they should be as clunky as they are, but they'd get away with it in 2004.A must have for any aspiring evil geniuses out there.			"

												This is a yes, but not a strong yes. I'm playing on easy right now and getting my ♥♥♥ kicked because the game requires too much micromanagement. A simple pause button would do a world of good, and would make this worth buying when not on sale.Base building and resource management are the primary mechanics you use to lead your evil genius in taking over the world. The style of the game is its strongest feature; the music, art, and humor make it a joy to play, and really capture the tone of the spy thriller genre they're parodying. The UI could stand to be more detailed, although it'd likely make the game more difficult because there's hardly enough time to enter commands as is. The concept is fairly unique, and has honestly been most of why I keep coming back to this game. I do look forward to the sequel, and really hope they address the management issues.			"

Train minions, capture spies, steal the Eiffel Tower. Look for the community patch on the web, though: the game has some bugs that were never fixed.

You start with money and basic rooms to start your fledgling base, and will gradually gain access to more rooms and minions as you carry out missions.Pros -- The game is relatively easy to learn, with a quick tutorial to show you the basics, as well as a detailed glossary for every room and item.- The game is challenging enough to almost always keep you occurpied and thinking.- There is quite a bit of detail in the game, especially in minion animation and such.- Agent AI is acceptable, with them snooping around your entire base, unless you stop them with traps.- The game visual and audio assets are quite nice. The terrain is quite low-res and undetailed, but the models look colourful. Audio is also acceptable. Overall, aesthetically, pretty good for 2004.Cons - - The game is very slow, and requires you to play for hours if you want to complete it. This is nice for some people, but boring for others, and you can sometimes be waiting for minutes to get funds so you can build something. There is also no time speed setting.- Although the game has enough features to make it fun, I feel that there could be more. There are only two ways of making money - The world domination screen, where you send out minions to provinces and tell them to steal, and stealing from tourists (something I haven't been able to figure out yet).- Pathfinding for the minions is mediocre. You will often find groups of 3 or 4 just standing by a door for a few seconds before continuing on their way.- Revising your base design to fit new rooms closer ot the entrace, for example, can be difficult. For a new player, who doesn't know what rooms they will get later may fill up any space, then have to destroy rooms/make rooms smaller etc. The problem is that building/removing/destroying rooms and objects takes time, which can be detrimental if your base is crawling with enemy agents.Despite the cons, I still find this game enjoyable.

												You've probably wanted to be a Bond villain at some point in your life.  This game is pretty much your best shot at it.  It's a bit old, and lacks some features you'd expect to see in games nowadays, but it's a fun little resource management sort of thing, similar to stuff like Rollercoaster Tycoon in a way, or that dungeon thing game I've never played that everyone likes.  Make a lair, capture spies, maintain a facade of legitimacy for tourists, take over the world.  Or suck at it all like I do.			"

												In Evil Genius you play a criminal mastermind who has plotted to take over the world and has started by building a base on a secret island. You build the layout, decied where things go, who works where and who they work. Set up booby traps for pesky agents trying to get into the base, or have them out right killed by guards. Place henchmen in the right places to get money, blueprints, preform kidnappings and achive world domination. If I have your attention then good luck on world domination.~Skellington			"

												Didn't even realise this little gem was on steam!If you have never played Evil Genius it's simply one of the best games around and is rated as highly as every other ""must play"" classic like Theme Hospital, Roller Coaster Tycoon and The Sims. I've poured hours into this game and so happy to see it on steam as I lost my copy years ago, for £2.37 (hell even at full price of £6.99) it's a steal. You can spend hours building your perfect evil lair filled with traps to torment the goody two shoes, capture and torture them or stupify them to the point they don't even know their name anymore.You don't just deal with agents trying to sabotage your plans, tourists also flock to your island and will roam around enjoying the pleasent little island. Until either A) You build some hotels to keep the idiotic morons away from your base or B) They eventually wander into your web of death traps that surround your base.It's filled with moments of hilarity, panic and sheer amazment. Still waiting on an Evil Genius 2.DO NOT RATE THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE ONLY PLAYED THE GOD AWFUL FACEBOOK VERSION			"

												It's an all-round great base builder, if a little dated nowdays (it was made in 2004 after all). The shear joy of being that cheesy but funny James Bond villain is something you can't miss. The way you can make any room in any shape gives a lot of freedom to build and defend your base. The minion skill tree lets you prioritize what is important, technology, military or an even a blend of both.However there are flaws to the game. You can't build an infinitly sized base, or even build DOWN a floor. The base always stays on one level, and the mountain you use for a base can get really cramped. Also, the 'heat' system is hard to work. Any villainous act increases it, and as it increases, agents come to wipe you out. To lose heat you must not do any villianous acts for a long time. Bear in mind that to even get money, you have to steal it, so to lose heat, you must  Stop Earning Money.  It can get really annoying at times. But if you can get used to that, it is a really fun game, with a great concept and excellent execution. I just hope that sometime, Rebellion brings back Elixir Studios to continue work on a possible sequel to this great game.			"

												A fun basic romp that's part sim and part rts. It's a mish mash of different gameplay genres. It's a little bit dated, where graphics and performance are concerned, and once you get the hang of how to play the game, it seems like a fairly linear grindfest where to do X you need to do Y, with very little variation.0Also be warned that the main resource in this game is your time. You're always waiting on something or other, whether its for more minions to be trained up, stealing money to be completed, plotting to uncover new world objectives, or just waiting for pesky agents to leave you alone or give you room to do what you need to do. You're going to be clicking things for about 10 seconds and then waiting a few minutes for the payoff with nothing to do - thank god for steam overlay and the fact that it doesn't pause the game when you go into it.All and all though, it's not a bad little game. I've sunk about 80 hours into it. I'm not sure if I'm proud or ashamed of that fact.			"

IKR)-Checked the guides a few days later-Noticed Cheat guide-Started new game as Alexis-Cheated my way to the end of the conference-Got mission to get research machine and start a project-Couldn't start a project cause I used cheats to unlock everything-Spammed explosion cheat on Alexis-Killed Alexis-Started new game as maximillian only using money cheat10/10 would play/fail/cheat againThe Serious Part:Evil Genius is a management/plotting game with fighting, its a great game for, well, anyone who dosen't mind the comic violence.

												This game is a pretty solid buy when it's on sale, I would only recommend it on sale though because it's one of those games that everything that it does right seems to have another part of the game where it goes wrong.Pros:Great oldies action theme. The decore and technology all look like something from that era.Interesting progression system requiring you to complete acts of infamy.Easy to mod. Just unpack files and change values.Handful of unique henchman that you can directly control and have special abilities.A nice comedic take on some things. Interogations involves smashing their heads between symbols and spinning them in an office chair so it's not gruesome. Minions will stupidly work themselves into a coma, and if low enough on stats will even walk into your bases traps.You can kill your minions to motivate the rest of them. Pretty wicked.A good variety of rooms and limited space makes planning a good idea.Cons:Basically needs to be modded or it's painful to play on many levels.Only 3 evil geniuses, and the wiki says maximilians passive bonus to research was never even added.Bodies of agents you kill take forever to rot and drain your minions loyalty as they sit there, you can store them in the freezer to stop it but space is limited and they take twice as long to decay in there. Constant assualt from agents of justice constantly destroying your stuff, breaking your doors down, and robbing you. You end up having to kill them which leads right into the body bag issue and increases your head sending more agents.The biggest rip off ever, you make extra security doors, and put traps around your base and agents just climb up through the ♥♥♥♥ing floor. One of the agents in my game crawled up in an in-accessable area of the room because there were gold bars blocking the path so she'd just shoot at people walking buy.Money gain is a pain in the ♥♥♥ and painfully slow, you have to stick minions in the world map to steal funds but as they're there they get picked off by the local law enforcement and you only get the rewards for your efforts every 2 minutes or something like that.Basically the game has a great premise, I'd like to see it done with a bit more to it. I modded my game to make it more playable. Made money from world map collect every 20 seconds instead of 2 minutes (still takes quite a while since your agents will get wrecked by the local police). I made it so bodies increased loyalty instead of decreasing it so they actually seem like EVIL minions and not random people who took the first job they could get. I made the freezer increase decay rates so I wouldn't have mounds of bodies piling up.			"

												Evil Genius is a fun game where you are (literally) an evil genius, your overall goal is to conquer the world and have fun while your doing it.First off, there are no mods for this game. So if you run into any issues please consult the forums here on Steam or on the site called ""Evil Planet"" you'll get a ton of help if you run to any bugs, issues or have questions. Also there is a quicksave feature so i highly sugggest you quicksave often.Everything else is pretty self-explained. With that being said, one particular issue i have with the game is that there isn't any fast forward button when building or capturing, etc. (Yup that's right old school waiting in video games). Also for certain missions that require say ""two workers""go double or maybe one up when doing certain missions. I'm personally disappointed that the three evil geniuses that you can choose from don't have their own unique stats to make them different. I'm also disappointed you can't create your own personal evil genius (Sort of like what Tropico did). They have their own personal henchman each one having their own personal abilites which is pretty cool. Another issue i have is that there isn't enough space to build your evil lair. You'll have to reallly plan it out when building otherwise your going to run into issues. Other than that the game itself overall is pretty entertaining. You'll have a lot of fun with this game. Despite some setbacks that the developers could've considered and whatnot. If you love to world domination Evil super genius style. This game is for you.Link to Evil Planet Site:http://www.evilplanet.com/ "

HilariousA real oldie but goldie game. Graphics are ♥♥♥♥♥ no doubt about it and the actual gameplay is quite limited from todays viewpoint. But non the less the fun of the game is all about those jokes from 007 movies. Characters, base upgrades, music - there is a whole range of mockery and the game uses all of em.Beside that fun to play an evil genius trying to gain world domination. You start with some gold bars to build a secret base and hire sidekicks. You level your base, do research, train and upgrade your agents, kill and torture enemy spies, run an alibi casino. All in all good clean fun ;)  There might be no longterm motivation since its an old game but now and then being a villain is so much fun. Now and then other agents infiltrate your base and you have a few options to build traps and send your minions out to do the dirty work. Hilarious!			"

												I think the best way to describe the tone of this game is that at the end of the tutorial, your henchman kills the tutorial leader - that and the fact my villan of choice talks with the stereotypical camp German crime lord voice. This brilliant dark satire combined with a soundtrack that feels like one straight out of a 70's spy flick sets the game up nicely to be a hit. Then when the player is exposed to the simple to use, yet complex enough for good stratagy, gameplay mechanics it all comes together and produces a top quality game. One can tell it was produced in 2004, but this Steam version runs as smoothly as anything and lets face it, they don't make games like they used to! I'm sure the game gets better the further you progress - but I find myself constantly restarting and trying to set up the best lair from the get go... top quality stratagy managment here.8/10			"

												This game is what base building should be about - You are given some land, some servants, some cash, access to silk road to get your resources and an objective, which in this case is to dominate the wold.So you start out making your super secret base with a corridor and a hospital-room-esk accomidation for your minions. Then the fun starts, some overly nosey tourists decide to start snooping around super secret base with a camera, and best of all you get a choice what to do with them - kill them, interrogate/capture them or brainwash them.Eventually you run out of money and have to send your minions over to do some work in the various areas of the world, which is simplified down to a large chess board. Admittedly this could be a lot more interesting, but what could you expect for a game released in 2004 on a budget.On your road to domination, you need to ""convince"" some people to be on your side, this can be done by putting them into a industrial grade mixer, a oversized laser pointer or maybe even force them to watch and listen to wrecking ball for 10 hours in the multiple full immerison multimedia suites.And then you realise you're almost 24h in, and you're still too scared to do any missions to avoid increasing your heat.Overall 9/10 - would recommend for souly the menu music alone.

												Do you remember Dungeon Keeper? You know, before EA f#cking made a sh#tty phone version, KILLED IT FOR GOOD, AND THREW THE CORPSE INTO A MOTHERF#CKING GRINDER, TO THEN SERVE YOU IT'S ORGANS ON A PIZZA? Well, games like that still exist. And this one is a great example, mixing most of the good stuff from Dungeon Keeper to (I sh#t you not) the Austin Powers movies. Yeah... It sure as hell is a random f#cking mix. As usual, I will start with the stuff the game doesn't go right:First of all, the game only offers a story mode, with 3 humans to select for your main character. That's dissapointing, there's no Freeplay mode, there's no multiplayer, NOTHING. It also only has 2 islands, unlocking the second one midway the story. The lack of content is a real shame, as it could've help make this game stand out and live longer.The second thing are the bosses. Later on, completely hilariously broken characters with start invading your island. However, this offers a really harsh challenge: You need money to keep your base up, however getting money will get you negative attention. Getting negative attention will make more people go to your island. The more people blowing stuff and killing your minions, the more money you'll need to keep up with everything. Is a never-ending death cycle that will probably end once you're out of the game for good.The last thing I'll comment uppon is that the game hasn't aged well on performance. There's people who have issues setting the resolution to the game to a number that's actually good for them, and stuff like that.All of that being said, what's left is a really good strategy game, which also has quite the amounts of comedy.The biggest standout on this game has to be the designs, animations and graphics. THIS is a great example of cell shaded graphics well put to use. The animations for characters fit perfectly with the cartoony style and FOR F#CK SAKE, THIS GAME HAS THE BEST LOOKING MENUS I'VE SEEN. I'M NOT KIDDING.The music and voices are also quite good, fitting perfectly with your role of a generic overly evil dude who wants to screw over everyone ellse.The characters themselves are also quite entertaining, as you can unlock henchmen who are all parodies of a movie. Jules Winnfield from Pulp Fiction? You got it. A Russian Rambo/Arnold? You bet. There's even a ♥♥♥♥ing Ronin that reminds me of The Last Samurai, tons of stuff to choose. This hilarity also goes to the world map and events, were most stuff is just pure gold (until your troops are taken prisoners, that is).The game also lets you fill the base with deadly and stupid looking traps, and set them to trigger on different ways. The best part about it is watching some of your staff trigger them as well by accident because their intelligence dropped to low, although that might suck as you'll have to get new ones. You can also interrogate people in some hilarious ways, some even being parodies, like using a GIANT F#CKING LASER ON HIM LIKE IF HE WAS JAMES BOND.Do I recommend this game? If you enjoy strategy games AND like games such as Dungeon Keeper, then I seriously wonder why don't you have it already. It's a really good game, and fun to play. However if you're not a fan of base-managing games, then that might turn your boner off.TL:DR Edition: Dungeon Keeper mets any Humour-based movie that parodies James Bond and similar stuff. Fun game, although a bit challenging at times. Get it on sale if you like that sort of stuff, totally worth it.			"

												The game itself tries to re-created the feel of everyone's favorite base-builder classic Dungeon Keeper 2.  How close does it come?  Closer than anyone else, but not without a lot of new, and very avoidable flaws. Much like DK2 the game revolves around you digging out multiple specialty rooms in your Evil Lair (Control Room, Armory, Barracks, etc.) to acomplish various tasks, and to keep your minions healed, happy, and armed.  The forces of good will also come wandering in to your lair in an effort to sabatoge your operation and must be kept at bay, or dealt with. You also have the option of building traps and security devices to keep intruders occupied, or dead... You have the option to deal with the do-gooders in various ways. By default your minions completely ignore all enemies and neutral tourists unless they are directly atttacked. You must ""tag"" an intruder on your island with an action for your minions to take. These are either ""Kill"", ""Capture"", or ""Befuddle"".  Killing is the most straightforward way, but the downside is that a dead enemy leaves a corpse behind. If tourists or enemy agents see these your ""heat"" level increases for that particular faction. A higher ""heat"" level for a faction means that they will send stronger agents to your island and are much harder to deal with. To deal with the bodies you must build a freezer and storage racks to hide the bodies until they decay. You can kill anyone that looks at you funny, but you will run out of storage space quick. Another method to deal with them is to ""befuddle"" them. You have social minions like Valets and Spin Doctors who will attempt to confuse enemy agents and tourists. Once their Mind stat is reduced to zero the enemy will stand there in a daze and do nothing. Agents only have a fixed amount of time they spend investigating your island, so the more time they spend drooling on themselves the less time they have to throw monkey wrenches in your plans.  The third option is to ""capture"". Minions will attempt to knock the victim out and then drag them to a holding cell. From there you can either kill them, or interrogate them. Interrogation is only useful against skilled civilians so that you can train your minions for that profession, otherwise it is a complete waste of time.One thing that sets the game apart from the DK series is the use of the world map.  Not only must you build and maintain your evil lair, but you must send your minions out into the world to Steal, Plot, and cause Mayhem to further your evil goals. It is a very unique addition, but has numerous flaws that make it more of a pain than a pleasure.  The world map is split between 4 different alliances, each alliance having 4 separate territories. Each territory has an income and a security rating. The income number shows how much your minions can steal from that territory, and the security rating determines how much heat your illicit activities will generate. You won't know what these numbers are unless you have a specific number of Control Panels in your control room properly staffed.  You also have access to various evil missions to send your minions on. These include kidnapping specialists for interrogation, stealing valuble loot, and regular story advancement mission.  THE FLAWS___________________________The game, unfortunately has many, many flaws that should have never happened.  For starters the controls are terrible and very unintuitive. Almost everything is done by right-clicking. Left is generally only used for selecting your Avatar/Henchman and to drag out room building templates.  What game uses the left button only 10% of the time?   The World Map controls are just as terrible.  Scroll speed depends on how fast your PC is, so old PCs have a reasonable scroll speed, but on newer ones you will constantly overshoot the place you are trying to scroll to.  This is very irritating when you are frantically trying to tell your minions to go in to hiding so they aren't caught by the investigator agents who randomly deploy across the world and kill your minions.  Speaking of which, when those agents deploy you have NO WARNING! While you are desperately trying to fend off agents invading your lair, about 80% of the places you have minions deployed on the world map will suddenly have an investigating agent deployed there as well, and if you don't luck up and check the world map at the right time all of your minions will end up dead after about 10 seconds.  The World Map button will sometimes tell you have have minions being killed, but by the time it tells you it's way too late.  Keeping enemies from casually wandering in to your base and investigating your freezer full of corpses, blowing generators up, or stealing gold is unreasonably difficult. As I mentioned before minions completely ignore enemies unless manually told to do something about them. There is no ""default"" action you can set for enemies so you have to manually assign an action for EVERY enemy individually. Good luck with that level of micro-management when you have two separate screens to pay attention to, neither of which can be automated in any helpful way.  Traps and Security Cameras are supposed to help with this but both are complete wastes of money.  Traps can only be triggered by an enemy activating a pressure plate, tripwire, or motion detector. The problem is that these can NOT be placed on the actual trap, they must be placed next to it (or anywhere else, but that is even less useful). When placed next to the trap the enemy will, 90% of the time stop on top of the triggering device while the trap gos off harmlessly next to them. If it does manage to trap an enemy it has an equal or better chance of trapping your minions as well!  Security cameras are just pointless. They are supposed to alert you to intruders and then deploy minions to deal with them. The cameras only alert if an enemy has been ""tagged"" previously. Enemies that havent been tagged will be ignored. Even if an alert is sounded only minions within earshot of a loudspeaker will be deployed.  All of these things are complete wastes of valuble cash. Dealing with enemies is needlessly difficuly as well. Enemy Agents will always be armed and you have the option of arming your minions, but only if you have built the proper gun cabinets, and only if your base is on Yellow or Red alert.  The rest of the time they return the guns to the armory and if enemy soldiers start raiding they will gun your helpless minions down before you can issue the alert. This makes some sense for your regular minions, but why aren't your guards armed 24/7? Your only real defense is your Henchmen, the only guys that you can manually control besides your avatar.  They can easily deal with weaker agents on their own, but require backup if faced with numerous opponents. You start with one, but can recruit more later on. One word of advice, avoid the ones that use explosives, they will kill your own guys more often than your enemies. The best method of dealing with potential intruders seems to be using the ""befuddle"" option if you have a lot of social minions. Yes, it requires 1 minion to be occupied with each target, but it saves freezer space and doesn't raise your heat level. Hotels are a complete joke. They are super-expensive, require staffing, and produce no income. Better off stuffing their corpses in the freezer. BOTTOM LINE_______________________A worthy attempt to recreate the magic of Dungeon Keeper. Some horrid flaws keep it from being a true successor, but it is well worth your time and money if you loved DK2.			"

												Get this game. It's great fun once you get the hang of it.tl'dr: Don't recruit Red Ivan.""Even the penguins in alaska have a theory."" ""Penguins are in the south pole, Bill.""Pros:+ Interrogate people with michael jackson dance moves+ Learn how to dance in nightclubs as demonstrated via in-game interrogations+ Interrogate people by placing them in a giant mixing bowl+ Interrogate people by crushing them between bookcases+ Hilarious and brilliant trap (defence) system+ Every item in-game becomes explosive upon destruction+ Can create an enormous obstacle course whereas you capture somebody, release them from custody and watch them attempt to traverse every trap you place in their way in hopes of escaping, only to have them captured upon reaching the front door+ Locker room building simulator+ Play hide and seek with your newly obtained loot because the game places your new loot in random rooms for you to discover+ Build a casino and kill civillians mid-game. House always wins.+ Allow the most petty of investigators to trawl through every inch of your base and hypothetically get an autograph from your evil genius, then let him leave willingly because nobody will believe anything he says anyway+ Can replace all beds with gym sets to achieve the same effect on minions+ Minions can literally live off saladCons:- Can't re-steal loot which is stolen from you- Concept of minion loyalty is difficult to grasp and manage- No notification to tell you when your men reach their destination on the world domination map- Marking every enemy for death, capture or weakening gets a bit monotonous- tl'dr: Red ivan is a knob. Red Ivan (red russian henchman/bodyguard) is very generous with his grenades and RPGs. Often using them indoors, which ultimately leads to the death of a lot of men and the combustion of a lot of rooms.- Having several super agents attacking your base at the exact same time can be very difficult to manage- Minions fall for traps in populated areas more often than enemies willCheat codes (that come in handy)type in HUMANZEE (TASK COMPLETE will pop up to show its active)ctrl C = give money in 100k increments (trust me youll want it)ctrl S = cause an explosion (spam it when super agents arrive on your base)			"

												Is a good stradigy game, has some minor flaws, but does make up for it with its humor and paroding skills. I do enjoy the fact its a parody game of James bond, which just adds humor and entertainment in the mix. Truthfully the game isnt all that hard, and after a few play throughs, you kind of know all the things to do in it. But other then that its a great game, and anyone who hasn't tried it out should, i highly recommend it, it will give you at least a day to a week of entertainment, which is acceptable with the price of this game.

												Evil Genius on of the first games I actually enjoyed playing back in the days. Manage your evil lair, send out your minions to various missions, defend yourself against hordes of cannon fodder agents or special agents, hire high ranking criminals to be your right hand man, be evil and execute a rebellious minion or a captured agent to raise moral of the troops.Playing the role of a evil character is really refreshing planning how to build your hideout with all the rooms you need and might need to set your evil plans in motion. Rasing your infamy to lure more high ranking criminals to your side. Research technology, weapons, rooms and traps for your lair. In this game you can fullfill your evil mastermind needs to the fullest.This game has a great community and as far as I can tell, most players actually fell in love with it and cry out for a second game which we sadly might never see in this generation. If you liked the real Dungeon Keepers franchise (not the latest fake one) then you might actually like Evil Genius or Banished both are going a similiar direction.I'd really love to tell you all about the game but I am wonderfully lazy. So treat yourself to a wine well matured and acquire this game one way or another, who knows maybe a friend has a cd somewhere with extra stuff on it. Or wait for a sale, your choice.			"

												A very fun game. think Dungeon Keeper, but where you play a james bond'esque villain where you try to take over the world. You get henchmen to buld your base, guard it and even fool turists to try and keep your activities unknown.Sadly there are only 2 levels, but with all the reasearch and the length of time missions can take this is a game you can play for hours on end with the many different traps and science devices you can strap agents too, uncluding a laser like the classic bond film, Gold Finger. One hell of a buy if you ask me :)A suggestion when playing this game is to alter the files so you can get more minions as I find 100 is too few, especially when you run into secret agents who can end up killing over 50 henchmen before collapsing and you can't get rid of them until you learn their secret weakness on the second level.Also I believe the research file needs to be fixed. Research on google to find out the fix.I've heard that there is meant to be a sequal in the works, but it's on the back-burner at the moment and I hope it doesn't become like DK3 where it became a mobile game instead. This is a really fun game that you can get many hours out of and with a lot of dungeon keeper like humor.			"

												Nice to see here. I spenr about 3 dollars to get this on steam even though I still have the CD's for it. It's just much nicer to be able to have it ready on download then search the house for the 2 CD's as well as as have a permanent funtional verison of the game. It is almost entirely functional on windows 10. You need to download some files to get it to work in 1080 and sometimes it doesn't work with steams overlay thing but otherwise it runs as well as it did before.As mentioned, it is a game simliar to that Dungeon Keeper game where you don't have direct control over your minion except the 2 or 3 main minions that you can collect. It's pretty much all AI controlled with you giving orders that you hope will be followed. You need to create a base that is difficult for enemies to penetrate so they can't rob you or kill all your doods. I would have to say that at least the pathfinding is pretty superb but the AI itself is a bit furstrating sometimes. There are certian things I wish they could fix to make the process smoother.  Would be nice if the social minions didn't stop escorting confused enemies out of the base just to confuse another enemy. The minions should know right away when a bed is occupied instead of walking cirlces around the beds to find an unoccupied one. Minions should be able to take turns when grabbing guns. Stuff like that that could of made the game is bit smoother.Overall the game has hours of distraction to it. I already played over 10 hours on steam except the overlay wasn't working when I played it so it didn't show the time played.			"

												The best part about this game is that there is absolutely no shame in cheating. Remember San Andreas? Remember how the game was 100% more fun when you were spawning hyrdras and ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ up? This game is kind of like that. Playing without cheats is a good genuine challenge regardless but it's ok to do some good ol' guilt free money cheats because freedom to build the base of your dreams is half of the fun. (Actually it's probably 90% of the fun; the other 10% is making examples the minions that displease you by shooting them / stabbing them in the neck with a curvy dagger /  burning a hole in them with a cigarette).The art style is an overstylised...... early 80's?That reflects the whole OTT spy genre that was happening with James Bond and the whole USSR vs America with all of the inbetween cultural stereotypes thrown in like the ridiculously overdone accents for the respective world regions and a lot of the time this makes for some great satirical comedy.The one downside for me is that there are definitely a few things that can use rebalancing but luckily somewhere on the interwebs there's a unnofficial patch that fixes a wide variety of minute but overall rebalancing aspects. I've had some fairly rare texture glitches and sometimes the agent models turn into inpromptu contortionists acts but frankly it doesn't even seem that out of place in a game that's main artistic drive is to completely overstylise the era.9/10 "

This is a game I regularly come back for not just for the excellent gameplay, but the metagame lore is just as enchanting(Mixer, anybody?).Pros- Constructing a base in any way you're interested in (corporate facade, death trap, hotel facade)- Those visuals dude, iirc TF2 took some inspiration from this game's art style- Quirky humor, but unexpected tidbits of brilliance- Valet minions sleep during 1-on-1 training and I find that unreasonably hilariousCons- Quirky controls when demolishing or fixing rooms (plan ahead plan ahead plan ahead)- World map agents automatically unhide after a too short interval (can be fixed in configs)- World map isn't really all too exciting when you only get 100 minions maximum without changing configs (reducing base defenses/activity)- Only 100 minions maximum..... unless you edit it to like 500 like I did :p$10 for one of the most memorable games is a steal, if you find it on sale for less don't second guess yourself... pick it up!

												Nice to see here. I spenr about 3 dollars to get this on steam even though I still have the CD's for it. It's just much nicer to be able to have it ready on download then search the house for the 2 CD's as well as as have a permanent funtional verison of the game. It is almost entirely functional on windows 10. You need to download some files to get it to work in 1080 and sometimes it doesn't work with steams overlay thing but otherwise it runs as well as it did before.As mentioned, it is a game simliar to that Dungeon Keeper game where you don't have direct control over your minion except the 2 or 3 main minions that you can collect. It's pretty much all AI controlled with you giving orders that you hope will be followed. You need to create a base that is difficult for enemies to penetrate so they can't rob you or kill all your doods. I would have to say that at least the pathfinding is pretty superb but the AI itself is a bit furstrating sometimes. There are certian things I wish they could fix to make the process smoother.  Would be nice if the social minions didn't stop escorting confused enemies out of the base just to confuse another enemy. The minions should know right away when a bed is occupied instead of walking cirlces around the beds to find an unoccupied one. Minions should be able to take turns when grabbing guns. Stuff like that that could of made the game is bit smoother.Overall the game has hours of distraction to it. I already played over 10 hours on steam except the overlay wasn't working when I played it so it didn't show the time played.			"

												A quirky and clever look at how a Bond villain's normal day would probably look. Only much more interesting than it sounds. More a management sim than anything else, you have to construct and defend your headquarters while plotting the world's downfall. Fun and amusing, but let down by some rather serious bugs and questionable design in places. Don't be put off by that, but do find a list of the big glitches before starting.			"

												Very slow paced game. I don't normally mind a game being slow paced, but this is just painfully slow.  After almost 24 hours on easy, I still haven't gotten past the fourth objective, or at least I think it was the fourth one. After setting up your base and getting things running, slowly, you have to collect plans for a doomsday device, which I assume you will later build. There are three of these devices, each one has three parts that you have to collect, so nine total. I can only find six, two of each. The objective says that you can find them on the world map through missions, which is how I got these six, by doing research on the map, which I have done on every place on the map and haven't found anything, or from Agents coming to your base. I have captured several Agents and Super Agents and tortured them several times, never find anything. I have no clue how you are supposed to get any of the remaining three doomsday plans, and there are no hints other than what is in the objective of ""from the map missions, map research, from Agents.""Another problem is that you constantly have enemy forces coming to your base and sabataging/ destroying everything they see. Even some of your own henchmen will do massive damage to your base when fighting the enemy. Trying to repair all of the damage and then build new things takes way too long and is very boring, preventing you from doing much of anything else.The only way to make money is to steal from countries on the world map, where your units are constantly being killed off and you then have to wait for more units to train. Something that really irritated me is that you can build a hotel and casino as a cover operation, which is expensive to get started, but you do not make any money from that. Those buildings are strictly to keep tourists out of your evil lair.I think 20 hours is more than enough to say I gave the game a try. It is almost fun, but they really did a terrible job on it.***Update***I put a few more hours into the game. The final 3 plans for the doomsday device were on random enemies, but none of the ones that were marked as ""Agents"" or ""Super Agents."" There is no identifying mark on the enemies that have the plans, you have to click on every single one to see if they are holding it, then kill them.So! plans gathered, 2 million dollars saved up as part of a mission objective, now to move to a bigger island. Yay! Except...When leaving your first island you must give the order for your minions to evacuate the island, with a warning that they will grab ""as much as they can"" (which apparently means ""only artifacts""), and that once your Evil Genius arrives at one of the 2 ports anyone and anything left behind is lost. Naturally it sounds like your Evil Genius should wait in the base until everything is cleared out, so that's what I did. Bad choice.As soon as you sound the alarm 2 things happen: 1) your minions grab any artifacts that they can and move to one of 2 ports, and this cannot be stopped, altered, or overriden in any way.2) Enemyy forces swarm your base and begin killing your now defenseless minions, who will not fight back and cannot be ordered to do anything other than head straight into enemy fire on their way to the ports. Fun fact: there are 3 branches of training for your minions, with 3 levels of training. New minions can only be trained by other minions of a higher level in that branch. So if the enemy kills all of your high ranking military units, for example, then you cannot train any more of them on the next island until you go back through the tedious process of capturing more of that unit on the world map to learn their secrets.Following the warning not to send your Evil Genius to the port until the base was empty means that your Evil Genius is now completely defenseless and must hide from and evade the enemy swarm that now has free run of your base. This results in yet another long and tedius process.Now, provided that you made it you your new base alive, you may think you get to have fun and can avoid any logistical problems you had with your first base. No. Imagine a big triangle on this big new base of yours, each of the 3 points representing the 2 ports that your workers must go to to buy construction supplies, and the 3rd point being your treasury, where your workers must go to first to get the money to go to the port to buy the supplies. These 3 locations are as far from eachother as possible, resulting in a lot of unnessecary travel time to build anything. Also, you have no control over which port your workers go to, so when I built the entrance to my new base near the airport, my minions chose to travel to the seaport for supplies. It literally took over 5 minutes just to build the door to my base.Another ""fun"" thing here is that all of those valuable artifacts that you collected and transported from your first base are now sitting around outside, ready to be stolen by enemies, and there is nothing you can do to stop them because almost all of your minions were killed when trying to leave the first island.Long story short, it took over 2 hours to get my new base running, by which time several artifacts had been stolen and the last of my skilled mininos had been killed. I was out of money (apparently the 2 million was not enough, and I hadn't even built a lavish base, just the basics), and enemy units were all over the island because it took 2 hours to build. Essentially you are worse off than when you started the first island because back then the enemies were not coming after you as hard as they are now.Again, terrible game, do not buy it even if it is 90% off. Don't even waste your time if it is free.			"

												A great strategy game for people who played Dungeon Keeper or have ""Dungeons"". You construct a secret lair and organize crimes across the globe (although you dont get to see them actually carried out). For those who are familiar with ""Mastermind: World Conqueror"", a flash game on Newgrounds and across the internet, this is it's big brother (another sad point you dont get to pick new hideouts but live with what you get) based off the 60s-70s spy flicks.

												The premise is good. Be an evil genius, send your minions out to do evil stuff. The problem I had with this game is that the explaination of how the mechanics work are not very good. The in game tutorial does an ok job of explaining the base mechanics, but the system itself doesn't tell you things that are essential to succeed at the game. Like if you don't finish x mission your base will be bombarded by a steady supply of soldiers until you complete it. Even a subtle hint of maybe you should focus on your mission rather than focus on defending your base, because the attack isn't going to stop.			"

												NOTE: So when I posted this review it says I have 6 hours. THAT is a lie. When I first purchased this game, I played it for 4-5 hours until moving on to something else addicting. When I came back to this, it said I had 1 ♥♥♥♥ING MINUTE. I knew for a fact that that was a lie, but maybe I was playing offline or something. Ok, now to the real review...REAL REVIEW:ME: Evil Genuis! The critically aclaimed game by everyone ever!MINION: Sir, no big companies have critically aclaimed this game at all so that is a-ME: GAURDS! KILL THIS TRAITOR!!!REAL REAL REVIEW:Ok, this is the real review this time. So, Evil Genuis, a game alot like Mastermind exceot the fact that it cost money and has alot more features and not to mention alot of more time that you will most likely be depositing into this masterpeice.Have you ever wanted to destroy the world? No? How about take over it? No? How about torture the people that inhabitate it because you can? NO?! ♥♥♥♥ it then, just become a god damn useless island where tourist come to see the sites. You can do all those things and more in this base building, strategy, world domination/tourist island/ torture island/ world destroyer simulator. The main goal that your supposed to fallow is to conqure the world in various ways. It can be very, VERY difficult to start out but you will surely handle the ropes right eventually. One thing to keep in mind while playing this, NEVER be too ambitious when it comes to building your base. I started out my first time by trying to completely fill up the mountain with as many rooms as possible, at first I ran super low on money and it ended up taking me 2 hours to get it a quarter way done, then secondly I had to take almost all of it down because I had unlocked other rooms I needed in the mountain. Oh yeah, forgot to mention that you build your base in a mountain. You can also build tiny houses outside of the mountain to build bases in, but be careful since tourist or spies can get easy access to them and report them to the country they came from. Ofcourse you could always just capture them before they leave and torture them  if you wish. Also, waiting is a huge factor in this game, but you can shorten the wait time by spending gold (which is in game money) to shorten it. Before you say anything about pay to win, keep in mind that this game is 1: not F2P and 2: has no micro transactions. If the government is becoming to hard to handle, or if you just wanna see something funny happen, set up traps in your base so the government forces will run into them when infaltrating your base. There's alot of stuff to do in this game that I haven't mentioned and all this talk about the game make me want to go back to playing again, so i'm off to take over the world!TL;DR?10/10, the best game I have EVER played. But I have a weird taste for games so you may or may not enjoy the game. Also, waiting is a huge factor if you wish to not spend much money (in game money ofcourse).			"

												I'm starting this review not knowing whether at the end I'll give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down - which pretty much tells you my thoughts.    Evil Genius is a 1960s style James Bond/ Man from Uncle/ Our Man Flint  version of the Bullfrog Dungeon Keeper games.    The game is split between a base mode where all of the animated action takes place and a world map where you carry out missions that are solely a matter of numbers - you commit the designated number of agents of various types to a mission and watch their figures fall by attrition until they either succeed in the mission or fail.    As all the action takes place on YOUR ISLAND and in YOUR BASE any bad failures mean large amounts of damage to your base and a long grind to rebuild.  That's a problem I'd echo from some of the other negative reviews.  Money is gained by allocating agents to steal on the map level.  Practically it meets clicking to add agents to a country to get money, and then clicking and moving them to a new country before enemy agents start turning up and killing them.  Agents regenerate only at one a minute unless you pay cash to regenerate faster which costs you cash obviously.  The basic mechanics are a bit of a grind.    There's also the problem that the game seems to be played on two very long levels.  So my entire game time has been on a single level.  There's no way to change base design part way through (although you can destroy individual rooms and replace them with a different room in the same size).  You can't cancel purchases.      Research isn't entirely intuitive.  I discovered after a long time you had to select both an item to research AND a piece of equipment for anything to happen.  Also hotels (used to distract tourists) didn't work for me.  The hotel wings never attached to the core so they were virtually useless.    You'll soon learn the value of your valets who do a prime job of distracting enemy agents.  Keep most of the incriminating stuff some way inside your base and even agents that get inside your base can be gently persuaded to leave (instead of killing them or capturing and torturing them) before discovering anything truly incriminating.    There's bizarre irritants too.  I did a mission wherein I stole a cloning machine all for it never to be assembled in my base for me to use.    Some of the game doesn't really hang together that well.  For example other than gaining new skills from specified targets capturing and interrogating (i.e. torturing to death) prisoners never seems to do much.   The main problem is the lack of variation in the game.  You stay on the same screens, you can see everything, enemy always enter by the same door (or doors if you add another entrance), you can't easily identify enemy (it flashes up but not easily).  There's not enough change, not enough development, and not enough fun things to do to make a really good game.    This is a great idea let down by some poor execution.  At the full price of £6.99 I wouldn't touch it but for anyone nostalgically missing Bullfrog's Theme Hospital and Dungeon Keeper games at 50% off and higher in the sale it will provide you with a few hours of fun.  Until you realise the next few hours will be exactly like the first few hours.S.x.			"

												This isn’t mastermind world conquer 2. this game is infuriating on so many levels. First you have to tell your minions to kill all the idiots that come are in your base. If you miss one they can cause all sorts of havoc. This is THE WORST game mechanic of all time. It doesn’t sound so bad at first but wait until one saboteur sneaks past you while you aren’t paying attention for a second and blows up your entire power grid you will be screaming at your computer “just kill them! You can tell by looking at them they aren’t one of you” if you place something incorrectly and make it so an area is inaccessible agents will tunnel into your base. (tutorial is too stupid to tell you that btw) and if it’s a generator which is blocking a single empty meter from being accessed then have fun watching saboteurs ♥♥♥♥ on the ashes of your base. also if the agents CAN tunnel into the base why don’t they do that all the time? Because screw logic.Oh and the tourists THE TOURISTS even the game points out how stupid it is that they even exist and you’re forced to spend a ton of money on a hotel for them! The worst bit? I kill every one of them and they keep coming! This is a island with a evil criminal mastermind who kills all intruders and you want to vacation there despite the fact that almost every other idiot who wanted to vacation there is dangling by their feet in his freezer? The  concept is great but almost everything else is ♥♥♥♥. "

												This game could have been very, very good. It has a very unique, well-presented concept : you get to play as a James Bond villain, complete with the stupid minions, eight-feet tall bodyguards and shark-filled traps. The art and concept teams did a great job, creating very interesting characters and buildings that makes you want to unlock everything and to find out what the game has to offer.The one problem this game has is its pace, and it's, sadly, a crippling issue. No matter how well optimized your base is, you will spend most of the game waiting endlessly for minions to be recruited, trained and outfitted so you can attempt missions. Those ""missions"" only require you to have the right number of henchmen, to click on a button and to wait (and hope) until the mission succeeds or fails. That's it. You don't get to do anything else, you don't get to command your soldiers as they attempt to steal a german satellite or whatever you sent them out to do. Clicking ""Start mission"" and waiting. That's all there is to this game besides base building and it's a little underwhelming. Then again, it would all work perfectly if you did not have to wait for dozens of minutes for your henchmen to be recruited and trained for missions. The worst part is that you always have to choose between waiting less or playing efficiently : recruiting minions faster costs money, so if you want to use your money carefully (and you will), you need to wait even longer. Same goes for your missions : you need to send henchmen away from your base so they can steal money... which makes your missions' progress even slower, because the henchmen you're using to steal money can't go on missions. There is no way to increase the game's speed either. It's like the developers really wanted the player to choose between waiting for long, unproductive minutes or to use his hard-earned funds to actually keep playing the game. It's not rewarding at all and makes the whole game feel like a grind.I have played about twenty hours because every once in a while, I tried giving the game another chance, reinstalled it and started another playthrough, only to get tired of it at the same point, after five or six hours, every time. It's just so terribly slow, so full of waiting and almost devoid of actual gameplay besides the base building that is also very, very slow once you spent your initial funds (because earning money in this game is also very slow and difficult). To me, Evil Genius will always be the game that could have been, and that never will be.			"

												You know, I really really wanted to like this game. I'm a huge fan of dungeon keeper, dwarf fortress, etc etc etc. I've heard nothing but good things about it.But after spending over 4 hours trying to finish the first map on the campaign, all I can say is that this game is atrocious. The pacing is absolutely terrible.Example: $100 per minion per minute basically means getting the funds so you can build a hallway takes roughly 10 minutes.The bugs are game stopping. For instance: Don't try to build a hotel too close to a depot. Your minions will never finish it, and it'll suck up all your money. And you can't cancel the construction.Your minions have self-defeating AI.For instance: I assigned my new valet minion to the training room, but he had low smarts from accidentally triggering a trap on the way over. Now, because the training room saps smarts (wtf?), he is stuck in an eternal loop there, and I can't train his replacement. Had to kidnap a whole new maid.The 'world domination screen' is frustrating.For instance: There's no timer or progress bar on how long it'll take for your minions to get shuffled around. ""Not a big deal, I don't mind checking on it randomly. Can't wait to commit this act of infamy once all my guys are together!""<10 minutes of dealing with panicked tourists later>""Hmm, I wonder if those minions showed up yet --:<Minions there are already dead, because an agent already showed up & killed them without ever notifying you.>Even after exploiting the neutered enemy-heat of the first level of the campaign to build up all the money I'd ever need, I still struggled to get things done. I repeat -- money wasn't even an issue. I built up my base as best as I could without having everything unlocked, and amassed a small army of over 70 henchmen. Hours and hours later, I had still only commited a handful of acts of infamy due to all the subtle ""features formerly known as bugs"".			"

												Evil Genius is set in the cold-war era of 1960s superspies much like the NOLF games but, on this occasion, the player is on the side of evil megalomania rather than sexy crime fighter. The game involves building an impenetrable base on a secret island within which henchmen are trained, spies are tortured and doomsday devices are researched and developed. It is very much a Dungeon Keeper game in the NOLF world, but has the disadvantage of being overly-ambitious (much like the evil overlord you control). It can be very difficult to work out exactly what's going on, or how to defend your base, or where to deploy the wonderful new laser your scientists have researched... even with the glossary, tutorial, movies and online help! It looks like it could be an amazing game to get into, but I just found it too frustrating - I soon found myself struggling to make ends meet since I was constantly low on cash, and the only way to get cash was to risk my minions by sending them out into the big wide world, at which point the forces of good started killing them off... and I found myself low on cash and low on minions, and now the forces of good were sending squads of soldiers to blow up my base (in response to my minions' brief activity out in the big wide world) and I didn't have anyone left to defend it!It is beautifully presented and I would like to recommend it based on that and its promise, but it unfortunately failed to live up to my high expectations!

												I bought this on sale and I am glad I did not pay full price. It is very buggy and crashes frequently. The gameplay is simple and can get very repetitive however it does have the secret of ""just one more quest"" value to keep you going. The base requires constant supervision if you want to maintain you supply of minions and henchmen.The humour is weak, mostly dad jokes or plays on every old Bond film you have ever seen.The difficulty level spikes considerately when your  notoriety level increases making the game a grind of creating minions, protecting them and then losing them on a mission. Wash and repeat. Also frustratingly, the AI control of the minions is as dumb as mud. They constantly wander into your own traps and blindly run off on low priority tasks even after using your overlord to set a high priority on an urgent task.All in all I don't think this is a game to appeal to many but  I will complete it for my own satisfaction.Additional: I managed to complete the game after a few restarts despite the bugs. It has no replay value.In response to the comments about running an old game on a new PC I am runnning it on a PC I bought in 2006 and in Windows 7			"

												I can't tell if this is the best bad game i've ever played, or the worst good game i've ever played.Evil Genius is one of a kind. You play as the typical James Bond villain, with 8 feet minions fighting for you as you forfill your dreams of world conquest. This concept could of worked, very well. But Evil Genius completely crushed this golden oppurtunity with terrible AI, and tedious grinding.One of the HUGEST problems with Evil Genius is the way your ""Minions"" work. In a game like this, you're supposed to feel like a badass, as you epicly fight through enemy soldiers with your loyal army of minions. But in Evil Genius, you don't feel like a badass, you feel like a victim. As soldiers wave through corpses of your minions while your remaining soldiers constantly desert you every 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes.The only way to keep up your minions ""loyalty"" is by interrogating enemy investigators/soldiers you captured. Which is extremely hard to do depending on the way you play. Minions drain on loyalty completely every 3 minutes, and depending on your heat trespassers barely ever show up.While their not busy constantly deserting, their busy going insane, getting stuck in a corner on a big piece of nothing as they suck up minion space.So then your last saving grace is a henchman, which you only get about 3 of in the time you play.Evil genius can be fun in the first couple hours, but it gets REALLY frustrating, REALLY fast.

Shouldn't have. Execution matters as much as concept does. It has the latter, but not the former.			"

But the slow advancement in new things to use, and clunky way to make things work the fun is stripped away faster then it takes to get things to work the way you want. After a couple of hours it gets even worse trying to do away missions and the micromanagement on the home and away front contestig for your attention.			"

 Originally posted on January 18, 2011 I really want to like Evil Genius. The Bond-villain style of the game is really fun and funny, and the idea of building your island lair up from scratch has some real appeal to it. But in the end this game simply is far too shallow and repetitive to be enjoyable in the long term.The art design is charming, and so are the animations and sounds, but the meat and potatoes of the gameplay simply loses its appeal far too quickly.The base building mechanics are solid and the traps are fun to build and use, but there is no differentiation between islands, and you are often restricted in the size of base you can build. Research can grant you more expensive but more space efficient versions of existing technology, but deleting old building plans within the confines of limited space and starting over is a real pain.The minion AI is atrocious, which I suppose is intentional, but it is also lazy developing. Your minions will constantly die in your own traps, and minions make no distinction between themselves as far as their role goes. Your ever so valuable third tier minions are just as likely to stumble into the gas pit attempting to kill an intruder in hand to hand combat and die as a plain worker is. I don't even want to start talking about how repetitive the evil missions are.These are just a sampling of the problems with the game. Overall, I would say it is a fun little game that is not worth more than a couple dollars.			"

												Very cool ""evil bunker"" concept, and I'd love to see a sequel. However, the original here has some nasty bugs, worst being that I got stuck on the first island with NO ability to progress forward. After sinking lots of time into a devilish base, I didn't have the patience to start over from scratch. That's a dealbreaker. Also the interface is kinda weird and substandard, the world map minigame is simplistic and trite (IIRC), and the superheroes who invade can be too frequent and incredibly irritating.If there's a community mod out there to fix the bugs and annoyances, then by all means give this unique game a shot. But Evil Genius as it comes? Skip.			"

												I don't know about the content of the game and won't rate it. Probably fun.I just started the game up, realized it had no suitable 16:9 resolution, accidentally (out of stupidity) selected an unsuitable resolution that didn't get reverted to the former resolution after a couple of seconds like it is modern programming standard, managed to quit the game, realized that my TV screen had activated overscan, fixed that, decided to give the game a second try, started it up, had a blank again due to faulty resolution, couldn't quit it or alt-tab, however, and had to reboot.I could probably find the config file and change res manually or just reacquire files. But I don't want to.It's a bit shallow for me to judge a game by its technical side after 5 minutes of dabbling with it, I'm aware, and it's 10 years old by now, so I'd cut it some slack, but that's just not how I like my games. Jagged Alliance 2 works better.TL;DR: • No FullHD. Sloppy programming.			"

												Evil genius is a great game that I’ve sunk 60 hours into thus far. You get to build your evil lair into a couple of different islands and steal technology, cash, and treasure from the world powers, all the while defending against attacks by soldiers and secret agents. The flexibility in base layout is a great part of the game, as the way you set yourself up really affects the gameplay. You have to keep your many henchmen functional by providing healthcare, sleeping quarters, entertainment, and such. Of course, if one of them displeases you, execute him. You also need to remember to build your power generators, your gold storage room, your control room, your evil inner sanctum, a prison/armory, a research laboratory, and more. Of course, there are problems. For whatever reason, steam doesn’t update the game all the way, so you need to find the official patch somewhere. You’ll also want to download the unofficial patch, and the “Bonus CD” content that steam didn’t include.			"

You start off small time and slowly work your way to the top to RULE THE WORLD!(insert M. Bison from Street fighter movie saying ""OF COURSE!"")

												I bought this the day it came out.  From an actual store, at full price -- I was that excited about it.You know Theme Hospital or ...well any of the Theme or Tycoon or similar games where you build a park/zoo/airport/factory/prison or whatever?  Take that, add a huge helping of James Bond (and any movie from that whole spy era) spoof, a lot of humor and plenty of developer love.You are building an underground evil lair, and you gotta make sure your minions have facilities to work, relax, train, rest, and research.  Of course you also need jails and interrogation machines for when you capture spies, and an elaborate trap system so agents and civilians don't get in, and don't forget room for a doomsday weapon.There are a few frustrating times when unfortunate timing results in the minion that was bringing an important item back from the helipad gets attacked by Jet Chan (lol!), and then others run to get the item to be slaughtered one by one.  But most of the time it is so awesome.			"

												This game mixes base building perfectly with solid retrospective humour. Those of you familiar with old James Bond movies, with feel right at home with this games comedic foundations. The game will have you developing traps that open the floor to a deadly pit of saws one minute and then have you interrogating a prisioner with Micheal Jackson choreography the next. The game oozes with charm. Not only that, but the game offers a solid strategic challenge as well. You will find yourself having to keep track of both your base activies and your world domition tactics on the world map (Think total war, but with everything happening at once). This sense of micro-management will never leave you bored, or unatentive. The game always presents a obstacle for you to overcome, rather that be enemy agents trying to inflitrate your base, a power failure leaving your base vunerable or trying to keep pesky tourists from wondering into your evil lair the game consistently presents you with challenges, some difficult some not, and never at any point leaves you with nothing to do. Overall, this game is ranked in my Steam favourites. The game is genuinly funny and light hearted. It presents challenge with its gameplay, has a addictive formula to boot and is a hit for those who are fans of games like Dungeon(s) Keeper, Tropico and the like.			"

												Ever wanted to play a Jame bond baddie? Sure you have. This game lets you do that. The game plays alot like dungeon keep, but instead of demons and devils its well An Evil Genius and his Minions of evil. You start off small time and slowly work your way to the top to RULE THE WORLD!(insert M. Bison from Street fighter movie saying ""OF COURSE!"") As you play the unlock new minion types, more rooms, even a hotel and casino for your island, The game is overall very fun but does take time to get going, there are few bugs, but they can be avoided if you are careful.

												I bought this the day it came out.  From an actual store, at full price -- I was that excited about it.You know Theme Hospital or ...well any of the Theme or Tycoon or similar games where you build a park/zoo/airport/factory/prison or whatever?  Take that, add a huge helping of James Bond (and any movie from that whole spy era) spoof, a lot of humor and plenty of developer love.You are building an underground evil lair, and you gotta make sure your minions have facilities to work, relax, train, rest, and research.  Of course you also need jails and interrogation machines for when you capture spies, and an elaborate trap system so agents and civilians don't get in, and don't forget room for a doomsday weapon.There are a few frustrating times when unfortunate timing results in the minion that was bringing an important item back from the helipad gets attacked by Jet Chan (lol!), and then others run to get the item to be slaughtered one by one.  But most of the time it is so awesome.			"

												Word of advice: Yes, you'll need strategic and 'Dungeon Master-like' base building thinking... but above all you need PATIENCE and a lot of it. You'll wait to recruit and train minions to lose most of them on a mission (successful or not) or at the hand of enemy govt agents. So you'll have to recruit and train new minions, etc... So, a big part of this game is about waiting...That said, the building of your base, if done correctly, with the help of well trained and equiped minions and devious traps will keep civilians and enemy agents mostly away from the heart of your operations and is quite satisfactory...Building your 'Empire', via stolen money/loot gathering, scientific research, intelligence gathering, 'interrogation' of enemies, civilians or your own minions (for fun or keeping them in line), getting better and more powerful minions, getting more notoriety (giving access to better equipments), etc... is also well done.A good game to play the bad side of a James Bond's movie...

I think part of what got me here was the combination of style and the basic premise: manage an evil corporation and become your own Dr. No, outsmarting would-be spies with a your choice of henchmen and lethal traps. Unfortunately the game is too hard for it's own good, and for all the wrong reasons. I'm not sure if you have to be an evil genius, but you've got to be some kind of genius to beat this game.  "

												Evil Genius is a game that really seems to polarize people. Personally, I love it.Evil Genius is an evil lair simulator, with emphasis on planning the base. The retro-styled, goofy supervillain theme to the game reminds me of Austin Powers (which I like). You have to build your base so that your minions (which you cannot control) can work efficiently, but that also keeps out the forces of justice. Most of the minions work independently, and you must ""idiot-proof"" your base for the simple-minded AI. Sounds like a bad thing, but I enjoyed the design challenge. You also have to send out minions to steal money, which is also mostly non-interactive.My main complaint is that this game can be very slow, as you wait to earn cash. Expect to put the game on cruise control for long periods of time. I also recommend modding the game to increase the max minion capacity.I would gladly recommend this at $10. Warning: your milage may vary.			"

												It is a sad world we live in where the options to play the evil genius are few and far inbetween. For creating the opportunity to hone my criminal mastermind management skills, this simulation earns my recommendation. However, it's gameplay loop quickly becomes short and repetitive. I correctly purchased on sale, and gave it no quarter beyond my boredom.			"

												It gets pretty hard.  Some d-bag super agent will show up and destroy your whole base if you're not careful.  Community guides are pretty helpful in defeating super agents, as they all have some weird contrived secret weakness.Buy on sale.  Also, use ""evil"" traps to make money, rather than gaining heat from stealing.			"

												Evil Genius is a base building game in a similar vein to Dugeon Keeper. You manage your minions to try to thwart the forces of justice and take over the world. Gameplay wise, The game is a strategy game. You need to make decisions on what to build in your island base, where to build it, and what to do with minions planted in the outside world. The best thing about this game is the sense of humor. All of the game feels in part like a James Bond parody. The pause menu has sychronized dancers and what sound like an orchestral piece not too disimilar from a James Bond intro. Another hilarious piece is that minions interrogating various forces of justice may perform dance moves from Michael Jackson's ""Smooth Criminal."" The game, though, does have some glitches, such as loot disappearing upon a specific event, and freezing during a specific animation if the autosave occurs. However, despite these flaws, the game is a blast to play. Overall Score- 8.5/10			"

												Do you want to be an evil genius? Do you want to execute minions just to ensure others stay loyal to you? Do you want to torture an unwelcome agent with a huge mixer? If yes then you should buy this game! On a more serious note this game is a 10/10 for me and I would recommend that you get it! (for £6.99 it is a steal!)			"

												This game is great fun! I would highly reccomend this game as it is also one of my favourite games of all time. As well as radio broadcasts (containing stereotypical characters from the respective country) being played after you commit many crimes, would say this game has a lot of replay value and it's so cheap!

												If you've ever wanted to be a bond villain, this game is for you. If you enjoy games with a sense of humor, this game is for you. My only complaint is that I've never been able to win without cheating, and the hotels and casinos do not seem to really help all that much.			"

												It's like Dungeon Master, James Bond (villain) style. There's nothing more satisfying than stealing the worlds treasures and putting them on display in your base to boost your worker's mood. If that doesn't tickle your fancy you can set up elaborate traps to defeat INTERPOL agents or even the games James Bond-type secret agents. All the while you need to keep hapless tourists busy in hotels and manage your criminal empire on the world map to earn cash and complete missions (wihout brining down too much heat on yourself). Helping you in your tasks are a number of unique henchmen like a rogue Samurai or a crazy Nanny who earn experience to level up and unlock special attacks. There are a few small annoying things about the game which could be fixed in a great sequel but until I get my doomsday device working to force that to happen this is worth playing the in the meantime.

												If I could pick one game for which of which I could put the developers into several kitchen appliances until they consented to make a sequel, it would be this game. I've owned this game twice on CD and thankfully now on Steam. Every once in a while I return to the game and start a new evil lair. Despite all it's quirks, and the fact that the developers obviously had to rush the release, Evil Genius is in my opinion the best base-building game there is.			"

												A decent game. Fun idea, fun to play, has a few hang ups though, like poor basic minion ai, and certain things being too breakable for their own good like generators. If you find this on sale, buy it. If its at its regular price and you want a fun time killer, get it if you have ten burning a hole in your pocket.			"

												While not exactly the best game of its kind, Evil Genius has one thing a lot of these 'Sim' style games lack. Character. You can really feel the maniacal glee of stealing priceless works of art, assembling nefarious devices and plotting world domination. You've played the hero too much. Why not take a break and play the bad guy for a change? It'll be fun.			"

												When I first heard about this game I did not know what to expect. What I expected was you playing as some sort of 007 type character to STOP a evil genius when I first heard the name and nothing about it. My expectations however were blown  right out of the heat ray with this lovely game. I expected seriousness but what I got was a delightful retro supervillian game where you play as Dr. Evil, Cruella De vil, or a 1960's scooby-doo villian from Asia. This game has lots of fun and wonderful secret agent bosses representing famous government agents like Rambo and of course James bond himself. I love this game but the only problem I see with it is that walls need to be 100% accurate. You can't delete them and it's really annoying when I built the freezer and now it's as open as the grand canyon. I reccomend picking it up just be careful how you build.			"

												First off, this game is fun but the in game tutorial is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and doesn't explain anywhere near enough.Also, the length of time required to do Anything is ridiculous. Honestly its damn infuriating sometimes.Oh yeah, and the random arrivals of enemy agents that never leave and that you cant deal with (had three super agents on my island that won't ♥♥♥♥ing leave even though I have no heat and am doing everything I can to ♥♥♥♥ing avoid them; meanwhile they kill every agent I try and send on unrelated missions so I can never get anything done).Its still pretty fun, but when you spend hours and hours on a game and never really progress because the mechanics are flawed, its maddening.I hate that I cant give a mixed review. I'd likely give this a 6 out of 10.			"
