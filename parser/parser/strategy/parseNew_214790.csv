												Ed Mcmillen is, arguably, a video game auteur (though, no one would really contest that). If he isn't an auteur yet, he certainly is a recognizable personality and a welcome individual to the world of video games.The Basement Collection is a bundle of Mcmillen's flash work prior to his big hits (""Super How the Hell Did I Miscalculate That?"" and ""The Binding of Why The Hell Can't I Stop Playing?""). So, the big question is, do the games hold up?Well like any art or artist, it takes time to develop skill and hone one's-oh wait, nevermind these games are gold. Honestly, you would think that at some point Mcmillen and his team screwed up and made an awful game somewhere and had to bury it like a dirty secret.None of these games are some crayon drawing that a parent puts on the fridge to make themselves or their children feel better. The games included in this compilation are all fascinating and top notch, and all of them feel very different from one another. These games all share the familar Team Meat aesthetic and challenge. Out of the games here there should definitely be at least one that will warrant a purchase from you. Maybe it will be the somber story of the adventure game Aether? Or maybe the frantic Grey Matter? Maybe Time ♥♥♥♥, the perplexing puzzle platformer with a dark twist? If you can't find one game here to enjoy, there honestly might be nothing that pleases you.			"

  TL;DR  : An amazing set of original indie flash games, each single one has something great about it. Amazing gameplays, great music, some original stories, a great art style... A must have if you're into simple and quick indie games, and if you like other Edmund McMillen's games. Definitely worth its price. The Basement Collection is a collection of different indie flash games, created mostly by the creators of Super Meat Boy / The Binding of Isaac.Story / SettingMost of what the games have to offer is their gameplay and art style, but some of these games have a really unique story. Meat Boy and Spewer barely even have one for example, whereas Coil is really story driven, even if its story is not really clear, and it requieres your own interpretation of the game. Time ♥♥♥♥ and Aether's stories are present and interesting, but really aren't the core of the games. Finaly, if you unlock AVGM, I'd say that its the game that has the most meaning in the list, this game is litteraly a parody of other games and is only worth playing if you understand what the games is making fun of (or if you want the achievements !) GameplayTrust me, there's going to be at least one game that you'll enjoy playing in there. Most of the games are hard to beat completely, like, really hard. Even if you reach the ""end"" of the game, there's going to be advanced levels or achievements that will take a while to beat and obtain. I guess you already know how Meat Boy works, since it's basically the original version of Super Meat Boy (one of the best and most challenging platformer I know of). Spewer is an amazing platformer as well, but requieres a bit more tactics than Meat Boy. Aether is like... the smallest sandbox game I've played, it's fun to play and really is different from all these really hard games. I didn't play Triachnid much but it's gameplay is quite unique, even if I found it a bit boring after a while. Grey-Matter is like one of these old Starship arcade games, it's hard to describe. It was fun but I'm a noob at it :( Time ♥♥♥♥ was my favorite one to play and has an awesome idea behind it. It requieres a lot of attention and reactivity, especially in the harder levels. I'd say that it's half puzzle, half platformer, it reminded me of Fez in a way. The only problem with it was the saving system, make sure you click ""exit"" on the right, under the person who speaks to you (no spoiler) so that the game saves your progress, and try to quit the game with the in game option (top left). PerformanceKnowing it's a flash game... the performance was pretty bad for what the games had to offer, but it was totally playable. I did have to lower my screen resolution to play Spewer and Aether properly, as the games were quite laggy (kinda like the first Binding of Isaac was, for me). The game can't be rendered by my GPU (because it's flash I guess ?!) and uses integrated intel graphics :( Probably won't be an issue if you have a desktop PC with more a more recent CPU. Style / Graphics As always with Ed, i'm not dissapointed. It's not as full of weird wonderful things as The binding of Isaac, but pretty much each game has it's own look and feel. Triachnid and Aether were especially enjoyable to play simply because of their art style. Time ♥♥♥♥ wasn't especially nice visualy, (I know that the pixelated look was what was desired) but the game clearly isn't about it's graphics. Finally, the music. Wow. Danny Baranowsky is by far my favorite video game soundtrack composer. If after playing Time ♥♥♥♥, Meat Boy and AVGM, you don't have the melodies stuck in your head you must be deaf.			"

 8/10 Great Games in 1  SHORT VERSION : If you do know Edmund McMIllen you would know that his games are most made in flash and they're more like a painting or some sort of art.This is a collection  of his best worksFor Edmund fans this game pack is a no-brainer. LONG VERSION  Edmund McMillen is a real artistic game developer. He has done almost all of my favourite games.This gamepack does including these games :Aether : I dont know what to say about this game actually it's kind of a sandbox game but it's not.It has real objectives and it contains lots of content.You're playing as some kind of guy who has a flying spiderman kind thingy who can grap on clouds.You have to travel around planets and help their problems. If you've done anything the planet will be happy and you can go to the next place. As every Edmund game this has some kind of similarity to other McMillen games. It has lots of mistery and it keeps you playing towards to the end.Time ♥♥♥♥ :I think this game is a real badass thing. You are as steven who you should know from BOI if you have played it for even like 1 or 2 hours. Its style is very simple its kind of like Limbo but it has its own originality. It has some story line in it but i never did follow that i just played  like when i played BOI for the first time.This game should give you a mind♥♥♥♥ if you play enough. I really liked this you should really try this out.Spewer :As it says its a physics based platformer. Uhhh . yeah kind of but it has some funky and ugly stuff at the same time. I mean it has puking yourself in the air in it and things like that. It has weird things going on. I really liked this when i played this for the first time but as a flash game its really simple and not very addictive for a longer playtime.Meat Boy:Meat Boy is a 2d platformer just like spewer and time ♥♥♥♥ but its really hard compared to time ♥♥♥♥ because this game needs some skill to play it not really just logic .I really liked this one as its ""complete"" game the super meatboy.Im sure you will like it if you like hard platformers.Grey Matter :Ok grey matter is the game that i never liked as much as the others. It is a 2d shooter game like these old-school spaceship shooter games but with a twist. Its kind of hard and i can't say too much about this game because i didnt play with it too much.Coil :Coil is the game thats not really a game. It is a story for real. It has some s*x and i didnt really comprehend its true meaning.My thinking is that its about you know.... I dont really wanna tell more about this.Triachnid :This game is a little slow-moving and kind of turn based but its real time but its a little hard to control.Triachnid is a spider physics game. You do play as a spider and you have to get from point a to point b.It has a real addictive way to get in love with pyhics based games. I really liked this one i hope you'll too   "

												This is a collection of Flash games that 1 man did the art for. The great quicky cartoonishly happy yet strangely horrific art. Basically you get this collection for the Meatboy prototype. That's worth the $3 it takes to buy it. A lot of these games seem like precursors to Meatboy. A lot of platformers, one unique asteroids type of game and not much else. Its worth $3 but not much more.			"

												This is a wonderful pack of little games.I quite enjoy getting to know the developers behind some of my favourite games. I follow certain indie devs, even more so when I hear them talking passionately about their games and going into detail about the ideas and stories behind them. That is why I love this, not only do you get to play a pack of great games, but you can unlock extra content, comics, hear interviews, see concept art and really get to know those games a little better.Every game in this pack is a joy to play. They are all unique games, with completely different stories, morals and ideas, but with the same art and music style from Edmund Mcmillen’s games, that we all know and love.I highly recommend this pack to any fan of Edmund, Team Meat or just great indie games in general!(There is also a few “secret” games hidden away in the game files that you can have a gander at, for anyone that didn’t know.)

												Here we have a series of games showcasing the early works of Edmund, who's brought us Super Meat Boy and Binding of Isaac. So, should be amazing stuff, amirite? Well, some of its pretty good, and I won't deny that one bit. But it should be disclaimed that everything of value here, you can already play on flash websites like Kongregate and Armor Games. Not only that, but they also perform better there. In fact, problems with these games actually seem to be multiplied when being ran as a program. For me, Spewer is the highlight of this stress. Due to problems with memory leaks, its just accepted by the community that yes, restarting the game IS the best way to push back against its unresponsiveness --- which only helps for a few minutes. This renders Spewer unplayable.Really, the only reason I can see that this could be considered a worthy purchase is if you want to be able to play the ORIGINAL Meat Boy without having to connect to the internet, which mind you, controls notably worse then Super Meat Boy. If you're really looking to support the ""big name behind Isaac and Meat Boy"", I'd advise you to maybe consider if you'd prefer purchasing their soundtracks instead, as this will likely just end up being added clutter to your Steam Library.

 The Basement Collection. What can I say about this game? ▼ ▼ ▼  The Basement Collection is a collection of award winning games released in years around 2006-2009, all of which have won many awards and have been nominated. Once you finish the base game of a game in the Basement Collection, you unlock an extra that may or may not be related to the game you beat at all. The extras usually contain artwork or a comic, but beating two of the games, (I wont say which) grants you two unlockable games. Do note though that these are the 2 only unlockable games in The Basement Colleciton. Every single game in The Basement Collection is amazing and unique in it's own way. There are 6 base games to start with, and 2 unlockable games, making for a total of 8 games. The starting games are Aether, Time ♥♥♥♥, Spewer, Meat Boy, Coil, and Triachnid. The unlockable games are   AVGM & Grey Matter.  Pros:- Every game is amazing and REALLY fun, REALLY well designed and are all challenging!- Great soundtrack for each game and the main menu's!- Great list of achievements!- Each game has unique puzzle gameplay which you must think about carefully and put into action before finishing the levels.- Each completed game unlocks and extra containing a comic, concept art, or an unlockable game!- Super cheap! $4.99!Cons:- The Basement Collection runs in flash, which means all the games in the collection are going to run in flash. This sometimes results in lag, deaths because of lag, a random crash I had once due to flash, and the game Spewer can be REALLY laggy if a lot of puke is on the screen, and I have an Intel i7 and Nvidia 1080.- Sometimes, but not always, and very rarely, random crashes when I go into SHIFT + TAB (Most likely due to flash but not 100% sure), but nothing to be worried about it imo.FINAL VERDICT:9/10 - Excellent!

												TL;DR Below.Like many other people say: You need to be a fan of Edmund in order to fully enjoy this collection. I myself had no idea who he was until I played this collection and his story is truly fascinating. I really do recommend people to go and hear his story because I'm sure many people can relate to him on different levels. Despite that, the majority of games were not my cup of tea but that doesn't necessarily mean they're horrible.I absolutely love Super Meat Boy and was amazed to find the original in the collection. Aether was also another interesting game I thoroughly enjoyed. Every other part of the collection was ""meh"" and I found it to be quite boring if not too frustrating to fully enjoy. Another problem I had was the frames. All games of the collection require little graphical demand to run and I have a top of the line CPU and GPU but still found games running at a frame rate as low as 10. This obstacle makes some games almost impossible to play as they require some complex platforming. The reasoning I believe is because they're made in flash and are in fact flash games. These are the infancy stages of what he's created and since they are flash games, you can easily find and play them elsewhere with better performance than on this, with no cost. That being said, you are in technicality paying for behind the scenes.Regardless of the problems I had, The Basement Collection is an interesting one at that and is one I can only recommend if you're quite fond of Edmund McMillen. The games as a game in my opinion are quite mediocre but that is because they are ""flash games"", but if you can connect to Edmund as well as his games then I think you would truly enjoy them. Being able to relate to Edmund can really make his games pieces of art.The collection as a whole unfortunately I cannot recommend because of it's performance issues, gameplay mediocrity, and price tag. Even though I said I recommend it to people who are fans of Edmund, and his story is fascinating, this review is geared towards the game/collection itself, not Edmund.TL;DR: You will only really enjoy the game/collection regardless of the poor performance fully if you meet very specific criteria. (Personal conflicts, Fan of Edmund McMillen, etc.) Buy at own discretion.			"

												The basement collection is a beautiful metaphore for Edmunds personal life, as described in Inde game: the movie. Each game has a certain charm that really accentuates the emotional connection the developer holds over his creations.Picking this game up in the sale will give you  a lot of games for the price you pay, and it certainly is worth the price, whilst not triple a standard, the meanings behind the games are rather quite deep, leaving the gamer with a feeling of content whilst being aware of a tragic undertone... Especially Aether, that game is deep.10/10, great indie bundle.			"

												You know, people wail on this game like it's at the bottom of the ""lowest price"" criteria, but really, I dont see the problem. But I must say, dont buy this game unless you want to support the developers, or are just a fan of the dev. With this you can see some of the behind the scenes things, or even just some of the smaller or just weird projects he hasnt released anywhere else. Plus, I would pay this money just to have that music. ""Music to make love to"" is a fair and just title.Overall, a good gift when the game is on sale, and I would definetely reccomend it to anybody who likes moderately weird things.7.3147843839402394237479230423479203342342342342384748374910234/10 Points.

												The Basement Collection... The price is awesome, especially for this much content.Let's take a look at the games:Aether - Loved it, exploration game with some small puzzles. Controls could use some work, but this is a great concept. Could work in a standalone game.Time Fc*k - Another great concept. Puzzle game where you switch between layers to solve puzzles. Could work in a standalone game.Meat Boy - A classic! No controller support though (hard !! :().Grey Matter - Shoot 'em up without the shooting. Wasn't all that impressed, but it's ok.Coil - Something about a pregnant lady. Weird and the controls plain suck.Triachnid - Again, the controls suck. And no saves so you have to restart the game every time you exit. Nice concept, terrible execution.And then there's 2 secret games (one of them is AVGM which is all about mouse clicking, the other one is unknown as of now) and a whole lot of extra content (audio Q&A, artwork, etc.).If you liked (S)MB and/or Isaac buy this ![Rating: 80/100]			"

												To draw an allegory to comic books, Grant Morrison is one of the most interesting minds there is in the comic world. Always leaving a trace of a larger story that connects all of his comics and leaves a grand mystery for those die hard fans looking for it. Well, Edmund McMillen is the Grant Morrison of indie video games, he leaves us with an amazing story that falls underneath what he presents us and the deeper we go down the rabbit hole the greater it becomes.

												There's actually so much to say about this pretty big collection of games, photos, art, comics etc. but overall it's pretty good! Good & bad things I'd like to mention:- I had to restart the collection a few times in order to get a stable (max.) 30 FPS (again): 1 time while I started playing Aether (<10 FPS), multiple times while playing Spewer (15 - 20 FPS). I feel there's a problem with proper garbage collection > memory leaks;- You'd wish you could play most of the games at 60 FPS, especially Spewer. Not only does it make the game slow-paced, a low framerate also messes with your timing skills. And when it's about precision-platforming...- The original Meat Boy - with familiar achievements - already makes the collection worth it for me. This game might be available on the internet for free, and I've checked 2 sites, but it works awful for me there. So it's nice to have it in the collection, a bit more optimized?8/10			"

												As a fan of ""The Binding of Isaac/Rebirth"" and ""Super Meat Boy"", It's safe to say that some of these games are very entertaining, and some are meh. Some of the games do tend to lag, so be careful with that. When it comes down to gameplay, most of the games work very well, although some are worse than others. (Ahem, Triachnid) Either way, this collection is a blast to play, and there are many secrets to discover.			"

												The collection is very entertaining for someone who is a fan of Edmund McMillen's work, however it is hardly playable due to lag. Some of the games work better, some of the games work worse, but unfortunately I cannot recommend this collection because it is not optimized enough. I should be able to fully enjoy the experience considering my specs, but I cannot.I've got the game on sale for 0,99 cents so I really do not feel cheated and I had a fun time with Time ♥♥♥♥. So if you do not mind risking that the game won't work for you and if you are a fan of the game designer get the collection anyway :) .			"

												Amazing collection of games by Edmund McMillen... These games are some of his older work, Super Meat Boy's prototype (aka ""Meat Boy"") might be the most recognized one here. Meat Boy is almost exactly the same as Super Meat Boy but it's more simplistic (since it was a newgrounds game), though that doesn't mean it's less challenging. There's also Time ♥♥♥♥ which is one of my personal favourites...Time ♥♥♥♥ is truly an amazing game, the levels have you thinking the whole time about your next move and even the story is interesting for a game as such, you can create or download levels and there's also a mode which is called ""Enter the unknown"" which downloads a set of random levels and uses them to create a whole different experience from what the campaign's levels give.I'm not going to talk about all the games but if you really enjoy indie games then you should definitely get this collection... You won't regret it.			"

												The Basement Collection is essentially a library of past flash games made by Edmund McMillen, the developer infamously known for creating titles such as The Binding Of Isaac and Super Meat Boy, both extremly fun and unique games in their own right. It shows the progression of Edmund throughout not just his developing career but also his life with drawings done by him as a child and sketches of characters that later were put into his games as unlockables from beating games. It is a rather interesting Collection and if you are a fan of McMillen's games I would definatelly recommend picking it up. But aside from all that, the real selling point, the highlight of this collection is the inclusion of a man hanging from a noose when you exit the game, not only that but his face changes seemingly at random, absolutelly breathtaking. 10/10			"

												Edmund McMillen is a professional troll and game designer with a perverted and vile sense of humor. He's also a genius. He's the man behind the modern classics Super Meat Boy and The Binding of Isaac, titles you should already recognize if you've been a Steam gamer for any amount of time.The Basement Collection is a compilation of his old flash games which made him famous on Newgrounds. Granted, it's an excellent compilation, complete with tons of extra levels and DVD extras, but whether it's worth your time or not really just boils down to the question ""How eager are you to play these games again?""I say this, because this collection mainly exists for historical significance alone. The games themselves are low-res, glitchy, have mildly-to-maddeningly infuriating controls, and most of them are simply exercises in masochism. They’re the type of game you beat just to be able to say you beat it, and that it’s finally over with. In other words, a good challenge. But if you want to unlock all the extras that make this package worth the money, you’ve got to play through the games again. So it all comes down to how appealing that sounds to you.If these games are important to you and mean something to you, if they were the games that defined your childhood and the games you'd secretly play in computer lab in high school or something, hey, I respect that. Buy it without hesitation and support the man who gave you hours of joy in your youth. We all have our nostalgia bombs and we have every right to indulge.But if you've never played these games before, there are much better Edmund McMillen games on the market, as well as better games to play for their historical significance alone; I recommend seeking those out instead.(Oh, and it’s also quite hard to 100%, so achievement hunters beware!)

												My favorite thing about this game is it starts as four games and unlocked, it's seven. No local saving so if you have to reformat or use a different machine you'll have to copy your save to usb and such, otherwise your achievements that are unlocked will unlock all your old stuff, just no save progress for long games like Meat Boy. Yeah, these are all free around the internet but these are also Newgrounds games, so actually good flash games. Classic Meat Boy is a hard as balls platformer that took me forever to 100% and all of these are completely different games. Great humor though through out all the games, and there are unlockable comics that are by the artists that is amazing, about a boy who hears a dead crow talking to him, it is adult context with a super simple look that a lot of these games posses a portion of. Yes oh yes I recommend this game because I like them to be this hard. Those flash games I would come home and play all night to beat in a sitting, now I own them and I can save there progress. I even gifted this game to a friend so they would have a variety of games to play.			"

												A ragtag collection of Ed McMillen's old flash games. If you liked playing all sorts of games on Newgrounds back in the day, like Ed McMillen's work, and want to see what his old games were like, I guess this might be for you. In all honestly, it was pretty hit and miss with me.Coil was pretty abstract and didn't really give you instructions on what to do, which was the draw I suppose. Honestly wasn't too engaging.Triachnid was pretty slow, and the physics can get really bothersome at times. Interesting atmosphere and way of telling it's story.Meat Boy was pretty fun when it was on Newgrounds, and controlled pretty well at the time. But now after Super Meat Boy came out, it really doesn't hold up. The controls are really primitive and half the difficulty of the game is just fighting the controls. Several of these levels would be nowhere near as difficult if you put them into Super Meat Boy. Not really a fan of this one unfortunately. Super Meat Boy is just much better.Time ♥♥♥♥ pretty much plays out like those old flash puzzle games. Kind of interesting and neat, and it did get a new set of levels in The Basement Collection. Unfortunately, those play out more like a ROM hack of this game instead of just being more levels fo play through. Those aren't really fun.Spewer is my favorite from this collection of games. It's a puzzle platformer where your character has basically a barfing jetpack mechanic to help him get to certain places. The levels are pretty fun, and the main gimmick has plenty of ways to work out. Unfortunately, it can get a bit finnicky at times.Aether is kind of a puzzle adventure game that's kind of interesting once you play through it. Unfortunately, finding the space landmarks for the achievements just isn't fun. Kind of interesting, but not much to it.Grey Matter is a interesting game that I didn't find too engaging. It's a shooter type game, except you have to run into the enemies, and avoid the bullets. It was kind of fun, but I didn't have any real interest in the end.A.V.G.M. is an unlockable game, that's a satire on cow clicker type games. The joke ran too far, and the joke itself wasn't that great.Overall, a really mediocre collection. Get it if you're interested in Ed McMillen's old games, but there's really not much reason to get it otherwise.			"

												The Basement Collection is a pretty nice variety of games made by the talented Edmund McMillen. It collections contains a bunch of games, which can be either found online or playable in this game only.Let's start with Meat Boy. If you played Super Meat Boy before, you should know the story. Your girlfriend Bandage Girl has been kidnapped by the evil Dr. Fetus. The plot is nearly the same, and was the original plot that later appeared in Super Meat Boy.In Spewer, you play as a little creature that tries to escape the scientist's lab by spewing puke, activate traps and avoid the traps. One of my definite favorites, and requires some thinking.Time ♥♥♥♥ (that's getting an sequel soon) is another puzzle game that features Steven, a person who has no idea in what situation he has trapped himself in and tries to find himself the way out. A very strange puzzle game.Coil features a story similar to well, how a person gets made. It's been a while since i finished that one. It's pretty short, but still a fun one-time experience.In Triachnid you play as a three-legged spider called Triachnid that wants to explore and find his lost larva. I always had trouble controlling this one, but you will get the hang of it.Aether has this kid that rides his octopus-like creature and sticks onto planets and discover the 5 different moons. The game also features some hard to find easter eggs that require both exploring and playing with coordinates.And finally, Grey Matter. This plays similar to a arcade game and you have to make triangular shapes as much as you can while avoiding all kinds of stuff. Quite difficult.Each of the games feature special unlockables and other stuff when completing certain chapters or the whole game. These may vary and could be things like prototypes, videos, art and more. There's also 2 special games that can be unlocked by completing multiple games.And that's the Basement Collection. Should you get it? I think you should. If you like Edmund's work or you just like to play a bunch of games in one with special unlockables, you will most likely have fun and have some rage-inducing moments. The $4 is definitely worth the price. I just would like to say that the game runs most games in Flash, and tend to make them laggier. The menu will not have this problem.			"

This pack contains a bunch of his older games, plus a few other surprises as you go through it.  I only played through some of the Meat Boy flash prototype and Spewer and most of Time ♥♥♥♥, but I feel like this game is worth playing through Time ♥♥♥♥ alone :3Hope you enjoy getting frustrated, because that's a highlight of all of ed's games!I got this from the humble bundle that included it, but I think this is worth at least $5-10 just from the little that I played of it.  All of these are flash games, but Binding of Isaac is a flash game too, and that's pretty good in that regard~			"

												If you're a fan of McMillen games, this is an obvious get. It's like a collector's edition of many of his older works, some of which are experiments, others fully-fledged games. Aether is a great one for its play-dynamic alone. Time ♥♥♥♥ for its reality-twisting 'story'. Many of the other games may drive you mad for their time-sensitive play-style requirements, but if you like McMillen games you know what you're in for. Overall if you like mini indie-games done well, or peculiar games with dark and melancholic undertones, then you'll like most of this collection. Be prepared to lose a few more hairs over it.			"

												Only for fans of Edmund Mcmillen. It was one of the first things I ever bought on steam.I mean, it's basically a bunch of flash games shoved together. Nice little taste of everything Edmund. But I mean, it is fun for all the little games you can try out and play. If you want a long lasting super fun action adventure, this isn't it. If you want a casual, on and off kind of gaming where you aren't really progressing just more short spans of playing, this is fun. It's worth it ONLY if it's on sale and you like EdmundTL;DR - Get it on sale if you like short games by Edmund			"

There are many fun little games wrapped up together, tons of secrets and bonus content, and high replay value. The only downside is that the Steam overlay doesn't seem to work with this game - it makes checking achievements a pain in the 6-21-3-11. But it's forgivable. The Basement Collection is a definite buy if you played platformers in the aughts. Relearn, replay and relive.			"

It also comes with bonus content like Q&A on how the games were created and even more games that were made as small projects/pre-builds.I loved this collection and maybe it's becasue I love Edmund Mcmillen or because these games are amazing, you figure it out.

												If you're a big fan of Edmund McMillen's other games, then this is likely a worthwhile purchase for you. It has some very interesting experimental digital installments (I wouldn't call all of them games), and also things like Coil which is a nice short story-based game with some very unique gameplay elements. However if you come into this not having previous experience with McMillen's work, then you might find some of the things in this to be a bit strange. Even so, it is a very cheap price for a few hours at mosts worth of basic entertainment, so go ahead and buy it if you have a bit of spare change.			"

												I was interested in Edmund McMillen since I saw him in a documentary about game designers. I knew about Super Meat Boy, so I wanted to learn more about his style with this collection. So far I've only played Time ♥♥♥♥ so I'll talk about that:This game is the best mindf*ck I've experienced in a looong while. It exemplifies the struggle of self and identity, reality, life and death. What I love most about it is the main antagonist, who seems to be you from the future: now trapped in this alternate dimension of maze-like rooms you find yourself in (which feels an awful lot like purgatory). As you go room to room and solve puzzles, this other self constantly puts you down and spouts all sorts of disturbing nonsense, while simulatenously cheering you on and pleading for help. Imagine something like an existentialist GLaDos, only crazier and more negative. If you can imagine that.The game itself raises a multitude of philosophical questions and really makes you think deeply beyond the creative puzzles. The puzzles themselves can be maddening; the fact you have a limitless amount of lives and continues only adds to the sense of hopelessness, but you feel so fascinated and driven to keep going and solve each one, just to see what happens next...

												Edmund McMillen is a genius in my opinion. This is a very nice collection of games, all of which I enjoyed. They're weird, but Edmund's stuff in general is weird. Some of them have moving stories, while others are more focused on gameplay. The player is rewarded for progressing in and completing them, making it worth doing. Each game is unique, providing a massively different experience, and most of them are replayable, meaning you don't have to drop it when you get the golden god achievement.They're fun, and for €4 ($5?), it's worth trying, no matter what you think of it afterwards. It's a collection of His finest flash games before the hits, and though they're less known than tBoI and SMB, they're just as fun to play.			"

												I did enjoy some of the games in this collection, and the extra content that can be unlocked by finishing games/getting achievements, but I'm not recommending this collection because it's buggy and lags often/really badly. To perfect it is alot of work and dedication, add in the lag (especially while playing Time ♥♥♥♥) and it makes it so much more frustrating. A few of the games involve precision jumping/moving, and when input is delayed for just a few seconds, it really messes up a play through.In saying this, if you're a casual gamer who doesn't care much for games, you can play these games on New Grounds in a brower, which might help since they're Flash games.

												I have been a fan of Edmund Mcmillen ever since he was back on Newgrounds, so the second I saw a compilation of all of those games redone come on sale, I was quite excited to jump back into the fray of the physics-platformers the man is known for, especially the original Meat Boy, which is fairly nostalgic to me.Now, briefly, let me sum up the games: they're fine.They're still well designed, sometimes brilliant little games that achieve so much with so little. I enjoy Spewer's, Time ♥♥♥♥'s, Aether's new smoother, crispier selves. Meat Boy was thrown under the bus.Meat Boy is a very good game with consistent controls. These controls, while a tad floaty, are suited to the game's design. Meat Boy jumps just within the right height and width the character needs to see to the end of the level, turning this struggle into an elegant foray of taps and clicks. Every time you press the space bar, you feel in control of the hang time and brevity of the leap. It's simple and comfortable for a game with vertically designed levels in mind.Super Meat Boy's levels are, for the most part, horizontal, and designed for a controller.So, whoever decided to throw out the original controls in turn for these new ones is an idiot.Meat Boy, as a game where it's levels are designed with the controls in mind, does NOT work with new controls.Simple.Now the game plays like an awkward, floppy piece of meat, where instead of dancing across levels, now feels as entertaining as swinging a stick around in a figure 8. Also, the stick is falling apart, constantly. As SOON as you let go of the space button, Meat Boy plummets to the ground as fast as he left. There is no arch like there was in the original, just because more people played Super Meat Boy and that's what they're used to.And hey, on a controller, I'M used to that too! But guess what? No controller support!AND, you can't change the controls back to the original!MAN. I LIKE THIS REDESIGN.			"

I loved the added content in this collection, but if you aren't a huge fan of Edmund's stuff this game isn't for you.Even if you don't get the collection, you should play the games.

No greys for this pack of little games.Very nice and original art and gameplay but, objectives aren't always clear and controls response is so low that they became unplayable. Different control's assignement for each game, no bottom line and, they are not mappable.A CURIOSITY on Gameland. Muic is painfull. If it was programmed just a bit better respect of controls, they would be even good.			"

Each is unique and complete in all aspects. I say this in full honesty.

It's made by the same person who did games such as Super Meat Boy and Binding of Isaac, but these games range only from moderately amusing to massively laggy and frustrating to play.  For two bucks, it's worth it.  Otherwise, not really.  You're not going to play these games for very long.			"

												The Soundtrack (aka music to make love to): while I haven't listened to all of them, they are defineately worth playing when you're in another one of the Basement Collection; 3/5Meat Boy: A fun-ish, yet challenging journey of a block of meat to save his mother, but lack of a worthwhile goal creates a large hole in gameplay: 3/5Coil: At first glance, this seems dull and messed in the head (and that's coming from ME), but countinue on and it turns out to be a touching and loving (ahem) ""adventure;"" 4/5Triachnid: A fairly simple yet touching journey of a Triachnid, the last of it's kind, to survive, however, there is a lack of gameplay that leaves a large hole in the game; 3/5Aether: A simple, yet stunning game of what we all dreamed of as a child: flying through space on a spider-elephant thing; 4/5Time ♥♥♥♥: Mind ♥♥♥♥ would've been a MUCH more suiting name for lack of a better term, and ""WTFs"" are almost guaranteed; 4/5Spewer: This was nearly the hole reason I bought this collection lol. I played Spewer a while back on Newgrounds, and just couldn't stop being amazed at using mouth♥♥♥♥♥♥as a tool. The level editor brings this game alone to about 4 hours of my time on the Basement Collection; 5/5Grey Matter: This is the arcade game that ties the whole collection together, where you get highscores and different difficulty levels. It's gets old fairly quickly, but what you do play of it is pure 80's arcade bring-a-beer-and-some-chips-to-spend-your-Saturday; 4/5Overall, this collection gets an impressive 3.75/5Also, don't forget that for each game you complete, there is a hidden one to unlock ;)			"

												I remember playing half of these when they came out. You might be better served by Newgrounds in a few cases just because either new-Flash or the wrapper on the games in this makes them run like♥♥♥♥♥♥half the time.On the other hand, it's ♥♥♥♥ing Flash, it could just be some stupid setting I don't have tweaked.

												I really can't recommend this collection. It's a mixed bag; some of the games are really quite fun, while others are just... blah. My major issue with the game is that playing some games will unlock others, but the games never stay unlocked. This was, supposedly, fixed, but a fresh install will still behave the same way for me.Bottom line (in my opinion): if there are some games in here you know you'll enjoy, buy it for them. Then pray you don't have to unlock them each time!			"

												There's not a lot to say about The Basement Collection that the name does not already convey. Not to say they are all garbage but the strings are visible and the limitations are frustrating.Aether, Time ♥♥♥♥ and Spewer are definitely the stand out titles, although the last two suffer particularly due to a lack of controller support. Platforming in flash is bad enough but with a keyboard it's repugnant.Grey Matter is an uninspired asteroid style shooter, Coil is some experimental wank and Triachnid is a ""spider-sim"" which involves you having to move each of it's three legs, one at a time by mouse. It's tedious to say the least.Finally Meat Boy is what it says on the tin; ever wanted to play Super Meat Boy with worse graphics, music, controls and on a keyboard? You're in luck! Nostalgia for the small crowd of people who were teenagers when Newgrounds was still ""a thing"".The Basement Collection is certainly a fascinating insight into the works that came before Super Meat Boy and the Binding of Isaac but from a gameplay perspective it is completely primitive and tiresome.

												This game is perplexing to me, because I loved Super Meat Boy, and adored The Binding of Isaac – both games done by the same artist…so I had high hopes for this game. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but it just didn’t grab my attention. I’m planning on revisiting this game because I haven’t admittedly played enough of it to say definitively that I don’t like it, but it couldn’t hold my attention initially. At this stage, I wouldn’t recommend this game....and, for some reason, it shows me at 0.0 hours -- I've played more than that, obviously.			"

												The Basement Collection is a collection (hah) of a bunch of flash games and bonus content brought to us by Edmund McMillen.  To tell you the truth, most of the games weren't very good, just your typical flash-based time wasters:Triachnid was unplayable due to the input lag on the controls,Aether is a gravity-based physics platformer with a few puzzles to complete.  The music is good and there's some strange McMillen style story going on, if you're interested in this title it's available for free online (Newgrounds).Time CFUK is a puzzle platformer that deals with alternate dimentions or time travel or something.  It's actually pretty well put-together and I'd say is the highlight of the games in the collection.  I found the strange storyline appealing.  This is available for free online as well.Spewer is a physics-based platformer where you puke out goo that you use to navigate the levels.  It's alright, your typical flash-based game.   Once again, available for free online. Meat Boy - the prequel to Super Meat Boy.  Super Meat Boy is great because of its tight controls.  Imagine if Super Meat Boy had laggy controls and no controller support - that's what playing Meat Boy is like.  If you want to see what the flash prototype for Super Meat Boy is like you can find it free online.Grey Matter is kind of like a shmup but instead of shooting you use your ""ship"" to smash into things, creating a triangle within which the enemies die.  I'm a big fan of shmups and found this to be lacking.  If you want to check it out, it's free online (seeing a pattern here?)Coil isn't so much a game as it is art.  It was an alright piece, I found it weird and difficult to figure out.  You might like it, I wasn't a huge fan.  Check it out for free online for the same experience. Besides the above games, you can unlock the following games:The Lonely Hermit (beat Triachnid) - never played this because Triachnid is broken.  You can find it free online.AVGM - ""Abusive Video Game Manipulation (beat Coil) - a real stupid game.  All you do is click a lightswitch to make items appear and disappear.  Pretty huge waste of time.  You can find it free online.In addition to those two if you browse to [~steamapps/common/basement/moregames] there are four more games:Carious Welting - a missile defense clone with McMillin's art style.  Available free online.Carious Welting 2 - sequel to the above, same idea.  Available free online.Clubby the Seal - sidescrolling action game where you're a seal and kill Eskimos.  Available free online.Dumpling - a momentum-based physics game.  Available free online.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Besides the games you get some bonus artwork and drawings from McMillen's sketchbooks.  There's a bit more bonus content but that's really the extent of it.Would only recommend if you're a huge, HUGE fan of Edmund McMillen.  Otherwise you can pass and either play the games free online to see what they're about or just skip them entirely - most are pretty forgetable.			"

												Literally no point in buying this collection of flash (yes, they actually use flash) games. Only buy if your a fan of the creators, which I am not. I thought I might find something as engaging as Meatboy, but was sorely disappointed. Meatboy is one of the games in this collection, but it's the flash version. Just go find the games on Newgrounds.com, a site filled with laggy flash games of every kind. I'm going to go back to playing non-flash games.Gameplay:

												While this set isn't quite as bad as ""♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls the game"" aka The Binding of Issac, I will say that most of these games are barely Newgrounds circa 2002 quality. Sure, most were created quicky, but I'm surprised at how badly the controls don't work in most of them. The best game, Time ♥♥♥♥, is VVVVV with level shifting instead of orientation swapping. Is there some sort of rule that physics based Indie games must have really really terrible controls? Aether is a tedious rope swinging game that attempts to use rope physics to swing from planet to planet. Coil was the last straw. Basically, according to the dialogue, you play as a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s sperm as you violate a woman, impregnate her, and then drive the newborn? into despair during the formation of the fetus (how does that even work?). Oh, and the controls are crap.			"

												This game is just a mish mosh of a couple of flash games put into one pack of stuff. So I guess I'll just go by each game:-Meat BoyIt's alright, it's just like super meat boy except with worse controls. Just go play super meat boy.-TriachnidThis ♥♥♥♥en game is really ♥♥♥♥en annoying you gotta drag the 3 legged spiders legs and make it move and there is absolutely no ♥♥♥♥ing way. It's not fun at all. You just die for no reason and there are stupid maggot things you gotta collect and 1 is impossible. The music in this is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥-AetherProbably the best one, you just float around in space and visit different planets and solve puzzles. It's actually kinda fun even if it is really short.-Time ♥♥♥♥ WTF. This is a puzzle game where you shift between planes or something like plenty of other puzzle games out there. It gets really difficult at the end and there are♥♥♥♥♥♥puzzles made by the community and some are actually impossible. Also the music is really annoying.-SpewerA game where you spew♥♥♥♥♥♥out do puzzles way too ♥♥♥♥ing hard. WTF were they thinking. It's no fun if you have to do the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t level 1 million times coz the game keeps lagging, in a bloody flash game. This game was really ♥♥♥♥ing laggy, I think maybe it was the spikes or the goo or something but it was no good. Too ♥♥♥♥ing hard.-Grey MatterYou fly around and destroy ships like geometry wars or something. Pretty boring.Then there is one where you just click a light switch and make stuff appear on the screen. you're supposed to click it like 100,000 times or something. Couldn't imagin why i would wanna do that.In the end a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥games doesn't make a good one. I dunno why I would wanna look at pictures of Edward McMillen when he was a kid.2/12OH and there's a game called coil. Thats how memorable it is.			"

												Beat most these games on newgrounds, now i have to re-beat??? WOW... very very excercise indeed.  The game client is great, the games run smooth, the music is epic, and the gameplay is unique.  Comes with the sountrack of all games+ fan revisions + dev art and character art... fanboyish unlockables for beating certain games ( + secret game). My favorite games are Grey Matter and Spewer.. the rest are deviations from what we normally think of as video games, they are works of art... masterpieces really.			"

												It feels like all of the games in this package are in the alpha phase. For example, why play meat boy, if there's a good version: Super meat boy? The games feel like minigames sometimes and shouldn't be considered full ones. Quite amusing collection though. 6/10			"

You know... The guy who made Super Meat boy and The binding of Isaac....Eh whatever. This collection of small games are great. It even include Meat boy, the prototype version of super meat boy! worth for 5 bucks? Maybe. Worth 1 buck during a sale? ♥♥♥♥ yes.

												Edmund McMillan's classics in one package. If you liked his newest titles, Binding of Isaac and Super Meat Boy, I can recommend this. You will see the games that formed Edmund as a game designer and artist and look his finest pieces of work. Also you are recieving plenty of developer commentary, interviews, movie clips, artwork, and other goodies to enjoy. Games include Coil, Grey Matter, Triachnid, Time ♥♥♥♥, Meat Boy, Spewer, and Aether. All wonderful.			"

												Fun collection of games from the creator(s) of Super Meat Boy and The Binding of Isaac. All the games have been polished a bit with a few things added too them. Also has a few cool videos and development sketches. My only complaint is that since they are coded in flash, there seems to be some optimization issues in some games.			"

												My first impressions on all the default games (the ones you don't have to unlock that is):Time ♥♥♥♥ - Quite fun, challenging, and addicting.  You play as this little  guy who has been forced to go through a series of platform challenges by his future self.  Along the way, you get text messages from yourself in the next room, sometimes helpful, sometimes not.  Overall +1Spewer - Fun, but to floaty.  You play as this little genetically engineered thing that propels himself using his spew.  It sounds really fun, but when you actually play it, it's way to floaty.  Overall +0Meat Boy - Basically just a crappier, laggier version of Super Meat Boy.  Just play Super Meat Boy for pete's sake! Overall -1Triacnid - Fun, and as addicting as hell.  You play as a Spider, and you have to move all three of your legs independently of each other, trying to complete the stage with your egg sack intact.  It's really fun, but those 2006 physics and hit detections are subb-par.  Overall +1Coil - I don't know what to do.  I get that's the point of the game, but I get tuck on the second stae.  Overall +0Aether - Fun, but not great.  You play as a boy, riding a monster.  The monster can grab planets and clouds with his tounge, swinging himself and the boy to greater hieghts.  Ummm... that's about it.  Oh, and it can be laggy sometimes, but you can easily turn offf the stars, which helps a lot.  Overall +1Gray Matter - Fun, but too fast-paced.  Basically, you're a dot, trying to run into other dots, while avoiding flashing dots.It really just moves too fast for me.  Overall, +0Plus you got all the extra content, revamped♥♥♥♥♥♥ soundtracks, and more unlockable gameplay.  It's a fun collection of games, and for 2 bucks on Steam, I say take it for what it is, and buy it.			"

												The Basement Collection is a great little, well, as it says, collection of games Edmund McMillan has previously released or never released before. Aether is great, Coil is a little... deep, but still just as great, as are other titles in this small collection. There's also small bonus content where Edmund's wife interviews him about each of the games and each of the most commonly asked questions about said games are included as well, which is great to listen to. There's also sketch and concept art of each game included. I'd reccomend this to anyone who is a big fan of Edmund's other works like Super Meat Boy and Binding of Isaac. If you aren't a fan, however, then this pack is not for you, simple as that.			"

												For a collection of fleshed out ""beta"" games, this is well worth the cost.  The games themselves might be a bit rough around the edges since they couldn't really all stand up on their own, but the sheer variety and behind the scenes stuff is what makes this so compelling.  Some games are deeply intriguing and polished, while a few others are a bit lacking.  If you like the world of Indie game development, this is the best presentation that I've seen outside of Indie Game: The Movie.			"

												I personally bought this solely for Triachnid, which you can play for free on several websites (such as newgrounds). I loved it enough to want to have it forever and to support whoever created it.The rest of these games? I couldn't care less. I tried them and found them all to be some combination of short, creepy, confusing, and frustrating.Still, 4 dollars is a small amount to pay for 7 games, and I think it's definitely a reasonable price, all things considered. I think most gamers will enjoy the games I didn't, anyway.			"

Some are fun to play, like Aether, some are obscure and hard to follow, like Grey Matter and Triachnid, and some are just downright ""hWhat?"" inducing, ie Coil and AVGM.  If you are a fan of Mcmillen though, the interviews, art and comics contained within are worth the $4 price tag.  I mean, that art comes with some games that will take up some of your free time.

I love his work no doubt but I don't like playing flash games because the data is secretly stored in this secret flash file or something. Now I can pay a cheap price to get alot of his most popular flash games on a download. Not only does it not store in a flash file or whatever but alot of the popular games are all in one package.

												What can I say about The Basement Collection?As a fan of Edmund McMillen since the Newgrounds days, being able to play all these games again feels great. The game headlining this collection, Time ♥♥♥♥, is worth the $3 alone; all of the other games and secrets in the collection are just icing on the cake. I feel like I'm getting to know Edmund through playing these games, and that's kinda awesome.Gameplay wise, it's a collection of Flash games, so don't expect to get 10+ hours out of this. The framerate kill some of the games in this collection as well (I still haven't beaten Triacnid, and it feels almost impossible with the ~12fps that you get sometimes).All in all, worth your $3. I highly recommend it if you enjoy Edmund's other games or if you just like Edmund himself.8/10; Makes me want to put together an interactive art collection			"

												The Basement Collection was one of first games, or rather pack in this case, which I got on Steam. To be honest, I wasn't really interested in this at begin - these games looked ""meh"" to me and I got some trouble playing Meat Boy because of lag. So I played it for short time and forgot about it. Not so long time ago I tried it again: new PC would mean no more lag in Meat Boy! To be honest, at time I already finished Super Meat Boy on X360 and nearly finished it on PC but still, I just love this game, so a prototype was a must play for me. Not sure if this pack is for everyone anyway. I mean, there aren't any great (at least in my opinion) games that need to be played. I think maybe if you enjoy small indie games, you might like it. Probably fans of Edmund McMillen will have most fun playing it, seeing what ideas he had for games. On sales it's rather cheap, so maybe if you have some spare money and you are not sure what to get, and also you are big fan of indie games/Edmund McMillen, give The Basement Collection a chance.

												This is a review about the basement collection.I will be reviewing each game, and then the bundle together at the end.Time ♥♥♥♥4.5/5This is the game with the most ( and my favorite) content. 2 chapters, 4 achievements, 3 endings & a level editorSpewer3.5/5 A pretty good game. It also has a level creator and 8 achievements.SMB5/5Includes over 100 levels, 5 achievements (Includes the map pack and the regular game) and a level maker.AVGN2/5*im not sure if the name is right but meh* Honestly this game is the worst 1. it does have 4 achievements though.Aether4/5Very relaxing, has a lot of achievements & has a open-world like area. Also, bonus music C, so this has more content than the regular game.Triachind3/5A cool game, with a hidden egg in each level, mini games & a bestiary.Black Mind2.9/5A game that i think has random waves, unique powerups, 2 difficulties, a decent amt of achievements & a boss rush.Bonus Content 4/5Awesome that breadmund mc muffin included some bonus content like drawings & beta versions, also adds more meaning to unlocking things.Coil2.5/5Easy to complete once you know what you are doing.Bonus Games4/5There is 3 other games in the files that can be unlocked. they are pretty good, especially dumpling.Overall rating:4.9/5This is one of the  best games i have ever played as there is something for everybody, (and for a good price) a good game to buy.

												this game, as the name implies, is in fact a collection of small games.  if you are a fan of edmund McMillon, or if you're looking for some interesting platformers/puzzle games, i would highly reccomend the basement collection.  of course, they aren't all puzzle and platformer games, coil is... well... an art game i suppose, i dont know what else i would call it, and grey matter has a retro play style in which you slam your little black dot into the brains that are attacking you.  Although, if you haven't played much of Edmunds previous works, i would suggest either Super Meat Boy or The Binding of Isaac over the basement collection (but the basement collection is vastly cheaper)			"

I loved it enough to want to have it forever and to support whoever created it.The rest of these games? I couldn't care less. I tried them and found them all to be some combination of short, creepy, confusing, and frustrating.Still, 4 dollars is a small amount to pay for 7 games, and I think it's definitely a reasonable price, all things considered. I think most gamers will enjoy the games I didn't, anyway.			"

												♥♥♥♥ing awesome. Most of the games in this little collection are crap but still interesting simply for being so weird and thought-provoking, then there's a handful that are genuinely incredible. Aether is fun and really moving, Grey Matter is a hypnotizing adrenaline rush, and Time ♥♥♥♥ is probably one of the best puzzle-platformers of all time. Seriously, the clever premise, the creepy music, the funny writing, the smart puzzles, the striking visuals, the dark story, everything about Time ♥♥♥♥ is fantastic and memorable.Online these games are free, but pay for the  Basement Collection and you're getting fullscreen, no ads, the soundtracks, and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of extra content including A GOD DAMN WHOLE NEW CAMPAIGN FOR TIME ♥♥♥♥, plus new music for Aether, fan-service stuff like old concept art, that sort of thing.It's just so good. Whether you're a fan or not it's worth buying this dirt-cheap bundle if only to play a definitive version of the masterpiece that is Time ♥♥♥♥.Oh Meat Boy's pretty fun too.			"

												A collection of indie games all made by Edmund McMillen, as the description of the game suggests. Most of the games can be found elsewhere on the internet, but I think that this aggregate which comes with the soundtracks, art journals and commentaries is a good deal for only $4.From what I know: Pros: +Comes with the soundtracks (which are amazing)+A lot of extra content for each game and otherwise+Fairly easy game to 100% Cons: -Runs in Flash, which means it may run slow on a lot of computers-Most if not all of these games can be found elsewhere on the internet (if that's all you want out of this collection)-Progress saves are really rather finnickyI think this is a pretty good investment, even if it's only for the soundtracks!Not that the games are bad.

Worth it just for the commentary, and to have all of these games in one place honestly is worth money. Don't hesitate if you like this guy's work and want to see more of it.			"

												Going to make this quick and simple for this review. Great bundle of games for Edmund McMillen fans. Yes, these are flash games but there is tons of extra content and info for each game. If you're a fan of Binding of Isaac and Super Meat Boy, you will love this. If you don't you won't. From an Edmund McMillen fan standard, I'd say. Ten OUTTA Ten! For a normal Steam user, I'd say 6.5/10			"

												Solid collection of basic games from the creator of Super Meat Boy. It's worth noting some of these games feel unfinished but that's the point. Some of these games were early prototypes of later games, abandoned projects, or just really basic games made with limited resources at the time. But that's part of the charm of this pack.			"

												An interesting look into one dev story as a early game designer. Edmund McMillen, the creator of Gish, The Binding of Isaac, and Super Meat Boy, shows off his early trials at interactive story telling including an early version of Super Meat Boy. Gameplay wise, they are all rough prototypes so each game in this collection is realitively short in content but a few can really be a pleasant time suck. I quite enjoyed Aether for longer than I care to admit, just exploring and playing with the physics of the game. All in all, it kind of feels like a semi-masterbatory auto-biography, but you can walk away with some fun gameplay and a bit of insite into the life of an early indie dev. 3.5 stars This should be paired with a viewing of Indie Game: The Movie.

												The games contained within are hit or miss.  Some are fun to play, like Aether, some are obscure and hard to follow, like Grey Matter and Triachnid, and some are just downright ""hWhat?"" inducing, ie Coil and AVGM.  If you are a fan of Mcmillen though, the interviews, art and comics contained within are worth the $4 price tag.  I mean, that art comes with some games that will take up some of your free time.  Worth it.			"

												I personally bought this solely for Triachnid, which you can play for free on several websites (such as newgrounds). I loved it enough to want to have it forever and to support whoever created it.The rest of these games? I couldn't care less. I tried them and found them all to be some combination of short, creepy, confusing, and frustrating.Still, 4 dollars is a small amount to pay for 7 games, and I think it's definitely a reasonable price, all things considered. I think most gamers will enjoy the games I didn't, anyway.			"

												As a long-time McMillen fan, I'm glad I have the oppurtunity to re-play these Flash classics- with extras. Time Kcfu is a fun, dimension-hopping puzzler; Spewer relies a bit more on your reflexes, with level design as delightful as Time Cufk; the original Meat Boy is an enjoyable demo of sorts to Super Meat Boy; Grey Matter is rather insubstansial, but still quick, twichy fun; Aether and Coil are interesting, moody interactive art-pieces (Aether being much more of a traditional game than Coil). The only game I don't particularly like is Tri-Achnid. Slow and clunky, not very fun to play. Altogether, more than worth four dollars. As a fan, the extras divulging the inspirations for the various titles and developer commentary were great, too.			"

												As many of the reviews for this game mention, you have to be a fan of the creator to really, fully appreciate what it has to offer. I can appreciate putting his earlier games into an easily manageable release but I found that it just wasn't for me. I haven't really been a fan of flash games and that is all this is, a bundle of flash games with a bit of director's commentary thrown in, which I will state that I do appreciate. I'm sure many others love this game and more power to them but if you already aren't a fan of flash games then this isn't going to change your mind.			"

												A cool collection of old school flash games. Some of them are neat and some of them are stinkers. If it had controller support - Id recommend as a good buy, but without controller support... you may want to just play games on NewGrounds if you like flash games.The games do have Edmund charm about them, so if you are into that then it will be a treat.  I got about 6 hours out of it, beat 6 of the games, gave up on the 3-legged spider game and Super Mean Boy prototype after the first chapter is crazy card on a keyboard.			"

Although, if you haven't played much of Edmunds previous works, i would suggest either Super Meat Boy or The Binding of Isaac over the basement collection (but the basement collection is vastly cheaper)			"

												As you probably know, this is an anthology of McMillen's earlier work, mostly from Newgrounds. All the games are availiable for free, but the fun extras combined with the low price, make for a very attractive purchase. Said extras include, but are not limited to: two extra games (a joke game and a map pack for meatboy), examples of McMillen's drawings (two full comics and an assortment of sketches) and expanded soundtrack for all games. Anyone who remotely enjoys McMillen's work will be familiar with at least some of the games, but all games contain bonus extras that go from early technical demos to cut footage from IGTM, going through fan Q&A in a talk-show-like format hosted by Danielle (McMillen's wife & business partner).

												The Basement Collection was one of first games, or rather pack in this case, which I got on Steam. To be honest, I wasn't really interested in this at begin - these games looked ""meh"" to me and I got some trouble playing Meat Boy because of lag. So I played it for short time and forgot about it. Not so long time ago I tried it again: new PC would mean no more lag in Meat Boy! To be honest, at time I already finished Super Meat Boy on X360 and nearly finished it on PC but still, I just love this game, so a prototype was a must play for me. Not sure if this pack is for everyone anyway. I mean, there aren't any great (at least in my opinion) games that need to be played. I think maybe if you enjoy small indie games, you might like it. Probably fans of Edmund McMillen will have most fun playing it, seeing what ideas he had for games. On sales it's rather cheap, so maybe if you have some spare money and you are not sure what to get, and also you are big fan of indie games/Edmund McMillen, give The Basement Collection a chance.

												Unfortunately this game breaks very easily and can become unplayable after only a few minutes of playtime. Not sure exactly what causes it when someone can play a brand new game that requires extremely high-level equipment and then this collection of flash mini-games craps out constantly. There will be constant lag and in some cases the games will freeze on some screens and screw up all your progress in that game until that point. If you want to play the games in this collection, go play the original flash versions I guess.			"

It also has a level creator and 8 achievements.SMB5/5Includes over 100 levels, 5 achievements (Includes the map pack and the regular game) and a level maker.AVGN2/5*im not sure if the name is right but meh* Honestly this game is the worst 1. it does have 4 achievements though.Aether4/5Very relaxing, has a lot of achievements & has a open-world like area. Also, bonus music C, so this has more content than the regular game.Triachind3/5A cool game, with a hidden egg in each level, mini games & a bestiary.Black Mind2.9/5A game that i think has random waves, unique powerups, 2 difficulties, a decent amt of achievements & a boss rush.Bonus Content 4/5Awesome that breadmund mc muffin included some bonus content like drawings & beta versions, also adds more meaning to unlocking things.Coil2.5/5Easy to complete once you know what you are doing.Bonus Games4/5There is 3 other games in the files that can be unlocked. they are pretty good, especially dumpling.Overall rating:4.9/5This is one of the  best games i have ever played as there is something for everybody, (and for a good price) a good game to buy.

The game headlining this collection, Time ♥♥♥♥, is worth the $3 alone; all of the other games and secrets in the collection are just icing on the cake. I feel like I'm getting to know Edmund through playing these games, and that's kinda awesome.Gameplay wise, it's a collection of Flash games, so don't expect to get 10+ hours out of this. The framerate kill some of the games in this collection as well (I still haven't beaten Triacnid, and it feels almost impossible with the ~12fps that you get sometimes).All in all, worth your $3. I highly recommend it if you enjoy Edmund's other games or if you just like Edmund himself.8/10; Makes me want to put together an interactive art collection			"

												There's about 9 flash games all bundled into one with added content for each one. Time ♥♥♥♥ has a second chapter inside it for instance. If you liked Super Meat Boy and/or Binding of Isaac, I would recommend it. There's a bunch of content here for only four dollars, you can't go wrong.			"

												Most of the games are really boring and not really fun to play, I wouldn't recommend unless you are an Edmund superfan.			"
