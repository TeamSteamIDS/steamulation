												I just want to say that this game used to be incredibly good. In all honesty I've played more of Awesomenauts than any other game I've played to date. This game is a MOBA like any other, but with rather simplistic mechanics compared to other MOBAs. Things like shop items are limited to a small variety that can drastically change the style of play of characters, very unique to other MOBA shop items that merely provide stat changes. Despite being a ""Watered-down"" MOBA, the game was very fun to play.As the years carried on, however, the game began to quickly lose its sheen. Ronimo has failed to listen to its fanbase time and time again. The matchmaking system now is the same as it was when it was first released: Without relative skill matchmaking, so matches are often decided before they even start. No dedicated servers, so networking in the game is strictly peer-to-peer, which doesn't work well with MOBAs. All forms of hit detection are determined by the client of the attacking player, so a lagging player can easily rack of kills by exploiting his latency. Game balancing has been an issue, as the stronger characters tend to be the newer ones available through DLC, making things feel P2W at times. The community is awful; expect cancer.Overall, this game had potential, but slowly my expectations for Ronimo to respond to player pleading and continued to take the game in a direction no player wanted.

												Awesomenauts is truly an awesome game, it combines traditional MOBA (DOTA, LoL, etc) style gameplay with 2d platforming. The gameplay is addictive, skill based and tons of fun to play with friends. There are a few annoying issues, such as players being able to leave and rejoin the game without consequence in order to pick a counter to your character.I recommend the game to anyone regardless of how new or experienced you are to gaming.

												With over 1k hours of this game I feel like it's time I talk about it. I love this game and stream it daily. www.twitch.tv/zachymassacre.This game has so much potential. I've been playing it for 2 years or so and it's grown so much. With the release of Starstorm and the new content it's only getting bigger. There are lots of reasons to play it and there are a lot of frustrating things that make you want to quit.The thing with this game, as well as many others that rely on the online community, is that it's either really fun or it's toxic.Some people you come across can be respectful opponents or teammates, but a lot of the time you can expect them to be real mean, rude, and disrespectful to you and others. Best thing to do is just keep your head up and keep trying for victory. Always play to have fun and don't pay attention to leaderboard ranking. Come be a positive part of the community and join me and my friends on Twitch. We're a tight crew and try to keep the community as positive as possible.			"

												Almost 600 hours played and first review ever.Nauts was a fantastic game. The community has good and bad seeds and good and bad players. I, for one, can say I've made a ton of friends that I regularly talk to in Steam even if not playing a game together.The new patch completely and utterly destroyed the game. It punishes poorer team comps, slower build team comps, and non-premades. Never have I seen a game that REFUSES to let you win if you have 1 poor performer on the team. You can't save them or carry them -- they literally cause the enemy team to be on God Mode. Worse, I can't even enjoy it. If I play with a premade, we steamroll the other team. There's no competition; there's no chance of a comeback. If I'm playing a premade, there's no hope. We will be steamrolled. It's a zergfest. Get 3 initial kills and 0 deaths as a team, basically auto-win button. I HATE rage quitters, but what is the incentive to even stay in matches if you're guaranteed to lose?Worse, why didn't Ronimo listen to the community? Who infleunced this misguided ship?If you want a mass exodus, by all means -- keep the game the same; If you want to create competition and engagement -- change it. If you're trying to stop turtling, perhaps nauts who refuse to leave their turret for 60 seconds start taking a 'Death DoT'. If, XP is your bread and butter, then remove all damage dealing skills and make everything about building characters to different utility functions. Better yet, bring 2.12 back and create an XP system in Nauts 2 that you have time to test and understand without public outcry. We did not want this. I have sadly, uninstalled the game. Best of luck Ronimo.			"

												You will play solo vs a premade.You will play vs vastly better opponents every single time when you have a lesser experienced player on your team.You will win 50 games to get 10 ranks only to lose them thanks to a single losing late join.You will play vs Australians, Chinese, Madagascarians, Martians and other beings from distant worlds which will deal damage to you and kill you with a swell 5 second delay - no dodging for you!You will play solo vs a premade.You will get frustrated, start adding people to play together, and they will join - without asking - the opposing team!You will play vs a dude who keeps taunting, deserved or not, like he bound his left mouse button to the function, you will turn off the game sound forever only to keep seeing ""Enemy taunts you!"" written in big letters on your screen regardless!You will face imbalance, questionable design choices and constant quirks that emerge after every hotfix only to be left in for weeks after appearing.You will trashtalk, swear, learn sarcasm, be sarcastic, learn bitterness, be bitter, learn saltiness, be salty, you will overcome that, stop being toxic and still shout at your monitor - ""WHAT THE F**CK?"".You will keep getting invited to out of region games by that one dude who added you out of the blue even though you told him you can't handle the ping.You will premake and play vs players who haven't yet figured out which button is which skill.You will have fun, or hope you will next match, because it will be challenging, or at least, fair, or at least, i don't know? There will be a next match, won't there?But would i do it all over again?			"

												A constant love-hate relationship characterizes the gameplay of pretty much everyone that has played awesomenauts competetively. Scanning the game's official forum tells you why. This is a beautiful game that is marred by some flaws. A 2-D side scrolling moba with an array of characters greet you when you play this game.Pros- Beautifully drawn characters and environment.- New updates every 1-2 months.- 19 awesomenauts to choose from. - 4 maps and different game play modes.- Replay system / Tournaments.- Great for casual play in leagues 3-9.Cons- Horrible matchmaking.- A disconnect will drop you 200 ranks.- If you're in a premade with good team members you can pretty much stomp everyone.- If you play solo you'll get to league 2 or the bottom of league 1 and matchmaking will eventually drop you a couple of ranks.- Sucks for competitive play.- Those who play on the worldwide network (like me) will be matched against those that want to play within their region. This causes a lot of friction in the community. Most Asians can deal with the lag but others cannot.The reason I stopped playing this game was because I was tired of facing only 2 possible outcomes1. You play in a premade and no one can stop you. Stomp Stomp Stomp.2. You play solo and you get matched against duo or premades and your teams mates are in league 3-5.The game is awesome and you should check it out. As long as you do not take it seriously / competitively you'll love it. Fair competitive play is only possible with manual matchmaking.			"

												I have roughly 800 hours into this game and now ill uninstall it, AGAIN.The core game is really great, characters are great, artstyle etc.So I was hoping for change since it would be worth it.The sad truth is that its unplayable 80% of the time.Lags and disconnects are one of the biggest issue. Without dedicated servers there WILL BE NOT WAY to get rid of this. NO WAY TO PLAY THIS COMPETETIVELY!!!!!! This destroys about half the games you play since either your lucky and your enemy has the leaver / lagger or the whole game is unplayable with 300 ping favouring some chars which benefit from lag.The community is not excatly what youd call friendly so be prepared for ragequitters and lots of flames.Matchmaking does not feel to be balanced but this could be because there are very few players playing the game (as a result of the above mentioned) so often the matches are very unbalanced. This results in even fewer people playing etc...Combine all this and you have, again, a situation where you simply wont have fun playing this 80% of the time. If it works, its a good game. I cannot recommend it, sadly, and going to uninstall now and maybe forever.Come back when there are dedicated servers which will never happen because devs focus on new nauts and skins.Its a sad story of a good game taking forever to try to be playable but never achieved it, I wont waste any more time on this and neither should you, sorry :(Edit: Now even ""migrating host"" results in disonnect 50% of the time, besides other major bugs. Cant change this review to positive even with the new patch. Bugs and Servers still break this game.			"

Disclaimer:Please don't feel offended by my review. We all have different opinions and there's no reason to fight over it. If you don't agree with me, that's fine. I'm not trying to convince you to change the way you feel about the game. This is just my opinion.Review:With close to 1300 hours played over two accounts I used to love this game. A simplistic side scrolling MOBA that's very easy to get into, what's not to like? A lot of time was spent in the game, I made friends and we had lots of fun. Unfortunately, as time passed the flaws of the game were revealed.This game actually favors people with poor internet connections and if you don't have a bad internet connection you might as well simulate one to gain unfair advantage over your opponents. How is this possible? Due to Ronimo being a small company they can't really supply dedicated servers so they designed the game for p2p networking. You have the option to queue in different regions, same or nearby would be recommended. It doesn't matter though, if someone feels the need to queue worldwide (maybe because lack of players) they can join you no matter what your settings are. It gets frustrating real fast playing an opponent with over 300 ms of latency. They can actually pick a naut that favours their ping to get the upper hand because it gets impossible to dodge certain skills because you can't anticipate where a projectile might be on their screen and before you know it you've been hit. If someone choose to queue worldwide you'd think it'd be more of a challenge for them because of latency but it's really the other way around.And if they don't have high latency they might have packet loss and that can actually trigger effects on abilities multiple times. There's a naut that has the ability to pull other nauts to him using his tongue, if the player has packet loss he can actually tongue you multiple times and this is very frustrating. His client registers that he hit his ability but the packet was lost and had to be sent again and maybe a few more times.The design wouldn't be so awful if both players had a say in the matter and dedicated servers would make it even better and actually favor players playing on the right side of the globe.Networking issues aside, the matchmaking could also use some work. Solo queuing is ok but can be a terrible experience since players can just leave the game without any ramifications. If the player hosting the game crashes and the host migration fails everyone gets a loss. Some maps end in single lanes which makes a choke point and favors nauts that can turtle and just delay the game for as long as possible.edit:I quit playing this game because it was actually making me rage. I still occasionally play the game for the sake of ongoing tournaments and to keep in touch with the friends I made along the way. The game still has flaws, some of them being addressed (slowly). Until all of the major issues have been resolved I will not recommend this game.It's a lot of fun to play when the stars align, but whenever people lag (be it due to connectivity issues or if it's intentional) it ruins the experience completely.

												My playtime in this game is probably enough to tell you tell that I've really enjoyed it. Awesomenauts is a MOBA played in 2D . I picked the game up a few years ago and I still find the game fun to play.At the start of a match you pick a character. You have the usual classes you find in MOBA:s, such as rogue, tank, support and so on. Every character has their own set of skills and items you get to pick from at the start of the match. Characters and items are unlocked as you level up your account, which is fairly easy to do and comes naturally as you play. The characters in the game all look great I think and they really fit the flippant feel of the game. As always there are some balancing issues for a time after a new character is released, but for the most part the characters are pretty well balanced and only your skills determine how tough a fight is going to be, not bad balancing. You will learn how to play most of the characters pretty quickly although there are some characters that require more practice to master them, as is common in most games like Awesomenauts. It wouldn't be much fun otherwise. The ease of learning the basics of the game means that you can get into it pretty quickly and with so many characters with very different playstyles you will want to try them out and in this game you're able to do that in very little time.Matches usually last about 20-30 minutes and if a player disconnects from the match then another player can immediately jump into the game, which is something that I really like about the matchmaking system in Awesomenauts. The possibility to join ongoing games means that a team where a player disconnects isn't necessarily crippled, as is often the case in other MOBA:s. To win a match your team needs to destroy the enemy team's base. To do that you have to push through one or two lanes where turrets need to be destroyed in order to process further. Nothing out of the ordinary here. Mobility plays a big role in Awesomenauts. Not all characters are fast and not all characters have skills that help them escape. This means that when you play as the slower characters, typically the tanks, you will need some knowledge of the layout of a map in order to be able to escape. The importance of mobility is something I really like about the game.I think that the larger part of the community is pretty friendly, but that could just be because most players tend to not say anything in matches. Ragequitting is very common (or at least it was back when I still played) but other than that you'll probably not have any problems with other players.TL;DR: I would definitely recommend Awesomenauts to people who like this kind of games. Just watch a few videos of it and you should be able to tell if you would enjoy it.			"

												Replayability: As of writing this review, Awesomenauts has stolen over 750 hours of my free time, and it is bound to rob me for many years to come. With the multiple match ups (meaning how good certain characters are against other certain characters, on a scale of equal player skill) no session has ever felt the same.Arenas: I cannot compare it to the likes of DOTA or LoL, since I havent played either, but coming from someone whos played the likes of Powerstone 2 for the Dreamcast, I can tell you that this game offers a robust experience. The arenas are structured in such a way that allow you to go miles by taking an inch. Characters: The prime beef. Ronimo takes a bit of slack when it comes to balancing certain character traits and abilities, half of which I would say are very much deserved, but at the end of the day using the character in a way that outplays your opponents strengths and capitalizes on there weaknesses will outrule any match up against you. You are bound to find a character, if not half the cast, to your liking~Single Player: There is none. This game will not engage you if not played online. Future DLC will patch in alot of match customizablity, so I cant say much on how they will integrate it, but not including the Starstorm DLC, I would not reccomend this game to anyone who is timid of the online environment.Art: The game is advertised to look and sound like a Saturday morning cartoon. The Musical Score matches this, with catchy rhythmic beats that loop in the background and character specific that play ala reward for killing sprees. The graphics, not so much. Dont get me wrong, the sprites are colorful (albiet small in relation to everything else on screen, but still packed with personality) and the levels looks gorgously bright and tell a story, but the only thing ""Saturday Cartoon"" about it is the intro video and character portraits. Still, you get what you get, and if youre a fan of the child friendly art style, you wont be disappointed.			"

												A great entry level ""Moba"" game. Awesomenauts with its quirky characters, ""saturday morning cartoon"" art style, fast-paced gameplay and diverse skills offers a unique blend of accessibility, configurability and depth, making it an ideal choice for those who want to sink their teeth into the Moba genre.I have to admit though, the game is still not a 100% balanced and for some characters, there is little to no variety in builds that are viable when it comes to competetive play. Be ready to be stomped by certain builds that excel on certain maps frequently. Nevertheless, while frustrating at moments, at 20-30 minutes per session, you won't have to spend too much of your time in ""those games"".			"

												Awesomenauts is based on the premise of casual competition. It is designed to be fun. An interesting result of that is the lack of a real consequence when somebody quits your team. He is replaced by a bot that is often more competent than himself and continues to play in his stead. Another player can join mid-game to replace the bot at any time.Awesomenauts also has a great community (official forum, not Steam). It has a thriving fanart community, a modding one, a tactics one, etc.This game really opens itself up to modders. It allows creators to modify in-game bots and make their own using an AI editor. Modders can also create gamemodes using this tool. If Ronimo likes a bot, it can find its way into the official game.Overall, I highly recommend Awesomenauts. It has a thriving community that you should not miss out on. The gameplay is very fun, if less competitive than its other MOBA counterparts. All that is lacking is you.			"

												A truly amazing game. The imagination of the developers is wonderful and they have a great sense of humour and the way they have put this game together as an indie developer is nothing short of excellent. The gameplay is reminiscent of Super Smash Bros, and is an instant recommend for anyone who enjoys that series. Like Smash Bros. it is both light-hearted fun and can be very competitive, easy to learn and hard to master.There are problems, however. Balancing a multiplayer game can be difficult and is never perfect, and the maps do have some annoying gimmicks. The matchmaking and Leaderboards are kind of broken and are meaningless to most, don't let that get to you and random teammates can be bad mannered.But, I believe the core game is worth it 20 times over the problems, and would suggest anyone to give it a try!

IMPORTANTNot recommended to buy this game unless you are from EU or NA. Awesomenauts was a great game that offered a unique 2D moba style gameplay, as well as countless hours of fun. The game has lost a lot of its spark since 2012 release. Balance and matchmaking problems start to become noticeable as you become more familiar with the game. This is ultimately just a casual game though, which I guess is justifiable.While at a slow pace, this game is still being updated. Unfortunately however, the most recent matchmaking update has caused this game to lose a lot of its playerbase. Being an Australian player, it has been very difficult to find matches and constantly being placed in bot matches is just disappointing. For me, the game is no longer playable.I hope that future updates will be able to save this game.			"

Note: If you DO NOT live in an European or American region, the matchmaking system will be hard to tolerate in this game. Now that patch 3.3 is out, I've had enough time to get my opinion on the update everyone was waiting forAwesomenauts is a fast paced 2D side scrolling MOBA with 26 character (soon to be 27) all of which have unique & interesting playstyles. I never could get into MOBAs such as DOTA or LOL as I'm not keen on the RTS genre. When this game first came out, it was a breath of fresh air into MOBAs & I really like the idea of a side scrolling MOBA as it's one of my favorite genres. I'll start of with what I liked about the gamePositives: - Great artwork- Catching music- 2D platforming MOBA (I honestly really wanted to play a 2D sidescroller MOBA)- All characters have difficulty levels to indicate new players on their choicesIssues & problems the game has suffered fromI really liked this game when it first came out & I really want to play it now but ultimately the downfall of this game is the negatives of this game which is a combination of A LOT of factors. Now before I go into these negatives, I'll give you a summary.- Bad paywall system & why it can't even be free to play- Lag & connection issues- The terrible matchmaking system prior to update 3.3- Devs & the community- Rapidly decreasing playerbase- The Overdrive update (game's last chance in a sense)- Where we're at nowHorriffic bad paywall system & why it can't ever be free to playYou know the big well known MOBAs like DOTA & LOL are free to play? Well it would make sense in a marketing view to make a lesser MOBA free right!...Right? No? Oh, ok then...You'll have a very tough time standing out then. Oh well, at least you get ALL the characters when you buy it rather than 2 DLC containing 33% of characters which cost just as much & is the same price as the game-Oh wait WHAT!? Goddamit...Maybe you should wait unti it's free to play? Sadly, this game can't go F2P despite how much I want it, no system in place to keep you staying (e.g. free premium skins for playing long enough or an in-game economy), player numbers don't go that higher during F2P periods making a super huge risk the devs just can't afford to take. Lag & connection issuesThe company that made this game are independent developers so they don't have the most amount of time, resources & money to make a MOBA as big as DOTA/LOL. They made this game peer-to-peer as it was not feasible to host servers which means that if you're playing with someone with a huge ping indifference it REALLY changes the game & usually for the worst. Just watch this & you'll understand. I can understand why they used the peer to peer model, game wouldn't exist if they used another method.


YouTube™ Video: Awesomenauts - Lag is OP 

			Views: 1,021		

			A demonstration of what lag can be like. The only video editing done to the clips was to block names and add text. Nothing was done to make the lag seem worse than it was in the match.		

The matchmaking system was terrible beforeIf you've gone through reviews written last year, it's no surprise the majority of them talk about the shotty match making system (both good & bad). Remember the ping indifference? You had NO SAY what so ever if laggy people joined your game and there were so many huge skill gaps between teams matches, it was sad most of the time.  Devs & the communtiyThe community wanted a better matchmaking system (which is now patch 3.3) but the devs took a really long time, I mean a REALLY long time then they release the EXP system (patch 2.13) & it wasn't well received by the community. Patch 2,13 made a lot of players  take a hiatus until the new system was introduced. The bad matchmaking, EXP system & overdue constantly being pushed back new matchmaking is what hit this game hard the most between devs & players. Majority of community thought that the devs didn't listen & were interested in skins only.  The truth is that they were working super hard on it but being indie REALLY made it hard, the new system we have now was originally meant to here 1 year ago! Overdrive update:Now this was the update everyone was waiting for, like the second coming of Jesus for this game & when it dropped, current play base TRIPLED in numbers on that mouth, No more screwing around, devs promises that THIS update would have the match making system (& ultimately it was) but when it happened, people were♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ When Overdrive happened , there was no new matchmaking system! Turns out it was pushed back to patch 3.3 & this isn't fully the devs fault but they could of communicated it better. Unfortunately this was the finally nail in the coffin for the vast majority of veterans wanting to get back into Awesomenauts.Where we're at nowNow that the new matchmaking system is out, it's better don't get me wrong bad but it does have its downfall . One of the issues the playerbase were point out in both the forums is that the match making system is POINTLESS if they're aren't enough players participating & should introduce a F2P period for this game when it happens (they didn't FYI). Oh crap, turns out it was actually true. When this update happened, I rarely notice the difference in the old system, I'm still getting match with people far away from me because I don't live in Europe or America and player numbers JUST BARELY raised. Now it's safe to assume that Awesomenauts is at the end of its lifespan. The only thing left going for it is going F2P but it's either never happening or won't happen until a couple more years.Patch 2.13 - December 02 2015 (EXP system)Patch 3.0 - March 02 2016 (Overdrive)http://steamcharts.com/app/204300Well...That's it. I've uninstalled it & requested a permanban that I ask to never be lifted...I'm sad, you know? I really wanted Awesomenauts to succeed, spent $30 on skins but it just wasn't meant to be. At this point, only play it casually & with friends. Thanks for reading & have a good one.			"

												Okay, first thing's first: I hate MOBAs.I really hate them. The fantasy/myth/RPG styled theme, all the nonsense you need to cram into your brain faster than forgetting to study for a test and doing it last minute (I personally can tolerate that kind of stuff, but not with MOBAs) and the hostile communities make me hate them. Hate's a strong word, too. However, Awesomenauts is a significant turn for the better. Although the online multiplayer has its share of issues, Awesomenauts stands out from the rest and is what MOBAs should be like.GraphicsThe graphics are cartoon-like, with a cheerful (yet dark at the same time) atmosphere. No fantasy stuff here, Awesomenauts is a sci-fi theme and that's something worth seeing after the same old MOBA. I love the visuals for the game, and I see nothing wrong with them.GameplayThe gameplay is simpler at first for the rookie MOBA player. Shoot stuff, (attacking without abilities has a bit of a meaning now, hooray!) use your abilities to get an edge over the other 'Nauts, and much more. But then, when you get into it, you'll start analyzing your playstyle to suit your needs with that 'Naut, how to take on the opponent in a one-on-one, and more. Although I did experience significant amounts of lag that costed me quite a few deaths and also really bad matchmaking, the gameplay is still solid to me.StoryThe story is simple and straightforward. You play as an Awesomenaut (or Lonestar in the tutorial) and you need to destroy the enemy's Solar drill. Solar is crucial to your employer for an unknown reason, and you need to destroy the drill so you hinder the enemy's Solar supply. MOBAs are known for their lore, and although this game lacks lore compared to other MOBAs, Awesomenauts doesn't fit in the category of a fantasy/RPG world like this.AudioThe audio is probably the key point to the game. The music (especially the theme song, just play the trailer if you haven't done so already) is outstanding, and the themes really get into your head. My personal favorite themes are Froggy G, Yuri, and the new character Scoop. The voice actors did an OUTSTANDING job with playing the characters and don't seem all bold or shrouded like most MOBAs do. Each one has their own personality that makes them unique from the others, and if I'm not mistaken, popular Youtuber TotalBiscuit even voiced one of the characters (Vinnie and Spike I believe) which I found pretty interesting. The audio overall to this game is near perfection, and I feel empty inside without those ""awesome"" songs.ReplayabilityThe replayability is pretty massive. I don't want to touch up here much because it's a MOBA. Its easy to get hundreds of hours logged onto a MOBA.For one thing though, Awesomenauts has some major pros that don't fit into any of the five main categories. The developers are dedicated, for one. They constantly release updates and even do some charity work. Check out Lonestar's Private Mels (?) skin. A kid came in from the Make-a-Wish Foundation and made his own skin for his favorite Awesomenaut. The updates keep on rolling in, and the most recent (as of this review anyway, 2.7 in case you're wondering) introduces Scoop, buffed every character in the game, gained a new main menu, and so much more it's better I keep my mouth shut. One more thing though that sets Awesomenauts apart from the rest is that the community is much, much, MUCH nicer compared to the other MOBAs. You don't get yelled at for screwing up, you actually GET help when you need it, and so Awesomenauts makes me feel comfortable when I get on.VerdictIn the end, Awesomenauts may be in my least favorite game genre, but who cares? Awesomenauts still got a thumbs-up from me. Aside from a few online flaws, Awesomenauts is a game that fails to disappoint me, and is one amazing adventure not worth missing.Graphics- 9.5/10Gameplay- 7.5/10Story- 7/10Audio- 10/10Replayability- 9.0/10.:8.0/10:.+Nice community+Caring developers+Outstanding voice acting+Unique style, executed well+Catchy theme song +Easy to learn but hard to master gameplay done right+Awesome cast of characters+Unique character themes-Lags frequently-Awful matchmaking-Ranking is meaningless			"

												I'm sad to add my hat to the pile of negative reviews. Awesomenauts always had a unique sort of charm to it. It's likely the first online game I invested hundreds of hours of my life playing. Ronimo were also the first developers that I really wanted to support. I followed all the streams, bought nearly all the skins as they released and gave 50 bucks to the Starstorm kickstarter.Unfortunately it's nowhere near as charming as it used to be. The UI used to have character and life to it and the devs kept ""updating"" it by removing or streamlining features. The shop redesign was the first thing to make me raise an eyebrow. Awesomenauts used to display all the items in a vending machine kind of setup where you could view all the colorful artwork for each upgrade. It clearly had a lot of love put into it. The new ""improved"" shop system was a transluctent sci-fi styled pull out menu with much tinier icons. While I understand Ronimo wanted to expand the amount of items per row from 3 to 6, they could have just drawn more space in between. There have been many other minor UI changes but that was the most saddening to see.On top of the life being drained from it, I have a lot of issues with the XP system they introduced back in September. That was the final straw for me. I tried for months to play the game anyway figuring it'd grow on me. It did not. I still can't fathom why Ronimo broke their own game so badly. Snowballing matches happened occasionally under the old system, but after XP was introduced they skyrocketed. The solar drops and respawn time on kills were already strong enough ways to gain advantage, but no. That wasn't enough. Now teams gain buffs to damage and health too! Ronimo also stated their intent was to speed up matches that took too long but that wasn't ever an issue to begin with. My most memorable matches were longer ones where the leading team changed back and forth. Games are way too short now and it's much harder to have a match you feel was worth the time spent.The XP system patch also needlessly complicated other parts of the game. Ronimo multiplied all health and damage numbers by 10 to make it seem like you were doing more. The problem with this is that every number displayed now has 1 extra digit. You can imagine how much this gets in the way during gameplay. I could tell day 1 that hindering every players view of the match was in no way a good enough tradeoff for bigger numbers. Sure you adjust to it but there was really no point in changing it to begin with. Reverting it could only improve on the issue, after all.You also used to be able to read how much damage you'd gain for taking an upgrade but the added percentage increases with the XP system make this old method impossible. Instead, every upgrade now states the increase as a percentage. This isn't user-friendly at all. In such a fast paced game where you need to be spending as little time as possible browsing the shop, it's incredibly difficult to tell at a glance how effective an upgrade will be when it's displayed as a percentage. I used to be able to see that I'd get 25 (now 250) extra damage per stage. Now your guess is as good as mine, unless you want to be bothered to calculate percentages as your turret continues to be shredded. I don't need to know the exact numbers sure, but a ballpark figure of what I'm capable of dealing would certainly be appreciated. Again with time you could memorize what does what. However, each character added to the roster makes this more and more of a headache.I sympathize with the developers. I really do. After putting in so much time and effort on a complete overhaul to the game's mechanics, it would be a colossal waste to revert the changes. That's the issue. Ronimo has its hands tied and can't as a company justify going back to the previous system. Unfortunately the game has to suffer for it. I had many great times with Awesomenauts but I cannot recommend this game anymore.			"

												FInally getting round to writing a review on this game. Ive played since the very beginning, across all platforms (Xbox 360, then PS3 then PS4 and finally PC). It has the groundwork of a great game, its just a shame it has been driven into the ground. From a team desperately trying to keep it afloat and make money off of it, who care more about making purchasable skins and adding P2W Nauts then actually making an enjoyable playable experience. This game has been out for YEARS, literally YEARS and it has 5 maps......5!! This game needs to be retired, I would be more than happy if they just shelved it and brought the Characters over to a new game and tried something completely different. For one 3v3 is dreadful, if you have one bad team mate, 90% of the time you arent going to win no matter how well you play. It's been plagued with server issues since day 1, its rife with laggy games and questionable hit boxes, funnily enough I have just switched in on for the first time in a couple of months to find they have released ANOTHER new naut (still the same old 5 maps though) and first game i try to get into (after a 7 minute queue time) hangs up at tha Character select screen and crashes. I gave it 10 mins, tried again, this time making it into the match only for a team mate to DC after 2 mins, followed by me a couple of mins later. I finally managed to get back into the game only for them to destroy my base while I am in the drop pod. But yeah, ""Awesome"" job guys, hastag sarcasm.Edit: Just thought i would update this. Nauts was recently on sale meaning a fair amount of new players bought the game. Thanks to Ronimo's ""awsome"" match making system, you can and will very readily get paired up with or against them, regardless of what League you are in. So there you are, finally in a game after a 7 min queue and one of you team mates hasnt got the slightest clue what he is doing, and just gets repeatedly destroyed 10 times in a row before quitting out of the game. Ahhhhh Ronimo, you are so clueless about your own game it is borderline offensive.			"

												Don't buy this. I say this with a heavy heart, because the game used to be fun. It had enormous potential as a new take on MOBAs. I used to really believe that. I even still believed it could be resurrected despite a rapidly dwindling player base and veterans fleeing the game left and right over the last years. I'm a sucker for a good redemption story.Alas, despite the incredibly long time they took to develop their new matchmaking (codename ""Galactron"" - game version 3.3), which many of us remaining players thought might turn this ship around, I am now forced to conclude that devs did not manage to fix the problems at the core of this game. In fact, as of right now, it's worse than ever.So, to put all this in context, let the nice uncle tell you a story about how things were a while ago. Specifically, what matchmaking used to be like.Basically, it was ""first come first served"" with very limited regard to how experienced (""skilled"") players really are and where they come from (""ping""). Thus it was entirely possible to get matched with/against players from across the globe (literally), or players who had picked up the game barely a week before. This is not hyperbole. This happened way too often for it to be coincidence. I have played this game for close to 3000 hours over the last couple of years (smurf accounts included), so believe me, I've been around the block. It means something when I say: the number of unbearable matches with either extreme latency or extreme inexperience was beyond counting.And it gets better: the devs directly and intentionally caused this situation, as regards high latency. There is/was a setting that let you decide WHERE your game client would look for a match. In other words, you could specify the maximum ""distance"" (=~ping) that would be acceptable for your matchmaking. Sounds great, no? It would be. Except, devs felt it would be unfair to actually enforce this setting. Unfair to all the people from remote areas of our planet, who would then have a more difficult time getting matches. So they came up with a truly unique solution: The setting only goverend YOUR client. If you set it up to be looking for matches as low ping as possible, that's what YOUR client did. But that didn't prevent OTHER players from setting THEIR clients to ""worldwide"" and thus join after you, for example. And of course, predictably, that is exactly what happened once out of every, I dont know, 5? 10? matches. Way too much. Did I mention, that the matchmaking ALSO didnt really care too much what rank/rating players had? Sure, it ""tried"" to get you a somewhat close match, but in reality that meant ""no more than 2 leagues apart"". A league is HUGE. To consider players 2 leagues apart is frankly a joke. And again, this is exactly what did happen.The old matchmaking had one advantage however. It ran entirely through STEAM. And Steam has a ""block all communications with user"" feature. After a while, Awesomenauts players figured out that using this would also keep players from getting into one's matches. So that's what we did. My blocklist grew to several thousand people from thousands of miles away. It was the only way to keep matches relatively free from 200+ ping.This worked alright for a while. But the game had other issues (esp. balancing), or not everybody knew about the blocking, or indeed wanted to make use of this ""trick"", resulting in more and more players becoming fed up with the game. Veterans quit. The game's population got thinner. Matches got worse. It was stomp after stomp after stomp then, and has been for the last year or so. But, at least you could block laggers and terrible players.That is, until now.The latest version - ""Galactron"", version 3.3 - finally introduced the supposed panacea for this game, the fix that would finally take care of imbalanced skill-matchmaking and horrible pings. Or so we were promised. It was in development for, I dont know, a year or so. It was finally released a few days ago. But already during the preceding public betas it became clear that devs could/would not deliver on their promises. Neither skill-based matchmaking nor ping-based matchmaking has improved for me. I have had to play with inexperienced teammates and against 300ms-players.The difference to before being that they can't be blocked anymore.But hey, as long as devs can develop a new DLC-skin, right? That's one final thing I'd like to mention: Devs of this game have a huge hard-on for graphics. If they put half as much effort into tracking down bugs, fixing matchmaking or getting the game properly balanced, as they put into making new skins and improving visuals, this game could have been a huge hit on the scale of LoL.Based on my considerable experience with this game, I can only regretfully recommend you do NOT buy this. Not even at a reduced price.I for one will keep checking in every now and again, to see if the situation is getting any better, but Im sad to say, it looks like this ""final bullet"" is a complete dud and my hopes are very low indeed at this point. To say I'm disappointed would be an understatement of some proportion.			"

												With +900 hours ingame and most of the DLC's,im gonna say something I've never expected to say:This game?I do not recommend it.why? well,wait,Im gonna say the positive things about this game,first the good then the bad,right?+awesome characters+amazing music+great maps+great effects +great artNow,the reasons of why I dont recommend to buy this game (at least for its full price):-Matchmaking,its broken-lack of servers,connection P2P (if steam dies,like every tuesday,every current game dies,and it counts like if you quitted a game)-Drop In system is broken,why? well,Drop In system is a bad idea already,but this game makes you join matches where there's a full premade,and no one in your team,well,its an 1vs3,needless to say that the premade already had advantage and started to destroy every turret-Said system can make you join LOST matches,where the enemy team is already destroying your core (They said its fixed,well let me tell you ITS NOT,I've joined a TON of matches after hte patch that ""fixed it"" and there were many where I lost as soon as I joined the match)-Did I mentioned the ""Region"" system? oh wait,I didnt...lets see,since the game lacks servers,the conection between players of a neighbour country can go from 80ms to 400ms,wich in regular servers in other games,playing with the same players only gives you a 10ms pingAlso literally anyone from any country can join YOUR game,that means you can be playing an almost lagless match but then a chinese or a colombian enteres you match,with their 400ms ping RUINING EVERYTHING The game says to have a ping-kick limit,but in my own experience you have to have +550ms to get your kicked by lag,and let me tell you,a 250ms ping is already,ALREADY,unplayable. (People with lag can move freely,killing you while you are behind your turret,because in their screen,you werent behind the turret)-The devs complains that there isnt enough playerbase to fix the matchmaking thingshowever the playerbase is becomen smaller and smaller with every day that passesand the devs denies to make the game f2p,or at least free for a few weeks (just like they did in 2012) So basically the game is having a really low playerbase,which doesnt allow the devs to fix the matchmaking problemsand want to know why the playerbase is becoming smaller? Matchmaking system.Now,I had many,tons of hours of fun,I meet a lot of new friends,I also make fan art for this game,like I said,the ""not so functional things"" are amazing and that's what attract me the most to this game,but the functional thing that makes it a MOBA is so broken,that I dont recommend to buy it.Its up to you,but if you still want to get the game,go get it somewhere cheaper for steam,9,99$ isnt worth AT ALL.

												If DOTA and LOL isn't your cup of tea, please - try this one. It's unique 2D MOBA centered around aim, map awareness, teamplay and old-school platforming. The plethora of characters with unique, well designed skills (each naut has 2 main skills assigned to 2 buttons + AA, jump and team commands - it's that simple, yet hard to master) and gameplay itself makes this game addictive and ton of fun. You can try different builds, every skill can be upgraded in a different way, same for AA and utility row (movement, more hp, regen etc.). Game is easy to learn, but can be frustrating if you're not paying attention, however there's replay recording built in and you can see what your opponent bought and how he outplayed you.			"

												I have over 1200 hours into this game and it is finally time to let it go. The community for it has dwindled from what it used to be, every new update just makes the game a little bit more laggy, and the new content the devs keep putting out isn't really worth the money in my opinion. They keep trying to push out new characters and new ideas that feel rushed and untested in the form of new dlc trying to keep alive something that is dying. It's sad to see you go Awesomenauts but to me this is no longer worth a purchase. The thumbsdown on this review is based upon the fact that the community for the game is dying out, and for a game that is only online competitive multiplayer you need a fan base to keep it going. I cannot forsee this game lasting another couple years before it is dead altogether.  Queue times trying to find a match are getting longer and longer. You should have bought the game when it first came out if you wanted the true Awesomenauts experience. It is not worth the purchase anymore.			"

												Awesomenauts has fantastic potential, but is not quite there. Tweaks to the balancing and AI will make this one a star.A clever spin on the MOBA genre that strips away the complications and nerdy presentation to create a fast-paced but deceptively complex action strategy game.Awesomenauts has a good and effective mix of genres: platformer, strategy and action. It also has a deep multiplayer with the approachability of a Saturday-morning cartoon.It's surprising just how well the MOBA formula adapts in a 2D environment, it might not be as strategic as others in the genre but it holds its own in terms of how fun the combat is. Special mention also goes to the sound design, very cool soundtrack and each character has their own little jingle, a small touch which I was impressed with, and on top of it all is the great voice acting which adds a welcome layer of charm to an already likebale game. Great concept, great gameplay, much faster-feeling and action-packed than games like LoL or Dota.A brilliant game that's well worth the small price tag.			"

												Awesomenauts,A fun, casual & cartoonish MOBA that is a blast to play alone and even better with friends. However, the game has a few MAJOR flaws that almost ruin the entire game and cannot be ignored.Cons:-	LOW player base. In a game which is entirely against online players it literally becomes unplayable in non-peak times.-	NO dedicated servers. Causes many lag problems which is further complicated by the game being advantageous towards higher ping.-	UNBALANCED. Many balancing problems, especially every time a DLC is released. Also bad map designs and other problems such as snowballing.-	LATE JOINING. Yes, you heard me right, it is very possible to join a game literally seconds before your team loses.-	All the above problems have turned a once polite player base to salt.Pros:-	When you actually find a game with reasonable ping and non-salty players it can be quite enjoyable.-	Interesting cast of Nauts, no two are the same.-	Music and voice lines are very entertaining and enjoyable.-	Lots of replay-ability, assuming of course you can actually find games.Verdict:A fun, interesting game brought down some rather large problems should have been resolved YEARS ago. If they made the game free and upped the price of DLC the player base would grow and solve the most major problem of being unable to play the game. I cannot recommend this game in it's current state although with a few small changes they could fix the large problems and create a more ""awesome"" game.Worth getting on sale or if it does go free, if you are in any way serious about MOBAs steer clear.

												Literally a dead game. Game had a good community and was alive pretty well during the era where TotalBiscuit was promoting the game as he lend his voice for Vinnie & Spike.While this game was made back in the day before MOBAs became an all-time high played gaming genre, Awesomenauts was received very well as a fresh and unique game. Which it still is today except for the forced mechanics from similar MOBA's like the EXP (alternatively, the ""you will never make a come back"") system and other tidbits (""down the throat"" competitive) that only did the game more harm than good when there were bigger issues, like stability in games due to peer 2 peer hosting.Now, with MOBAs like Dota 2 and League of Legends being at a very high popularity, Awesomenauts should also adapt in terms of what is paid and what is free. The free characters that are released once in a while are obviously good and are of high quality as other characters, but there is no reason for characters to be behind a pay wall, especially in this current era with games like League of Legends and Smite where you pay for convinience which is skipping the grind to unlock all the champions/gods.Just make the game free to play already or release all the characters for free, Ronimo. While it is obvious that the game should be profitable for it to keep receiving updates, people are not going to take a competitive MOBA-genre game seriously that is pay to play with characters locked behind a paywall. The skins are not the problem, it's the paid content behind a paid game that is a problem for the many of potential new players that will look at this game and turn away or buy it on a sale and never touch it again after playing 1-10 matches. It has only been losing players with some ""spikes"" during big updates/sales which have been lost at a faster rate than the mentioned spike.[steamcharts.com] "

												Awesomenauts is a combination of 2D platform/side-scroller with a MOBA (3v3), which creates an interesting combination that turns out as a very enjoyable experience for people who are fond of both genres. Like most 2D platforms,  the main mechanics are simple and it's very intuitive, which makes it easy to learn the basics of the game. It's also similar to 2D platforms in how fast-paced it is, and how much it values reaction times.  However, it also has some of the depth of MOBAs; there are several characters to choose (16 so far and counting), each one with 2 unique abilities and a different set of possible upgrades to choose for your builds and item routes. This combination results in a game that's simple yet fast and competitive. In regards to some specific contents of the game: The developers are active on this game, they produced 15 characters and 4 maps for the base game, plus microtransactions for skins (which doesn't have any impact on the gameplay itself). They'll be releasing an expansion now (currently on beta/early-access) and expand the game from that point on, so if you want to get access to all present and future features (which so far we know are extra characters, maps, spectator mode and custom-setting games), you'll want to buy both the base game and expansion, which is actually really cheap if you buy it on Steam sales or related stuff. The balance of the game is not top-notch but it's pretty good regardless. New players might feel some characters are OP and whatnot, but once you get used to them you'll realise all of them are pretty much playable and none is ""game-breaking"".There's a big ""luck"" factor in the game. Players are not forced to play a full game and teams aren't required to be full to start and continue games (which means you can find yourself alone with 2 bots in your team vs 3 human players, although this doesn't happen often). Players are allowed to leave a game (although they'll be punished by losing ranking points), this happens very frequently, specially on losing teams, which can be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥for both teams (losing teams with bots frequently have no chance of winning, on the other side, you can be on a winning team and new players will join the game and make a comeback).  You don't know the map you'll be playing either, which is a problem because some characters have a bigger advantage on certain maps. You don't know what characters the enemy picked either. There's no separated queue for premades and solo players, which is also annoying for a lot of people.The game netcode is p2p (so, no servers), this is annoying for a lot of players because you won't experience ""input lag"" (any actions you'll perform will be instantaneous in your screen), but you will experience a delay in actions of other players (basically you'll see that other enemies will hit you even when it looked like you were out of their attack/skill range). This means that you'll need to deduce the enemy intentions beforehand and estimate the true range of abilities and attacks on your screen based on the player's ping. Finding full matches is not a problem, and there's a decent amount of players online at most hours, so don't worry about buying a dead game (at least not yet!). There are a lot of players who'll want to play with you and it's easy to make ""queue buddies"".The pool of characters is not as huge as in LoL or DoTA, but all characters have clear differences and they're all fun to play. Character synergy and team-comps are very important and sometimes if you don't pick your character properly you'll find yourself with a team that is incompetent in teamfights or pushing.All in all, I think awesomenauts is a great concept and a very enjoyable game, specially for it's price. It's far from being a masterpiece because of it's issues, but despite that, it's a great experience and you'll have lots of fun playing it, specially if you play with friends.			"

												I was totally baffled when I launched this game for the first time. When I saw the store page, it looked like a boring old platformer, but my friend convinced me to buy it. This game is actually an immersing, high action multiplayer experience, with a lot of good things to look forward to in the future.			"

												It was a great adventure playing this game for over 2 thousand hours, but now it's time to move on because the game itself is unplayable in its current form.Since this review was posted, I haven't played 'Nauts for a few months (5 maybe). When I left this game, it was already a mess with a new level system that a good portion of the community (and it's not a lot people that still play this game - we'll get there) didn't like, including myself.Why was I still playing a game that was only going downhill? Friends! Yeah, for me, the greatest thing in this game was making friendship, I've met great people and a great portion weren't from the same country as mine, so although lag was an issue, it was still an enjoyable game when you're playing with friends, like any other!I used to play a lot with one particular friend that I've meet on this game, so it was always me playing with him hosting since this game has more or less a 200 peak of players per day, 200 people for a multiplayer is basically a dead game. It's 200 people over the globe, so it's easy to say that the majority of these 200 people are from the USA and I'm not from USA, so i had to deal with all the possible lag. We don't have a lot of games in common, so Awesomenauts was the only choice if we wanted to play together, and now this game literally ended our chances to play together since from the time i went away and didn't play, Ronimo released a major update that only tries to connect you with people from the same country/region. But how am I going to play a multiplayer game with only 200 peak players with people from the same country as mine? If before these changes were already hard to find people to play, now it became impossible.You can check for yourself on steamcharts.com or any third-party website that uses Steam's API to check playerbase from a specific game, to see how many players Awesomenauts have and how it's only a downhill from here (it is for a long time now). Why the developers didn't went F2P on this game it's beyond my imagination, because you could receive a lot more of attention/playerbase going from paid to F2P since they have a great talent designers that make awesome skins already.TL;DR: Want to buy this game to play as couch co-op? By all means, go ahead, it's a great game with great art design and soundtrack to playing with friends. But if you're expecting to play multiplayer online, it's better to search again for other games, this game is dead and it won't change if it doens't go F2P! "

												TL;DRNot recommended with the state of servers now especially if you don't live in US/EU======================================================================After 1,754 hours, from kickstarter to now, it used to be awesome (pardon the pun)to collect all the silly costumes, having all the heroes even having a special ronimo badgeduring game - knowing you were there when it all started...However like having a child, you have no idea how that child will grow up to be - you hope, you prayedyou wished the best for it, but sometimes it turns into awesomenauts and a little piece of you died inside...gee, first thing's first:Not in EU/US? forget about this game, they increasingly made it hard for people to find a matchA STABLE match, not just connect and reconnect sort of match - mind you.with that said:this is an awesome game with 2D elements brought into DOTA/MOBA styled gameplay injected withenough random elements on each levels to keep it interesting.The fact that maps are random and tons of nauts(heroes) WHILE having only 3 nauts(heroes) at any given timeon a team does give this game a ton of variety for how small the game is.Having 3 players per team also made your contribution to the fight much more apparent.Jungling is focused on regaining health most of the time, so you could - should you wish focus on pushingwith occasional jungle to get more health then hop back in the fight.Jungle is also a great place to ambush low health opponents looking for health pick ups.Occasional hazards in each maps keep the flow going from enticing solar induced greed from killing solar boss,fire from the walls, low gravity area, to a literal death void pits and teleportation makes for an interestingflow of battle. Awesomenauts still employ turrets(towers) at certain choke points that still helps peoplewho aren't used to awesomenauts style of gameplay focus on objectives.The nauts (heroes) are also varied with varied fight styles and they are all impactful on every fight.Even a single nauts can be played differently on each match depending on build and what you want to focus on.But with all the praise so far, the management side of things aren't doin too well...they increasingly focus less and less on the things you need to play, I remember back whenthey only had a play button like a literal play button - the connection WAS more stable back then, and noi wasn't playing with ppl near me at the time and it was a ton more stable and far more responsive net codeback then. Now what with ""VOLTAR's SERVER"" or whatever the name is, it's a lot less responsive, a lot slowerand it's very slow to play a game - i'm sure a ton of old players know what I'm talking about whenyou play a game, YOU JUST PLAY A GAME, not going thru hoops just to play a single game.Sadly with the current state of the game, I dare not reccomend a game - even as brilliant as this WAS, not is.

												The way I always try to describe Awesomenauts is as a 2D, action platformer MOBA. Ever since I started playing this game, it's a formula that I truly enjoyed in a way that I didn't enjoy something like LoL of Dota. What sets this game apart, from a mechanical standpoint, is that it has much more emphasis on manual positioning of both characters and skills, and that makes it much more challenging and interesting. Aesthetically it is very stylized and pleasing to see, with bright palets and a very well done soundtrack. The cast of characters is really unique and each has it's own unique skils that make them fun to play. And in my experience, both playing online alone (SoloQ) and coordinated team play are fun. Ronimo is always working on adding new characters, balncing them, and interacting with the community.The only true drawback from this game, in my opinion, is that the community playing it relatively small for a MOBA, which is a real shame. As a result, matchmaking can be problematic sometimes. Finding a match and filling one relatively quick is almost never a problem, but the problem comes in with the difference in skill level of the players in the games.I wholeheartily recommend this game to anyone who wants a different spin on a MOBA, wants a fun game to play with friends, or just wants to play a fun game.I also stream this game semi-frequently if you want to see live gameplay of it: twitch.tv/pyrocheese "

												I played this game a lot when it was much simpler, must have about 500 hours on it(different steam account+this one) and when lots of new maps and pay-to-play characters came out I felt like I was mising out on what Awesomenauts used to be.  I did buy the Starstorm expansion when I was crazy over this game(2-3 years ago) and it was more fun. I also felt like the game just gets boring after a while, because everything seems the same and it isn't like a whole new adventure every game.  As well as this, the mastery system seemed annoying as I could upgrade my mastery for a long time but I didnt because it would take 10 years for me to be able to unlock my upgrades again....just to reset them. So I stopped with the mastery system and I hope that it gets changed. sorry for the wall of text!TL;DR:Awesomenauts got boring after a while and I don't like the pay-to-play packs and I feel the mastery system is way too tedious.

												This game in a word. ""fun"" I honestly think this MOBA surpasses every other MOBA in the sense that it is by far the simplest and easiest to pick up. It also includes an old time retro feel to the mechanics. If you like Mega Man, Mario, Donkey Kong Country or Super Smash Bros, than this is the MOBA for you!It also has one of the best communities for any game I've ever seen. Especially for a MOBA. Most of the players are friendly people and the developers are always focusing on balancing and making this game more attractive to the eye. The DLC is reasonable, the game play is fun and engaging and it even has characters with high skill ceilings for if you want to challenge yourself. This is the sort of game you should pick up and try some time!			"

												Awesomenauts is a  2D Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, MOBA for short.  This game is available for €10, and offers you lots of fun for that price. You don't have to pay for anything else, except when you want to buy skins for the 15 awesomenauts. These skins are pure cosmetic, they won't give you an advantage in-game. So, what is this game all about? Well, you play as one of the 15 available awesomenauts and you have to destroy the enemy base. Sounds easy right? Well, to do that you have to fight your way through turrets, robotic minions and of course the other team. At the start of the game you try to earn some 'Solar', the gold of Awesomenauts, and buy upgrades for your awesomenaut with it. And you try to kill enemies of course. Unlike MOBAs like Dota or LoL, this game doesn't feature items or a leveling system. Aeesomenauts also doesn't have a laning stage, which means you can be ganked every 30 seconds. After a while, one team will have more upgrades and more Solar than the other team and they will push to the other teams base. And then of course destroy it.Verdict--------Awesomenauts offers a lot of fun, and in beautiful graphics. The game feature's Offline Training and allows you to practice with friends. It also offers ranked matches and 15 awesome awesomenauts.Awesomenauts will keep you behind your computer for at least 75 hours. If you want to collect every upgrade and get Prestige 10, you will be playing Ronimo Games little game for at least 150 hours.Score: 84/100			"

												Edit: Another paid expansion was added with more powerful characters locked behind a real money paywall. XP system added that was not necessary and leads to snowballing (the team that starts out ahead will stay ahead now). Playerbase could be toxic at times before, but seems more so now unfortunately. The players want servers not peer to peer player hosted connections, so developers do not add servers, but add powerful pay 2 win characters, more character skins, and an XP system that nobody asked for. End edit.Fun MOBA platformer with large amount of characters. Very good to play with friends.No dedicated servers, every game is hosted peer to peer. Terrible lag can happen often. Matchmaking is ridiculously terribly completely horrible. The top players in the world can be matched against the lowest 30%.The company that makes the game decided to do a kickstarter for a paid expansion. The amount the kickstarter generated exceeded the amount they needed to raise to make the paid expansion by over $200,000 United States currency. They are not adding dedicated servers.The average population of this (online only multiplayer game) on steam is at its lowest point now in april 2014 since 2012. Source: http://steamcharts.com/app/204300#AllAwesomenauts has the potential to be a super fun game that is held back by a dwindling population due to poor matchmaking, no dedicated servers, and a small player base.Personally I have experienced connection problems and random crashes in this game after some patches. These have affected some of my friends as well, but not everyone. They get fixed eventually, but are very annoying.Hope this game goes f2p, and gets dedicated servers, and a bigger playerbase! It was super fun to play in september 2013 when their were 4 times as many people playing as there are now.There are many cosmetic skins available for purchase in this game to provide revenue. Valve increased revenue by 12 times for teamfortress2 after switching to free to play.			"

Before there was a chance to make a comeback even if you were behind, but its much more difficult to win because of level.

												This is a game that honestly had a lot of potential. It's easily capitvating for most new players, the art direction is nice, it has charming characters, and has great music.But Ronimo took it in too many wrong directions. There's numerous balance issues that they've been too blind to fix and when they do actually fix them it creates new issues. Which means the meta is constantly changing and there's always going to be people who abuse this which can occasionally limit who I can safely play. When I'm in higher leagues I don't want to be discouraged from playing certain fun characters just because the enemy team picked an overpowered team composition, because at that point it's not fun anymore, it's just a chore to try to win.Also I would like to point out that there's STILL features from the starstorm expansion that we haven't gotten (Even after releasing the overdrive expansion), and it's been what, 2 years? They hyped up the Starstorm Map so much and said it was gonna be super unique and have all these cool features, and we finally DID get it, but it was a bit underwhelming. It's certainly a well-designed map, but honestly I was expecting a lot more, considering how long it took to actually MAKE it.Then we have the upcoming Happy Matchmaking Server, which is probably their biggest mistake yet. This is the kind of feature that would honestly work if the game had a larger player base, but something like this won't really do much for a player base thats <800. Their goal was to make this game a ""casual-friendly"" moba, but with the HMS coming up, it's pretty much becoming the opposite. And from what I've seen, the HMS itself doesn't seem to be fixing matchups that much, I've still been running into people across the world and people who are miles ahead/behind me in rank. The HMS as a whole makes me think they just copy-pasted from Overwatch, but forgot that they barely even have a fraction of the players Overwatch has.This is a kind of game you'd probably enjoy every now and then, but don't bother trying to actively play it, it's slowly fading away and Ronimo is too optimistic to see that.

Posted: July 1, 2014
												UPDATED: 4-11-2015Facts: Before I start the review I want to state a fact, so that this review is not entirely based on my opinions. The player base went from 228,886 players in season 5 (Sep. 2013) to its current player base of 24,889 (4-11-2015) for a reason. That is a 920% decrease in the number of players. Also not all of the 24,889 players actually play the game on a regular basis, that is just the number of players that have played at least one match. If you check the reviews on steam most of the negative reviews are written by people who have 200-1000+ hours in the game and used to love playing it. Just keep that in mind before you buy this game.Credentials: I have put over 580 hours into the game as of this review. I am a fairly high tier player and go back and forth between leagues 2 and 3, this means I have a good amount of experience in higher tier matches. First I will list the pros then the cons and then additional information. I do not consider the additional information to be a pro nor a con, I am just providing it for those who are still considering getting this game.PROS:-The graphic art and animations are great, and work well with the side-scrolling nature of this game.-The characters are very unique and have cool abilities that give each character their own personality.-The fighting in this game is very fun, it feels alot like smite had a baby with super mario bros.-The abilities (upgrades) menu is very well done, and allows the player to counterbuild the enemy team.-The leveling in this game is extremely simple. It is based off of collecting solar (currency) for player kills, turret kills, etc. and spending the solar in order to by abilities. This makes the game good for players that are new to this genre of game, and also provides enough complexity to entertain veterans to this genre.-The maps are well made. Each map has a unique feature in its center. For example one map has reduced gravity, one has a giant worm that can kill you, one has an invisibility orb, and one has fire that turns on and off throughout the match.CONS:-The matchmaking system is terrible. As a league 2 player I was frequently matched against players that were league 6-7. There is a huge skill difference between leagues 6/7 and league 2, this made matches boring for me and frustrating for new players. Also the matchmaking system frequently puts players in matches that have already started. It is no fun to join a match in which your team is already loosing by a huge margine.-The game is P2P. Players will constantly get matched against people with bad internet connection. This causes high latency and frequent packet loss. Since some characters do a ton of burst damage, if the player you are fighting has high latency, you can often be killed from 2-3 hit boxes away. The devs have talked about starting dedicated servers; however, they have been talking about it for over a year and still have not done it.-Some characters are inherently better than other characters. This means that you will often play against the same characters over and over again until the next patch makes a different set characters better than the others.-Players can die their way to victory. They do this by attacking the turret until they die, respawning and repeating over and over again. This is able to happen because certian characters do more damage to turrets than other characters. Also the abilities that these characters need to accomplish this are cheaper to get than other abilities.Additional Information:-Matches can last anywhere from 15-45 minutes.-Each character has 4 rows of abilities with 6 abilities in each row. When you buy abilities in the match, you can have a maximum of 3 unique abilities in each row (only 3 out of the 6 for each row of abilities).-The game is 3v3. This is the only option, there is no 2v2 or 5v5 like in some other MOBAs.-You have to aim your abilities with your cursor (or controller), they do not auto hit on click (much like smite).-The prestige system is optional. If you prestige, you loose all of your abilities and have to earn them back again. Some players will love this feature and some will hate it.I hope that this review has been helpful, and has given you a better understanding of what the game is like. I love what this game used to be and it is still very good in some ways; however, until the matchmaking is fixed, dedicated servers are added, and the game is balanced more, I simply cannot recomend this game. If you find this game on sale for $2 or less then it cannot hurt to pick it up. I would love to see the player base go back up and the game to be restored to its past glory.Please feel free to leave comments or questions in the section below, and I will get back to you as soon as possible.UPDATE 11/22/2016Not much has changed with awesomenauts, they have redone the matchmaking system though and it is terrible. Allow me to explain. You now que up for a match and have to wait anywhere from 3-6 mins (on average) to be put into a match. On occasion, i have actually joined a match and then got kicked from the match before I was  even able to choose my character. After i was kicked from the match i was given an error meesage that said ""unable to connect to host"". I was then prompted that if i did not rejoin the match, i would recieve a loss and been banned from matchmaking for a short period of time. No matter how many times i tried to join the match, i got the same message and was forced to give up and take a loss and time penalty for a match i never even played.TL;DR the new matchmaking system is broken and annoying. Avoid this game if you dont want to deal with the frustration.			"

												Genre - Cartoon 2D MOBAI purchased this game first a while ago on the Xbox 360 but didn't get around to playing it much. However, when I saw it on a Steam sale I thought I would give it another go.Having grown up in the 80s I find similarities with the music, characters and art style that remind me of the cartoons back in the day. Basically this game is a parody of 80s cartoons and brings with it much nostalgia as a result.The game is a 2D 3v3 MOBA and I think it is probably the best one I have seen, not that many exist to be honest. The characters and abilities are varied and there are several ways to interact with the maps to turn the tide of the battle. I have mainly played Bots at a difficulty I find a challenge  and have enjoyed the many games I have played, even when I lost.You unlock characters and maps as you progress at quite a rapid rate. Then you get to access extra abilities. This encourages you to play more games at once. Against Bots they last 10-20 minutes, which is great if you just want a quick game.It is a fun little game that will be enjoyed by all ages and you can easily increase the skill level if you want more of a challenge.There are costumes to buy and an expansion pack with new characters. The latter is tempting me, but I will see if I can wait for the next sale...			"

												Owned this game since release, and I've seen it go through many different iterations.I can no longer recommend this game because the developers failed to deliver on multiple fronts:- no dedicated servers, p2p matchmaking is TERRIBLE and the impacts of delay have always been horrid- imbalanced matchmaking for higher ranks because of a dead playerbase - I was routinely in the top 300-500 players when I was active playing back in 2013, and it got to a point where, because I was solo queueing, I could not win games to save my life as they'd be against full rank 1 premades with voice comm.- Starstorm expansion's features haven't been fully implemented, yet Ronimo had the gall to release another paid DLC for the game- Oh, and the addition of the EXP system a few patches ago was the final nail in the coffin. Does nothing to help the snowballing problem this game has always had, in fact it makes it worse because now winning teams can snowball on two fronts - a solar lead (allows you to buy upgrades to your character's kit), AND an xp lead for additional stat increasesSomewhere along the way Ronimo forgot about delivering a quality game and attempted to cash in on what little they've managed to deliver. It's a shame because the art and character style of this game is fantastic. Hopefully one day I can recommend this game again.			"

												About the only valid point you will find in the negative review is that you shouldn't  play this game outside of NA or EU, while I can't talk from experience it just seems obvious with a playerbase of this size. One other point that is made a lot is that matchmaking does a poor job at matching up players, the level to which these people expect the games to be fairly matched up are comparable to games with hundreds of thousands of cuncurent players. These people expect games to be perfectly matched up, player rating for rating. Matchmaking like this is unreasonable for serveral reasons; players will NEVER perform to the same standard every game they play, not every game is played on the same map or with the same heroes, some heroes are better against some worse against others, if everyone was always exactly equally matched up then games would last for ever with no winner.

												Moba meets platform.  This is well polished game with endless hours of fun.  At first glance you might think this is a childish game from its graphic and character, but it won't take you long before you realize how competitive it can get.  Champion build, team composition, and team work are all there from moba side of things.  If anyone is looking for semi casual Moba games you can enjoy with friends I'd highly recommend this game.  Just be weary of the DLC they can be addictive and expensive.Break DOWN!Superb controlsExcellent replayabilityGreat multiplayer match making systemScreen SHOTS!

												I wish I could recommend this, because the concept is great and honesly I'm impressed with the graphics and sound. The issue is two parts: 1. The devs seem to not care about balance (AVA), and 2. the game is dead. But yeah, it's a decent game but I really regret purchasing this game.			"

												I have spent over 150 hours in this game and used to recommend it to all my friends.  This is no longer the case:This game was so much fun till patch 2.1.3 when they brought in team exp.  Now if you have a poor player on your team you can't carry them or recover the game.  What's more, due to the imbalance that team experience causes, it seems like 9 time out of 10 games you join are ""in progress"" and you have joined the losing team as another player (or, more likely, ALL the players) on your team have left... the game they are in loses it's fun once the other team levels up to far.  It's like a revolving door of players.GET RID OF EXP PLEASE - IT HAS RUINED A REALLY FUN GAME.			"

												Upadted Review 30/08/2016Awesomenauts is a incredibly fun sidescroller moba, proberly the best moba in general ive ever picked up. :)(Pros)- Unique and Powerfull nauts to chose from, with there own powerful abilitys- Super Addictive- So much varity for skins and announcers - A 'Awesome' community! (most of the time)- Really fun to team up with your friends- Highly competitive!- A really creative and passonate community- Ultimate Skins ^^(Cons)- Lack of maps- Country Locks (prevents or makes it harder to play games with friends)- The xp system- Some Broken Hitboxes- A paywall for people to play, downsizing the community and keeping out fans who would love to play-  Can have a very arogant and toxic (Final Words)Ive played since the game was in its very early stages and i think the way its going is really cool, some bad points however is the lack of effort to bring in new players by maybe asking youtubers to do a massive competition. In my opinion and i think so many other share my opinion is that the core game should be f2p then the new players have access to by the skins and dlcs. This really needs to become a priority at the moment			"

												If you're new, STAY AWAY.The new XP update completely caters to veterans. Now new players are not just facing a skill/experience deficit, but you will do less damage and have less health than people who have been playing longer because they will get XP much quicker.If a new player and an experience player pick the same character, 5 minutes into the game the new player is going to have LESS health and LESS damage output than the experienced playerDO NOT BUY until Ronimo fixes this system			"

												Awesomenauts is a 2D platformer/side-scroller MOBA that pits players against each other in 3v3 arenas. It uses a very rich and creative formula that supports a distinctive MOBA experience.The basics of the game are very simple, every character class has two abilities, each assigned to a button of your choice, aside from the basic attack. Your objective, like in most games of this genre, is to destroy the enemy base, and to reach that base you need to get past turrets, which requires creep management and strategy. Killing other players and creeps awards you with Solar, the currency needed to purchase upgrades for your abilities. The gameplay is, therefore, very easy to learn and incredibly hard to master (which keeps things interesting).The similarities with other MOBAs end there. Character classes differ vastly from each other, not only in the abilities they possess, but also in their complex movement traits (some are fast, some are slow, some can jump high, some can hover in the air, others can fly). There is an enourmous variety as each ability's effects and the possible upgrades for each, which can lead to a lot of different possible strategies for a single class.Map design is clever. Currently there are not a lot of them, but clearly each and every map available was well thought of to allow for resourceful use of its elements both offensively and defensively. The map selected for a match can have a very high influence in its outcome, as you may excel in a certain map with a certain class and play poorly in another.The basic game options available are four: The quick match, which randomly selects players based on their League, the Practice mode, that allows you to practice with and against bots, Battle, which allows you invite friends to be your teammates, and Custom Game, which is available only for Starstorm DLC owners, and allows players to create a completely custom match, defining settings like starting solar, creep spawn rate, maximum number of bots allowed, and several other modifiers. Custom Games have two different game modes, aside from the classic mode (destroy the base): Team Deathmatch, which takes the bases away and the ultimate objective of the match itself is scoring kills, and Randomnauts, which is exactly like the classic mode, but each time a player spawns it gets a random awesomenaut with a random build (upgrades are randomly and automatically purchased as Solar is acquired).The audio in this game is superb. Every map has a background music that is slightly different depending on the class you're playing and every character has a theme song, a killstreak song, and a lot of fine voice acting lines. The SFX is also very, very well done. There is a handful of custom announcers available for purchase, as well.Cosmetically, this game features a lot of character skins (premium ones come with custom voice acting) which helps add visual variability to the experience, the only downside being the price (but if you like the game it is a nice way to support the developers!)My general impression is that this game is a must-play, even if you do not like the genre. It is almost guaranteed that you will like it, and even if you don't like, it is certainly worth the try.EDIT: The new party system and matchmaking are, in my opinion, great improvements for what was previously marked by me as downsides of this game, so I have removed those. I feel that the developers have even put quite some effort into tackling the balancing issue, and currently I have really no general complaints.			"

												The new xp update seems to many people to be a horrible addition. I see 90% of people who complain about it say that once a team gets a few levels higher than the other team, they automatically steamroll and win the game easily. This is clearly not the case if you play the game enough. The only reason that people hate the new xp system is that it makes it easier to see when games become unwinable due to bad teammates. The XP system doesn't change that fact, yet people are quick to blame it on the XP. What really needs to change is accurate matchmaking, yet other than that it's a great game.			"

												For the moment. I have to say no. I feel really bad for saying this. I feel like Ronimo tipped the boat too far on this new patch. I'm afraid that they may have to balance all the characters over again through their items and once AGAIN with the new EXP based system if Ronimo decides to keep it. Snowballing happens too quickly, Premades conquer pretty much everything and Solo Queing I feel has taken a big hit in how teamates are now even harder to work with and ignoring minions/droids within the lanes.Wait for the patch to be reverted or play through the tragedy with us.

												Really sorry to say that after so many years playing this game I'm done. The instability issue is unbearable, used to be annoying but now after i started to play a lot of other online games i found out that the problem wasn't my connection, it was the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""servers"" and the way that the game works.Pretty sad because the gameplay is amazing, is out of this world. But if u don't want to spend countless games with a red triangle reconnecting or being kicked out WITHOUT ANY WAY OF COMING BACK TO THE MATCH AFTER 4 YEARS u should stay away from this.			"

Game: AwesomenautsVery fuuun game, that is not ashamed to play, despite its graphics ""cartoon"" (if negative). There is good system throughput. Games like Dota2, game with 2D graphics. In the beginning of the game u have 3 characters, each of which has free music, the skills and the things, one of which you have to soak 3-4 huge turrets (depending on map), kill all enemy heroes and destroy the pump, which produces a local liquid mineral ""Solar"". I liked it & I think u will like it too. Maybe, someday we can all play? H&K			"

												Sadly, for anyone from Australia (including NBN connections), the online gameplay is an exercise in frustration. For a game that is based on matchmaking, the practical result is watching the promise of a next round connection tick past, whilst an explanatory popup message mocks you for being the poor connection.Edit (after another frustrating fortnight of trying):If you manage to make a connection, here’s what will happen:Because you are the slowest connection, your leader board progress will not count.OrYou’re matched with an all AI team, playing a token game against bots on the easiest difficulty.

												I didn't think it was possible, but bad matchmaking got worse.  They just removed a block feature.  On a P2P connection-based game that is unacceptable, especially when your matchmaking pairs people with people from across the globe.  You will never have a good connection with them.  Next, xp is an essentially just an extra snowball measure in place by ronimo.  It's poorly executed especially when most people solo-q.  I like the scale changes that came with that patch, but xp should be time based and even for both teams.  Balancing is so shaky (it was already iffy before), but it is clear now that ronimo cannot keep up with all the characters.  Every patch there are clear characters that perform better than others.  People constantly complain about the game being pay2win (which I would argue against (you benefit more from lagging actually)), but now i question that stance with a new ted skin which makes his attack practically invisible.Tons of glitches are present as well (some are hard to tell if it's because of lag or whether Ronimo jsut can't code)The only thing that is worth playing about this game is the gameplay itself, but Ronimo throws every obstacle it can at you to prevent you from experiencing it.

												Managed to crawl past 3000 hours and I can say for certain the game has no future, it has gotten progressively worse after starstorm expansion, then the XP system. Play it as party game because I have never seen such bad balance in any game before with zero sense of direction. If you want to get good at a game that has a future instead of wasting 3000 hours like I have to find that this doesnt, then I suggest you keep looking. Had huge potential but ruined its about as passive as a floppy weiner. The characters do not even need to aim and they are far better than most of the cast! "

												You die and one of your teammates rq ? Enemy team destroys two turrets and now your base is openHad a bad day and thinking of playing a game? Why not join a late game where your base is at two bars and enemy team is already attacking itYou think enemy naut is far away from you and cannot hit you? Enemy naut uses 500+ ping and it is super effective.You are winning a game? Game crashes and you lose rating anway.Some details:Well, the game is designed for those top 500 or so who are very experienced and when they play, they will play with people within their league who care about their ranking and who won't rq. My rank is somewhere at 1800-2500, it is rare to play a game without an rq. In this game an rq is not a joke, if you die and one of your teammates rq, your base will be open. The design is flawed, there is no pause possible in the game to wait for a new player, so what actually happens, your teammate rq's, a new bot replaces him, two turrets are down, enemy team attacks your base, bot is mid clearing some droids. Then a new player joins. At that point, it is very hard to comeback, the newly joined player, will lose ranking for no reason and you as player, who endured the game so far, will even lose more ranking because the newly joined player gets gold advantage over you (so if one of your teammates feeds and rq's, you get double punished)Well I don't care much about ranking, but when the game disrespects ranking and punishes you for no reason, then ranking starts to lose its meaning and people will rq without caring too much. The game is fun if:-You are among the top ranked players-You play custom games with friends-You play competitive with teammates whom you knowThe game is not fun if:-You are somewhere in the middle (you play from time to time)- You are a player who doesn't rq			"

												Game is fun and great to play to pass the time. Matchmaking	HOWEVER, that does not mean crap when it's your second game and you're put against 3 players that are AND were in the top 10 ranking... 3 times in a row. If you're a new player, this is like Dark Souls but with High Ranking players as the bosses and you dont have any equipment with only 1 game under your belt. Much like Quasso's review, the match making, as the game puts it, is completely ""Zorked.""""But you only have 10 hours under your belt."" Yea, but that's 10 hours of facing players in the top 100 while I have what, 1-20 games under my belt. There was only ONE game where I was placed with people further down the list and even then they were still 1000 ranks above. I was REALLY hoping it was just because the game was trying to figure out where I am on the ranking list but even then after finding out where I placed I still fight the top 100 of thousands.""Get gud"" Yea because I'm forced to choose 2 things with this game: Spend 100s of hours just to be decent and maybe shadow the higher rank players or just lose 20 games in a row. Winning isn't everything but I'll tell you what, it's not fun losing every game you enter.Even if I continue to play this game, the Community here will just call me out on doing poorly. ""I'm new"" means nothing to those elitist kids like come on.It's such a huge shame when this game is fun to play but if I can't learn to play it or adapt to these top 100 players play styles then there's no point in me or others turning this game into a ""chore."" to get better at this game.Until the ranking system is better I haft to agree with the top review. Fun as hell to play especially with friends, but the matchmaking is god aweful. Balancing	As to be expected, the DLC characters have beefier stats than the base characters. This is simply because if there was no true incentive to buy the DLC, then there would be no need to stray from the free characters you get in the first place.This happens all the times in games with DLC characters such as League of Legends. However, League of Legends demand for a new character is often due to his/her new and unique playstyle rather than pure stats. You can still very much outplay some one with a DLC character but they have more leeway with making mistakes and their stats. However, even talking with some experienced players in the top 100, they say their stats are unbalanced but can still be overcome.This goes back to the first issue however. If a more advanced players uses a DLC character, they have the advantage of the stats and skill over just skill itself as it should be.This is a minor issue to be honest but an issue non the less. Client Side Hosting and its problems	Unlike a lot of other games, this game hosts games VIA Peer to Peer server hosting, or client to client hosting. A majority of my games are met with having 400-600 ping (On average, even connecting to someone in the UK from California, I'll have 80 ping at the most!!) and if the host is on the other team, his moves will register just fine while yours will have a delay. This makes skill shot characters almost useless. Some people as hosts can abuse this with something called Lag Switching: A simple program you can set up to purposely put a heavier load on your Modem, giving you higher latency.Also on the rise recently, I have been in a few games that a host has forced others to disconnect through a hangup program or a DDP (Direct Distruption Program) that forces other IPs or connections to disconnect from them (The Host). Ironically, these are the games I have had the best ping with (24-50). I have reported both cases and one has resulted in a VAC ban so at least this problem is being taken care of... at a snail's pace.This ONLY happens with a Client Side hosting system such as in this game. These hackers would haft to DDoS them which is more difficult to do if the game had its own servers.Hopefully I'll play you again later Awesomenauts.			"

												Lack of dedicated servers makes this game unplayable with random people. Most of the time you will be forced to play on a server that is hosted by some kid with a modem made out of wood. If lag wasn't bad enough, host will probably rage-quit if you beat him too hard.If you plan to play with bots and friends only, by all means, get this game.This game is a really fun to play 2D dota-like game, but without proper multiplayer, I can't recommend it.

												Awesomenauts was fun when I first started, and as most games in my library can attest, I played it off and on for a while before I moved on to other games.When I came back to this one, however, I found the game I once enjoyed casually was no-longer receptive to my casual-style approach. I tried playing for almost 4 hours before I resignedly-uninstalled, unable to enjoy the game's casual matchmaking for the sheer lack of fun.I was paired with the same 3 people each match, usually 3v1 while bots made up my team. We were destroyed time and time again, with new players connecting only to disconnect after seeing how one-sided the match was.Sorry Awesomenauts			"

												Awesomenauts is a great game with friends, but you can also play it alone. A match lasts about 15 minutes, so it's a good game when you have a little bit of spare time. Matchmaking was recently improved, so you should find lobbys with better pings and players on your skill level.But I don't like the way the business model is going. The game itself costs money and you may fight against enemy with characters you do not own. These characters cost money as well. It seems unfair and looks more like a thing a free to play title would do.I am concerned the game will be gone if the developers can't get back the players that once played this game for so long.Each character has it's individual soundtrack and items he can buy to progress in the game. This makes it stand out from other games and I love it for that.Awesomenauts is often on sale for 1€, or whatever your currency is. I'd highly recommend you to check it out when it is on sale. Maybe you can save the game.			"

												Before Awesomenauts I have played a little bit of LoL and DOTA2. These games have always been a non-go for me : gameplay too slow (point & click, no way to evade stuff, little skill involved), learning curve too high (you have to read plenty of guides before you can get a handle on what are the good builds, what to buy etc..), and their community usually just suck. Ragequitting, flaming, ""competitive"" players, you name it.Awesomenauts is the exception.Easy learning curveThis is what kept me playing during my first hours. I did not have to read guides, or to worry about my build - i was just having fun playing this little game. In a few hours only I had understood the basic mechanics of the game.Very fast gameplayJump, shoot, drop, drop, shoot, oh damn there's someone needing help !Take the jump pad, dash towards the enemies, thus saving your mate, and then drop down to jungle and escape. Woosh, you nearly died, but you just saved your mate.Ok, your two buddies are right there in top lane, and you see the 3 enemies standing there. Time to initiate ! You dash, your mates follow, you prevent them from escaping by bodyblocking them while nado'ing.. One is about to espape, you are about to die, but your friend Nibbs just launched her Orb, teleports, and the guy is dead. It's a wipeout. Time to push !And that's basically what the entire game is like. You have no time to rest. You always have something to do, always on your nerves. The slightest mistake might turn the fate of the game.. But you keep playing, you keep pushing. Until victory (or defeat) is achieved.Easy to learn, and yet so hard to masterAfter more than 600 hours in this game, I still did not master 100% of the game.Each one of the 23 characters has a completely different gameplay. That's 23 playstyles to master.  Out of these 23, I think I'm mastering 8 of them. I still have 15 characters to continue learning.. And that's what keeps me playing, even after 600 hours.Epic moments !Be it when you kill someone in air battle, or when you barely escape a gank and manage nevertheless to kill one of them, resulting in a wipeout (all 3 of the enemy team dead) because your team supported you - or when both of your team mates died, but all 3 enemies have low health, and you manage to take them all out..These kind of moments are so rare in the recent games, that Awesomenauts is a perl just for this sake.The consThis game is not perfect though. (no game is)The community still have a couple of weird people. The kind of people that are attracted by the ""MOBA"" and ""F2P"" labels. Flamers, ragequitters, ...Matchmaking is not great. But the next big update coming in March should solve this issue.Peer-to-peer system. You can get hit while you're not supposed to on your screen.Final WordsAlong with Rollcage and Freespace, this game is one of the 3 best games I have ever played in my life. I recommend it to anyone who likes 2D games. I got this game in a Humble Bundle, left it in my library, and only played it once a friend reviewed it on Steam..I only wish I had started playing this game sooner			"

												I'm retiring 'nauts. It's been a little over 2 years that I've been playing this game. I feel like I'm obligated to give a review for the amount of time I've put in, so here it goes:The game itself is great, but it's gone through so much wear and tear that it's impossible for the game to remain pure. When changes are made, people like it or they don't like it. Considering the rate people have been leaving the community, they clearly don't like the changes. Perhaps everyone liked how the game was, when it had defined characteristics, like a peticular set of nauts that gave the game character. It happens to the best of games, shows, etc. It was pretty easy to formulate stradegies and counter teams, but with all the junk being introduced everything now seems worse off than it once was.As of now I don't play anymore, but occasionally see what the community is up to (in forums, fanart, screenshots) for nostalgia's sake. I'd probably play again if Ronimo was able to make some sort of brakethrough that was capable of bringing back the community, such as new balance changes, a line between competitive and casual, different modes for a diverse amount of playing styles, and the list goes on. In fact, I'd love an **implemented** deathmatch or random team deathmatch mode instead of the dumb ones formed in the lobby. I just wish they focused more on those things than spamming new nauts every few months. It would give the game a bit of backbone so people don't just quit from years of frustration to the problems that aren't being fixed.Now to describe my experience: First 50 hours, really enjoyable; 200 hours, kind of fun... and over time it lost it's sting. It shouldn't be a chore to carry teams and do the tedius work of chasing people around and destroying driods.Now the part you want to read: should you buy this game? If it were two years ago, yes (because I liked it back then). However, right now there's really no reason to buy it. No one plays anymore. I'll recommend giving it a try, and whether you like it or not will only be determined when you try it out. There's a lot in store, and much to experience. Like seriously, there is no other game on Steam close to this. Nowhere will you ever find a 2d moba... seriously type that in google images.			"

												I just really wish there would be an option for a ""Mixed"" review. This one would surely be one of them.But since this is one of my most favourite games, I rather not hit the ""Not recommended"" cause that would make me feel bad. Let's say my review is a kind of warning for future players, as I will talk more about the disadvantages rather than the advantages.This game, as the title already says is really, really Awesome, it has tons of potentials, in my eyes it beats Dota2 and even League of Legends (and I like the latter) just to mention the two most popular MOBAs which are kinda similar to Awesomenauts.So the task is, you are in a 3v3 match, you with your two teammates have to defend your base on a battle arena which is also protected by 3 or 4 turrets, that's depending on the map. Both teams have 3-3 (or 4-4) turrets. There are various champions, characters, whichever you call them to choose from, and each and one of them has different, unique abilities. From the medic to the assassin, supports, tanks, you can find different classes, and even these little ""types"" have different selections. The background story is simple yet still enough for this game, the characters all have their own background stories and the design (even the most of the skins) are also amazing. So, everything is set up for a perfect game, what's wrong then?Pretty much everything else. Sadly.1 . Let's start with the matchmaking. Catastrophy. Horrific. A complete disaster. The game has no dedicated servers, so you pretty much have to wait until the matchmaking finds players from your region (and this one is preferred, or else you have to deal with laggers, and even with this set up you will probably meet them), sometimes it takes like, 5 minutes or even more. And when you are finally in a game which has not started earlier (and will be a losing match as you will get dropped into the place of angry ragequitters), you will probably have to deal with people who have higher ranks than you. And here comes the second most horrible thing;2. The ranking system. I can't describe how it works, because I absolutely don't understand it. You can't choose to play or not play ranked matches like in LoL, you will be categorized into leagues, but the way you level up to higher leagues or get dropped back into the former seems to be really, really random. And if you get into higher leagues because out of your 20 matches you luckily won one, you have to deal with the bigger guys. And by bigger, I pretty much say guys with the highest ranks and prestige, becase those are the ones who I get mostly, even if I am in league 6, with prestige 1. I always, and no joke, always get enemies with max prestige, and league 3-4. Maybe even higher. I don't need to mention how do I end up. 3. The last, and probably the worst thing in this game is the ""community"", if I can call this a community. I have met a few communities before, but this game definitely has the worse, pretty similar to LoL I'd say. Your teammates calling you noob if you die once, your enemies tapping the taunt button more than M1, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s everywhere, trolls, ragequitters who leave you alone with bots, and enemies still taunting you. During this 70 hours I have met like, 1 or 2 nice random helpful players in this game, seriously. And there is no kickvote or ban system either. 4. I also want to mention how I disagree with the content what you have to pay for. Sure, a few skins to buy them, the devs need to eat something of course (no irony), but there are also characters what you can unlock only with using your debit card, pretty strong characters (I'd not call them p2w though) and instead of a few serious fixes or developing, the company seems to put all their efforts into the new skins and into some occasional bugfixes. Oh, and to nerf Voltar to be almost useless.All in all what I can say about this game is that it is really addicting with its unique humour, gameplay and overall experience, but has so, so many backsides that it might not even be a benefit to play this game. Unless you have nerves made of ropes. I'd suggest the game for people who can be ignorant against trolls, can deal with stress easily, and like this genre.(Also I am sorry for my grammar errors and typos, my English is not the best, and my typing is even worse.)

												This is a hard game to love, but I do. I've sunk far too much time into it to say I don't love it. It can be extremely fun but also very infuriating. It's meant to be a casual side-scrolling Moba / Dota-clone and it does that very well, but when I say casual, I mean super casual. Not caring about winning and game-breaking issues casual. I can handle losing just fine and I couldn't care less about ranking. Being out-played and out-maneuvered comes with any online game. You play until you get better. What I can't handle is losing because you can go 1v3 or the drop-in / drop-out system forcing you to be always down a player because someone forgot they left the oven on and the next person just got a call, so your 3rd is constantly on their way to fight. Or the terrible matchmaking making you join a game where everyone has 300+ ping (yes you can set the game to find only local players but the player base is so small I've had that take 15+ minutes. And then the game is force-started because someone is too impatient). There's issues involving lag even in local region games that have been around since game launch and continue to persist and will forever persist, because the game uses a p2p hosting model instead of a dedicated server. That cost cutting measure is simply awful and I've been dropped out of MANY games where the host decides to leave and we can't all get connected to the new host, sometimes resulting in the entire match being scrapped. I've played the game since almost launch, contributed far too much money to the expansion kickstarter and bought some DLC I didn't care about just to support the devs.  But I've also uninstalled 6-8 times and quit for months at a time because all the issues got to be too much. I usually come back after a big patch rollout hoping some more issues are solved, but more often than not it's simply some unless flair added to the GUI and some balance changes which I can rarely understand the reasoning behind. I've ragged on it a lot and I'm not giving it a thumbs up (in its current state), but I do recommend picking it up, maybe on sale and giving it a shot. Maybe it will have most of my issues with it fixed and if not, at least you can get some good hours out of it. "

												One of the most, if not the most casual-friendly Dota-style game on Steam. Play a character, manually aim a shot and help your creeps (droids) travel to the tower (turret), and then destroy the ancient (core) while trying not to die from other players. Similar ideas to Dota/LoL, but great if you're not a fan of the penalty system of more serious games.Would recommend because the updates have helped improve the game IMMENSELY, and there's always something you can learn from the game. As of 2.8, you can bypass the matchmaking problem with the chat rooms in the main menu.The big negatives can be matchmaking, so beware of playing solo. I do it often, but may end up finding random teammates in the chat from now on. Lag can be an issue due to the playerbase, but these issues are from not having millions of people looking for matches at the same time.If you want a more relaxed approach to Dota-style games, or prefer cartoony, unrealistic action multiplayer games, then I would give a strong recomendation!

												This is the first time I've seen this game F2P, might be wrong, but If you haven't tried it, then this is your chance. It's a fun game to play with/without friends and really easy to pick up for a moba.3v3, each char has a basic attack + 2 special moves - can chose 3 upgrades out of 5/6 ( <-I can't remember LOL) for each move/basic attack. ~A few cons if you care. -Game has always felt like it's still in beta/early access with all the unbalanced stuff each season.-P2P so it's one of those games , highping=good // low ping=meh-Matchmaking, because the playerbase is so small ( might be bigger now F2P+sale ), you will see low ranks vs high ranks. -It is really easy for a match to end up being 1 sided. I don't really play this game anymore, but I still recommend it. Oh yeah I have been banned once from this game *by accident* lol.			"

												The graphics are cute, if you don't mind ""cartoonish"". The characters are each unique in personality.Hackers/cheaters are relatively rare.The music by Sonic Picnic is exquisite. If you are going to buy anything from this, you should buy the soundtrack.Unfortunately, this is where the fun ends.Matchmaking is terrible, peer2peer technology which means that lag is abound. For some reason the matchmaker is still stuck in 1998 whereas it only offers you to search games by ever-reducing selection (worldwide, continent, local) instead of pairing you with others on the basis of latency/packetloss compatibilities and tolerance.Moreover, the pairing of opponents based upon rank is seemingly non-existent whereas you may face a team of extreme aces with a couple of complete novices for teammates and vice versa, or mixed and so on.Additionally, the game allows late joins. You may be one such lucky 'winner' as to be selected to join a game in progress, for the past twenty minutes, whereas all the players on the team you got tossed onto have quit the game and the opponents been pummeling on bots and becoming superiorly strong for the entire time.You may even rake in the jackpot and join a game that a player has quite precisely five seconds before the base is destroyed and the game is over with a defeat for you (which you WILL take a dive in ranking for).Think of many such fun small joyful defects the game is rife with.Oh, and it is worth of mentioning to note that the community is chokeful with acidic terribly-behaved children (at least mentally). Which, of course, the developers pander to happily.To top it all off, there is no semblence of balance. The disparity becoming fast evident and very wide in scale.With some characters being exquisitely over the top whereas others are scrapping at the bottom. Some of them featuring extremely ""cheesy"" or ""lame"" easy methods of combining certain abilities/power-ups to either kill any opponent within mere seconds regardless of their strength/health/abilities or to escape out of any situation essentially becoming unkillable.Some of the strongest characters are also locked behind a DLC pay-wall, effectively turning the game somewhat onto ""pay2win"" situation.Watching plays as a spectator on youtube is also not very enjoyable, barring the game from any possible future as an e-sports entirely.

												I've played this game for a few years now and I have always been a fan of the 2d style moba. I loved the unique chatracters and balance that exisited between them. However now this game is nothing like how it shipped. Matchingmaking is just totally unplayable. It is inconceivable to me how they managed to butcher it so badly, like they must have actually tried to make it worse. To even start a game you must wait in a 4 minute or longer queue just to search for a game, no matter how quickly it finds players. Then the actual quality of the matchmaking is just atroucious. I have and always have had an execellent internet connection, but since recently matchmaking updates I consistantly experience a routine lag pause which makes games unplayable as this is a competitive moba. Then theres the leagues which attempt to rank players with similar skill. They never had this right and made it worse than what it was originally. League mobilityhappens too often and 2 or 3 bad match ups can tank your league rating and leads to either easy wins or slightly losing a game. Theres no middle ground which makes games so boring now. You either win easily because your in a lower league than you should be, or you advance then have 1 or 2 bad games and go back down a league. And with Seasons constantly reseting the league your in only the most devouted players experience some remote sense of stability in their rating. I want to love this game again and had high hopes for the big matchmaking update but ut has only made this game worse. Ronimo just keep adding new characters and skins and do not have any real plans on re working this game which so desperately needs it.			"

												This game looks cozy and sweet but it is actually a super hardcore, fast paced, team oriented, moba/fighting game. Every naut is unique and most does not follow standard rpg/moba classes. Unlike most mobas this is very much an easy game to learn, there is no need to memorize item combinations and no pregame mumbojumbo. On higher levels buildorders/knowledge is very much still a thing though because of upgrades that happen during the game. Skill ceiling is very high, the pace of this game is fast, not combarable to most mobas, closer to super smash bros, and there are a lot of small mechanical nuances to learn that separates pros from good players and good players from scrubs. Tldr - easy to learn hard to masterSound is easily 10/10, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of really catchy tunes and effects. The graphical style is eternal if a bit cheesy. The current balance is very fine, sometimes they go overboard with a new naut but it is often reined in a patch or two after release. The game is still in active development and generally patches makes the game deeper/more exciting rather than the dumbing down/shallowness that is popular in most games nowadays. It is possible to turn around a snowball, but it has been made much harder since the xp system (before xp system a single good player could often carry a bad team from a losing position, nowadays it takes an exceptional player or sudden effort from all team-members to carry a bad team. xp system is controversial, personally I think its better with team effort than two titans that have chewed on noobs dominating the pace of the game). Community is varied, a mix of the old breed of good gamers, some trolls, but also some from the hyper sensitive community and rage quitters. Biggest problem is lack of players and as a result matchmaking is a bit ♥♥♥♥ed, the players that are left have a standard of game that is generally higher than in most other mobas.If you are thinking about getting this game then I can recommend keeping a positive attitude/open mind in trying to understand why you are losing. And stay close behind a team-member at all time, preferably someone that doesn´t die, at least until you figure out what is safe.The expansionpacks are fun, but not required to play. Some people think that expansion-nauts are op, but that´s because they don´t know♥♥♥♥♥♥ standard-nauts like froggy, derpl, skoldir, etc are often played or pre-banned in pro-tournaments. All nauts are viable, though most players become comfy with a couple of nauts and stick to them, pros are the same.			"

												I got this game back in the start of 2015, and it was great. Now, as the recent review for this game have shown, its taken a dark turn.  I've spent over 200 hours on this game and quit like 5 times. The reason, is the games matchmaking. No matter what league you're in, its a guarentee that at one point, you'll be matched against a team of prestiege 10's with two guys that just installed the game. It has apparently been♥♥♥♥♥♥from the very start of this game, and Ronimo has'nt done jackshit. However, they claim that they'll fix it in an upcoming update, so fingers crossed. The community for this game is also very small, not a lot of people know about Awesomenauts, and it doesn't help that the jackasses in it just yell at new players and scare them off, bringing this game down even more. The XP system kinda ruined the most fun part about the game, and that was the long matches in which you couldn't tell which team was winning and the smallest mistake could lose you the game. Now, not only are players rewarded with solar and 1 less team member on death, they get extra damege and health, making it almost impossible to have those types of fun games, turning most matches into one-sided slaughters. I know that this all sound really negative, but let me list the positives of this game. The gameplay is incredibly unique and fun (if you have good teammates) and it's amazing when you're playing with a friend or two. Each character is unique and I feel that there is one suited for everyone's playstyle. The soundtrack for this game is excellent and the art style is unique and colorful. In Conclusion: I've said my piece for this game, I think it's still a good game and worth your time and money, and I sure as hell reccomend it to you. They claim to be fixing the main issues with this game, so there's still hope on the matchmaking being fixed. If you do decide to buy this game, please, stick around and help the community grow, and maybe even leave a good review to help the game appeal to potential new members of this community. Thanks for reading the whole review! :D			"

I don't usually like Mobas at all so the fact that I could stand to play this is impressive from a gameplay standpoint. The big shame is the online, which is the entire basis for this game. It's hard to find a match and when you do you will often lose connection fast with no way back into the game. Ruins the whole point of the game.Balance is♥♥♥♥♥♥too. Hope you like one of the most powerful characters because if you don't then you're not gonna have a great time.

												Well, after . . . 3500 hours?  Thereabout.  Here's my review of Awesomenauts.Great and addictive game.The only downsides:  It needs more players.There is the occasional balance problem, but these are generally rectified quickly, and the ones that aren't are not that extreme.  The developers are constantly fine-tuning and adding things to this great game.  You'll probably spend less money on this base game and the two major optional DLCs than you would on skins and cosmetics in a free-to-play game like DOTA2 after all is said and done, and get way more out of it.In short, if you like teamwork, competition, and platforming, buy this game.

												I really love this game, it's incredibly fast and funny. And no, i didn't misclick. I could emphasise how this game is enjoyable, but sadly it has some big problems that need a disappointed review.1 the game has no dedicated servers, it runs on host connection. What does this mean? That one of the most important aspects of games like this, dodging, is often pointelss, since with lag you will be hitten by projectiles that appears to be very far from you hit box, neverthless you stand still or jump away. And i have a good connection.2 balancing. This aspect is not much important to me, especially since the characters got changed a bit with latest patch, but yeah, some characters are too horrible to play against (cough ayla cough). 3 You have to buy the game, and it has microtransactions? You can buy skins, and there's even a dlc with new map, new very strong characters and all? Really? And no dedicated servers? .. This is my greatest disappointement.4 often you get in games already lost, often people disconnect due to bad host or ragequit etc. etc.			"

Sadly victory isn't up to teamwork half the matches, it's up to the snatches with a stronger combo. So gather some mates, and hope that fate decides to allow you to wallow in the little fun.Each update seems to damage the content, and leaves little to engage like a dead bird in a cage.

												I used to love this game but after the matchmaking update it has become unplayable. The only thing the new matchmaking did is increase the wait time for games to over five minutes. There are still bad matches being made.There are a lot of skill level mismatches and one good player can't pull out a win because of the XP system. One bad player affects the whole team/game. I lost hope that it will ever be fixed. "

												Although this game is VERY fun and often entertaining, I'm giving it a thumbs down and STRONGLY recommending you don't play it until the developers elect to balance it in some way. Of course there will always be metas, superior players, and unbalance in a game, but the current ranking and tier system does absolutely nothing to seperate the experienced/meta players from the unexperienced and/or casual players. As of right now, it is far too easy for top-tier players to end up in low-tier games, whether intentionally or not.			"

												This game is really good, i recommend buying it and dowloading the beta that will come within, because the beta is going to implement a whole new matchmaking system and interface! The matchmaking system is one of the only cons of this game, and i'll list the pros below:- Good OST, Characters, Stage, Graphics and Animations.- The whole game besides matchmaking system and fanbase.

												Before I start, I want to give a heartfelt thanks to Ronimo for what this game used to be.Rewind a good few years, and Awesomenauts was, excuse the pun, an awesome little game. It knew what it wanted to be- it was a little MOBA with a different perspective on the whole thing. Pre-Startstorm (Yes, I mean Starstorm) the game had its true character, with many mechanical differences setting it apart from other games in the genre. Picking which items would be in the shop before the battle was interesting in my opinion- okay, it might not have been a 'good' mechanic, but it gave the game character. And the level system? The level system... Why Ronimo, just why? We had a game that had something to set it out from the masses before from mechanical standpoint. Now we don't even have that. The level system means that a bad start always leads to a bad end- the enemy gets 1 level up from you for more than about 2 minutes and they'll get too far ahead- you won't be able to bounce back unless they choke HARD.Awesomenauts is different from a gameplay standpoint from many of the games in the genre, being 2D, but this is simply the game's shell. Ronimo decided to take the game's soul away a long time ago, and slowly the body has been deteriorating without it. By now, it is simply a husk, lifeless and souless. The matchmaking is broken- reguarly pitting prestige 10 people against those who haven't even unlocked every character yet. I can't tell if that's bad programming or just that Ronimo killed their game a while back, but in any case, right now, in its current state, I have to recommend you stay away from this game.Ronimo? If you read this, could you please give me back Awesomenauts? I'm really not a fan of this new-fangled Awesomenot.			"

												Awesomenauts was once a gem. A bit of dirt and grime on it, but a gem nonetheless. The dirt and grime could have been cleaned off, but update after update the dirt and grime kept building. There'd be something to help clean the gem off, and something to dump it in the mud. But with this recent patch, it is no longer a gem. Ronimo have tarnished it beyond belief with the ideals of aking the game faster, almost outright refusal to fix balence issues the community has been crying out for, and seemingly lack of listening. I have over 1000 hours on Awesomenauts in total. ~700 of which were earned on the Xbox 360. Today, the Xbox 360 version is for more different than the PC version. It was abandoned after only the first update having only two extra characters than the original six. It sits in immense unbalance and it was much more rage endusing than what the PC version was. It was a point of insanely unbalanced characters and upgrades, and the top dogs were extremely obvious, especialy with the small roster it had. I played it constantly becaasue despite it's unbalance it was a gem. It was one of my favorite games period. But after a while the unbalace got to me. The top dogs of the console community were the most imfamous people because they completely abused the unbalance.After some time of Awesomenauts being on the sidelines and my ignoring it, I aquired the PC version.  It was great, so much better than the console version, I loved it so much, regardless of being even barely able to run it due to my horrendus PC. I had regained interest of this gem and I played it constantly, racking up 100 hours in a relatively short time. But then they dropped it in the mud. This most recent patch has ruined the game, dropping a pile of logs on the fire that was the game's unbalance. It already had broken haracters that, regardless of the communities outcry to fix them, Ronimo ignored them and allowed them to remain broken for the most part. Then they added the In Game XP System. This was added to try to make games faster when it could have been more accomplished by many other means. Reworking upgrades and characters, making different maps besides the 3 maps that can be played online. This new Xp system took most of the fun out of the game, removing challenge and fairness. It made it nearly impossible to win a game with a bad start. Before a team, or hell, even ONE player on a team, with enough skill, could make an amazing comeback. Now? The game is decided within the the first 3 minutes. If one team just gets a couple levels ahead of the other early on, they steamroll. They become a snowball of death and misery and it takes all enjoyment out of the game, and makes it nearly impossible to come back by increasing the team's flat health and damage every level they gain, making it harder, and harder, and harder to comeback. This was a terrible idea. As of the current patch, this game is no longer a gem. It is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game was once great and could be again. Ronimo just needs to fix what the community has been wanting fixed. If Ronimo fixes the issues I mentioned here, I urge you to pruchase this game, but in it's current state, I can't say that this is a good game and that you should play it. The only way the game is good at this time is when you have a large pack of friends and play custm games together. The online is ruined by unbalance and attempts to change the game for the ""better"". But as I said, if they fix the present issues, I could not urge you to get this game enough, but I recommend you avoid it at the current time. "

Awesomenauts' flaws hold it back from being a truly awesome game.Pros: Graphics, Sound, GameplayCons: PerformanceAwesomenauts graphics, sounds, and gameplay all mesh well together to create a more casual, faster paced MOBA experience than its 3D brethren.  With only fifteen (nineteen with DLC) awesomenauts, at most two lanes, and one less dimension, the game is more welcoming to newcomers.With no dedicated servers, however, the performance is mediocre.  Disconnects are handled by freezing awesomenauts in place, where they can be killed by enemy creeps or players.  There is no way to reconnect once booted from a game, leaving teammates to fend for themselves with a terrible replacement bot.  Force starts allow premade teams a huge advantage with 3v1s and 3v2s.  Even having a strong connection does not solve the problems if not chosen as host.Overall, Awesomenauts is simply too unreliable to be anywhere near awesome.6/10			"

												The game was a great, more casual 2D Platformer MOBA that had pretty good depth, but the recent update has ruined the game for me and a lot of other players. Essentially they made all of the characters much weaker, and added a XP system where everytime you get a kill on a player / creep / turret, you get XP to level up. Everytime you level up you're entire team gets a +4% to healh and +4% to DMG. So if a team gets a good start it's almost impossible to come back from. It's not fun for a long time player, and I'm sure it would be even worse for a new player. I would highly advise waiting until this is changed / fixed.			"

												The game is extremely fun to play. Gameplay is fast paced and brawling with your opponents in a 2d environment with a lot of different abilities extremely entertaining. It requires more skill to master the game mechanics than it seems. The graphics are great, voice cast and sound amazing, lore deep and funny. There is plenty of different heroes to choose from, you will stay occupied for a long time before you become proficient at all of them. The developers update the game all the time, they really try to meet the community's expectations and keep things fresh.However, there are simply too many issues with awesomenauts to recommend it to a new player. Apart from the usual moba complaints (subjective issues like bad balancing, matchmaking, ranking formulas, toxicity of players, etc.) present here, which arent that big of a deal breakers to me, the game suffers because of peer to peer connection system. On top of a rather small active player base its a huge issue.It's common to be constantly matched with players half way around the globe from you. 400 ping enemies is something you will see all the time playing this game. Not only cant you do much to prevent such players from joining your matches (region settings dont work at all, blocking a player on steam doesnt always work and is going away in a future patch it seems) but a lagging player have an upper hand when attacking you. You have to add his ping, so to speak, to all the stun, pull and knockback effects which will move you back to the place on the lagger's monitor during a fight while on your screen you are miles away from danger. The peer to peer connection system works in favour of high ping players which is really unfair to players with stable connection.I play awesomenauts very often and enjoy it, but i have to tell, getting unfair matches most of the time is so frustrating i dont see how new players could enjoy the game now. Moba/2d-platformer mix works so great that it is strange there arent any more mobas like awesomenauts nowadays.			"

												After two-three long years of Awesomenauts, I thought I might give you my full thoughts about this game, now that we are getting close to the end of the Starstorm DLC development and the new Matchmaking server.First of all, my feelings toward this game are mostly positive. I love the general gameplay style, it's like Smash Bros meeting MOBAs like Dota and LoL, 2D and stuff.Music, oh boy, Sonic Picnic has really given their best with the game's soundtrack.Visuals, they're great, I love the 1980's cartoon style Ronimo has been going for, same goes for the characters and lore in general.Ronimo keeps updating the game with more characters, visual and gameplay advancements, new features such as new bots you can play with, when not having players in game, new game modes in custom games, skins and announcers. It's the reason the game is still going on for it's 3rd year on Steam, has got PS4 release that is also updated from time to time, and Xbox One -version coming.Community involvement is great thing with this game, as I myself have made some sort of ""career"" on YouTube somewhat because of Awesomenauts. We've walked the path of YouTube together for these +2 years. And I thank both this game and it's developers with cooperation :) Also, the community of players might sometimes feel childish etc, but there are a lot of smart people who strive to keep Awesomenauts, well, awesome. We have had some great tournaments and other events, our suggestion for character voice lines, skin and/or character ideas are passed down to the game in one form or another, and in example, Replays have given us options to make more different kinds of gameplay videos to YouTube.Of course, this game has it's issues. Since Ronimo can't afford to rewrite the netcode for Awesomenauts to enable dedicated servers, players have to deal with P2P, which will cause problems if 1. Player/players have faulty connection and/or 2. players involved are from different countries. Of course you can limit the options your matchmaking queue goes for, but it's a bit flawed until Ronimo implements their new Matchmaking servers around the release of Overdrive expansion (which isn't required to use the matchmaking servers, mind you). Connection problems aren't fixed by that, but at least matchmaking will be more ""fair"" towards players of different skill levels and you are less likely to be put in a game against players from other side of the world.Speaking of skill levels, new players might find problems to start the game if they skip beginner missions and jump right into the online games (which is not recommended). Skill level might vary even in the higher leagues of leaderboards, but there are cases that new players quit the game because they don't feel the need of commitment to learn the basics and advanced techniques of the game and it's characters.Then there's character balance. Some characters are already pretty balanced in a sense, but then there are one's that are doomed to be bad or too good. But, balancing acharacter isn't a walk on a sunshine, it's like stacking a house of cards. One slip and the whole house of cards might collapse, of course, then you have to start over again, but once you get it right, man, it feels satisfying. Even though you're missing couple of cards, which in this game are incoming characters and maps.But, my likes, which are plenty, clearly overpower the dislikes towards this game, and over 2000 hours in the game, I say that I love this game. I believe that Ronimo can and will strive to make this game stand out and stay alive for a long time, and I'm willing to stay with Ronimo until the day Awesomenauts has to move to a higher plane of existence.For about 10 euros (and hefty amount of sales/giveaways you can get this game from) this game is worth your time for at least those 10 hours. DLCs are mostly skins and announcers, and the Starstorm Expansion, but even without those you can get some solid hours in to this game. It's also great with friends, be it normal games or Custom games. With the upcoming matchmaking servers, Overdrive Expansion with three new characters, not to mention free character Ix the Interloper from the 2nd Design-a-naut contest and Starstorm station map AND character art updates for older characters, this game gets the love it deserves from the company who made it, and it should get the love it deserves from you, too.Buy it. Play it. NOW!			"

												In a MOBA, there are typically levels. You level up and your stats increase, and you usually gain a large amount of money. Now imagine that you're playing LoL, DOTA 2, whatever your choice MOBA is. Imagine that when you get a kill, your entire team gets a huge amount of EXP and money. More than you would get if you had the best possible CS(Creep Score) at that point in the game. This is what Awesomenauts decided to do with the EXP system. Upon killing an enemy(which will happen before one team even reaches level 1),  the team's shared EXP shoots through the roof, giving ~1.5 levels. For this level up, the team gets a large amount of Solar(the game's currency, used to buy items), and their base stats increase, namely HP and Attack. Before this EXP system, there was no way to get stronger but by purchasing items. This added a level of depth to the flow of the game, as leaving to buy items was a time-consuming process. You gambled everytime you decided to stay out after killing an enemy, chanced that you would still be strong enough to take on your enemy, who had just bought items. Leaving at the wrong time could cause your turrets or teammates to be decimated by the larger enemy force. By playing your cards right, you could turn the entire game on it's head during these times, defeating foes as a team that you would usually lose to by yourself, or boldly attacking turrets head-on when no enemies were around. This, however, could make games a little longer. And 40 minutes might seem like a normal game of any other MOBA, but for Awesomenauts, that was loooooong, because typical games were 25 minutes, and that was with plenty of back-and-forth. The creators of the game, however, wanted to make games shorter. It's an appealing concept, but Awesomenauts was already very, very fast-paced. I never noticed that 25 minutes had passed, because there was just so much to do, and the possibility of coming back after a team-clearing battle was entirely possible. Awesomenauts was a game that made you interested, and you wanted to be focused, because even if you messed up, even if your K/D was 0-10, you could still win, you could still be the underdog that came from nowhere with a sneaky play and stole the game.Some new characters(namely Rocco) ruined this aspect. You now had Ashe in the form of a bird, and he could hit you through turrets, from his own spawn. He could teleport back and fire an arrow to ward off or even kill enemies that were going after turrets. Coming back wasn't the most viable thing in the world now. But it was still entirely possible.And then they introduced the EXP system. At first, I was intrigued. Some characters were quite hard to get going at the start of a game, even if you got first blood. So I was hoping this would rectify that, and balance out some of the ""late-blooming"" characters. I was wrong. The EXP system changed the game from this mysterious, complex game of back-and-forth into a game where first blood was all that mattered. A game where one slip-up, a little bit of lag leading you to get killed meant that you lost the game for your team. The game was not forgiving anymore, bending to the way of skilled players who may have died once or twice in a game, but was now rigid, placing a wall between the team who didn't get first blood and any shot at victory. Some people might like this new system, it does turn the first 1-3 minutes of every game into a toss-up, and makes those >3 minutes really tense. But after someone gets a kill, it's just a matter of watching that team win over the next 5-10 minutes. So, if you like games where one teammate or a single slip-up costs you the entire game, buy it. But if you want a game where anyone can come back, the underdog can win, and the game is determined by not just skill in a single kill, but skill over an entire game, in strategy and observation?You missed it. It's gone. And I'm sorry you missed it, because it was easily the best MOBA I've ever played. The community loved the game, and the game loved the community. I'm refunding this game because it's not the game I paid for, all that time ago. It's a 3-minute game, with a toxic community due to a new system that places blame squarely on an individual player for a loss. Thanks for the good times, Awesomenauts. But I guess the best things never last.			"

This I agree with the other posts, but if the commuity is suffering then the best way to fix it is to add better community to the game. Playing this with friends is an awesome time regardless of the fact there can be some seriously uncouth people online. My advice: Play the game and if you want the community to be better then make it better. Honestly if you spent as much time trying to fix it as complaining about it then it could be an amazing community. It definitely used to be.			"

Posted: March 7, 2015
												Is this game fun, Well yes. BUT there are somethings that need to change in order for this game to truely be a good game. Pros.The game perfectly captures the moba spirit, but in a fast paced action platformer. Don't like RTS style constant clicking? Think there's not enough action in Dota or league of legends? This game has it.Voice acting and soundtrack are great.artstyle is nice and freshThe game IS fun.Negatives.This game can not be competitive yet. There are numerous reasons why, but let's start off with the worst offenders.1. There is no strategy to picking a character. None. There isn't a draft, so you can't see what the other team is going to pick. It's like Blind pick in league of legends. There's a reason for that mode not being ranked. If the other team happens to pick a character that counters yours, you're screwed the entire game. I propose something like league of legends. Each team can ban 1 character, and they take turns picking their characters while the one they picked is shown to both teams. Until this is implemented, If you are looking for a serious competition, go look elsewhere.2. The Paywall.What Paywall? The expansion. I'm fine with them having an expansion. That isn't the issue. Here's the issue. Almost all of the expansion characters have a attack that passes through the turrets. Normally, you can use the turret as a shield to take some damage while you fight off the enemy team. A lot of the characters in the expansion have attacks that can go through said turret. nibbs, Penny, Ted McPain (in levels that have the turrets on top of the jungle area), sentry x58 has an attack that draws you in from behind the turret. You see where I'm going with this? Ok. So there are characters that can get you behind the turret. There must be one that can in the normal game too, right? Yeah, there is. One. Coco. So if you have the expansion, you can poke the heck out of anyone behind the turret, but if you just have the base game? Just pray there's a coco on your team or you're screwed because you can't touch them. 3. Joining late games.The game has bots take over after someone leaves. That's awesome and well needed in other mobas. You know what isn't awesome? Other players can then join the game and replace these bots. I've had numerous times where I'd join a game, only to find out all the turrets were gone for us and the whole team had rage quit so I'm the only one there. A garenteed lose. Gee, thanks. Unfortunately this happens WAY to often. You get screwed just for wanting to play the game! If people still want that feature, fine. Put a switch in there that you can click and say ""I only want to join NEW games. NOT games in progress."" This sucks.4. Disconnections. The game gives you a penalty for quiting the game. This is good. Unfortunately, You can't rejoin games that you have disconnected from. Internet goes down for a second? Congrats, you are now punished when you start another game.  Game crashes? Punished. Fair, right? You should be able to rejoin games that you we disconnected from. Simple as that.Summary:This game is fun. I always have a good match or two when playing. But, because of these problems, I can't recommend this game. These issues need to be fixed before this game is good enough to recommend to anyone.			"

IntroductionThe review for this game is in the game's title; Awesome!Awesomenauts is a unique, 2D MOBA that brings together old-school platforming, realtime action and overall fun. While it might not be as competitive as other MOBAs (like Dota or LoL), it's a great game that's easy to learn but hard to master. Filled with unique and interesting characters, Awesomenauts has kept me playing for hours on end. Positives Creative, innovative take on conventional MOBA-styled games. Charming, unique characters that all play differently. Amazing soundtrack and artstyle. Responsive controls. Developers are amazing, and work very hard to keep the game balanced and fun. Encourages team-based gameplay. Really fun for friends to play together. Great community, with loads of artwork, mods and guides. A lot of replayability (Just look at how many hours I've played.)Negatives No dedicated servers, so there's sometimes lag. Matchmaking a little unpredictable (but it is being worked on!) Allows players to leave mid-game without good consequence. Can be frustrating at times.ConclusionAwesomenauts it's a really fun, action-packed game that encourages teamwork and strategy. It's a game you can tell was built with love and heart, from not just the developers, but also the community. Personally, I would (and have) recommend this to anyone who's just looking for a fun time!			"

												I'm updating my review to reflect the new Awesomenauts content since my review 4 years ago.LEVEL EDITORThis update is incredible. Taking a game like this and allowing the community to create their own designs, and even upload custom textures has so many possibilities. I'm currently working on my own map and it's the most satisfaction I've got from this game in a while. Hopefully the devs continue supporting the Steam Workshop for this game and it blossoms into something greater than its ever been.DLCI'm really glad the devs are still supporting the game, but I hope they stop selling character packs. I believe all of the characters should be free and accessible to new players, and I think this paywall is deterring new people. I also think the base game should be free to play, or at least have a permanent price reduction. I would think the cosmetic DLC options would keep the devs afloat, especially if lowering the cost of the base game attracts new players (aka customers).GAMEOne final note, the game holds up. It offers a slew of characters since the original 6 at launch. I think we're at 29 now? It's fun, fast paced 3v3 action with your friends or against AI (not to mention a lot of the AI was made by the community). I've heard the online matchmaking can be a pain for people outside EU or NA, but I hope the devs can expand the player base to mitigate this issue (going back to my F2P option). I'm surprised they've captured and kept my intrigue since launch back in 2012, and I hope it continues for years to come.			"

 At a glance   Game Name:   Awesomenauts  Original Release:  1 August 2012  Genre Tags:  MOBA, Multiplayer, Platformer, 2D, RTS.   My Overall Grade:  B+  Estimated Playtime:  20-35 minutes each round and maybe more.   Multiplayer Aspect:  Auxiliary   Recommended To:  Established fans of the genre; those intrigued by the genre; Dota Players.   Review  Thinking of the MOBA it might sounds like a plodding war of attrition with particular hero characters between traditional battle roles, like tank, healer, ranged, and damage dealer. The game is simple, each team have to push against waves of human players or their AI sidekicks (if less player); whichever bunch gets through the other side first takes home the win. Turret situations, summon spots bring forth extra help, and concealed ways permit players to flank their enemies. Awesomenauts fabricates an intricate layer of system around a no frills 2D center, and this is the place attentive players will find brilliant strategies.Each character has a unique set of skills, consisting of a free-use weapon and two special actions. As the player acquires Solar, they can return to their base to heal and spend the Solar on various upgrades to these skill sets or core statistics such as movement speed and health. For each of four areas: the two special skills, their free weapon, and general statistics, the player can selected to buy up to three of six available improvements, with some improvements which can be bought multiple times with benefits stacked.Awesomenauts is like a mini version of Dota !

												Sadly, I am going to have to agree with many of the other reviewers here. The new XP system has broken the game. I'm all for making moves to increase game speed, but this move makes games impossible or incredibly easy, depending on how the dice roll for you at match making. If you have a leaver and a bot fills in until another player can be found, you're out of luck. The other team will quickly overtake you in damage, even if you play flawlessly. Have a feeder? He WILL lose you the game, and there is nothing you can do. The last game I played, I was 6-0, doing pretty well. I was completely maxed on upgrades. Unfortunately, I had a team member who fed a bit, and we started out with a bot for the first 5 minutes. Try as I might, no matter how many times I bested the other team and pushed them into a retreat, they would simply pick up a kill from one of my team mates and bide their time. Eventually, they rushed our base, and there was nothing I could do.I would have picked this game over any other MOBA before trying it with the new patch. Now, I'm not so sure.			"

												Mid-game joiner solar bonus ruins games. Whatever resembles a meta is thrown into random chaos due to the ease of dropping out of a game, and the massive disadvantage you're at in a 2v3 with a bot on your side -- a disadvantage that is only topped by the massive advantage the new player that joins your game receives.

												I can only recommend if the devs have one last sensible decision up their sleeve to bring in more players.As of January 2017 the game has ""better"" matchmaking. However the games biggest problem IMO is the size of the player base.  You can get decent games at peak time in Europe (and North America I presume). But I can't imagine this being the case in the rest of the world. I wish this game could copy the F2P system of the MOBA SMITE where you can get all characters for free by earning points from playing matches or pay a one off fee for instant access to every existing character and all future ones but I'm no business man and I understand Awesomenauts is an indie game with limited staff. I'm sure the company behind SMITE have a ton of people pumping out the paid costumes and free content for their title.Awesomenauts is a 2D game with fairly simple graphics so I would guess it takes less work.Could Awesomenauts survive on paid costumes? The game regularly goes on sale for a lower price than many of the premium costumes so I don't see why it can't just go F2P already. I have a friend who has spent well over £1000 on SMITE a F2P game... You see my point? Even if the game goes on sale for ~£2 it's still a huge barrier for people to just try out the game, get hooked and buy lots of costumes. I haven't spent a dime on SMITE granted but if the game has hundreds of thousands of players there's going to be plenty who will buy costumes (there are a lot of cool costumes might I add).I did give £30 to the Starstorm kickstarter for this game, I've bought a few costumes for my favourite characters and I am probably going to buy the latest ""expansion"" reluctantly. But that's because I really like the game.This game has good potential but that is wavering. We need dedicated servers. We need the option to invest our time to earn characters for free. I won't feel betrayed if all the game and paid characters I bought suddenly become free just let us who paid for the game get the next few instantly.Be smart and don't let it die Ronimo!			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Awesomenauts Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: 2D; MOBA; Platformer; Multiplayer   My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): N/A Multiplayer Aspect: Primary Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Multiplayer gamers REVIEWAwesomenauts is a simplistic and fun little MOBA that has a moderate learning curve and is mostly easy to get the hang of.  It isn’t as complex or competitive as many other MOBAs out there. This is a good thing for anyone who wants to play some PVP without having to deal with an overly complicated game and an overly angry playerbase.The game plays out in matches on small 2D arena-like maps.  At the start of each match, the players can choose from several Awesomenauts (read: heroes) to play as, each with their own different abilities.  Each match takes about a half hour or so, as two teams push with “creeps” to destroy towers and the enemy base. Sound familiar? So it plays like a traditional MOBA, but in 2D.The combination of the distinctiveness of 2D MOBA combat and the well-designed abilities for the different Awesomenauts creates a pretty enjoyable gameplay experience. It is fun to play around with the different character combinations to see what fun you can have with the unique gameplay. Also, there is a pretty decent playerbase and the developers have consistently been updating the game and creating new content, so it appears to have a stable heartbeat.Awesomenauts would be a good game to consider if you are someone who is interested in playing a PVP game for fun and don’t want to deal with the hostility of the community of other MOBAs. The ranking system does its best to keep everyone around where they should win 50% of the time. But that doesn’t stop some people from believing they should be winning every single match; luckily they’re the minority in this game. Due to the simplicity of the mechanics and the lighthearted nature of the game, the community tends to be a little less unnecessarily competitive than in other games.EDIT: As of the start of the year 2016, it has been a while since I have played this. The developers have continued to support the game with updates. I cannot speak about the current state of certain aspects of the game which may have changed since I have last played, but I believe what I have said here still holds true to the core game.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												Awesomenauts is a 2D ""MOBA"" game that pits two teams of three against each other.  It has all of the trappings you've come to expect from your dota clones: XP, gold, buying, mindless drones running in lanes, turrets, bases, and trash-talking players.  The characters are all unique and have really interesting designs.  I love how there's themes for each character.  Every win, if you can manage to secure one, is accompanied by a chorus of singers belting out a short stinger of ""The Awesomenats!"" that doesn't get old.  Alas...This game might have been fun to play when it was released when there were more players.  As it stands now, the player base has diminished and the only people playing are the diehards who have hundreds, if not thousands of hours in the game.  There is no room for newbies here, which unfortunately precludes me from truly enjoying the game.  I have received my fair share of insults and trash talk from both teammates and opponents alike.Like all ""MOBA"" games, the small team sizes (even smaller than the usual 5v5) puts a tremendous amount of pressure on the individual to perform.  Having a weak link on the team is a death sentence, but that may go without saying to those familiar with ""MOBA"" games.At the time of writing, there is a single expansion pack out that contains 5 new characters with another expansion on the way.  Unable to play them myself, I cannot make a completely accurate judgment.  However, being subjected to enemy teams composed of these DLC characters, I find them extremely potent when compared to the vanilla characters.The second expansion, which apparently required a Kickstarter, promises 5 additional characters, an extra map, and a replay system.  With a game that struggles to maintain 1000 concurrent players, it's probably too little too late.I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anyone.  There are plenty of other games that are worth your time and attention.  This isn't one of them.			"

												The fun and beauty of Awesomenauts lies in it delivering the MOBA experience found in games such as DOTA, but at a far more casual and beginner-friendly level. Just as with DOTA, the idea of the game is to destory turrets across numerous ""lanes"" to get to the opponent team's boss structure. Autonomous creeps are spawned from each team that attack the other team's structures, with the player commanding a hero that grows more powerful as the game progresses. Unlike most traditional MOBAs which are in 3D, Awesomenauts takes on a simpler 2D form reminiscent of platformer games. Games typically span 20 minutes and pit teams of 3 Nauts against each other.Instead of over 80 heroes in DOTA, there is only a small pool of 10+ Nauts to choose from. There is also no need to delve into the nitty-gritty of what items to buy or what stats/skills to train - the skill tree of the Nauts is far more simple. Other elements such as warding, lasthitting, denying, creep pulling etc. are also left out. That is not to say there is zero depth to the game. Individual player skill and teamwork remain of prime importance to ensure victory just as with any other MOBA. Some Nauts have a fairly high skill cap and various synergies which help add to the strategic element of the game - all this under a deceptively simple facade where each Naut only has two skills.The artwork is crisp and colorful, with no disorienting clutter during teamfights. Other notable upsides to the game are its fairly large and active community (with at least 1000 players ingame at any moment, finding a game is easy) and a ranking system. There is no pay-to-win, with all heroes being unlockable and any additional purchases being cosmetic only.Downsides to this game would be that associated with almost any MOBA - balance issues. This is especially pertinent when the hero pool is small - overpowered Nauts make the game less fun for everyone else. Another major problem is that the game automatically fills empty slots with bots, which typically do little other than feed the enemy gold. Furthermore, there is little disincentive for a player to leave a game if they are losing, which perpetuates the problem of *most* games being one-sided stomps against a full party of bots at the end.Despite this, Awesomenauts remains a fun game at heart, especially if you play it with friends.

												Awesomenauts is a 3v3 MOBA-style 2D platformer where each player takes control of one unique Awesomenaut and battle with the other team to push their turrets, destroy them, and ultimately destroy their base.The gameplay is your typical MOBA with a twist in that it's a platformer as well, making it a pretty interesting combination. Besides your typical knowledge about characters, their specializations and skills, you will also need some platforming experience as well, especially that certain characters have different movement abilities than others (certain are even capable of flight). It's action-packed and fun, but very hard to grasp and often turns into an unreadable chaotic mess due to the sheer amount of stuff that is going on at the same time.Graphic-wise, the special effects look nice, and all the characters have their own general style, though they all are pretty cartoonish and sometimes a little cheesy. It does add a bit to their charm, however.The music is, for the lack of better wording, awesome. Each character has their own musical theme (which also plays if you get a killstreak) and all of them are a good listen, especially that they cover a lot od different styles and genres, like Clunk's metal or Voltar's classical orchestra.So, on the surface the game feels nice, but the problems begin piling up when you go play online.The first thing is the horrible supposedly skill-based matchmaking. I say supposedly as it only operates on a league system, with each player being given a number, 1 being the highest, and 9 being the lowest in skill. The main two flaws are the fact that leagues reset every two months, so the first one or two weeks after the reset newbies are very likely to encounter skilled players who will absolutely stomp them to the ground, and the other is that the matchmaker has no problem teaming you up with a premade team consisting of Prestige 10 players (who reset and regained their levels a total of ten times) when you're new to the game, which, unless some kind of a miracle happens, will most likely result in a complete steamroll.It also doesn't help that the balance changes are made on a constant basis and while this is good in general, it also makes most user-made guides outdated pretty fast, so you're effectively stuck with the general description of character's role and abilities, and maybe a friend's help when it comes to learning the game, and considering it's a MOBA platformer, it's not only pretty harsh at the start, but also very easy to lose against veterans.The game does put up a certain ""Difficulty"" rating on each 'Naut, either Easy, Medium or Hard, but it's honestly far from correct. For example, it labels Coco as ""Easy"" even though she relies very heavily on mobility and correct use of her abilities instead of just whacking things in the head with your weapon, while at the same time calling Swiggins ""Hard"" despite his abilities being rather straightforward and generally easy to use.There are also certain Starstorm-exclusive 'Nauts where I can barely stop myself from calling them ""pay to win"" (mostly looking at Nibbs), so I am going to use a more generally accepted term of ""horribly skill-gated and not fun to play against unless you know the exact way to counter them"".When it comes to the expansion itself, it kind of does not help my opinion about the developer when they already begin to collect preorders for the next expansion, Overdrive, when they didn't even release everything associated with the Starstorm expansion (namely its exclusive map). Generally speaking you should finish the content people already paid for before moving on to create content for a separate purchase, unless you want people to look at you a bit shadily. Doesn't help that despite the beta the new heroes were overpowered as hell and often relied on cheap tactics, and the promised matchmaker rebalance still matches up newbies versus veterans. To the developer's credit, however, they do release some free updates for everyone every few months.Overall, this is a fun at its core, but very difficult to master and incredibly demotivating at start game. Personally, I just can't get myself into it big-time. Badly-designed matchmaker, a lot of things being far from obvious at first, and certain characters being just way too tricky to counter effectively while being generally easy to use if you're new to the game, and newly-released ones being overpowered or even P2W if they're DLC, are some of the factors that kill it for me. It's not a bad game, just one that's ridiculously difficult to learn at start and where the high skill ceiling makes it pretty much impossible to play casually unless you restrict yourself to bot matches.

												This game used to be really good, but ever since the game made an update where everyone's level is combined, it has went downhill. You are on a team of 3 people, let's just say that two of you guys are doing good, but one person on the team is doing bad, you will lose, because that team member that keeps dying, is giving the other team a bunch of levels and upgrades. This is probably one of the only team based multiplayer game that I know of where one team member can impact the other two team members that much. Not only that, this is the most unbalanced multiplayer competitive game that I have played.There are certain characters that are just mismatches. What I mean by that is that some characters are just weak against other characters, kind of like Pokemon. If you want to win any matches at all, you have to use the overpowered characters, like the recent DLC characters.  Before DLC characters were implemented into the game, there were a few unfair, or overpowered characters, but after DLC characters, the game just became pay to win. Yes, you pay for DLC and you will win matches, guaranteed. I used to like this game because I thought it was unique, and it really stood out on Steam, however all of the updates that the developers have made to this game has changed it to DLC, Pay to win, unbalanced mess. All in all, I do not recommend this game to anyone.			"

In matches where those problems are not too obvious I thoroughly enjoy the gameplay, and I would definitely reccomend it to people who can handle a few bad matches for some fun ones. This goes two fold after the new matchmaking comes out in patch 3.2. The community could always use more people to keep it going strong!			"

												Awesomenauts is a 2d 3 vs 3 MOBA featuring an interesting cast of characters and abilities. The gameplay is more-or-less just like any other MOBA out there (creeps, towers, heroes and items etc etc) yet the game shows a surprising amount of spit and polish. Unfortunately, there seem to be inherent balance issues between low and high level play (common for every MOBA mind you) but what ultimately ruins the game is the pitiful average playerbase of around 1.5k _PEAK_ players as of 9/9/15. This means actually having to wait a while to get into games against a condensed playerbase of mostly diehards and tryhards which is about as much fun as beating my♥♥♥♥♥♥with a cheese grater. Again, great idea for a game, it just didn't have the staying power.			"

												[EDIT] This isn't even the game that I payed for any more. I've given these people money over and over again and instead of getting what I originally payed for they took it away and made into something else entirely. I'm not even angry any more, just upset, like what I thought was the unreasonable behavior of a loved one was just the early symptoms of terminal brain cancer.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This was a great game that provided hours of fun and entertainment, truly reminding me of Saturday mornings as a little kid. Emphasis on the was. This game was easily my favorite MOBA that I ever encountered, until Ronimo fell for the trap of ""listening"" to the fans. The frequent hotfixes and character stat changes have left the game damn near unplayable, taking mains or other characters you enjoy playing as and completely changing how they feel, even completely changing skills/abilities.The last straw for me was not even the unbalanced Starstorm characters (which I backed on Kickstarter, something I now regret entirely), but rather patch 2.10, which has effectively turned Voltar, the only straight up healer in the game and a solid contender for one of the best supports in any multiplayer game, into a useless squishy blob with no pushing capabilites, no speed, no maneuveribility, and most importantly, an ineffective medic. The one mechanic that was changed to improve him was his increase in DPS for his Drone ability, which works- for anything left completely alone or an afk player, because his drones will actively target everything on the map other than actual threats coming up on top of you.Buy this game on sale, it goes for 90% fairly often, but don't expect to be playing this game for more than a couple of weeks- the magic will wear off and you'll find yourself left with a mediocre game that doesn't know what it wants to be, and never will as a long as Ronimo keeps on addressing problems that the vocal few ""fans"" keep bringing up, instead of taking a good hard look at the product and figuring out what needs to change.

												I gave this game so many chances, and after everything I just feel tired and extremely disappointed. Sure, the game is fun, but what good is it when most of the games you lose are not because you're bad and they are good, you lose them because of lag and unfair matchmaking.			"

												I used to love playing Awesomenauts, but that was only when it was at it's beginning stages and had some good gameplay and balance (It wasn't perfect but it worked). It's now 3 years after I purchased the game and I would never go near it again. The community isn't the best fall of salty users that get butt hurt over one lose on their account and refuses to ever take the blame that they actually were the fault to the lost. There is most likely 1-2% people that play the game that are actually nice and i'm very good friends with to this day. The balance has gone and looks as if it's never coming back, Romino seem to care more about making the game look good in screenshots then when actually playing it. The devs are lazy unless something is really broken and stops people from playing and they start to care because they lose money.- Ronimo asked the community for a kickstarter goal of $300,000 to created a simple DLC... which ended up reaching over $500,000!- The DLC content literally could have been done for free and then the DLC sold because they did nothing other than create some new characters.. which they do for free randomly all time!- The DLC ""nauts"" are usally broken and op when first released, seems to happening everytime a new DLC ""naut"" comes out but never when a standard free ""naut"" is released. *cough p2w? *cough*Long story short, save your money for a game where it's devs care about the community and the gameplay of their game and not just about making money.

-Quick Review-Awesomenauts is a 2D MOBA (Multiplayer online battle arena), with a strong sense of progression, and a lot of different dynamics that can be taken into account. I don't really have anything negative to say about the game, read on if you want to know more specifics! -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  Two sides are at war, choose your awesomenaut and ship out and defeat the other team! As you would expect from a game based completely on battling there isn't much to explain about the story, there is a nice opening cinematic that has a hilarious similar to a Power Rangers episode, but other than that the game is mostly an exchange of  going back and forward fighting indefinitely.Game Play: The controls are best explained while playing the game. the movement is ASDW, you can use W or space to jump, some characters have a double jump, some fly. You use both mouse buttons and the scroll lock click to use various abilities. The button configuration is very toned down, you're limited on what abilities you can use, and before you start the game you select the abilities you want to unlock as you play the game.Okay, now I should say something about the various characters, there are A LOT of characters which might compliment your play style. I tried them all while playing ""offline practice mode"", I found my favorite character and then intended to play as that character until I became very familiar with the game.As you play through the game (even playing offline practice mode) you will received experience that will unlock new awesomenauts and abilities for your awesomenauts. This element in the game gives me a very strong sense of progression throughout the game. (coupled with getting a lot of easy-to-earn-achievements that I earned while playing offline! (Thank you for that Awesomenauts!)I keep talking about ""offline practice mode"", the reason I do is because I spent a lot of time playing in this mode before starting the game. When I first played this game I tried to play it with my friend, we were both equally noobish at what was going on, I didn't even know this was a MOBA! So naturally we got ourselves massacred. :( Left a bad taste in my mouth......But! after I discovered offline practice mode, I learned on my own without looking up guides how I wanted to play the game. Naturally if I wanted to get better guides would help, but I like to think I'm a fairly competent gamer, playing offline let me try out various characters and strategies without dragging down my team. You can adjust the AI to make practice easier or more difficult depending on your confidence.A final note about playing through the game, you start the game out with ""solar"" or ""coins"", you collect more of these from killing various npc / players, as you collect more, you return to your base to purchase upgrades for your awesomenaut making him/her stronger. knowing which ones to upgrade and which ones to select take practice, guides, or strategy. Once again, if you want to actually learn the game, try out offline practice mode to see what I mean! :D Achievements: I got a bit ahead of myself earlier with a note about the achievements. They were mostly straightforward:  Win games, play games, taunt your enemy, go on a crazy killing spree, hoard up Solar (in-game currency) and then the rest are pretty much grind grind grind. Grind creep kills, grind turret kills, grind online game wins.Most of the simple achievements are simple, most of the grinding achievements you should just play the game to enjoy the game, let those grindy achievements happen if they happen. That is Atratzu's suggestion for this game's achievements. Price: Awesomenauts costs $9.99, So far (08/16/14) I've played 5.7 hours. I've really enjoyed learning how the game works, but my ""value system"" dictates that I need to spend at least 9 hours in the game to make it worth-my-while. I definitely think this game has that type of replay-ability.As always, I recommend buying games when they're on sale, or getting them in humble bundles, I was given this game as a gift from one of my friends (You know who you are). And we haven't gotten around to playing together, but this game would really be fun to play with friends. Conclusion: Coming into this review, I knew from the start that I didn't really have anything negative to say about the game. *IF* there was one thing I would like to have in the game that I didn't have, I would like to play offline practice with my friends over steam, but that doesn't take away from the game in any way.Once again, story was ""meh"" but amusing, game play was ""engaging different and fun"", achievements were ""okay"", and the price was ""fair"". I recommend this game to anyone who likes 2D platformers, and competitive battle games. If you would like to play it sometime with me, you're welcome to do so; I intend to continue playing this game over time. I really enjoyed it.			"

												There wasn't alot of active players to begin with, now I'd imagine the amount has halved. First when I saw the upcoming xp system, I knew it was going to be bad. Most matches seemed pretty fair, sometimes when the other team got ahead of you in cash, you'd still be able to manage and even win. Now, whoever gets ahead first with exp and cash, will dominate, as if it wasn't hard enough to make a comeback before. I think the bringing of the xp system was a desperate move to get more players playing the game, to make it appeal to a wider audience. That brings me back to the begining of my review, the game's diminishing population and small community of active players. That said, personally I think the xp system is the final nail in the coffin. Probably won't ever return to this game. I think it is time for me to put this particular game to rest in my games library.			"

												I have played this game for years... Almost since it was released. I really enjoyed it, because of the style and the mechanics, but sadly what I have experienced is that it did not get better after a time. The community became toxic, players are not friendly at all. Also, matchmaking is taking too long, it really pushes you out of the ""drive"". If you don't have players that keep you in the game, then what's the use of playing this? I do recommend trying this game, but be aware you might feel dissapointed at the end...			"

												TL,DR version : Nice graphics and great music hiding an unbalanced mess with inefficient matchmaking. Avoid!As you may noticed, I spent ample of time in this game, coming back every so often to see what changed. I played until I was max level  / prestige to ensure I was certain how I felt about this game. The last few games I played cemented it. My conclusion: Nope. Not worth it.Firstly, as you may guess, it's a MOBA-type game on a 2D gaming plane. 2 bases, 2 lanes with a “jungle” somewhere. Thus it's normal there isn't a single player mode. Yes you can play vs bots and you can make them as hard as real people. But the main meat of this game is the multiplayer. You will unlock the 16 characters on 5 maps (4 of them are on a paid DLC)  Unlocking them all is just a matter of playing and acquiring solar, the in-game currency / experience. Gaining solar is easy as it's both in-match currency and experience out of it. Levels are quick and more often than not you will gain 2-4 levels per reasonably normal match. After unlocking characters and maps, you will unlock items to change how your skills are in-game. At 133 levels plus 10 prestige levels, it takes a long time to max out.The characters themselves are cool  in and of themselves. Each has a backstory into how and why they joined the Awesomenauts and their own personality often reflected in the game. All of them spout off random memes and typical nerd references here and there. Some of the (purchasable) skins they have even refer to other games, movies and tv series. Pretty cool overall.Graphics, voice over and music are quite good. Several famous youtubers voiced some of the characters, adding a nice familiar touch for those that are fans of said youtubers. The music also does explain why I kept returning : achieving a rampage (3 kills without death) gives you a rampage background song of your character's theme. Only you hear this remixed song and it adds a nice touch of encouragement for your accomplishement. Should your team really steamroll the other, you are awarded with ""You are awesome!"" text and the intro music will start playing instead. Often I would find myself listening to such and such character's songs on youtube, Skolldir theme being a personal favorite of mine. Now for the bad : first the characters feel unbalanced. Some were nerfed to near uselessness and others never properly balanced and retain their unfair advantages. And don't expect patches to balance them... They come every 4-6 months. The reason why so long? MOAR SKINS DLC!  Enjoy seeing the same characters winning constantly.Matchmaking feels completely arbitrary : you often play against or with people that outclass the others (i.e. out of the ""league"" you play) which leads to steamrolled games. Of course one can explain this as the player base slowly moving on but still hard for new players to even start off. Quitting has no real penalty so players do it left and right. What penalties you ask? No win bonus on your next victory and a ""loss of ranking"". Read the first phrase of this paragraph if you don't understand how ironic it is.For the player base, it's a mixed bag. Most of the games, the chat will be unused short of the GGs at the end. In rare occurrences, you might have a bit of a conversation and some laughs when all players chat up. In others, some ""player"" (I refuse to acknowledge someone that willingly abuses of a system in a game a player)  will decide that spamming all the voice commands is required to fully control the game. 3 out of 4 are team based and the last is a taunt to the opposing team. But said taunt can also be heard by the playing team thus adding more to the spam. As one person starts, others will also start and continue forth resulting into a spam-o-thon. Unfortunately, there are no squelching in this game. Hope you like hearing that audio spam! Oh wait quitting out of the match is still a viable solution. Thank goodness!All in all,  don't. There are better games both within Steam and even out of it that can satisfy both a MOBA-type of gamers and platformer gamers without resorting to this one. This one looks nice but it's inner layers hide such frustrating flaws that ruin the overall coolness.Final silly thoughs : I sometimes imagine this game as a Saturday morning cartoon. The settings does make it viable and will the menagerie of quirky characters...			"

First of all - if you are another fanboy who get butthurt by all negative reviews - make your own with your opinion about this game, instead of thumb down. Or welcome to commentaries with criticism. Thanks------------------------Okay, its my 4 review for this game, first 2 was positive, then ronimo broke few things and its changed to negative. So...Obliviosly its sidescrolling MOBA. If you dont like dota (me too), but fan of action platformers - its may be your cup of tea. But 1st - few things you must know about it:Pros:- Graphics. Its rlly stylish 2d game with lots of EXPLOSIONS (not like in broforce, but anyways :D). Every naut has its own design (also few different skins, you can buy (changes only visuals), if you dont like default one), two different types of each skins (for blue and red teams), other things looks cool too.- Sound. Every naut has its own voice, sfxes and ost. Lone will pew-pew-pew, derpl - mew-mew-mew :D- Action. Its actually one of mostly action games I've ever played. If you think ""yay, its casual moba with only 2 skills and 2 moves! I ll beat them all easy!"" - you wont be right. Its WONT works after 6 league and you needs to use your hands and brains to win. Sadly, you wont win, using these things only, cuz of...Cons:- Lags. At 1st - its p2p game (like dota). But its netcode sux and matchmaking searching too. For example - you cant set ""maximum ping to search"" - only regions. Second thing is none cares about your settings - you can set ""same region only"", but if you will be host - latinos with 600ms will connect to you anyways.- Disbalance. Second thing, why lot of players left. Some nauts are easier to play, some harder... Balance, for me = simple formula ""skills+build"". But some nauts requires 0 skills to play and win as them. For example - Ayla. I seen lots of Aylas, who feeds until mid game, then got enough solar to buy all they need and starts to kill everyone, cuz mid-game ayla = very fast + life stealing + deals over 9k dmg/s by self-aoe skill, sized as 1/3 of screen.- Matchmaking. I said about lags, but its not only problem. Situations, when you have 2 league 8 guys in your team vs 3 league 4 guys in opposite arent rare. Also none cares about rating, so - you may be on 3k+ vs guy with 500 rate in other team. Also - you cant uncheck connection to started matches, so - your butt will burn 2 much, when you ll connect to matches on last seconds of them.- Premades. Thing, you will meet in league 4+. Guys, who plays with skype/teamspeak - there are almost no ways to♥♥♥♥♥♥them with randoms.- Splitscreens. Opposite side of teamwork - guys, who plays with splitscreen. If you have them in your team, you can insta-leave - this game is almost unplayable with controller and splitscreen players will care only about their mates irl, so - no teamwork too.I also could say about adv-like messages every 1 min on full window, if you plays multiplayer with bots, warping guys and 2.5 cheaters, but I wont. This game is fun for first 100 hours. Then you will drop it or play with pain in your butt. Sadly ronimo doesnt care about balance, servers and better matchmaking, so - I, for example, ll finish all achievements (7 left) and then drop it, like 70% of community.------------UPD 03 Dec:New update is terrible. In fact - Ronimo did things, nobody asked for - broke exists system with new unbalanced XP (right now you can insta-leave, if someone in your team died at least once, cuz its almost impossible to win vs higher lvl team. Bonuses for leveling are extremely high and its very fast) and turned balance to more horrorible one (simply killed all nauts with ""safe"" style). Also, new UI looks like drawn by someone, who never played video games before.After years of trying, Ronimo did it - Im moved this game to ""trash"" folder into my library.RIP Awesomenauts "

												Enjoy the idea of MOBAs but just aren't any good at RTS games? No problem. Ronimo got your back. By fusing the MOBA concept with a 2D platformer, they made a game that's quite simply: Awesome!There are some issues of course, mainly the matchmaking system. But just like LoL before it, it has improved a lot since it launched. Like most MOBAs, it's still preferable to be played with friends but at least the community isn't as nasty as most other online games. From my personal experience anyway. On the more technical side, the game is really pretty. The animation is really smooth, and the art direction is top notch, provided you like the idea of playing a game that satires 80s saturday morning cartoons. I definitely recommend this game to anyone with an interest in MOBAs or online multiplayer games.			"

												its clear from playing for only a few hundred hours this game has potential but unfortunatley the devs cannot properly balance characters proplerly , and have little idea how to implement certain skills for the characters. some characteres have loads of skill and versatility others have very little.matchmaking is a joke too, being pared with people of little skill only to find that you loose the game to find your ranking decreases to be paired with even worse people. how i got through league 3 to 2 is simply amazing but im stil being paried with people from leagues 4 and 5 who cannot hold there own as a group let alone god forbid they stray from the pack.. awful awful game. if they ever do soemthing about the yuri carry and his hoover up money bendy slowing laser with a heal and slow bubble whilst flying and laying 10plus mines everywhere that might be a start. also the stealth characters need a change as permament stealth is a game breaker, even more so when u factor in that there is no direct counter to stealth play, not a singe character or perk is available to counter stealth.finally this is apparantly  a recent change, the xp levlling system, what a joke , if your team is identical but behind in levels you will do less damage and have less health. so what do people do early on rush out and try to get kills cause they beleive that this will give them an advatage. so invariably people die a lot, feed get fed up and then leave ruining the game for everyone else. if the levelling bonus was not implemented until level 5  so that no increase to stats was available till level 5 i could understand , it might stop the intial reckles push early game as not all nauts scale the same way early on, some are very slow to build up and take time and money (in game) so a few early deaths mean that it cna be over very soon. this is apparantly wht the devs wanted to speed games up, but essentially it becomes a white wash with very few comebacks at being made if even possible. my opinion if the developers actually want a game that plays well and is popular they might want to start looking at character versatility.ps look at some of the older chars, raelyn has to be the weakest naut in the game now, absolutely no real abililty to counter anyone successfuly, shes a glass cannon which can be easily shut down or down right avoided, my own personal opinion is that she of all other chars needs a complete re work to the way she should be played, less damage maybe and more skills to employ, like a choice on snipe to break stealth, or a rift that goes both up and down or damage over time on succsesful hit. or hell maybe even the ablilty to clear a lane of droids like she used to be able to do but now her damage is so weak and pathetic against driods she can barely clear unles she uses rift and then she is defensless. what about a choice of penetration or a better sniping sheild, maybe a shield that only expose the back of the character, or one that is made of the same stuff as skrees turret god knows that when that is dropped it takes an eternity to destroy it single handedleyher blaster has the option for penetration but does not do so for turrets this ought to change too if its got penetration then it should do exaclty thatawful awful game avoid, unless its on offer at 90pence or something silly like thatps the new map they have made is bloody awful too, not much right with awful nauts these days and ive only done 300 hours or so, probly wont be doing much more im glad to sayalso the number of disconnects which cause your rank to decrease are all unforgivable , if they had this game with a proper server instead of peer to peer that might  help but they cannot have dedicated servers apparantly,. if there was a button that was worse than not recommend i would have selected that as the ""no"" does not seem to convey the awful feeling you will get playing this game post 2.13 patch avoid unless very very cheap			"

												This game has many problems ranging from lack of maps that are playable on online multiplayer, lack of options to kick people from your game, long waits for the matches to start (there is not even a room for people to wait the matches at like many other games have), late joins with the game basically over, force starts, patches that throw the game completely out of balance, lack of commitment of the developers with the gameplay aspects of the game (they prefer to develop skins again and again and again instead of making their product better, in a business model inspired in EA Sports - in their ultimate team BS that adds nothing to the game), lack of options of restricting you conection region in a clear way (as ""same region only"" means not same country, apparently, so that HAD to be clear), tendency of ignoring beta testing and lack of consistent or even acceptable QA testing (even if streamers or any conscient player could - and do - tell them what will work and what won't) to constant inconsistent tweaking in the available characters. Besides that the community that buys the game is quite toxic and there is no incentive into making it less so. The game has an interesting gameplay, even with the developers disregard and lack care  about the most important aspect of the game. Overall, a bad experience and neglected (but good) gameplay. After sinking 1000+ hours in the game and after each patch I feel less inclined to believe the promises of fixes, to believe the developers' honesty, or to even play the game.This game is the perfect example, for me, of poor development. I'm sorry, but while I had fun in the beginning, now I just feel frustration, distrust and betrayal. This game is a sad excuse of a game, and I do not feel I'm overstating my case when I say so. I can't recover the time wasted or the money anymore, so I wrote this in hopes that other people do not fall for this trap.EDIT1: After a month and a half I went back to see how the game was. In my opinion nothing significant changed. The characters continue to be unbalanced, the matchmaking got worse (!) and a lot of the needed fixes are still in need. As it has always been with this game, there are promises of fixes in the next patch (it is always the next patch). They still use the same trick: vain promises. I ask myself if they REALLY think they'll expand the player base like that... At least there is a new map. Maybe they think they can compete with DOTA... I think Ronimo needs to make another game. They are small, but they need fresh air in their minds. If they don't they won't be able to evolve; they'll be stuck with only this game forever, and I'm sure they do not want that.EDIT2: The only way to save this game is if it starts being free to play. With an average of less than 500 players playing, the game has become fairly difficult of playing. I always play solo, and I always face teams. And of course they do not quit. It is always a guy from my team that quits. So one can see why I lose a lot lately. Besides that I haven't seen the great ♥♥♥♥ing evolution so many (either naive or dumb) players advertised me would happen. Instead they gave us a very unbalanced and broken map. I'm not playing this game until the next patch - I am not having fun and I wait an hour just to play 4 matches. Also I only play with one character with an old build that was nerfed, and it is really sad I can't play how I used to. As a consolation prize at least I know that I have better games in my library to which I'll dedicate more time. Thanks for that Awesomenauts.			"

												I can safely recommend dont touch this game with a 10 foot pole. The matchmaking has been broken since day one. Ive owned this game for roughly 3 years now. I used to play avidly now i play on and off with a good friend who plays all the time. My friend plays all the time because its become ""their game"" its what they do, do they enjoy it? No. Its like dropping 300 dollars in dota cosmetics. After you put all that time in why quit now?The matchmaking in this game and the community itself is absolutely horrible. In no other game have i seen such a visible line the community. Either someone cares deeply about the game and is nice and interactive and fun to play with or chat. Or they are a toxic troll who will ruin your game. Whoever you get stuck with, totaly random.The matchmaking itself is somthing ive seen no other game do and those games have been succesful for it. In awesomenauts its 3v3 when you start a match. Boom someone leaves your game. You have a bot now. ""Oh like csgo so i can control it if i die."" Well no you cant control it. I havent expereinced the bot AI recently but when i last had to play many-a matches with them they have the AI of a child from a turkey and a potato. Oh you just qued for a game? Lets put you in one thats already going on to replace a bot. This is awesomenauts. 9 times out of 10 you will be qued into a game that is already going on. ""Who wants to start fresh from the beggining of a game? Not me."" -Game DevsIf you own the game dont touch the dlc either. I bought the starstorm dlc in early acess for my friend and me wanting to help the game maybe get better. It didnt. The map they promise in the pack has come out A YEAR LATER. The heros also came out very slowly. You can critize me for buying in to early acess dlc but this is a game that had recieved quite the publicity and funding. Including the likes of the yogscast and totalbiscuit off the top of my head. You recieved maybe 3-4 heros and a map. I dont even know if the map is specific to dlc owners or dlc owners funded it. Theres a new dlc out with new heros. This game used to be great because you had a large hero pool to play from. Now its locking things behind a 10 dollar paywall.The gameplay is alright down to its core. Its a 2d moba or Dota game. With different heros with differnet skill sets that are fairly customizeable, as you level up. Which is strange to lock undeniably better unlocks for different playstyles behind a leveling up system, which you then loose all these levels if you decide to prestige. Prestige is there idea of end game for people that have played it out enough. Personaly ive never enjoyed prestiging and loosing my progress. In COD you would loose your guns and gernades, etc and receive the basics agian. The same stands true for this and there truely are some undeniably better upgrades for heros later on.Edit: After reading a couple other reviews i forgot about the new system. In game team levels. A concept ripped straight from heros of the storm (a horrible game doing poorly) your team shares ""xp"" gotten from being around creeps that are dieing, this includes heros. Well if your team starts to fall behind, this level system gives the team more damage and health. If your behind look at you, you start loosing more and more, suddenly the levels are 5 to 9. The damage and health is minimal. Say 2% more each level. But why? What is the real purpose? If its so small why add it? And it doesnt even help the team thats behind in anyway it just makes it wose. And its already challenging enough to come back as it is.TLDR: Community bad. Matchmaking bad. Gameplay Ok/ DLC is overpriced and ruining the core game			"

												You are probably saying to yourself ""why would I buy this game when clearly there are better MOBA's like LOL or Dota 2? Why would I go through the trouble of paying for this game when I could play them?"" Well if you have found yourself asking that I have plenty of reasons why Awesomenauts is far greater than any MOBA I have played before.To begin with I find the community absolutely great. There is the occasional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who will scream ""Lol you suck"" in chat but apart from that I find that Awesomenauts attracts a great deal of funny and good sportsmanship players. I don't really have too many MOBA's I have played to compare communities with but I played one game of Dota and it had me being called a ♥♥♥♥ing noob and... yeah so I never played again. I'm not too sure if I just got unlucky but it didn't seem like a great community of people to be playing with. Everyone (well most) in Awesomenauts just want to have fun!Then there is the way the game looks detail wise. This may just be me but I find myself looking in wonder at all the detail the developers put into the game, no cartoon games should look this good. All the little things that I just can't help but really apreciate. How the background is animated, how in one of the maps you can see sunlight flaring through the trees. The way the water captures your characters reflection seems so awesome compared to other games I have played with water. Also something I really like about the character selection screen is how the characters animate and shine.Ronimo has done an amazing job creating so many characters all with completely different attack skills and ways to help out your team. I often find that people will always complain in chat about how overpowered a character is and yet I have seen every character be played so well. It really matters on how you use a certain character however some have a huge variation to how you can use them. This gives it a ginormous strategy aspect to the game (as most MOBA's do).So to sum it all up if you want to get that warm fuzzy feeling you get after killing someone in a video game try this game because every time I kill someone I feel like I have just gotten a cookie. And if you have given up on playing MOBA's because of how people treat you over the internet give this game a go, it will surprise you.			"

												Fun for a game now and again. But if you want to play a moba where the devs pay attention to what the players want, how the game should be balanced, or I don't know, care. This is not the moba for you. With the only thing resembling a competititve scene being dominated by 99c, and the ""Prestigious League 1 for the 250 best players"" is a total joke. The game isn't hard, the queues and matchmaking are awful to put it lightly. Combine that with very few characters to play, let alone are viable. One of the 'draws' of the game is that it has a very low skill ceiling and a high skill floor, and is supposedly easy for new players to enjoy and play. Again, this is not true. The difference between a good team and a bad team is noticable immediately into the game, and has very little to keep the player playing. The unlock system is completely arbirtary. See, while other mobas like League or SMITE force you to play the game for a while to unlock the things you want, you get to choose what things you want. In Awesomenauts, you have no choice whatsoever about what you unlock. Are you a frog player? Do you see all of these fancy items and great builds that other frogs have? Do you want those items? Well you're going to have to play about 30-35 hours of the game before you can get to that point, oh and I should mention that you can unlock these things faster for winning games, which is near impossible with the disgustingly bad stock items. As for the matchmaking, it's total trash. The matchmaking servers matches you with player within 2 leagues above and below you. Let's take the average League 3 player, not outstandingly good, but still good enough to be about top 8000. You can get matches with anyone from League 5 (roughly top 20000) to League 1 (top 250). If the game can't find anyone within those 5 leagues you can be matched in, it will take literally anyone and put them in your game, for better or for worse. Now this wouldn't be an issue with the game, if it had draws to keep players playing (which it doesnt) achieving League 1 wouldn't be hard if it weren't for the outright broken matchmaking, and even then so few tournaments are held with so small prizes almost always dominated by the same 3 or 4 teams. The devs have absolutely no direction and little involvement with the community, the game is easy with little to no reward for being good, matchmaking and soloqueueing is cancerous beyond description, I haven't even touched on the DLC which for $10 awards players with 4 characters who are absolutely dominant in the current meta (if this game could even be considered as having a meta), the balance is constantly changing with every patch and the devs are putting time into things noone cares about, games are near impossible to win if you're on your backfoot in even the first 5 minutes, everything about this game is maddening to say the least. If you want a good F2P moba, go play Dota 2. If you want a moba thats easy to get into, go back to Call of Duty.			"

												The game is incredibly fun. It is a cross between a Platformer and a Moba. Two of my favourite genres.The characters feel unique and the in-game music is fantastic. You can never get tired of the killing spree music.Compared to other Mobas this feels easier and more fun to pick up. The item builds are more straightforward, so I never felt the need to look up any guides or anything. If anything figuring stuff out on my own has made me a better player.This is a bit more twitch reflex, fast paced Moba.Since the matchmaking update, you get better matches and less ping  between players. Though be warned that if you live in an area where there aren't a lot of players matchmaking might match you with bots as there are no suitable players for you to be matched with. I haven't had issues with this my self. But had a couple of friends who couldn't get a match after the matchmaking update. Mainly people outside EU and US have been having such issues. Also as any other moba, people are pretty childish and will not hesitate to waste their energy to insult you. If you feel affercted by toxicity, there is an option to disable the chat altogether.Ronimo is, in my experience, a very transparent company and has continued to improve the game through years. Sometimes it means they make a big change and it might upset some people, but overall they have continued to improve and support the game for years. Which is more than I can say about a lot of other more major developers who have abandoned their games and communities.I would recommend anyone who enjoys Moba or Platformer genre to give this game a try. Base game is often on sale, so I would recommend  putting it on your wishlist and trying it out.			"

												A fun twist on the MOBA genre, adding platforming skills to the set of skills required in the genre. While lacking as big of a roster as other MOBAs, each individual character is unique and offers an approach for almost every player. The gameplay is also more geared towards a wider audience, with there being only two lanes to attack/defend and only 3 types of attacks for each character to use. Setting up a controller is a bit of a pain, but for the most part the controls work fine if you desire to use a controller.Overall, it's a really well-polished game! Almost everything has a distinct outline to it, most notably the colourful character sprites. The polish patch adds a few extra shiny things as well, updating some particle effects and more visual confirmations on damage and solar (the in-game currency) picked up. Each map is well-designed, each offering enough variety to set them apart. All of them are a blast to play on.And the sounds of the game are also top-notch. To add to the already stylised look of the game, each character has his/her own theme song, which does a good job at giving them more of a personality. These theme songs are then given remixes (for the most part) that play whenever that character goes on a killing spree, rewarding the player for playing well and making them feel awesome! The stages also have their own themes, matching how they look very well, and the theme song of the game itself is nothing short of spectacular!My verdict would be a 'Yes, totally worth buying'. The game especially enderes to those who may not be that familiar with the MOBA genre and want to start familiarising themselves with it, so if that is you then I'd highly recommend checking Awesomenauts out. Even more advanced players can find enjoyment from the game, with the ability to team up with two other friends and offer a tough co-ordinated fight to the other teams.			"

												A few things to expect if you buy Awesomenauts:The matchmaking issues have never been fixed.  There is no unranked play.  You frequently get matched in to ongoing games.  When the community is at its usual height (meaning not during a sale) you will very frequently get dropped in to matches that are well beyond lost.  Quitting out and re-queuing will often get you dropped right back in to the same FUBAR match.  You'll find yourself playing with bots against a premade team more often than 'naut.  When there is not a sale, a majority of the active players are very experienced.  They will let you know that power creep has made many of the base characters pretty useless.  Without Starstorm, you'll find yourself on the receiving end of a lot of beatings.  There are a couple of base characters that see a good amount of high-end play, but ask yourself if you really plan to commit that much time to this game.  The pool of honestly useful characters is pretty limited.There are no dedicated servers. There are no region settings.   This results in a lot of games where ping will be 200 or greater.  You'll be stuttering around slowly while the other team ruins your day.  And it will happen a lot.I've not played with the Overdrive expansion, but I don't see any of its characters topping any leaderboards.I've seen plenty of rumblings that the new XP system causes some real matchmaking inequality.  Remember, there is no unranked play.  The learning curve of any MOBA is pretty steep, and it gets much worse when you're stuck in a constant stream of losing matches with only bots on your team to teach you.If you can overlook these faults, the game is mechanically sound and visually appealing.  The original music is mostly pretty great.			"

												I preordered this game, and I can safely say, even after however many updates it's had, it's still unbalanced as ♥♥♥♥.EDIT: Came back to the game after about half a year, and it's still♥♥♥♥♥♥ Major balancing issues, lack of dedicated servers means that if you have a bad host, you're lagged to hell, and the cesspool of a toxic community is the most awful I've seen in any game thus far.There's so much wrong with this game that could've been so easily fixed, but Ronimo won't get their heads out of their ♥♥♥♥ing asses and stop making skins/new characters. They could easily focus on balancing the old ones and creating a new server system to reduce an average of 150 ping each time, but no. This game is slowly turning into a selfish money-grab with each update, adding more and more skins/paid for characters each time.I'm done giving Awesomenauts anymore chances. This game will always be♥♥♥♥♥♥ not worth ANY money.			"

Let me start. I join a game after a win, in which the enemy team had all disconnected and not received any punishment for it. I was happy. Then, after what seemed to be a good looking match, a Leon, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little chameleon with no♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ joins in an empty slot on the enemy team. He doesn't buy any items, and jumps strait into battle. Our tank, Skolldir (who happens to be on my friends list) dies, as he underestimated the power of this newly joined player, and then disconnects, messaging me saying that his awesomenauts crashed. The Leon immediately teleports back to base, and gets nearly full build. Without having any strategy or knowledge of the current match, he jumps out from behind out turret, and gets a triple (including the bot who replaced skolldir). In chat, the furry little mongrel ♥♥♥♥es all over the place, and smears some on my shirt. CHEERS BIG EARSHe then hands me a bannana. But the trouble was, the BANNANA was slippery, and sticky, and the peeeeeeel came off in soggy lumps that I could push into my mouth. ""Eat it,"" he says, "" I don't  want to,"" I reply. Then, suddenly, dad's hand DARTS accross the table, ""I'll eat it,"" he says.

												Straight out of the marsh pond ghetto's of planet Ribit IV comes the amphibious B.I.G., also known as Nate Frogg, but mostly known as Froggy G. Growing up in the baddest part of town, struggle and incarceration surrounded Froggy from an early age. Taking part in his first swim-by shoot out as a tadpole, Froggy seemed destined for a life of crime and prison. After a bloody gangwar with the neighbouring Toad-unit posse ended in a 5 year jail sentence, Froggy G vowed to end his gangsta ways. Instead, Froggy G started earning his keep as a beatboxing streetdancer and rapper, hoping to be picked up by a major record label. Unfortunately, his tracks, titled ""Pond Pimpin'"", ""Froggin' dirty"" and ""Motherfrogger bounce!"" didn't earn him much.In order to make some money, and then make some mo', Froggy G became a hired gun. Combining his shoot-out experiences with lethal watery dance-moves and beatboxing techniques, Froggy G now spins and dashes across intergalactic battlefields, droppin foo's left and right with his fishgun, hoping to make some money to take his momma out of the hood.

												DO NOT LET THE PLAYERS DICTATE YOUR DECISION ON PURCHASING/PLAYING THIS GAME! ALSO, THIS IS, AT ITS CORE,  A PVP GAME! WHICH IS ONE OF THE BEST OF ITS KIND ON STEAM IN MY OPINION! ITS PRIMARY FLAW IS LACK OF PLAYERS. PLEASE PLAY!! EACH NEW PLAYER IMPROVES THE GAME!Disclaimers.In truth, this game is incredibly, addictingly fun. A very well thought out game. The develop team works very hard to maintain a balance in the game (Even though sajd team gets heckled way too much by its community). The visuals are bright, poppy, nostaligic, and fun. If you are around my age (29), then you remember the Saturday morning cartoons we watched while growing up --the chatacters really resemble that. The concept and execution of the game is also impressive. There are too many PvP games on the market, so much so, its confusing and annoying. AWESOMENAUTS remains to be unique among them all --freshness exudes from this title (If you have never played - PLAY!). Now: Once you break through the game's lucid learning curve, combat and manuevering opens up in a new way. Your emotions become involved. Patience is the essence of Awesomenauts. This can be a curse and a boon for all players. The frustration - the desire to win - keeps you playing, however, you feel a distinct anger dyring the interaction (Depending on how deep you get into the game/how well your team is doing).PVP: Player versus Player.PVP is actually a young concept in the video game society, which has recently (Past 5 years), become prominent in online mutliplayer gaming. Long story short, the FPS (First Person Shooter) genre was dominated by the likes of Counterstrike, Call of Duty, Gears of War, Halo, etc. which brought upon a staple in online gaming.Awesomenauts is special because of the balanced utiliazation of its pletora of characters through the PvP gaming concept. Coupled with the nostaligic majesty of its side scrolling, old school, you ain't a woman/man till you done played this s%!t demanor, it's a ""worth it"" buy. I won't lie to you, the game is desperate for more players, and as a gamer, I too share that sentiment. But this game deserves that privilege, because of its constant updates (to make the game balanced), addition of characters (Yes, you have to buy the DLC, which is lame, but most of you have paid 60 bucks for a game), Replayability (No, that isn't a word, but this game has it. Gravity wasn't a word/thing/concept at one point), the bittnerness from opposition when your team is domination, and the nostalgia you recieve from prowling though a 2D, side scrolling environment (Makes me think of Mega-man when I was a kid).The learning curve isn't very large. In fact, all characters there are available to play have abilities that are easy to understand and wurks, thus you can figure your role quickly. The way I see this game is a turret defense MOBA (Which is probably what the develpers categorized its as). It's a 3 v 3 battle. The object is to destroy the opoosing turrets to break through to the base. when your team destroys the base, the game is won.Seriously, if you have a fetish for 90s culture, or even remembered the culture fondly, pick the game up.If you love multiplayer --competitive game play, pick it upThink you have what it takes to beat me? Pick it up.This game comes with no gimmicks. Beyond its expansions, you get what you pay for --that is how it sounds.Long  story short - Get the Game-You will be assimilated			"

The maps also have pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ level design such as jump pads which are essentially on every map, so by pressing W you can completely escape getting killed.

												The balance is not right. DLC characters are more powerful than base characters. For example, Yoolip as a mid-range stun-silence-do damage-snare skill. Clunk (a base character) has a skill that do less damage, had to buy the snare upgrade and is close-range. Yes, riskier and closer. That's so balanced.It costs 8€. Yes, we are in 2016 and you have to pay a whole ""expansion"" that contains 3 characters... and only that. That's less content than the previous ""expansion"" which costs 7€ but has overpowered characters and a map (we waited 2 years for the map, 2 years). I will not list all the balance problems but when you have beta at each character release and you are not capable to see a problem like that, it is unacceptable.The matchmaking is worse than a cigaret is for the health. It is expected that an update will change that... it is expected since the dawn of time. The league system is obsolete since it doesn't reflect the real skill of the player, it reflects his victories. Premades have a HUGE advantage even in the ranking.They add skins each 2 weeks (exageration here) but they can't do a map in 2 years (that's not an exageration). Howerer, they did another game for the WiiU (a lost console from 2012 with only Mario games - it's a joke, there is ZombiU-) in the mean time. I have been fooled once with Starstorm, Overdrive will not fool me. I'm pretty sure in the year 3587, Awesomenauts will not be balanced in gameplay or in monetization. And I'm not sure I will see that happening.			"

Heros and skills up grades are locked at the start in a non free to play game and must be unlocked by playing in matches.  The skills that have been locked seem to have been chosen at random and are unlocked in a similar manor.  Only worth touching if your obsessed with MOBA games.			"

												The Game in itself is fun for the first couple of hours. It makes for a decent time killer for me and my girlfriend although for any serious player out there this game is not for you. The Balance between the heros is nearly inexistent and the matchmaking system is plain terrible. Pretty much every games we played was a stomp on either side. the very few time we actually had a fair game it would end up in us defending until the end angaist some invisible hero that would just ship at the generator. Ho yeah there nothing to really counter invisibility. Unless you get lucky with couple of skill that leave some effect on the guy to trace him before he goes invisible, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. No sentry wards like in dota 2 or any ability to reveal heroes. Anyway that would be pointless since you don't see the enemy team comp until it's time to play. That actually kills most of the strategy that we could use in the game. Yet again the game is kinda fun if you take it super casually and you don't mind broken mathmaking that is forced on you. But the second you consider it anything more than a casual unbalanced game it sucks.			"

												What used to be a fun casual game with a chill as hell community has turned into your bog standard eSports wannabe MOBA where more time is spent on making the next shiny ""lol meme"" skin over actually making the game better to play. The game's slowly gone downhill over multiple patches, with each patch making the game progressively more frustrating to play, while not also solving any of the issues in the game. The community the game had at launch was a rather nice crowd where you were more likely to have someone compliment you on something rather than laugh at your slightest fault. Now it's like wading into the cesspools of the rest of the MOBA community, where it's constant non stop betaring over potention faults that may occur because you didn't follow the top rated guide your teammate read the day prior.Also if you lag, you are straight up better at the game than everyone else. So boot up them torrents and download gigs of literally nothing if you decide to throw your money away.Better yet, just throw your money in the god damned trashcan, it's a better investment.			"

												Great 2D MOBA (3 vs 3) with frantic action that keeps you on your toes to the last second of the game. Great character design, well thought-out powers and powerups. Characters feel very different from each other and it takes different tactics to win with each one. I love the local co-op / split screen aspect because it lets me play with my daughter (who's already better than me at this game, sadly for me) and a few friends/family when they pay us a visit.They increased the AI difficulty in one of the latest releases, which makes fighting bots much more interesting (and harder). You can select the AI level in the parameters of the game. It will take you some time to win against the bot on hardest difficulties and before you can contend with real players (and win).			"

												This game is the worst game ive yet too play, you get matched with people who are 100x your level and just play stupid champions who fly around and attack you from a range your character cannot even jump. im lv 8? and i get placed aginst people who are pristeged, This game needs a leveling system like league not some random matching system with who ever plays no wonder the ques take 2 - 5 mins to load a game up and you still get placed with bots.

												Awesomenauts is the MOBA we need - lighthearted, quick to learn, fast-paced and full of joy with its hilarious characters and catchy soundtrack.Oh, and it's 2D. That's right - a platformer MOBA. It's genius.There's something for everybody in this game, whether you prefer a tanky robot, a moth prophet, a space cowboy, a blowfish gangster or a space-surfing alien. Grab a couple friends, jump into a 3v3 match with very little difficulty and see why Awesomenauts will make you forget all the nastiness that exists in other, more traditional MOBAs.			"

												Let me start off by saying that this game in essence is really good and the concepts in play have the potential to be awesome (just like the title), but thats pretty much the end of line. When you first start out in the game you are required to play a tutorial and custom bot game. These two gamemodes (if you could call it that) are actually fun and show off the games potential (potential is the key word). However, the fun of the game is immediatly drained out when you start playing multiplayer for the first time. Everytime I tried to ask questions to my teammates they would ignore me even when they could spare the time in spawn. Then later in the game they accused me of feeding and being a ""noob"" until it became obnoxious even though they couldn't take the time to give even a hint on how to use my character well with theirs. As if they couldn't get to be more cancerous, they then took their ♥♥♥♥♥ing to the general chat (which I assume reaches most of the already dead player base) in which they were able to make everyone leave my team when I attempted to play another game. In conclusion the game is a decent 6/10 that I would have loved to take the time to learn and sink many hours into but it becomes unplayable for new players with the community. Even though the game is cheaper then dog♥♥♥♥♥♥right now DON'T BOTHER, because you would probably want to save your money up for dog♥♥♥♥♥♥instead...In conclusion, if your going to get the game get it for the slightly unbalanced game, but definetly not for the cancerous community.Edit:The game is no longer on sale so it is DEFINITELY NOT WORTH IT!

												For people looking to play this game, I highly suggest looking at other MOBAs. This one is OK for gameplay and fun, but when it comes to the community, it is absolutely horrible. There are people who purposely de-league themselves so they can play on lower league games and pretty much guarantee themselves wins. It is nealy impossible to get anywhere unless you absolutely pour hours upon hours into this game because you want to get better. Chances are, you might not get any better because you're fighting people who are highly advanced in skill level in a low skill-level game. You will not believe how many times you will go up a league, only to immediately drop one because you fought against ex-league 2s or bottom-line 1s. I can never seem to get above rank 8. I reach rank 7, and the next match, I lose and am de-leagued again.Pros? Fun gameplay, graphics are cartoony and nice, the controls are rather smooth, and it makes for a good action platform-jumping, run-n-gun MOBA.Cons? You won't get anywhere with the cheap community it has.. People are not ashamed to admit that they purposely de-league themselves to play lower ranked games. It's rather distasteful and it made me remember why I stopped playing it.Stay away from this game, you won't have any fun because you'll constantly get rolled.Thank you.-Alpha Gamma			"

												I, personally, enjoy this game a whole bunch. It has problems, sure, but it's still so much fun.The game is a 2D moba style game. Now, when you think Moba, you think 60 heroes and too many items and complexity up the bum. I want you to throw those ideas out of the window, because this game is NOT about auto attacking or using abilities, it's about twitch skill, platforming and a whole bunch of other stuff, and it's SO fun to play.However, it has some problems I feel must be mentioned.Firstly, some heroes in the game (called 'Nauts from now on) are absolutely silly and stupid to play against, and when compared to other 'Nauts, are at a big disadvantage. Some 'Nauts are also straight up overpowered, mostly at first, but hopefully the game will be balanced out later.Bring your friends, destroy your enemies, go buy Awesomenauts now!			"

												This is yet another game that I have returned to long after release only to be pleasantly surprised.  I wasn't interested in playing this game whatsoever after trying it on release, as everything seemed extremely unbalanced.  Although the mechanics and ideas behind most of the characters were interesting, there were only a few characters.  This caused the OP characters to be really, really OP.  There wasn't a ranking system yet, so very skilled players would be mixed in with brand new players, making gameplay frustrating for those just entering into Awesomenauts PvP.  They have refined this game into a jewel.  As a long time MOBA player (I have played Smite and LoL extensively, and sampled DOTA, Newearth, and a few others), this MOBA holds a special place in my heart.  The fact that you can modify the base skills to do different things is really a joy - it makes it so that you can tailor your favorite character to counter whatever team you are playing against.  Although the same can be accomplished with items in other MOBAs, the way they approach items in Awesomenauts makes the choices easy and good for a casual, enjoyable experience.  The community seems very welcoming, and the UI is clean and modern.  I love the way the profiles are set up, and am always interested in checking up on my own stats.  The side scrolling aspect will at first pose a challenge for other long time MOBA players, but the new perspective is easily mastered and adds another dimension to gameplay.The variety of maps and the different ""traps"" and features of each is really awesome.  The fact that your spawn timer mostly consists of flying to earth in a rocket ship while picking up solar is badass, and makes staying engaged in the game easy and fun.  I'd definitely suggest this game to anyone looking to pick up a simple, fun MOBA - there's something for both new players looking to learn the ropes of MOBAS, and experienced players looking to just have a bit of relaxing fun.I look forward to playing this game for a long time to come, and purchasing the expansions when I get the chance.

Whether you like mobas or not, this game is fun to try and bot matches are quite the easy time killer.			"

												The short version of this game is that you join a team consisting of 3 characters, and begin trying to kill the hell out of each other until one team gets a big enough advantage to push through a couple massive turrets and destroy their opponents base. The longer version involves a throwback to when cartoons were good (late 80s and most of the early-mid 90s), with silly themes and backtories on all of the characters. Each character has their own unique set of skills and abilities. Each character excells in one way or another. For example, Ayla (the psychotic little alien girl) can create a rage bubble around her which damages enemies nearby while healing her. On the other hand, Derpl Zork (the dumber-than-plankton heir to one of the biggest fortunes in the galexy) can transform his walking desk/secretary/death machine into a turret which can lay down a lot of firepower, including nukes.The games themselves are quick and fun, although the ranking system is imperfect due to a playerbase not large enough to support the higher rank players.

												As someone who has been playing this game ever since it was released on PS3/XBOX 360 back in May 2012, I REALLY want to recommend people to play this game. There is a lot of fun in this game due to the 2D side-scrolling gameplay, which I find very interesting for a MOBA game back in 2012, and the fun characters including new ones (most of which is free) that roll out overtime. The maps can be challenging as cetain characters can take advantage of it. For example, when Ayla's Rage can damage driods under the area of top turrents (which I find BS sometimes) at Ribbit IV. Sentry's Black Hole Sun applies too as this ability can drag and hold players when placed under them despite some form of ground inbetween the players and the hole. Another thing I like is that matches are pretty fast compared to popular MOBAs like League of Legends, DOTA 2, etc. You don't have to spend almost an hour on ONE match. In Awesomenauts, the average match is about 15-20 minutes with the longest I've experienced is about 40 minutes (this is before the XP system).But as I outweigh the pros and cons of this game, I find that the cons are slightly higher than the pros, especially with the new XP system. As some people mention it before, the purpose of the XP is to make matches go faster by creating a snowball effect. Any kills, whether it is creeps, driods, or other players, will raise their team level. On paper, the idea is great since in the past, there were some matches that drag out too long. As for execution, this is debatable. People who win a lot with this system will likely say there's little to no problems with it. People who lose a lot with this system will likely say the XP system is broken and unplayable. Personably, as someone who used to win a lot of games before, I can agree to the fact that this can be a problem. The XP system requires to have little to no mistakes when playing because every kill is exp points for the other team. Pair this up with the WONDERFUL matchmaking, those claims that this is unplayable may have some truth in it. The old system makes you work hard to gain a victory. The new system is on drugs as anybody, no matter what rank/league you are in, can simply win if one team is screwing up. It's subjective to how everyone feels about the XP system, but everyone can agree that this can be frustrating when you are paired up with team members who are either new to the game, new to the character they are playing as, or has no sense of teamwork or coordination. And honestly, I suffered way too much with that. Other things to note is that there are no ranked matches, there is no surrender option, and there are matchmaking issues. For ranked matches, I don't understand why this does not exist since we have leagues/tiers, ranked points, and such. I want to play with experienced people without the need to go over to community and organize games. Not all of us has the time to go over to the fourms and ask if people wany to play. For me, I play it like a lot of multiplayer games: hit the matchmaking button and hope the team you are in is actually good. For surrenders, why isn't this a thing? If a game is going very bad to the point where you and your teammates cannot do anything but feed the enemy team, why can't we be given the option to surrender instead waiting for the enemy team to destroy almost every turrent and finally destroy the base. This happens way too often even though I tried to carry my team. I think we can prevent a good amount of people ragequiting and going AFK instead of waiting for the match to be over. If time is the issue (like people wanting to surrender less than five minutes in the game), then set the limit to activate surrunder at the 8-10 minute mark. For these two issues, it has been almost four years and Ronimo still haven't resolved this, or rather walked around it. Lastly on the AMAZING matchmaking, we can all agree that we had experienced being with bad teammates against very good players or being placed into a match where the team you are in has only one turrent left a handful of times. I understand that Ronimo is trying their best, especially since they are just indie developers, but why not just give us the option to choose a game instead of the matchmaking be random. Why not give us the option to prevent us from joining mid to late games randomly? This is infuriating because I have experienced this crap for so long.It is also note that you lose more rank points if you leave a game versus losing a game (for those of you who care about your rank). While this encourages people to stay in their match and finish it (or wait till you lose), any disconnect is considered a leave. To be clear, leaving a game means losing half the experience points towards your league and unlockable skills (especially if you prestige) when you win a match. It may seem like an annoyance, but this is a warning for people who is tempted to leave a match just to find a game you can win in.I know this is a very long review, but this is a game I have put so much time in since its original release, and only to feel like being stepped on due to these problems. And the thing is, I want this game to succeed. This game has a lot of potential to be a unique MOBA game that is diferent than the typical and popular MOBA games out there. If anything, I want to say that Awesomenauts is my favorite MOBA, but I can't. The game had undergone a lot of changes, for better or worse, over the years, and while it is not as bad as most people who didn't recommend this game says it is, this game still need a lot of tuning, epecially ever since the new XP system. I know the Overdrive expansion is coming soon with it promising better matchmaking. But as it stands right now, be very, very wary when considering to buy this game along with the Starstorm expansion. Wait for a sale if anything.TL;DR: The game is mixed IMO due to frustrating issues, both common and personal, that has not been resolved or has been walked around. Wait for a sale.			"

												Leaving a review for awesomenauts is tricky... In short, it's a 2D platformer MOBA with a 3v3 setup.This game has a couple of obvious downsides:- The matchmaking is unstable during low hours.- The netcode is peer-to-peer, which means that there are no dedicated servers. This leads to advantages for laggers.- Apart from unlocking new characters, there is no late game content.- Because of all these things, the playerbase has been shrinking. This has led to experienced players remaining with the influx of new players being too small to close the gap.So, before buying the game you should consider these points. Nevertheless, I would recommend the game:(- Let it be clear that this game is often on sale for -80% or -90%, which makes the cost ridiculously low.)- The devs have done a very good job at balancing the game. Hear me out. Yes, some nauts feel completely overpowered. The problem with a 3v3 game is that there needs to be a balanced between how powerful the characters are and how slow the game can be. If the nauts are too weak, then nothing would happen. So, each naut carries a lot of power. To newcomers, this may be confusing, especially since they cannot practice with the nauts from the DLC. However, a lot of the OP-ness arises from inexperience with MOBAs. Once you get the hang of the general strategy (don't overextend, push droids, etc.), then no naut will be OP. Yes, some are better than others, but Ronimo has done a terrific job balancing all the nauts.- The game is still fun during peak hours. - The game offers games versus AI, which can be challenging and fun.- The game offers custom game modes, which can definitely be fun (and also good practice). - The game has a strong replay system, which allows you to look at players who were better and then better understand how they played so well.One big problem with the game is the community. It has obtained a nasty way of fatalism. Some veterans are suggesting newbies to get a refund while they can, despite having bought the game during sale (i.e. it being 2 euros/dollars). If you think the game you play isn't worth 2 dollars, then just leave. All in all, this game has given me plenty of fun moments. Like any MOBA, try to accept the fact that you can't always win. Mute players that you don't like, or just turn off the chat. There is so much to enjoy within Awesomenauts; it has given me fun for over a 1000 hours (smurfs combined), and I have gifted the game to many people who went on to invest hundreds of hours in it as well.

												This game is unique. There has never been a game similar to this one.Yes, it follows the basic MOBA formula of creeps/towers/""heroes""/loadout builds/base, but past that everything changes.Mechanically speaking, the game uses a 2D platforming free-side-scrolling approach. You move using the keyboard, and aim/attack using your mouse. Controllers can be used as well, if that's more your style.There are 4 main maps, each with an entirely different layout. Generally, 2 lanes exist, though most maps have open areas and choke-points.The ""heroes"" (nauts) are incredibly different from each other, in terms of abilities and playstyle. There's a chameleon assassin that goes invisible, a russian monkey that flies using a jetpack, a squid that anchors you in place, an overweight viking that hurls you into the air, an all-eating creature that spawns stationary minions, a floating brain that controls a swarm of drones, etc. for a total of 16 nauts, plus an additional 5 in the still growing expansion (the expansion marked a first step towards a continuous development effort, which I mention further ahead, and is not in any way pay-to-win). Each naut has its own learning curve. This makes the game spectacularly varied, as not only are the nauts unique from each other, the 3 naut teams mean there are a huge number of possible combinations, which in turn mean a huge number of approaches to a single match. Not to mention that many nauts can steer their own style in very diverse directions depending on which items they go for in their build.Last, but not least, the game is fun. As the intro makes quite clear, the underlying design theme surrounding the game is not fantasy or sci-fi, but instead a sort of nostalgic-childhood-saturday-morning-cartoon-fun.Competitive? Yes. But also a game in which you can kill a flying monkey by having a fat viking throw an exploding gnome at its face.It is also essential to point out that the developers are still very much working on the game. Yes, it was released back in 2012, but it has evolved immensely throughout the past three years. As you will find if you snoop around the game's website, the developers, who frequently post in the forums, intend to keep working and adding features to the game, while polishing and improving the ones already present. This is a project with long-term goals, and the players are having a blast watching the game grow and having their feedback taken seriously. (this is not early access in any way)All in all, a very fun game, with a great community, a unique design, and surprising strategic and tactical complexity.Grab it. Play it. Love it.tl;dr: fun, unique, surprisingly complex			"

												Game was ruined by a horrible update, such a shame. Comebacks are pretty much inpossible now, first team to get a few early kills will get bounus damage and make it impossible for the other team to do anything. Greate game but horrible patch.			"

												Great game, really is. Just a few issues here and there, and one gamebreaker.PROS:    - Large character selection (especially if you own all of the DLCs)    - Matches can last fairly longCONS:    - Matchmaking. Nobody plays the game anymore (not since a few months after Yogscast reviewed it), so you get matched with gold ranked players when you just play the game casually.    - Hosting. Not sure why they don't have dedicated servers for this, but it causes real issues with lag, disconnects, etc.    - Along the same lines, DISCONNECTS. No matter what I do, more than 50% of the time I spend in a game is spent in the ""Reconnecting"" state. This is a large issue on its own, but it gets worse. When in the ""Reconnecting"" state, YOU CAN STILL TAKE DAMAGE. This has caused my ranking to drop tens of thousands (used to be ranked in the 30,000s, now im in the 50,000s after 3 games.)    - RONIMO. No matter what you do, what the issue is, anything, Ronimo doesn't care. There have been many complaints about many things, and none of them have been acknowledged by Ronimo, meaning they haven't been fixed.If you can get past these issues, its truly a fun game (I know from experience, before my disconnecting issue as well as before the matchmaking unbalanced issue). If you never had these issues, you're one of the lucky ones. Hope you get lucky, cause otherwise, this game ain't worth $0.01, let alone $10. Any review from someone who has more than 100 hours in this game, because those are the kinds of people who no life this game and play ""competetive,"" which shouldn't even be an aspect of this game, as it's not so much competetive as it is raging all the time.

												Okay, I will admit at first I HATED this game... But I will also admit I was bad at it. Really bad. The game has a bit of a learning curve. But now, I like it. I wouldn't quite say I love it, but I'd say it's worth the $10.. even though I got it for 99 cents. :DIt's basically a base/tower defense game with 2D cartoon aliens. I think there's like 20 different characters now, and that's exactly what they all are, different. Each and every character is unique. There are no 2 characters where you think ""Hmm, this one is kinda like that one"" They all look different, and they all have their own special abilities. Pick up solar(games currency) or gain it by killing, and you get to upgrade those abilities.It definately helps to either read up on all the characters abilities, or have an experienced friend to play with you. What you don't know, kills you... Over and over and over.Overall, it's really a good game. I only have one problem with it. Leon. Leon makes me sad. No matter what character I am, no matter how upgraded I am, he finds me, pops out of nowhere, and out-DPMs me no matter what I do. Of all the deaths I have in the game, I'd say 90% are Leon related.Get the game, it's worth it. Not sure? Wait until it goes on sale. But before you make your judgement on whether or not you like it, play every character. That's the secret, you have to find the character that you like and do okay with, then continue to learn and progress from there. Don't just try 1 character and say you hate it, because that's what I did. Learn from my mistakes.P.S. Leon OP, please nerf. 9/10			"

												A game like this would be a really good idea for a story-driven platformer but it works just fine as a side-scrolling, casually competitive multiplayer game. The music is great, the characters are hilarious and the art is very well done. You can play alone against bots if you don't want to play against real people and you'll still be able to level up that way to unlock new characters and abilities. More maps to choose from would be nice for a little more variety, though.			"

Hay 11 Awesomenauts hasta ahora, cada uno totalmente diferente. Está bastante balanceado. Durante el juego vas adquiriendo unas monedas que te sirven para comprar mejoras, las cuales elegís en función a tu estilo de juego.

												If you think this is a watered-down DOTA-like, then you're sadly mistaken. Awesomenauts makes the MOBA (side-note: I hate that term, but it's what everyone calls it, so meh) genre accessible to first time players whilst being hard to master. And on top of the wonderfully deep gameplay, the artwork is absolutely gorgeous-- hand-painted textures galore and a killer soundtrack (each Awesomenaut has their own theme song music that plays when they go on a Kill Streak!). You should get Awesomenauts if any of these apply: 1) You're a MOBA fan, 2) You enjoy games that encourage good teamwork, 3) You want a game with tons of replay-value, and/or 4) You want a game that gets balanced and gets new content added on a regular basis. I couldn't recommend Awesomenauts enough; it's really *that* good-- I've already put in over 100 hours of gametime over the 3 months or so that I've had it, and I plan on pouring many more into it over the coming years. GET IT. PLAY IT. LOVE IT.			"

												I can't realy be considered a ""hardcore"" MOBA player. I recently started playing League of Legends and am enjoying it. But Awesomenauts is something else. It's a MOBA, yes. There are turrets, and minions and you level up over the course of a game. But the way it blends side-scrolling action shooting into the mix really makes it something more. If you've been turned off by LoL or DOTA by the large number of items, jargon and steep learning curve, this game sucessfully removes all of that while still retaining a nice level of depth. The lower number of playable characters makes it so that it's easier to learn them all, though they really play very differently from one another. There is a level of strategy that starts as soon as character selection and building your team. Battles are a lot of fun, and end up being decided more on your skill than your knowledge of the mechanics. While there are interesting combos to perform, and mechanics to master, skill remains the determining factor. There is a leveling system, but you seldom feel at a disadvantage for being a lower level. That being said, the transition from the traditional MOBA stage to a 2D environment is not perfect. The skirmishes often get chaotic quickly, and it can become difficult to see and understand what's going on. Having your character always remain in the center of the screen is helpful, but the visual style can still remain very busy.There has been some critisism that some characters are only available through paid DLC. These cahracters are not too powerful to ruin the game in the slightest. It is a decent way to get funding to expand the game. It in no way ruins the experience if you don't decide to pay. The player base is a lot friendlier than most MOBAs, though there are still some guys who sour the experience. The best way to play the game (like any game, in my opinion) is with friends, preferably with voice chat. Then it becomes a truly fun game to play with people of all skill levels. In playing with a friend for their first time ever, we were sitll able to have a fun time and play competitively against other teams. Plus being well-coordinated as a team really gives an advantage.It's a good enough game that I possibly will gift copies to friends next time it goes on a big sale just so they can enjoy it as well.

												For the better part of two years, I watched this title on the steam market, maybe like you are doing now. Being a pretty enthusiastic videogame consumer, this title seemed to sink into the background for me even when it appeared on the front page after an update. The thing that tripped me up was my conception of what actually constitutes a a ""MOBA"" game. Lateley people seem to think of MOBA games as stemming from some starcraft or warcraft mod with a tedious learning curve, an awful playerbase, and very slow-paced strategic combat.THIS IS NOT THE CASE HERE.Awesomenauts is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena which pits two teams of three agains one another. Each player may choose a character from an evolving list of ""Nauts"" catering to their own unique playstyle. Throughout the match, players are able to purchase upgrades for their characters moveset. Upgrade by killing enemy ""creeps"" (enemy AI units which give gold, aka 'Solar') and kill the ever-loving crap out of the enemy team.As opposed to a conventional MOBA like DoTa 2, there is no long farming phases, the shop system is easily understood, the mechanics are fast and tight direct controls, as opposed to clicking for movement, and the upgrade combinations provide the reletively easy-to-learn movesets with a huge bag of varied playstyles for each character.The action in any given match is literally nonstop from the moment you rocket down in your jetpod. Immediately the teams rush at one another trying to get an early kill for a leg up early on, and everyone brawls making risky chase attempts and desparate retaliations. With every trip to the shop the scales get tipped, and it becomes very easy for a team to go from underdog to victor if teamwork is utilized.As for the features of the game, there are several that set this game apart from an others I've playedLocal Co-op is always a big thing for me. In my opinion, gaming is about  experiencing cool events and challenges as a social event involving more than one person. The fact that I can play this game on the couch -conveniently, even- with my roommate who has never even touched the typical MOBA game is really cool!The Art Style and character concepts are so totally unique, I can't say I've come across anything quite like it. This makes for a fresh new continuity with lots to discover and master!All I can advise for those on the edge about purchasing Awesomenauts is to throw out your conception of an Isometric, slow, boring, grind-fest MOBA and imagine a gale-speed battle of force, reflexes and wits. Awesomenauts is truly the ultimate test of platforming, fighting, and skill.			"

												I cannot recommend this game highly enough.My biggest criticism with MOBAs in general is that there is an extraordinary learning curve built into buying gear.  Awesomenauts does away with this by building brilliant versatility into each character.  The learning curve can still be a bit steep, but it's much more reasonable than Smite or League of Legends.Each Naut is also extraordinarily versatile, especially since the new patch.  I find great new subtleties even after playing so many hours and it's very satisfying.			"

												A MOBA for people who either don't enjoy or are afraid of other deeper games of the genre. Easy to pick up and learn, the matches are short, teams have only 3 members, there's a good number of characters and it's always updating. That alone reduces the potential for stress compared to Dota 2 or League of Legends. You can definitely play this casually every once in while but that's not to say the game lacks depth. Not of great fan of the soundtrack though. The Starstorm expansion is supposed to fix my biggest beef with the game: lack of a dual stick control scheme on gamepads.			"

First, boil away that nasty control scheme, if we were making at RTS that'd be fine, but we want to get rid of that here until we're left with a tasty 2D platformer, but with that unmistakable MOBA flavour. Turn that hour long simmer up to a high heat of 15-20 minutes. Make sure you remove the denying and bizarre item scheme, you can choke on those easily. Add a dash of pop culture, but not too much! Finally, garnish with some delishious 80s cartoon goodness. Delicious!Serves 1 - 6.			"

												What can I saw about Awesomenauts? It's awesome duh!All kidding aside though, I have had so much fun with this game since it released on console and when it released onto PC. It started off as a small fun 2D brawler smash bros/moba hybrib for me, but it grew into something much bigger. It became almost like a home. This game holds one of the best gaming communities I have ever seen, both casual and competitive players are always down for a couple laughs, heck even the developers (Ronimo Games) join in from time to time. I started playing PC when it came out (xbox before that) and remember playing Gnaw because at the time he was new, and he was sooooo cool. Let's face it, biting people's face off and pooping out plants is just this sh*t. From playing I met a bunch of cool people that I still talk with to this day. A few people we even went into business with eachother so to speak form the APL. Although I had to leave the organization and have not been playing 'nauts very much, I still see my time playing as the most fun I have ever had with a game and some of the best people I have met through online gaming. If you are thinking of picking this game up... Just do it. Don't wait. It will be the best 10 bucks you ever spend. Last of all I want to give some shoutouts:First of all Metamist for helping me create the APL, and running the website for me.Naaza, Evan, and Wolfy for helping take the APL to the next level and also allowing me to carry you guys in Dota from time to time. Kewn and all the guys over at Ronimo Games. You guys put up with all my crap and for that I thank you, the APL and 'nauts in general could not of been possible without the support from all of you.The Awesomenauts community for just being kick♥♥♥♥♥overall. P.s - R.I.P Double Cat shot Derpl. You were the best build in the game <3.			"

An 80s/90s Saturday morning cartoon themed 2D MOBA. Gameplay-wise it's a lot of fun. In fact, If you couldn't care less about ranked or climbing the ladder and just want to have a good time PvPing with friends in a game with all the MOBA elements then, by all means, go right ahead. But then, why not ditch the laning & jungling and grab any one of the 261 vastly superior Super Smash Bros. games. I honestly can't recommend this to anyone looking for a serious MOBA. Especially when it doesn't nail the 'massively online' bit. The matchmaking system on ranked (the only mode that matters) is utter balls. The overall online experience is a laggy pile of feces 72% of the time due to the netcode and lack of dedicated servers, and is in desperate need of an overhaul! The TrueSkill rank system is the proverbial cherry on top of it all, ensuring that when you  do  lose because of either of the aforementioned (or both) you'll be severely punished for it. That being said, the game itself can be a ton of fun when played casually either in split-screen or privately with people in the same region.Here's an example of what a session of Awesomenauts is like at the very start of a new season: You solo queue and manage to roflstomp a few games and get placed in the Awesomantium league (league 1). A lag spike here and there, no biggie. You proceed to faceroll some more games, miraculously, without any major issues. Ranking-up a few more spots at a time. But then, inevitably, you get dropped into either:A) the end of a game that's mere seconds away from ending,5) one that's utterly one-sided with absolutely no chance of mounting a comeback,31) lagcity,9) a straight up instant disconnection as soon as you connect due to the host's dial-up Internet access,Q) All the above,resulting in your first loss and (here's the kicker) get set back anywhere from fifty to  HUNDREDS  upon  HUNDREDS  of ranks depending on how much lower the enemy team's players were rank-wise. DCing from a game with a big enough rank gap and you can even throw in a demotion to a league or two down. At this point, re-queueing and attempting to crawl your way back up is not an option. It's very likely that you'd just end up getting shafted again by any/all of the above. Plus, the difference between points earned and points lost is too great to offset anyway.Queueing with friends? Great! Attempting to reconnect back into your game can more often than not result in yet  another  <insert BS here>, which (you guessed it!) sets you back even further. Hours invested down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ all in the span of seconds. A setback from which you have no hope of remedying for the remainder of that season (60 days). Needless to say, this happens every.. single.. season...Now, surely you'd think the devs are aware and on top of the situation. Well, what do they have to say you ask? “Umm.. here's some more $5 skins!! :D”Being a huge MOBA fan since the days of the original DotA and all the hero-based mods on Warcraft III (Hero Wars players where you at), I really loved Awesomenaut's unique 2D spin on the genre, along with its style and music. It's original af and a nice breath of fresh air in a stagnating genre. It really sets itself apart from the current “top” MOBAs like DotA2 and League of Legends which are just blatant knock offs and re-skins of all the mods that kicked off the genre (and that I played to death) and ultimately have nothing new to contribute. So, when I discovered Awesomenauts I overlooked the issues and really tried being patient with the devs in the hopes that they'd sort it all out and get the game out there in a big way. I supported them and even backed their Kickstarter. But, after having been on board for no less than ten seasons, and after countless posts on the forums by the community and their most dedicated players, Ronimo have, and indeed continue to, ignore these glaring issues and treat the game like a pos cash cow. They prioritize working on♥♥♥♥♥♥like an AI editor, a map editor, creating new skins, releasing different in-game announcers, redesigning the UI, and  talking  about the 5th map-- the fabled “Starstorm” map instead. That's when they're not busy further breaking the joke that the game's balance is. During their Kickstarter campaign, they managed to raise over $500,000 and there wasn't so much as a  single  attempt at addressing these issues.So, unless you intend on playing this game with friends, either locally or in private matches online, spare yourself the buttdamage and skip it. Your cash is better spent elsewhere, if at all- there are much,  much  better  free  alternatives out there made by devs that actually give half a♥♥♥♥♥♥(*cough* Heroes of the Storm *cough*).GGs Ronimo! Game had a ton of potential but, sadly, Awesome not.			"

												While I can say it's overall a really neat concept with a 2d MOBA, this game has a bit more focus on slightly more casual play. Along with quite a bit of humour thrown in there.  This would seem like a quite ideal time sink if you want to play between 15+ minutes to whenever really.It is however dragged down quite a lot with it's peer to peer and ranking system... as some games are literally unplayable due to the lag. For example: One character has the ability to make a forward dash, and become immune to damage for a split second. This can be used to counter other characters abilites, such as nukes, mines or even direct hits if you trigger it right. So in other terms: Something that required timing and skill. With the latency, skill doesn't matter. As you can stand next to a mine, just out of reach. Dash clean through it, end up out of reach, then 1-2 seconds later die, because ""you touche a mine, we totes swear."". This lag also can cause no-clips, teleportation or a very common thing: making a blatant miss to hit, whether you dodged it, or are way out of reach. Because you either were in range according to the other player, or you were stuck outside for the others in a ""loading"" state. I don't know much about programming, but it feels like... having a system that checked ""where is character x at 15:42:6 in the game? Back in their base healing? Where did character y's nuke hit at 15:42:6? at the other side of the map? When then it missed."" instead of  the current ""Hey y, did you hit on your screen? Well then, you died x. Kktnxbye!"" So yeah, could definately see some improvements in that sytstem.Otherwise, it is somewhat balanced game. Mechanic wise, they really ought to fix the recovery issues though. The currency loss on death is just pointless, and only is a punishment on a penalty. Only really promoting hostility towards teammates, and making it literally impossible for certain players to catch up, or get a fair chance. As their enemies will have x2-x4 their health, deal about tripple damage, and have plenty more sustain and support. Sorta encouraging ""bullying"", as a team can get a huge advantage by picking out a player in the opposite team, and solely focusing all effort on killing them. As then it's basically a 3v2 game, with one team just being way better than the other. Because they have all the currency. It's not helped that ""try-hards"" or the professional players are in the same bracket. I know this is due to limited amount of players. Especially at certain times. But it utterly ruins the game if you have a casual intent, and run into a maximum cheese, on teamspeak cordinated game, where their team is soelly build to win within 5 mintues, along with making it literally impossible to for your team to do anything about it, as if you even get close to your turret, you die. It doesn't help that cheap, ""I win"" button tactics exist with certain characer combinations.That said, the game is only somewhat balanced as said. As you really have a ""rock, papper, scissor"" system for their characters at times. As some games you can just start, and tell from just looking at what characters both teams have, and conclude that ""yeah, we lost/won"". As regardless of skill, (unless it's waaay much difference, or unless lag is in your favour) those matches will play out like expected. As there's nothing you can do.I know most games got imbalance or issues in one way or another. But Awesomenauts could really do with some sort of handicap, or balancing thing. Along with some better way of dealing with the hosting and PtP. As of now, it's really annoying to see a character use an ability towards you, you clearly dodge it, and then you die, becuse it hit you where you were 1-2 seconds ago. Or when you pick up healing, get the +hp, then die, because according to the other person, you haden't healed for them yet, so their damage was fatal on their side, so the game orders your character to die anyway. This is especially not helped by that many people are either gloating, or rude about this. Always claiming it's ""skill"" when it's positive to them, but suddenly when it's negative for them, it's hax, luck or lag. Becase you know, what's hypocrisy?Know it's mayhaps been a bit seemingly negative view. But I do really like the game. It just has some glaring issues that could do with being addressed. Also wouldn't hurt to impliment the ""Official, unofficial, gg qualifications"" as an actual thing. I know some are against it, but overall, it promotes a fun/good game, and demotes cheap tactics. For those that don't know of it: It's basically that everyone gets at least one kill, one death, and one turret down for both sides. While it can be a bit tricky to pull of ""authentically"". I'd want to suggest making it an archivement to have like, 50-100 games like that, that might could have negative effects... so I can't suggest a good fix to encourage it. But so far, the only good, and really great matches have had these statistics. That, and no gloaters xD Those that had lag in them, at least had the people acknowledge it.But yeah, overall, good game. But comes with a lot of issues.			"

												Man, this game does not get enough attention. Awesomanuts is an incredibly addicting MOBA style cartoony platformer. It's easy to learn, and easier to get good at. If you're looking for a cheap game to enjoy with your friends, find new friends, or generally waste your entire afternoons, get this. Only complaint are the connections. A host is picked randomly for each match, and if that person doesn't have the greastest internet, WELL SUCKS TO BE YOU! Have fun spending the whole game with lag. 9.5/10 would recommend.			"

												Awesomenauts is a 2D 3v3 platforming MOBA with the style of 80s cartoon. I've sunk alot of time into this game and I've had a blast with it, and still do.Pros:-15 Unique characters with thier own upgrades that you can customize to fit your unique playstyle,-Each character has thier own theme music as well as killing spree music-Split screen capable up to 3 players-Controller support, but plays just as awesome with keyboard and mouse-Competitive Community (via the Awesomenauts Pro League)-4 maps with unique platforming and terrian obstacles-AI Modding support to make better bots-Easy to learn, hard to master-Quick matches normally taking 20-30 minutes per match.Cons:-Some of the community can be toxic-A couple of maps favor some nauts better than others-The ""drop-in, drop out"" system of the game which many have faults with because Awesomenauts was originally a ""casual"" MOBA styled game.-Unable to coordinate with your teams before a match begins to see what characters they may be playing as or what map you are playing on next (The first part can be fixed by using a voice comms [Skype, Mumble, TS3, etc])-Some people don't like how you have to obtain XP from completing matches to unlock new characters and loadout items for each character.Notes:There is also an expansion which is in development but will be bringing things like:-Spectator Mode-Replays (Released)-5 characters (4 released)-New map-Custom games to play different modes such as Team Deathmatch-Many other featuresI would also like to add one more note that even if you don't have the expansion, you can join a friend's custom game to play on the new map as well as play custom game modes through joining your friend.Overall rating: 9.5/10 "

												Over-looking a ""glitch"" where Teammates wearing Michael Vick Jerseys named Gary wont shut the hell up, (The mute is available in game by hitting Tab by the way) the game is really darn fun. Every patch introduces new wrinkles and matches are usually competitive. Playing from a 2D side scrolling perspective adds a lot to the genre. The chases and escapes are exhilarating. The team work required to set up kills is especially fun because of the direct control over your characters. The community is okay except for my jerk friend Gary but his parents are divorced so I suppose its to be expected. I have played enough MOBA games in my life to know I really dont care for them. This one is just deep enough with out being boring. If you have cool friends, unlike ""I-smell-like-the-inside-of-a-hockey-skate Gary"" then I cannot recommend enough. Especially if they are familiar with how MOBA style games work.			"

												It is hard to like game like this in my opinion. I mean, I like it a lot, and I am not the only one. Issues this game has are rather big though and can discourage you from playing . If you ever pick this game up, you will be frustrated. you will face lag and inbalance. I am facing these issues as well. But I still keep playing. Why? Because the feeling when you go on killing spree is pricelles. You feel like you did something great, something rewarding. Heck, you get to hear awesome ( most of times) remix of your theme song ( every character has one) when you go on killiing spree. I am not even talking about when you get some cool trick-shoot off, when you score triple kill and when your team goes AWESOME ( your team has to score 15 kills without dying), it is simply something not every multiplayer game has to offer. This is why I keep playing, just to experience these moments again and again. Howere, if you are going to buy this game, play it with friends. It is way more fun to experience those moments with your friend.			"

												It's a fun game to play for a while, but it has very obvious flaws that seem like they would be easily fixable if the devs actually cared.No dedicated servers means that lag or poor connection is a huge issue. About 1/3 of games end with a player disconnecting or just suffering through the game in a region that isn't remotely close to them. I consistently find myself (an East Coast player) playing against Europeans or South Americans regardless of what time I play at. The lag often benefits certain characters, especially Clunk. Additionally, the leveling system is just horrendous. There is no way to get a nice build on most characters without putting a significant amount of time into the game. I would be fine with it if it hardly changed anything but A lot of characters are just god awful without the last two slots in a row being added to a build. I just don't see any reason for it.The game definitely has potential but in its current state it is pretty frustrating.			"

tl;dr -> ""A anemy has been killed. A anemy has been killed. A anemy has been killed."" If you are too noob to play real MOBAs, then this game is for you. 11/10 great gameplay.I had been eyeing this game for a long while, and finally decided to get it during the Winter 2014 sale for myself and a couple of friends. I have been thoroughly impressed and satisfied by Awesomenauts. If you like 2D, platformer-style combat, multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games, 3-versus-3 combat, and a great character selection, then you will really enjoy this game. I STRONGLY recommend this game for anyone interested in diving into the MOBA genre, as it a great starter to begin your education. The game supports local multiplayer, and I plan to play this with my gf to give her a lighter introduction. The aesthetics are fantastic - the amount of detail in the different character models, levels, and skill animations is very well-done. I was very impressed with the music - each character has their own unique theme song that plays during the loading screen and for a short time if you manage to get a decent killing spree going (I am pretty sure it plays for everyone in the game, but I am not 100% certain). The character taunts, sound assets, and announcer dialogue is good, however, whenever an enemy dies it really sounds like the announcer is saying: ""A anemy has been killed,"" and I find this very annoying - especially when he clearly says ""An ally has been killed."" This is most likely a personal experience though, and not a big deal. Each different level offers a different enough layout that your play strategy can change significantly, and this is a huge plus for the game.The controls are simple and easy to familiarize yourself with, however, understanding how each character works may take a bit of practice and time. I strongly suggest you use a controller to play, but the keyboard+mouse combo is sufficient as well. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with MOBA games. Although the tutorial is fairly lengthy - you must do a tutorial, play a bot match, and kill an opponent (bot or real player) in order to unlock your full account (ranks, leaderboards, etc). I approve of this design because it will get new players to the genre better oriented to the unique playstyle, however, it can be very annoying for MOBA veterans (honestly, a single bot match would have sufficed). During gameplay, the goal is to destroy the opponent's drill core, which is located near the opposite end of the map. To reach the core, you must destroy gun towers that block your path. These towers, however, are very powerful against Awesomenauts, so you must wait for your periodically-spawning minions to soak up the damage while you attack. The maps have 2 ""lanes,"" or routes that minions travel through (compared to the typical 3-lane design in most 3D MOBAs). This fits with MOBAS that have a 2v2 or 3v3 match variant, which usually compensate by having only 2 lanes to defend/attack. When you destroy a gun tower, a special, stronger minion will spawn for you and follow the lane where the destroyed tower used to be, allowing you to push (attack) more aggressively.When you spawn, you will take a drop pod from your ship down toward the battlefield. During this interesting segment, you can collect ""solar"" (Awesomenaut currency) along the way. The pattern of solar placement differs by map, but seems to be consistent, so you can memorize the patterns per map. Solar is dropped when enemies are killed, and ""last hitting"" (delivering the death blow) will cause you to automatically pick up any dropped solar. When an Awesomenaut is killed, the killer gets a large amount of solar (70 if memory servers correctly), while all allies get 30 solar. Dying will cause you to lose a small amount of solar. There is no real ""jungling"" option, which is nice because it does not add that complication to this mostly introductory title to the MOBA genre. There is usually a separate portion on each map where neutral minions walk around, and killing them will grant you a quick, small health restoration and a bit of solar. Visiting this area regularly to keep your health up will ensure that you can sustain your lane, allowing you to stay there to continue farming solar. In Awesomenauts, you will not want to return to base to heal unless you have enough solar to buy a new upgrade. The different characters have unique movement - specifically, jump - styles. For example, one character can hover, another can triple jump, and another can fly/hover. You start off with your basic attack, which will be either ranged or melee-based. At the store, you can upgrade your basic attack, as well as skills relevant to your character - like increased health, movement speed, health regeneration, etc. You can also unlock 2 more usable abilities (on the controller, unlocking all abilities will give you an X, Y, and B attack {or square, triangle, circle for you non-microsoft users - like me}). You can only select 3 upgrades per skill, and you initially have 4 upgrades to select from per skill.As you gain account experience (given post-match; more xp is given if you win, naturally), you will unlock more characters to use, as well as more possible upgrades to use. I especially like this design-choice, because it allows people to familiarize themselves with a smaller pool of upgrades before providing them with too many - it also helps people get used to how each character is supposed to be played. The lack of items in this game is good because it allows new players to only have to worry about skills and upgrades. Again, Awesomenauts is a great introductory game to the MOBA genre.Overall, the game plays very, very well and should be played by anyone interested in the MOBA genre. You will not be disappointed.Definitely recommend! Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

tl;dr -> ""A anemy has been killed. A anemy has been killed. A anemy has been killed."" If you are too noob to play real MOBAs, then this game is for you. 11/10 great gameplay.I had been eyeing this game for a long while, and finally decided to get it during the Winter 2014 sale for myself and a couple of friends. I have been thoroughly impressed and satisfied by Awesomenauts. If you like 2D, platformer-style combat, multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games, 3-versus-3 combat, and a great character selection, then you will really enjoy this game. I STRONGLY recommend this game for anyone interested in diving into the MOBA genre, as it a great starter to begin your education. The game supports local multiplayer, and I plan to play this with my gf to give her a lighter introduction. The aesthetics are fantastic - the amount of detail in the different character models, levels, and skill animations is very well-done. I was very impressed with the music - each character has their own unique theme song that plays during the loading screen and for a short time if you manage to get a decent killing spree going (I am pretty sure it plays for everyone in the game, but I am not 100% certain). The character taunts, sound assets, and announcer dialogue is good, however, whenever an enemy dies it really sounds like the announcer is saying: ""A anemy has been killed,"" and I find this very annoying - especially when he clearly says ""An ally has been killed."" This is most likely a personal experience though, and not a big deal. Each different level offers a different enough layout that your play strategy can change significantly, and this is a huge plus for the game.The controls are simple and easy to familiarize yourself with, however, understanding how each character works may take a bit of practice and time. I strongly suggest you use a controller to play, but the keyboard+mouse combo is sufficient as well. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with MOBA games. Although the tutorial is fairly lengthy - you must do a tutorial, play a bot match, and kill an opponent (bot or real player) in order to unlock your full account (ranks, leaderboards, etc). I approve of this design because it will get new players to the genre better oriented to the unique playstyle, however, it can be very annoying for MOBA veterans (honestly, a single bot match would have sufficed). During gameplay, the goal is to destroy the opponent's drill core, which is located near the opposite end of the map. To reach the core, you must destroy gun towers that block your path. These towers, however, are very powerful against Awesomenauts, so you must wait for your periodically-spawning minions to soak up the damage while you attack. The maps have 2 ""lanes,"" or routes that minions travel through (compared to the typical 3-lane design in most 3D MOBAs). This fits with MOBAS that have a 2v2 or 3v3 match variant, which usually compensate by having only 2 lanes to defend/attack. When you destroy a gun tower, a special, stronger minion will spawn for you and follow the lane where the destroyed tower used to be, allowing you to push (attack) more aggressively.When you spawn, you will take a drop pod from your ship down toward the battlefield. During this interesting segment, you can collect ""solar"" (Awesomenaut currency) along the way. The pattern of solar placement differs by map, but seems to be consistent, so you can memorize the patterns per map. Solar is dropped when enemies are killed, and ""last hitting"" (delivering the death blow) will cause you to automatically pick up any dropped solar. When an Awesomenaut is killed, the killer gets a large amount of solar (70 if memory servers correctly), while all allies get 30 solar. Dying will cause you to lose a small amount of solar. There is no real ""jungling"" option, which is nice because it does not add that complication to this mostly introductory title to the MOBA genre. There is usually a separate portion on each map where neutral minions walk around, and killing them will grant you a quick, small health restoration and a bit of solar. Visiting this area regularly to keep your health up will ensure that you can sustain your lane, allowing you to stay there to continue farming solar. In Awesomenauts, you will not want to return to base to heal unless you have enough solar to buy a new upgrade. The different characters have unique movement - specifically, jump - styles. For example, one character can hover, another can triple jump, and another can fly/hover. You start off with your basic attack, which will be either ranged or melee-based. At the store, you can upgrade your basic attack, as well as skills relevant to your character - like increased health, movement speed, health regeneration, etc. You can also unlock 2 more usable abilities (on the controller, unlocking all abilities will give you an X, Y, and B attack {or square, triangle, circle for you non-microsoft users - like me}). You can only select 3 upgrades per skill, and you initially have 4 upgrades to select from per skill.As you gain account experience (given post-match; more xp is given if you win, naturally), you will unlock more characters to use, as well as more possible upgrades to use. I especially like this design-choice, because it allows people to familiarize themselves with a smaller pool of upgrades before providing them with too many - it also helps people get used to how each character is supposed to be played. The lack of items in this game is good because it allows new players to only have to worry about skills and upgrades. Again, Awesomenauts is a great introductory game to the MOBA genre.Overall, the game plays very, very well and should be played by anyone interested in the MOBA genre. You will not be disappointed.Definitely recommend! Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												It is hard to like game like this in my opinion. I mean, I like it a lot, and I am not the only one. Issues this game has are rather big though and can discourage you from playing . If you ever pick this game up, you will be frustrated. you will face lag and inbalance. I am facing these issues as well. But I still keep playing. Why? Because the feeling when you go on killing spree is pricelles. You feel like you did something great, something rewarding. Heck, you get to hear awesome ( most of times) remix of your theme song ( every character has one) when you go on killiing spree. I am not even talking about when you get some cool trick-shoot off, when you score triple kill and when your team goes AWESOME ( your team has to score 15 kills without dying), it is simply something not every multiplayer game has to offer. This is why I keep playing, just to experience these moments again and again. Howere, if you are going to buy this game, play it with friends. It is way more fun to experience those moments with your friend.			"

												On the surface, it looks like a simple 2D multiplayer game with 16-bit graphics. But there's a lot of depth to this game. All the characters balance out well with each other. Most are easy to grasp but difficult to master. I've seen players completely suck as, say, Leon, while others rack up the kills.The developers also constantly update the game, such as the latest update that includes new skins and voices. The developers clearly care about their fanbase by giving  them a great product and constantly working on it. Be forewarned, though, that your favourite character might be changed - or worse, nerfed - in some of these updates.			"

												This game is phenomenal. Ronimo has pulled off an almost impossible feat, a 2D sidescrolling MOBA. This game is fantastic and I highly recomend it to people who have played LoL Dota or any others out there. It brings an entirely new perspective on the genre, and I really love it. Although its not very popular it is a game that I (and many other people) just keep coming back to. Altogether a fun game and if your looking for something new, you'll have a blast.			"

												Awesomenauts is a 3-on-3 2D MOBA game. You start out with a limited selection of ‘Nauts, but unlocking the other ones is done rather quickly.Eventually, you’ll have a selection of 15 heroes to choose from (19 if you also purchased “Starstorm”) each with 2 special skills and a regular attack. Further levelling up of your profile will unlock special features for your skills, like lower cooldowns or larger range. So people who have played longer will have a wider variety of features in their skills.Awesomenauts also doesn’t have a steep learning curve like other MOBA games, so it’s fairly easy to jump into the game and get playing. However, it’s still varied enough to not grow stale quickly and the skill ceiling is high enough to keep you playing and trying to improve.			"

												My opinionated breakdown review of: AwesomenautsGameplay: Awesomenauts is a MOBA set in the future where there is an ongoing war between the Ones and the Zeroes. In order to bring the war to a conclusion, mercenaries called ""Awesomenauts"" have been hired to help aid the two factions. The main objective is to destroy the other team's solar drill. (solar being a precious liquid metal) You will have to go through turrents  and droids blocking your path, as with typical MOBA fashion, but this game does something different. It is set on a 2D plane. This adds another dimension to skill shots and abilities. I would describe it as a run and gun MOBA, and combat plays like so. As you complete objectives, you will gain solar, which you will ironically spend on upgrades to get an edge over the other team. Your base will constantly spew droids to help you push and destroy the turrents so you can eventually make it to the base and destoroy the drill. There are a wide range of characters to choose from, even without its paid expansion.They all add a nice variety of dual abilities and keep combat fresh. Besides some balancing issues with characters, the most strategic will always prevail. If you happen to die, you get to enjoy the very fun respawn system. You will blast from some sort of ship and fly through a field of solar, and crash land onto the planet where you will resume play. I have noticed this game tends to get more chaotic than most MOBAs, especially with all six players in one spot, it gets difficult to see what you are doing. Besides many minor gripes, the game works well and is one of the most enjoyable and frustrating games I have ever played.Art: The game is in 2D and the characters and enviroments are animated nicely.Teams are easy to recognize with their simple blue and red color scheme. Each animation is easy to recognize and it helps you determine what you should do to defend against a certain attack, besides characters being unique in looks, you can also buy skin packs which will give your ""Awesomenauts"" a newly themed costume. The effects of characters are nicely done as well, it is hard to look at an effect and not know what it does. Other than characters having exclusive animations (looking up and down) any gripes with the art would be purely subjective.Music/Sound: As soon as you start the game, it has a very enjoyable Saturday morning cartoon intro with a catchy theme song, after that the main menu music is very outerspace and fits the game perfectly. Music in game starts after you land your rocket which adds a special kick that helps get you back in game. Gameplay has a playlist of great tunes that add to the comedic battle them. Speaking of comedy, this game is full of one liners, it is not unusual to get taunted about how smelly you are or how fat your mother is. Each character has a voice that fits them well, and helps add to their profile. The game's soundtrack is also availiable for purchase.Entertainment: If you enjoy a simple, but competitive multiplayer game, you will have many hours of fun. Me and my friend constantly play this game together and have good and bad times. I cannot come up with a situation where you will get tired of this game. The updates are frequent and exciting enough and the community is a small, but very loyal and active playerbase. This game runs on the community, as they help fund updates and expansions. Score: Besides network and balancing issues (which will probably be fixed) the game is enjoyable on all fronts. Simple but complex gameplay, simple but fluent art style, and simple but groovy music, it doesn't do too much wrong, but almost does everything right.4/5Thank you for reading.			"

												Had to try this one out after taking a long hiatus. Reviews spell doom and gloom with the new xp system so i have to see it myself. Oh my.., game has indeed changed but unfortunately it's extremely well thought out balance is gone. Difference to the old system is in my opinion quite small but big enough -> Once one team early on gets an advantage that advantage stays to the end. I have now played a couple of games where our team right from the bat lost some encounters early on. after that it was a loosing game. We nearly managed to get the advantage but the other team lead from start to finnish. Differences are subtle but tighter the match the more you can see it.  This far i have not yet seen much of the old back and forth tug of war. Now tell me why should i play this? even with the added content? or buy the expansion? the motivation does not exist right now. And the worst part: in the games i played i was the noob that probably made the team loose. Everyone else had higher levels. Now who the **** would want to play this as a newbie? (after a long break it is like being a newbie again - have no idea of what builds to do now)			"

 wouldnt recommend it if you are from SEA or no friends to play withthe game is actually quite fun and quirky with their platforming MOBA concept, not to mention the cartoon art style for me personally is very nice to look at. id say there are some balancing issues with certain heroes dealing insane amounts of damage compared to others but surprisingly theres quite a lot of skill involved despite how it looks and the learning curve for some heroes are quite steep.the constant updates with the devs, while appreciated, sadly doesnt really help with the game's multiplayer life and finding matches is barren unless you go to EU which from SEA like me is gonna have over 200ping.id recommend this game, but as of now even if you buy it you'll probably play with bots for a bit until you get bored with it.on sale it pretty cheap if you really want it though.

Posted: January 24, 2015
												As you probably might guess by the Awesomnauts' cutesy artstyle and wacky character design this game was built around the idea of creating a casual and arcady 2D MOBA. The idea was executed well: gameplay is indeed largely twitch skill based, yet most of the mechanics familiar from DOTA clones were preserved. Learning curve is pretty mild and the game is satisfying to play right off the bat. There is a sufficient degree of complexity in terms of metagame, so it's not entirely meaningless, but superior platforming skill can definitely elevate even the crappiest of builds to a point where you might be an asset to the team. There is also a pretty varied roster of characters, all with their own style and personality. On top of that, devs are still adding new content, which gives you incentive to come back regularly, as it almost guaranteed to feel fresh again. The few gripes I have with it are not related to the core gameplay as much as they're basically inevitable problems that this game has to face as a multiplayer game run by a small indie studio and a (sort of) MOBA. One of them would be the occasional toxicity you might encounter in the game. It can be upsetting and annoying, but it's still slightly better than in LOLs and DOTAs. Matchmaking is another problem. The issue here lies in the basic reality that there simply aren't enough concurrent players at any given time  to make the algorithm work well so the result is oftentimes you end up in very lopsided  matches and unequal team members. The best remedium for this is to play with friends, that way it won't affect you nearly as much.  There is also a huge chasm between what the most dedicated part of the community, those who play in League 1 and 2, wants and what all the rest wants  and  sometimes it seems like the devs don't quite know how to deal with these conflicting demands which sometimes leads to some balancing issues. But that's rather a minor complaint as this state never lasts for very long and eventually returns to equilibrium.  With all that said, Awesomenauts still has me going back to it and despite my frustrations I can still say that it's still ton of fun and I recommend it without any hesitation.			"

												This is not like your Standard MOBA, its a 2D MOBA.There are 'Nauts' (basically just character) Each character has its own special ability. Its 3 v 3 so that makes it alot of harder to control the map. Of course are there Minions, towers and a shop :). Just like LoL DotA 2. But its not easy to get in the game, it takes alot of skills to master, since this is a 2D moba. You'll need a different play style cause the maps are not big. No jungles. So this is big change.The multiplayer is decent, cause there is Lag and someone can leave the server and join again and pick another character (no punish. And there's one thing that annoys me alot is the DLC. You have to pay REAL money for 'Nauts', skins. Like if i play online i see no one with a skin. And Yes i bought the Starstorm dlc, i think thats the best DLC they made. Cause there are new characters AI options and more! And yes the controller works really good on this game actually had no problems with the controller. Splitscreens is actually well done :).The game is really fun!If you are going to buy this game i recommend you to buy the Starstorm DLC for the extra 'nauts' and Options.And yes there are AI options if you buy Starstorm. Cause the AI is not the best in this game without it. Not alot of maps. Rating: 8,5/10 donuts.Nice price, nice game			"

												Don't buy this game.  It could be great but as it stands the matchmaking is THE WORST, and there's no single player mode.  The learning curve is really high, plan on getting destroyed as a newbie.  Once you get experienced you will get dominated by premades, lose games that you should win because people constantly leave/latejoin, get harassed by the toxic playerbase, and get disconnected from P2P matchmaking as you are about to win.  Oh, and players get a buff when they join late.  This game could be amazing but Ronimo just keeps cranking out DLC to fatten their pockets.  They have been saying they're going to fix matchmaking for over a year but have changed nothing, meanwhile churning our new characters and skins till there's no tomorrow.  Laggy matches, flawed matchmaking, and no valuable single player mode.  Trust me, I have spent 100s of dollars on this game and have over 2000 hours.Don't buy this game.  Go play Heroes of the Storm(what I switched to), DOTA, or LOL.  You've been warned.			"

												Fun game, but nobody plays it anymore. Matchmaking can take up to 6 min to MAYBE get into a game and even then your teammate's or enemie's connection will be laggy, thats not even getting into skill gap between them. This is all just a byproduct of the ever shrinking playerbase. DLC also seems over priced for what you get. I only see this game having a future it goes free to play, even at its current price of 10 dollars... its just not worth it for the kind of experience you're going to get.			"

												The screenshots don't do this game justice, it's incredibly fun to play.The style is amazing and along with great voice acting and soundtrack it sums up to be a really 'awesome' game.Although there is matchmaking problems, the learning curve isn't as steep as other MOBAs. There's a character to support everyones play style.			"

												Despite having a lower play time then alot of people, i still love this game. I have always hated moba's, but this one turned around my opinion of the genre.But this game is dead at the moment.If the devs want to fix this game, they need to remove the paywall on the dlc characters, and make the game f2p.The money could come from the same exact thing other f2p games do, skin dlcs.Hell, maybe they could even toss in attack dlcs, make leons tongue snatch purple or something.At this moment in time, i cant recommend this game to anyone though, i really hope the devs will wake up and save this game.

												The current version of the game it's broken and not worth playing. After almost 900 hours playing over the last years, I've seen its highs and lows with nauts balancing. They keep trying to find a point in wich all of them are equally used and usefull, but still you will encounter the same pack of nauts chosen over and over again, with some of them completely out of the game. This happens due to some DPS being extremely easy to control and OP, and support being useless unless you're doing a premade, and also having skilled team mates (And still you'd have probably won still if you had chosen another naut to paly with).And that speaking of when you actually GET to play a match. The matchmaking is utterly broken and discfuntional. First at all, it's divided in 5 minutes segments, wich make you have a fixed time to wait for a match. Besides of that, most of times it won't find players with similar ping or skill near you, wich will make you wait for another 5 minutes. Even then, sometimes it will just put you in a game with bots because it's not able to find you a proper match (Hello? If i'd ever want to play with bots I'd have choosen that, don't you think, Galactron?) And when it finally works a match for you, you end up with both skilled and new players all scrambled, proving all the waits and supposed ""improvements"" of the matchmaking lead to the same problems we had before the Galactron patch. I can stand a lame 10 minutes game with a league 7 and a bot against two league 2 and a league 4, but no way I'm waiting 8 minutes to play the same time.This game brought me plenty of fun in the old times, but I can't recommend anyone to play it right now, not even for a gimme achievement the developers put on trying to force the player's hand into bringing friends. Stay away from this until it gets A LOT of fixes.			"

												Though it's hard to choose a favorite game, Awesomenauts is up there for me. It is somehow casual while being competitive, using it's bright and silly graphics to keep a light tone to it. It is incredibly fun, and the most replayable game I have ever played. Each team having 3 players makes for a great time with 2 of your friends. However, this can also be a source of irritation for solo players, as teams with communication have a giant advantage. This can turn into a bigger problem as the Awesomenauts community is very small, making it impossible to match pre-made teams with solely other pre-mades. As a result of this, many players are turned away from the game early on, especially due to poor matchmaking at some less busy times of day. Through all of this, I urge everyone to try this game and to not give up during the first few matches. The fun only increases with your experience.9/10			"

												Awesomenauts is one of those games you will either like or not. I had a couple hours of fun with this game, but that is pretty much it, much like DOTA (which is quite different than this, yes), it plays out in the sense that two teams duke it out against eachother. Each player (human or bot) gains levels and more skills as the game progresses, and finally either team has pushed far enough to destroy the other team's main objective, and that is it. The game features dozens of characters to play and you will certainly find a couple favorites that you will have fun playing, moreso than others. I am pretty confident that a group of people (2-6) playing together (and against eachother) can have a lot of fun with Awesomenauts, and I would definitely recommend it for that.			"

												Awesomenauts is a game that constantly undergoes changes, so this review is temporary. At the moment, the game is getting more interactive with the community, improving basic things, adding new features, and developing a rich world with a crazy cast of heroes. Much like other MOBAs, it will require some time investment and a little research. However, I can recommend it highly as a 2D platforming team-combat simulator.Just remember to take a break every once-in-a-while and to take a deep breath.

You cannot dodge them, you cannot hit them. If it's not the laggers ruining the game then you can be sure it'll be a player of your or the enemy team who is a complete noob and doesn't belong in the match.

												I remember when I first saw this game for sale on the XBLA years ago (I was still a scrubby console gamer back then, please forgive me!), and my initial reaction was ‘Wow, this game looks absolutely dreadful’, I just didn’t get it! Luckily, I played this game on a whim, and I have to say, it blew me away!But first, a bit about the game, it’s a 2D, 3v3 MOBA, currently consisting of a modest roster of 20 ‘Awesomenauts’ (20 is including the Expansion pack ‘Nauts, of which there are 4), where the goal is to destroy the enemies’ damage dealing, high health turrets, thankfully with the help of small damage absorbing droids, in order to destroy the enemies’ drill core, leading to a victory. Each player picks one of the aforementioned ‘Nauts to play as during the match, each with His/her own unique Autoattack and abilities. There is also a currency in this game called ‘Solar’ which allows you to upgrade your abilities. All of this is in the style of an 80’s Saturday morning cartoon show. Boom.I love this concept (despite hating it initially :s), the 2D aspect of the game means that it requires a lot of platforming ability in order for you to be good at it, and honestly, it’s a very clever twist to the typical MOBA, and it’s made the game very refreshing for me. The graphics and soundtrack are equally invigorating, with some of my favourites being the character themes and killing sprees.Additionally, this game isn’t short of diversity. Each ‘Naut brings something new to the table in the form of the aforementioned abilities, so, when you get bored of one character, you can play another for a short while, it never feels like you’re playing the same game twice! Furthermore, upgrades add to this diversity. There are 4 rows of upgrades for your abilities, with 6 of them per row, moreover, only 3 upgrades can be chosen in a match. This means that you can upgrade your character to suit your playstyle, adding a lot of strategic depth into the game.The ‘Nauts themselves all have relatively interesting backstories and quirks, which is evident in their voice-acted lines when you play them. Granted, a few of the voices of the ‘Nauts are a bit hit-and-miss, sometimes leaving me questioning why ‘Naut X has Voice Y because it doesn’t suit them, and some of the voice lines are blatant attempts to badly cram a few well known memes and references into the game because apparently ‘It’s funny’ (Some of the references are well done and funny in my opinion, but I would like to see SOME original dialogue as opposed to a sea of memes).However, my major problem with this game lies in its’ online aspect, Ronimo execute this poorly, from the god-awful matchmaking which will leave you in a 1v3 against a full L1 premade, to the matches against players with over 400 ping, making it near impossible to dodge them, let alone win against them, ‘Awesomenauts’ knows how to make you rage online. In balance terms, the game is O.K at the moment, there are OP and UP ‘Nauts at the moment, which is only natural, but there are none which I currently consider stupidly unbalanced, despite the massive ‘Coco Nebulon’ Meta at the moment. The community, I feel, has also been gaining a lot of toxicity recently, but there isn’t much we can do, people have become more experienced and competitive since its’ release, and as a result, players become a lot angrier at new or inexperienced players who play the game for fun, which is a worrying and saddening trend in the once calm and collected community.The paragraph above makes it sound like this game is absolutely awful. It makes me want to hate it, but I simply can’t. For every rage-inducing game, there is a genuinely fun game that draws you back in, and that makes this game fun and addictive as hell (Granted, I have had to take a break from it twice for about a month because I was sick of all the Bull). This is without a doubt my favourite game, and I think my hours show that, and I would recommend this to anyone interested in getting into MOBA's. But I would recommend that you bring a couple of friends along for the ride, it’s so much easier to deal with its’ BS together. If you want to go into it by yourself, fine. But trust me, you will need a lot of patience with it in order to see past its’ shortcomings, and appreciate it for what it is.TL;DR: Love the ‘Saturday morning’ cartoon style, as well as the soundtrack. Very diverse roster of Nauts with interesting backstories. Balancing is a bit meh. Voice acting can be a bit uninspired. Bad matchmaking and network coding may result in rage inducing matches, but the rest of the game is good enough to help you see past its’ flaws.Final score: 8/10			"

												This was a hard game to get people into, especially if one has a bad taste from the MOBA-genre in general, but now it's damn near impossible to get newer folks to play. I love the characters, abilities, graphic style, and the flow of the fight especially in a team of friends, but some recent updates have marred the former image of Awesomenauts.For players from the pre-XP system era, like myself, some are able to work past the changes but almost all of us dislike the system for a number of reasons. Notice though how I said ""work."" The shorter game span and snowballing was really not necessary since there already was a leveling system in place before (Solar currency and maxing items on a character).But now that system is still in effect... with an additional layer of HP and damage % upgrades doled out instantly for player kills and droid/creep kills. There's no strategy involved with that; it's merely a grind to see who is a better farmer. Making this not only like ""other MOBA games"" but also causing players to play more selfishly, stealing health creeps for XP instead saving for a heal, or ignoring a push and focusing on kills.I still recommend this game because it's near and dear to me - but it has a steeper learning curve than it previously had without any real value added, unfortunately.

												it was a good game, sticked with many updates so far but this new XP system and the UI just ruined it for me, there this is negative here is whyRonimo wanted to make matches ""shorter"" they were already about 15-25 minutes an average match 30+ more minutes an intense battle about team work and cooperating. The new XP system makes some nauts way TOO MUCH stronger than the others.. when the opposing team is 4+ levels ahead of you then you pretty much lost the game and can quit, I bought this a long ago because I liked it, new maps and nauts yes good idea but not this system. all in all if you want an XP system like this go play Heroes of the Storm, not to mention its a free moba you cant complain about the system because thats all there is really. no item buying, just picking up passive and active skills			"

Yeah,you finally find the true answer.And dont forget the Awesomedisconnected.I bought all the skin even make the donation, and I just want a Roboscoop,but they dont.The starstrom should be fininshed in two year, but till now they drop the development of the Starstorm.What contained in the Starstrom are more than Overdrive but they get the same price.I dont want to mention how unbalance the nauts in the Overdrive.I dont want to mention the badly matchmaking.I dont want to mention the optimization of this game, When I open the game and wait several minutes and I started to feel the passion of my PC' fan,this will not happen in other well-known 3A masters.I dont want to mention I can match the guy who have 3,000 fewer points than me.Where is the Spectator mode?Where is the Steam Workshop integration?Where is the Online replays?Where is the seriously balance of the nauts?Where is the Simplified Chinese?I have played this game over 3000 hours, I have seen every steps made by Ronimo and get the deeply disappointed gradually.Can you tell me why I lost connection when I play against with BOT?????????In a word,.DO NOT BUY THIS S H I T GAME.DO NOT BUY THIS S H I T GAME.DO NOT BUY THIS S H I T GAME.中文版本：    有一句话是这么说的：“陪伴是最长情的告白”，关于这个游戏，我差不多玩了有3000+小时，作为及其少数从1.0版本一直走到现在的玩家，我只能说，我尽力了，真的。    当初寥寥无几的那些人，大部分人还是盗版。但是我依然在为这个游戏的推广而努力。在看到巴西玩家一起写信给Ronimo然后出了巴西语言之后，我们以华人玩家的身份给游戏公司写信希望能出官方的汉化，游戏公司回复我们也许会在未来考虑这一点，但是现在由于技术问题我们做不到。我们表示理解，毕竟是一个小公司，不能强求太多。甚至我们有想过能不能和3DM合作一起出一个外挂汉化发给游戏公司，然后我就去和3DM的版主去联系了，如果有心人还记得的话，那个版主叫杀中杀，虽然后来我们闹崩了。然后为了争取在国内普及这个游戏，对于制约最大的语言问题，我赶在我某个假期的最后放弃了其他所有的事情在三天内做出了第一版的翻译，我一点一点做的英雄的详细资料，包括背景故事，基础的信息，各种技能以及升级的的解释 。并且在每次版本更新的时候都要去自己一个人去维护他，只能说我耗费了30%的精力投入到这个游戏上面，我真的尽力了。我不想抱怨什么，因为所有的语言在事实面前都是苍白无力的。    然后关于星爆，当时群里的人特别兴奋，毕竟按照官方的说明，应该是一个会让人为之振奋的版本，在线观战，回放，大厅，Workshop，5个英雄2张地图，但是直到现在Starstrom还没有完成，但是在这种情况下，Ronimo选择的是出新的英雄出新的DLC，出新的皮肤播音员。Ronimo你可曾考虑过玩家的感受？    我不想提游戏关于英雄的平衡是这样的：哪个英雄这段时间玩的人特别多胜率也不错，那么好，这个英雄太强了我们需要砍一下。对于那些没怎么有人玩，胜率低的英雄，那么好，这个英雄太垃圾了，我们要增强一下。你们就是这么平衡英雄的？？不过看了Ronimo的直播之后我觉得，他们也只能这样平衡了，因为他们实在是菜的一笔。根本不知道怎么样去平衡英雄。为了让超频OverdriveDLC买的人更多，不惜一切来加强超频里的三个英雄，我也真的是服气了。    在Ronimo的官网上曾经有这样的一张计划图，评测没法贴图我就直接复制了。• Custom games browser• Third batch of Custom Games options• Online replays• Infinite spectator mode• Level editor• Steam Workshop integration• Starstorm map + song• Digital artbook• Backer mentions in the droppod area• New Matchmaking    大厅已经被他们放弃了。连一个简简单单的在降落区对捐款玩家的感谢，以及雕塑到现在都没有做出来。还有一张星爆地图也没有做出来，就更不用说观战模式，Workshop，在线录像。    之前想举办一个比赛，我去给官方写信问能不能给我们几个Roboscoop皮肤来当做奖品，我们想尽可能的在中国推广这个游戏，官方是这样回复我的，抱歉不能给你皮肤，但是我们正在弄简体中文，希望这样能帮你推广这个游戏，并且有可能后续需要你们的帮助来维护。当时听到之后很振奋，真的。在有生之年说不能定见到简体中文也不枉我这么多年的心血。但是随着第一次Beta的测试，心碎了一半。这垃圾汉化，一个大写的服气。再加上新的匹配机制的垃圾到不能再垃圾而且对于中国玩家强烈的不友好。我仿佛已经能看到这个游戏的终点了。    今天和Sauce老师一起测试了一下新匹配，我们俩150ping，但是2s一次红三角，然后一次红三角10s。这很王牌真的。    用一句话来形容，有心杀贼，无力回天。    我累了，仅此而已。    抱歉。			"

												Time for yet another update. Firstly, I'm quite excited about the new Starstorm Map. Let's see what the Devs cooked up for us. Secondly, I have the impression that the almighty Matchmaking got both, better and worse. Why both you might ask? Well, 'better' because I have the impression skill levels among teams are not so damn skewed anymore. Seems more even. I have to admit I am enjoying a lot more matches recently. Also, I noticed an increase in crazy comebacks. Boy, did we wreck that one team last night after our base got down to one bar of HP :)Actually, I am close to changing this review into ""Thumbs up"". BUT (Don't be discouraged by the long text below, stay with me here):'Worse' has gotten the amount of RQs (Rage Quitters). Understandably so. You (not me of course ^^) join a match, 15 minutes in against a ""premade team"", 3 turrets down. Why waste time on that, right? Just leave, or go afk or feed, it usually won't matter. You'll lose anyway, get your ranking decreased etc. This is the stuff Rage is made of. Don't get me wrong, I've been there, done that. But that just seems weird. Somebody RQs, he gets punished. Then you take his place. Whether you RQ or stay, it is very likely that you also get punished and lose ranking anyway. And the infinte loop of RQ - late join - RQ continues. And now it gets even worse: Imagine, if you so will, the following: You and your team harmonize, you dominate or simply put: YOU PWN YOUR ENEMIES. Now, somebody decides to RQ, is temporarily replaced by a bot, then by another players. Good so far. BUT: remember that ""late-join"" bonus? Yeah, it's insane. Now lets continue that train of thought: One RQ: no problem. Two: meh, I can handle it. Three or more (and believe me it's more common than you might think): YOU WILL PROBABLY LOSE. All of a sudden, all the late-joiners accumulate a MASSIVE amount of bonusses. Seriosuly, its not even funny. They will simply out-bonus you. Even if you dominated earlier, RQs result in a massive shift in resources. And that♥♥♥♥♥♥is simply broken.Short version of the above: RQs beget RQs, leading to Bonus town, USA.Minor stuff I'd also like to nag about:Premade vs. solo : C'mon devs, still? At least show me that I am playing againt pres.Lag: pew pew .......................................death            Don't get me wrong here, I like this game (got a couple of in-game hours). But would I recommend it to new players? Probably only to those who are willing to live with minor and major flaws. Then, go ahead, grab the game and hop in, it is fun. If you are prone to anger? Look elsewhere.Have a good day, everybody.			"

												Overly punitive rules, low player base, bad matchmaking, bad balance, pay to win characters. This game has gone consistently downhill and the devs have ignored complaints. They also laughably ask for money while in game. Sometimes you have to wait TEN MINUTES (!!!!) to get into a game.			"

 The StoryTwo sides are at war, choose your awesomenaut and ship out and defeat the other team! As you would expect from a game based completely on battling there isn't much to explain about the story, there is a nice opening cinematic that has a hilarious similar to a Power Rangers episode, but other than that the game is mostly an exchange of going back and forward fighting indefinitely. The Game PlayThe controls are best explained while playing the game. the movement is ASDW, you can use W or space to jump, some characters have a double jump, some fly. You use both mouse buttons and the scroll lock click to use various abilities. The button configuration is very toned down, you're limited on what abilities you can use, and before you start the game you select the abilities you want to unlock as you play the game.Okay, now I should say something about the various characters, there are A LOT of characters which might compliment your play style. I tried them all while playing ""offline practice mode"", I found my favorite character and then intended to play as that character until I became very familiar with the game.As you play through the game (even playing offline practice mode) you will received experience that will unlock new awesomenauts and abilities for your awesomenauts. This element in the game gives me a very strong sense of progression throughout the game. (coupled with getting a lot of easy-to-earn-achievements that I earned while playing offline! (Thank you for that Awesomenauts!)I keep talking about ""offline practice mode"", the reason I do is because I spent a lot of time playing in this mode before starting the game. When I first played this game I tried to play it with my friend, we were both equally noobish at what was going on, I didn't even know this was a MOBA! So naturally we got ourselves massacred. :( Left a bad taste in my mouth.But! after I discovered offline practice mode, I learned on my own without looking up guides how I wanted to play the game. Naturally if I wanted to get better guides would help, but I like to think I'm a fairly competent gamer, playing offline let me try out various characters and strategies without dragging down my team. You can adjust the AI to make practice easier or more difficult depending on your confidence.A final note about playing through the game, you start the game out with ""solar"" or ""coins"", you collect more of these from killing various npc / players, as you collect more, you return to your base to purchase upgrades for your awesomenaut making him/her stronger. knowing which ones to upgrade and which ones to select take practice, guides, or strategy. Once again, if you want to actually learn the game, try out offline practice mode to see what I mean! All in All Awesomenauts	 is a 2D MOBA (Multiplayer online battle arena), with a strong sense of progression, and a lot of different dynamics that can be taken into account. I don't really have anything negative to say about the game, read on if you want to know more specifics!8/10 From Me Sweep	 "

												Awesomenauts is one of my most played games in 2013 and I believe it will continue to be one of my most played games in 2014. Why?Just by the looks you can tell the amount of work and love that's been put into the game. It's pretty obvious that Awesomenauts is a game that its developers care about and not just some money chest that gets opened one time and then will be burried. Updates are rolling in regularly and the first Kickstarter-powered expansion pack is on its way as well.What really makes this game so good though is its core gameplay. It takes the MOBA concept, takes away every unnecessary complex addition and adds some action driven 2D arcade gameplay. The resulting game is addictive but also works well in short bursts. Games rarely last longer than 15-20 minutes and the game introduces new characters carefully so you will get to learn their strenghts and weaknesses.Just be warned that Awesomenauts' fun factor increases exponentially to the friends you're playing this game with. It can be rather frustrating if you're on your own and at mercy of inexperienced or downright dumb people. But setting up a team with two friends and communicating via Skype or Teamspeak will result in one of the best multiplayer experiences on Steam.This game is worth every penny they're asking for and if you've got the chance to get this cheaper from a Steam Sale or Humble Bundle then give it a shot.

												Awesomenauts is an amazing side scrolling MOBA game by Romino. The artstyle for this game is absolutly wonderful, and described as ""Saturday Morning Cartoon"" style, similar to TF2 but more cartoon-ey, I guess. Anyway, this game takes place way into the future in a galaxy unknown where this team of mercenaries, the ""Awesomenauts"" fight each other for galactic power. Each class is unique and has their own strengths and weaknesses. My favorite character is Voltar, a brain in a jar that can heal friendly awesomenauts and do small amounts of damage to the enemy. Definitely worth the money, so go ahead and pick up this game and give it a try, I'm sure you'll love it!			"

Now that is a lot of genres put together, but the blend of seemingly distant genres is done very well.This is one of the more fast-paced MOBAs out there, but that makes it more enjoyable to me.Individual skill is a very dominant part of this game, and 90% of the time, if something goes wrong, there was something you could have done to help prevent it. Of course that's not always the case.If you like 2D platformer games with a competitive atmosphere, then pick up this game. It's also better to bring a friend of two along, as that just helps make it even more enjoyable.			"

												A really good 2D Platformer game to play. It has many characters to choose from and each character is unique in it's own way with plenty of moves that can make your character different from another person's. This game can closely be related to Super Smash Bros in a way. I would recommend this game for playing with your friends as it is quite fun. Only downside is, Awesomenauts have very poor dedicated servers and almost every game will have lag. For example, I already got back to my base where they can't kill me but I suddenly take damage and die from robot 0.o. Also, if you have poor internet (Under 300KB per second) I would really tell you to stay away. If you have slow internet you just end up frozen in the game letting the enemy kill you while you can do nothing about it.			"

												A fantastic collaberation of the Side-Scrolling Platformer and Moba genres crossed with some fighting game elements.  And while it certainly has it's problems, such as various glitches which the devs are working on fixing at this very moment and a few balance problems, this game is well worth looking in to.  Much like any other Moba-style games, or competitive games for that matter, Awesomenauts is very difficult to master.  I personally have thrown 1000+ hours into the game and I'm still not that great.  However unlike quite a few games out there which I will not name, it is very easy to get into the game and have a fantastic time.  Rather than spending the first fifteen or so minutes doing nothing but killing the creep waves and maybe some minor poke, it is completely possible to engage in a team fight within the first few minutes of a match, keeping it exciting for everyone participating.If I were to rate Awesomenauts, I would give it a 7/10.  The score should be higher, however there are some outstanding issues which I just cannot pass over, such as a Peer to Peer connection system which quite often matches you against players with insane ping levels, or the fact that certain characters can't make jumps that other characters can.  However it is still an immense amount of fun and I have found that after 1000+ hours I'm still not bored of the game, do check it out!			"

												Awesomenauts is a fascinating game. I mean, come on, a 2D MOBA shouldn't be good. But it is. Awesomenauts flawlessly combines a platformer with the MOBA genre. The game is balanced a LOT better than Dota 2 or LoL, it has an easy to use interface, is highly accessible and always action-packed. This game, simply put, is outstanding for a MOBA. 8.5/10			"

												Awesomenatus is a phenominal 2D 3v3 MOBA platformer, and a great introduction to the genre in general. I reccomend the game on the basis I prefer direct control over characters vs. the traditional point and click style, the direct control makes a more interesting game. I love this game and I would be more than happy to help anyone who wants to start playing.			"

Posted: March 11, 2016
												A really good Game, i would REALLY like to see it as a new ESL MOBA.BUT, and here comes the but:- Many Characters are unbalanced and still too strong- You shouldn't add buyable Characters. That destroys a competitive Game, focus on Skins, that doesn't destroys the Gameplay. Its just unfair to pay real Money so that you are ALLOWED to play Nauts that are in this game.- Map Balance. Some Maps like the ''jungle'' Map are good balanced, with many Creeps to restore your health, and bosses to fight against to earn more money. But Maps like the Space Stations are unbalanced as hell, because once you hold the middle, where the only creeps are, you get constant health while the enemy team has to go back to base.- Gameplay Balance. AGAIN the Balance. If you got 3 people who are good at this game, just push 1 lane, and to 90% you always win. The turrets should be MUCH stronger and shouldn't have a consistent life bar. So its basically just [hit, run away, hit again, run away] until the turret is down plus, there are no servers. Peer2Peer and you get killed behind turrets. Great.Also, the ranking system is not existing. You, with 5 hours get easily connected to people with 2000 hours. So the ranks are making no sense at all.- And the biggest problem of all: The base. Once all turrets are down, i guarantee you to 99% you will lose this game.The nauts can attack the base, while droids can spawn without problems, helping them. YOUR droids cant do anything, because they all spawn infront of the base, so theres almost NO chance to turn the game around, because you don't have turrets anymore. People just hit the base until it has 1-10% of life, then they just wait for you to push, and they go alone in there and finish it. That is certainly damn stupid and you can easily destroy the base, without ANY chance of pushing back. The base should regenerate itself and should have a little undestroyable turret. That would make it MUCH harder to attack the base without Mercy.And of course the Community: You ever played COD, LoL or any other Multiplayer Game? Yes?Well forget all of it. NO community in the world is as worse, as the Awesomenauts Community.People play 1-10 destroy the base and write ''eZ noobs''You barely lost a game because a teammate disconnects? ''Deinstall game you f.aggot''You died because an enemy has the perfect counter naut for you? ''Learn how to play m.otherf.ucker''You died because an enemy is lagging around and you cant hit him? ''You are so bad, eZ''You destroyed the enemy base? ''LoL you guys suck eZ''You destroyed a turret? ''Play fair you noob''If Ronimo would work more on the gameplay, instead of putting new buyable annoying nauts in the game, it would actually be REALLY good.But until then, we just have to wait.7/10. Would recommend, if you can ignore the community.			"

												A lot of people might think it's just a flashy and happy game, but there's more to that in it. The game it's a 2D MOBA with some really unique characters and nice maps (so far the only downside is that there are only 3 levels). If you don't feel like playing LoL or DOTA because it takes too much time to learn everything in it, this game will probably grab you. It's simple and probably won't take more than a few hours to learn the mechanics and the characters abilities.			"

												This is a very good game for people of all skill levels, and play styles. Awesomenauts offers a unique variety of characters, all with their own unique play style. I don't like comparing games, but after getting about 30 hours in on Awesomenauts, I played a game called ""Smite"" a similar game with a 3D art style, Awesomenauts was FAR superior over that game, by having a long and growing list of unique characters with unique abilities. Awesomenauts will offer hours of fun, and unique combat along with a lot of strategizing. Being a highly competitive game, you will be matched with competitive people.  But like I said, with strategizing, and smart gameplay you will be able to win.  And if not you will learn from the superior players, and grow your knowledge of the game -- You aren't just automatically good at this game, practice is required. So if you have the $10 to spare, I highly suggest purchasing it, and if its on sale I HIGHLY suggest purchasing this game.			"

												Before you read onwards, this is coming from someone who was ranked world number one for a few weeks when I was playing this every day, I got really, really into the meta so keep in mind my review is based on high level play. Casual players may have a different experience.This game could be fun but it's a rage fest and waste of money for several reasons:- It's a lag fest. You will die, and lose a lot to inferior teams that have a lagger- If someone rage quits on the opposite team, when someone else takes their place they are given a huge point bonus and this results in you losing 9 out of 10 times, it's very broken.- Certain combinations are just unbeatable. There are a lot of characters that have huge burst damage, if luck has it that you are up against 3 burst damage characters, game over you lose don't pass go don't collect 200.- There's a healing naut called voltar who offers indefinate sustain healing for the team, if he's on the opposing team see above comment.Don't waste your time and money. I have played this game... a lot. Seen it go through a lot of patches and updates, currently it's just ♥♥♥♥in' broken.			"

In order to win, you have to take down the enmy base, there is garded by turents, to get close to the turents, your minions, have to go first.There are a lot of characters to chose from, and each and every one, is uniq, we have a stelth one, one that takes damage to give damage, a person that pulls, and so on.You can costemize, your charactes attacks as you see please, and therefore, you can build up, your own best tactic.This game is tons of fun, I highly recormend it, thumps up. 9 out of 10			"

  Category RatingBrief Comment   Plot 7.5/10While simplistic, the plot is short and gets to the point. Basically, you're a mercanary being hired by somebody trying to collect an intergalactic currency known as 'solar'. You never know whether you'll be working for the red or the blue team next time, but only time will tell.   Gameplay 10/10Fun, fun and more fun! You can play this game for hours and not get bored! Play as a variety of characters, and use your moves to your advantage to annihilate the enemies! Work together with your team in this multiplayer action-packed platform. Very, very nicely done.   Graphics 9/10The graphics have a simple yet futuristic feel to them. They look very well done, and there's a lot of detail in them, while not having too much. This game is great! Awesome graphics, simple plot avoiding complications, and very fun gameplay. This game truely is awesome!Thanks for taking the time to read my review! Please check out my other reviews. I'm a rather new reviewer, and I appreciate any feedback, Thank you so much! "

												Just buy it. It's easily worth it's full $10 non-sale price, so getting it for $1 is just silly. Even if you're not really a fan of ""moba"" games it feels quite a bit different and is worth more than a dollar even if all you do is play solo with bots for a few hours.			"

												Awesomenauts is a very addictive, actionpacked and fun 3 vs. 3, 2D platform MOBA featuring:+ lovely cartoon graphics+ 16 Awesomenauts with 2 unique skills and 24 upgrades for each (+5 extra nauts with expansion)+ 5 maps with special gameplay mechanics+ custom games options for individual games+ offline games (against bots), local and online multiplayer+ high replay value due to the easy to learn, but hard to master fighting system+ an active developer team that is still adding new content (even after more than 2 years after release)- not perfect, but moderate balancing- occasional lags caused by the peer-to-peer network structure - moderate matchmaking (which should be fixed in a couple of months)Best game I've played yet! Highly recommended!:)			"

												This game is incredibly fun. The sidescroller aspect to a MOBA is one I hadn't considered before and it really works well. Learning the game is a much easier task than in other MOBAs and the character builds are varied but simple enough that newbies can get them quickly without having to look them up. Games usually take anywhere from 1/6-1/4 the time a match of DOTA2 would take. The music is excellent and ridiculous, which perfectly sets the tone for the environments, characters, and pace of the game. Awe of the fun factor can, unfortunately, turn into frustration after several days of gameplay. The meta game is very unbalanced at the moment which is not a huge problem for most MOBAs considering the large roster of choices most have. Awesomenauts doesn't have that luxury and it becomes an issue when at least 5 of the characters aren't worth playing at higher levels. The game clearly needs fairly constant tweaking as with most MOBAs but it's a great way to pass the time and to take a break from work.			"

												Two moba style games I will always come back to. Heroes of the Storm. And Awesomenauts, the only side scrolling action moba I know of, and the only real chalanger for the most fun MOBA I've played. With crazzy characters, and endless refrences to the long gone, but not forgotten age of Saturday Morning Cartoons. Awesomenauts takes this outlandish setting and makes into a brawling arena fighter with a lot of wroth while content that still seems to keep coming!			"

												Awesomenauts is a 2D MOBA set in space! You'll be playing 3 VS 3 and trying to destroy the opposing teams 'Nauts, Towers and Core, which will results in you winning. Hopefully. That's the plan anyway.Due to it's unique cartoony art style as well as it's complex elements of strategy Awesomenauts is a great way to get into the MOBA genre. It has a very diverse range of characters to play as (which have all been very well voice acted and have their own theme tunes) and several maps which differ greatly due to one feature in each that shake up the gameplay hugely.Do remember that as a MOBA, this game still does has a fairly steep learning curve due to other players not sucking as much as you do. But if you persevere and learn the game, it can get incredibly fun! Awesome game!			"

												This cartoony, beautiful, hilarious, enraging MOBA is definately one of the most addicting games I've ever played. Even if you normally despise MOBAs like League of Legends (which I'm not very fond of), you'll still have a blast playing as the space heroes otherwise known as the Awesomenauts.The Steam page and trailer makes it seem so much more idiotic than the game actually is (even though the music is freaking awesome) and it doesn't show all that the game is about. It's a 2D platformer with many different characters to choose from (and more are on the way), where your team of 3 has one goal, to destroy the enemy's base. Every character has their main attack and three special abilities, and you can upgrade these abilities by collecting the currency, solar, from destroying turrets, killing enemy Awesomenauts, killing creeps or minions, or by finding and collecting the ones on the map. Its a ton of fun with a lot of variety and will keep you entertained for hours.Overall, I think that anyone who is interested in this game should go out and buy it, and tell two of your friends to do the same, because its a lot more fun when you have other people to play with.

												Awesomenauts will always be very special to me, played this game over the last 4 years and now I am proud to say I can recommend this game more than ever, with the addition of the Level-Editor.Before the recent Patch 3.5, Awesomenauts used to just be a great, but also very niche game. Not many players were interested in sticking around with a fun, but casual 2D 3v3 MOBA. And while a much older patch brought us custom matches, you were still very limited to just a MOBA mode & Team Death Match on a semi-custom map. But now with an awesome Level-Editor, which is easy to get started and has enough complexity to be very creative with, plus additional wacky custom games settings; You can now play Smash-Brothers, Horde Mode, single player maps, or just a custom made map for the default MOBA mode. Links to most unique mods & maps are at the bottom of the review Mind you the Level-Editor only has been released a few weeks ago in beta. It has since than been improved and we already saw a wide range of mods, so we will see more and better stuff coming, which is very exciting.Although the default multiplayer isn't the main attraction of this game anymore, it is worth mentioning that this is the only game I know, which is a 2D MOBA. Since its launch on Steam in 2012, 21 new characters were added to the game (29 total), 9 of them being distributed over 2 DLCs. There is no other pay2win aspect to the game. Currently 4 maps are in an online rotation, accessible by every player and matches that are 10 to 20 minutes long. It's stillv ery simular to a MOBA, you destroy turrents on 2 lanes and fight for map control. But the fighting dynamic is much more different as it is very easy to escape a fight as it is equally easy to burst down a player, with combined forces. Plattforming feels good, and with various different jumps per naut adds another layer of deapth. However, with not too many people playing, getting into Awesomenauts can be rather frustrating, as most people playing online have at least 100 hours under their belt.For old players coming back this MOBA mode has been changed a lot over the past years, so here is a quick rundown of all major changes in no particular order:-> XP system; In 2015 Ronimo decided to include the XP-system from Blizzard's ‘Heroes of the Storm’, while there were a good number of outspoken people hating on the change, it was mostly because it wasn't very balanced at launch. After fixing unbalances, the overall multiplayer experience hasn't changed negatively at all though. In fact, damage and health upgrade got a major nerf resulting in making versatile upgrade more viable and improving the game flow. Additionally, stalling games to be 10 minutes longer than they should have been, vanish since XP-system's inception. -> Galactron matchmaking update; The current matchmaking we have now is made by Ronimo themselves and replaced a default matchmaking service from Valve, improving the match quality overall, but sadly the effect was limited due to the size of the player base.  -> Late- join & Quick-start were removed; These two options were in the game originally, due to the game being seen very casually by the developers. As time passed by, the community wanted the multiplayer to be more serious and competitive. So now you can't join a game in progress anymore or quick-start an online game with anything but 6 playersThere is no doubt I am very biased at this point, with this many hours, investing in the Kickstarter and sticking with the game for so long. But do consider that these developers, Ronimo, have stuck with the game for nearly 5 years now and that all of these cool features can be yours for $10 or even less. Take care and remember if you ever in need of fun, just call the Awesomenauts. ;)As promised four maps & mods:Fun TDM map:

												TL;DR is TOO LONG!Game fun. Bad grammar/writing. Should buy. Not convinced? Do research. And for crying out loud, the DLC characters are not over powered, they just require less skill to be good at. TL;DRAwesomenauts is a fantastic game, and worth a try.  Most of the reviews from 1,000+ hour guys that are bad are probably because they are salty about a nerf or the game ""isn't like it used to be"".  If something seems unfair, it's probably lack of knowledge or  lack of teamwork. (there are still moments that are unfair, but that usually isn't because of the game)A lot of the reviews complain about high ping having an advantage, but from my experience it can be either. Some matches  the high ping player just can't be touched, and other matches the lowest ping player is impossible to dodge, but most matches it's all just fine. Like any MOBA, most of the bad reviews from high hour players is probably from salt because their favorite character was nerfed, or the game, ""Just isn't the same anymore"".  I've rarely noticed being put into matches against people that are way better than me, but it usually comes down to the other team working as a team (not as well as a premade. There is quite a noticeable difference) while my team is doing whatever they want instead of working together. However, when a new season starts, you might run into the issue of super good players for a few days, but it is usually fine the rest of the season.MOBA community so there is that toxic ""YOU GUYS SUCK I QUIT, NOOBS PLEASE KILL SELF."" guy in about 25% of matches (he's the guy that runs into a 3v1 and then complains about his team sucking when everyone else is pushing a turret), but I usually encounter friendly people.  A lot of people I've come across are willing to teach people how to be better.I will say that some moments can  be unfair, but I haven't played a multiplayer game in my life that is 100% fair 100% of the time.  There will definitely be moments where you will say, ""Dang, if we had this character on our team, this character on the other team wouldn't be 11-0 right now."" but that encourages you to think of a solution with what you have.  There are some strategies that seem ridiculously broken at first, but if you can convince your team to work together, those strategies (from what I've encountered) will not hold up.Awesomenauts is a fantastic game and is my favorite MOBA.  I don't know if it has something to do with my childhood growing up with platformers, and my interest in strategy games, but I have a blast even when I go 0-6 on a day (I still rage, but I still have fun).  It has its flaws, some of which have existed for too long without cause, but like with life: If you focus on all the bad, you'll never have time to see the good and you'll end up in despair (except in this case missing out on a great game).

												Awesomenauts is a 2D-perspective MOBA with a lot of interesting character combinations and effective playstyles.  This game is best enjoyed with a team that is of similar skill level, although you can also join random teams for online battles.  Like all MOBAs, certain characters always seem to have balance issues, but overall the gameplay is fun and the team dynamics provide many hours of enjoyment.If you want to play any of the 4 expansion characters, I recommend buying the Power Pack, as it can usually be found at a better discount than buying the game and the expansion separately.  Costumes are purely cosmetic, but add some nice variety if you play a lot of Awesomenauts.			"

												This game is awesome. This is my opinion://Good things: -Lots of maps-Nice gameplay and mechanics-Detailed background -Magnificent soundtrack ***-You can play with a local player next to you-The shop is very cheap compared to LoL-Characters are balanced, nothing broken//Bad things:-Sometimes, the host is laggy and it will fk your game-Not enough characters to play-Matchmaking sometimes is a little crazy-Sometimes you join a game that already has the enemy destroying your base and that will make yuo lose rank and will make you angryBUT OVERALL IT'S AWEEEEEESOME ;) Totally recommend this for everybody			"

												I have put many hours into this and purchased a lot of DLC. I supported the kickstarter Starstorm campaign also. It's just fantastic for a MOBA/PLATFORM/TURRET DFENCE game. Although that is what people call it I would ignore that description and say it's a multiplayer platform game. It reminds me of playing Smash Bros Mele many years ago on the gamecube. There is a learning curve, but it can be worked through. I'm league 3 now and it is challenging against other players, the main thing is to work as a team, even if the are strangers, knowing where you should be and where to defend or when to push is the key to winning. There's 4 levels (one more to come in the dlc), there's so many characters I've lost count. Each character has a jump/mele or shoot attack, and then two specials. Each can be upgraded to give either more damage or slowing effects etc. You can only pick three upgrades for each skill so you do have to think about it, although usually you'll find you stick to the same pattern that works for you. You have the light characters and heavy support types, something for everyones play style. The only criticisim is the matchmaking can sometimes be unfair, and put you against a team of three people, and are in higher league so the game ends quickly. The developers are however patching the matchmaking soon apparently.... They are very good and do live streams to reveal the patchs and what to be expected. I think this is a great game and no 'paywall' the dlc's that you buy are purely cosmetic, but I like to support the game so I do buy a lot of them (steam sales, get them for pennies). Anyway, I could go on but you should really just get the game now! Also go to their homepage and buy it via humble bundle you save a few penny and support them directly.			"

												This is a very fun and addicting game, but some things definetly need fixed. The 2 main ones are the connection problems from player to player and the penalty for leaving a game. Starting with the connction problems, even playing a custom game with friends, the connection cut out on a signal that we have no problemwith in any other game and it is much worse online. This takes me into the second problem, the penalty for ""leaving a game"". THis is a great feature to stop people from rage quitting or purposely trying to screw over teammates, but the problm is you also get the penalty for when you lose connection to a host, which makes you leave the game even if you don't want to. There have been games where i have gone 7/0 but lost connction so i got the penalty. Now I don't know about you, but that doesn't seem like something i would urposely leave. Overall, even with these problems i still reccomend the game and give it a 7/10. Just hope these problems are fixed.			"

It's a 2D Platform type MOBA, but even though it isn't as competitive as other MOBAs, this game still requires you to have skills in strategy and fast hands. Only thing I dislike about the game, is that it can get pretty hard to find a game. But hope you guys enjoy this game and found my review helpful :)			"

												I would not recommend this game until they fix their matchmaking system.This game suffers from the same issue with other games that rely on ranks. High skilled players just create new accounts because they don't want to actually play with a challenge. With no way to report them you just have to sit there and deal with it.Their system of dealing with players leaving is also broken as hell. They try to replace missing players with bots which just gives the enemy free kills because the AI on bots suck and the enemy team gets extra solar (money) allowing them to be even more fed.Then you have the problem with collision where on certain maps you have characters that take up the entire walkway so you get two enemies one on each side and you are automatically dead.This game is NOT finished. It needs a LOT of work on balancing, the matchmaking system, dealing with players leaving, the ranking system and more.			"

												.....I regret ever reviewing this game whilst I was 10 to 12 years old.....Time for the 15 year old brain to ramble about this.The game's pretty good. It's a 2D type of LoL game, where you assault the enemy base. Frankly enough, however, there are more shooting characters then melee characters. It's relatively easy to learn, but pretty spicy to master. After all, you gotta use that in-game currency to get your abilities, and upgrade 'em. Then there's the catch that every ability (including the character and it's passive/weapon) can only hold three upgrades per match. So......yeah.			"

												The server is really lagging so your enemys teleport in front of you making it really hard to perfectly aim your skillshots. Once you fall behind (they get like one/two turrets) you can't beat them anymore, you're maybe able to kill them but you can't stop them from pushing because it's 2D and once you are in front of your minions you get all the fire instantly without the ability to dodge or counterplay. Knockbacks are ridiculous because they mostly are super easy to hit and fling you back way too far. Overall is it a pretty fun game except if you're losing, not only because you're just losing but mostly because you can't fight back once you are behind.			"

												A great concept, good sense of humor and an awesome diversity of characters... only too bad their online matching algorithm blows.I like this game, trust me, I do. Only every second match I try to play online our league 5-7 team gets matched against league 2-3 opponents, which results in us getting completely steamrolled. We can beat bots easily, have fun playing against each other, but we cannot seem to improve enough to close this huge skillgap.This makes every online match a gamble: will we get matched against (roughly) equally capable opponents? Or will the teams be so badly matched one of the sides gets inevitably steamrolled?If the second happens, prepare for a 10-20 minute waiting/suffering simulator where every strategy you try and every time you slip up even the slightest is immediately punished by much more experienced opponents who slowly make their way towards your base. In my opinion, not fun in the slightest.			"

												If you're looking for something more casual than DOTA or LoL but along the same lines, then Awesomenauts is for you. Instead of 100+ ""heroes"", there are only 22 (with the new addition of Rocco). The game contains charming, 2D-animated artwork and some catchy music, though it might get repetitive after a while. It's alright though since you can turn the music off to play to your own beats. The community is relatively small, and that can be a good thing because making friends as future teammates occurs fairly often... if you're good lol. Try out a lot of the characters and one just might 'click' with you - others you have to look up guides (*coughAylacough*). Also, it's quite addicting once you get the hang of it. Now I understand how sports fans feel. Downsides: Since Ronimo is a small company, there are no dedicated servers. Every game is hosted by an individual player. A disconnect on your end counts as 'abandoning' a game which affects your leaderboard ranking, but to be honest I don't care at all about that. I'm all about casual fun. Leon's range is ridiculous, and the AI Station 404 is the least fun map to play (<- opinion). If you're into skins and such, you might be spending pretty pennies to look snazzy. I love my Bumble Gnaw skin though, it amuses me and was worth it when I bought it in a sale.All in all, I highly recommend this game.			"

												So, I really like this game but I'll try to approach this from a reasonably neutral point of view.Awesomenauts is a crazy 2D MOBA where you must push the enemy back and destroy their base (Guarded by turrets). Pros:-There are a lot of characters to choose from, all varying in abilities. -Characters each have cute or funny little backstories, varying, strange, and quirky personalities Ex:       A gangster breakdancer frog who grew up in the ghetto.-Almost all the abilities are all extremely different and interact together in so many different ways. -Very well done balancing, and although you may think things are unbalanced when you start playing nauts, there is so much strategy involved in the game. -There are a bunch of unlockable sidegrades that may fit your playstyle perfectly. -There is a prestige system, once you get max level you have the option to reset your level and get a shiny medal beside your name. You'll keep all the characters you unlocked but all the sidegrades for them get relocked.-The music in this game is amazing and fits the theme perfectly. Theres special music for each character.Cons:-Although earlier I said balancing seems awesome the more you play, its absolutely crazy when you start out! Things'll be doing what seems like an insane amount of damage! You'll be screaming for nerfs (Probably)!-The community. There are some AMAZING people in the Awesomenauts community but thats like 3/10 people. Then maybe 5/10 people are batshit crazy and get angry super easily, troll, and basically take a dump on the sanctity of the game. 2/10 people though, are pretty apathetic to the whole thing. Silent mutes, the lot of them.-No dedicated servers. The servers use steam, so if steam crashes you wont be able to play. They're working on it.-Lag. A whole lot. You can minimize the lag by setting the matchmaking search to NOT worldwide, and then it becomes not too bad. Its usually not crazy rubberbanding or melee attacks hitting from across the map, just things like ""I was behind that turret!"" or ""No way she has that much range!"" or ""THIS GAME IS ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!!!!11!11!"".  -Requires teamwork. Some games (If you soloQ) you will get absolutely demolished by the enemy premade team, OR your team will just blow.-You have to put around 10-30 minutes per game, depending on whether its a total stomp or both teams are evenly matched. Awesomenauts is an awesome take on the MOBA genre (IMO) and should be enjoyed by everyone. If you think you might maybe enjoy Awesomenauts a tiny little bit, you should probably buy it. Its only $10.99 Candian, so if you have the money to buy this, you should. Remember to never rage, its just a game.NOTE: Its amazing fun to play solo, but a team makes this much more fun.			"

												This game is currently one of my favorite Steam games, it's very fun and addicting. Each character has their own unique abilities, strong-points, weaknesses, and personalities! I love all the character designs, voices, and animations, and the art style is perfect for the game!The gameplay is really fun too! I've found myself playing a ton of matches without even realizing it, it's quite addicting!Now, since I'm sure you don't want to read a huge review ( that, and I'm not a very good writer xD ), I'll just list the pros and cons.Pros:- Fun and addicting gameplay- Amazing characters/character designs- Decent loading times- Very fun to play with friends!- Fun for both casuals and gamers- Good controlsCons:- A majority of the community. Good lord, the community. If you aren't as good as your teammates (or even the other team) you will be insulted. You might also be insulted and bullied just for choosing a character your team doesn't like. I'm not even kidding. They will also ragequit if you're better than them sometimes. So yeah xD (don't worry, there are still nice players!)- Some characters are a bit weakSo overall, a fantastic games that needs more players (friendly ones preferably).Also you actually unlock most of the characters, rather than buying them, unlike some games.I hope you found this review at least a little helpful! c:- Tek			"

												If you were to ask me my opinion of Awesomenauts before patch 2.13, I would have told you it is a fun game and I would give it a positive review. Now that patch 2.13 is here, Awesomenauts has a negative review. The main reason patch 2.13 is so awful is because it changes the game in a way that is not for the better. Before patch 2.13 games were won with teamwork, communication, strategy, and strategy. It was a completely legitimate strategy to farm creeps and not focus on kills if the other team is passive. Just out push the lane. Patch 2.13 changed all of that with the XP system. Because the XP system is about leveling up the whole team, the early game is no longer about pushing and out farming the opposition, it is now about early game team composition and trying to get kills before the other team kills you. Most of the games I have lost in this patch have been games where my team did not get the first kill. Early kills are more important now than ever before. They boost maximum health and maximum damage. Before patch 2.13, the other team could get kills but not all was lost, because you still had the same amount of health as they did, and you still did the same damage per skill based on their upgrades and your upgrades. Patch 2.13 tore away with those ideas because now the team has 1) more solar and 2) more health/base damage. This all leads to a snowball effect. The other team has even a less chance of winning against that team than before. If a player has a teammate that is not as strong of a player, the team is pretty much doomed. The snowball effect doesn't give players a reason to stay in the game either. There is still no penalty for leaving a game and players really don't have a reason to stay once the other team is a couple levels + above them. I've seen people feed and ragequit more than I have ever before. Please rethink the XP system. Don't just make this game free to play because of a decreased flow of players.			"

												It had great potential. But it never became what it could have become. All the big issues with gameplay and matchmaking were never looked at, only content updates that cost money. So alot of skins but a game that isn't working properly. And if you write anything negative on the steam forum page for this game, it gets deleted. I don't know why they do this, maybe so people won't know about the issues since alot of people check the discussions before buying.Only buy this on sale when it's max 1 dollar or euro and then only play on lan with your friends. Otherwise it's not worth the space on your harddrive.			"

DON'T GO THERE...at first it's ok, but after some time, when you get better and get higher ""league"" mark, then half of the time you play is so laggy that it's unplayable - small comunity of good players and horrible matchmaking. Plus the servers will kick u from various reasons and you are just left raged. GOOD things:  Competitive Fun Addictive BAD things:  Addictive (as normal dota) = time consumer Still mysterious server disconnections - game is lost Matchmaking Quite forcing to buy all the new DLCs which are overpriced "

												Constant network errors, players with high ping who ruin games; unbalanced matchmaking, constant nerfing and buffing of champions. If you tick local or nearby region it wont stop a player from another country joining your game if they have selected worldwide. Peer to peer network system, bad game; don't bother to play.			"

												players cheat.  lag is horrible..  unless you're lagging..  then you win every time.  developers refuse to address issues.  game is peer to peer garbage without dedicated servers.  same maps almost forever.  so-called new maps are more of an edited version of previous maps.  new characters added but balance issues not addressed.  only play if you've wasted money to buy already.. and you're just trying to kill time because you don't have anything better to do for a minute or two..  if you haven't purchased, stay away.. not even worth it at $5.   keep pumping out skins for easy money ronimo..  thank god i never wasted cash on that.. never will..  the frustration with hacking, underage children is not worth it in the least bit.  games should be fun..  as soon as a game stops being fun, it fails as a game..  like awesomenauts... where high ping is king.  maybe i should bittorrent and max upload to start winning myself.  I can sum up the playerbase in two words.  TALENTLESS F A G G OTRY.			"

												Awesomenauts is less of a game than it is a chat platform for angry pseudo role players. You'll see obnoxious quirky banter from players when they're winning and childish, racism infused fury when they're losing. So in any given game you get to watch both sides of this insufferable drama play out. Does this game attract these people, or does it create them? These are the mysteries of our time.Gameplay itself is ruined by laughable character balance made worse by the fact that there's no character draft. Your team chooses blind, the opposition chooses blind, and then whichever team has the better matchups takes the win. Great system for a MOBA, devs!			"

												This game is unbelievably unbalanced and broken. SO many characters are overpowered and cheap. There is a lot of nerfing to be done. Also, the team balancing system is HORRIBLE. PLEASE NERF THE OP CHARACTERS IN THE NEW UPDATE. Another problem with the game is when you die, you lose 25 solar, (money used to buy upgrades) and that totally screws you over. For now, the game is broken until to new update comes out, which HOPEFULLY fixes these problems.			"

												Here we go guys, awesomenauts, a fairly priced Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) , the game is quite simple, so a couple of coop vs. AI is enough for you to get the mechanics of the game. It has a REALLY memorable soundtrack, and the graphics are quite good, for a game of it's budget, I mean. As other MOBAs, it IS NOT pay to win.PROS+Really Great Soundtrack, seriously guys!+Pretty cheap, you can get it for sale for, like, 50 cents...+Fun to play with Friends+Up to 3 Local players (Same Machine, using controllers)CONS- DLC characters are kinda OP in my opinion- No dedicated server, the game is hosted by a random player who may have a low internet access or be playing on a toaster.- As there is no Dedicated Server, there is not a dedicated ""Matchmaking system"" similar to those on  League of legends and DOTA 2, since some players start losing on purpose after every season to get low ranks and pwn noobs and are left unharmed, it can make you really angry, but does not affect the overall game experience (Credits to the user: ""Asparagus?"")-It is really fun to play with friends vs. foes, but not quite so to play solo online, matchmaked with 2 othersOVERALL THOUGHTSThe Game is quite funny and Cheap.Price: 100Soundtrack: 100Offline Play: 95Online play 80Graphics: 90Gameplay: 95Wich brings us a total of: 93,3/100I hope this review will be helpfull, so please feedback me for errors and stuff, but be nice, since it is my first review on steam :v,   Don't Forget to upvote it if you liked this and wants me to review other games.

It's an awesome game with unique characters that fight in teams of 3 in a side scrolling platformer. But it has the elements of games like Smite and LoL where the goal is to destroy the enemy turrets in order to destroy their base.

Its just easier to just Quit & find another game...  OH but wait there are only ever 2 GAMES ever active.. so you will always keep landing into the same damn match you left or if you are lucky another match where chances are you are stuck with bots again.Who even plays this game?

												A 80s cartoon vibe made Awesomenauts feel different and unique from all of the other MOBAs on Steam. That used to be the case. Patch after patch modified and stripped the game of its charm, leaving it a shell of its former self. The developers don't care about the fans and haven't for over a year. They fail to listen to complaints. Original characters were patched, nerfed and modified to the point that they are now unplayable. Everything has been cast aside in favor of adding new characters. The match system unfairly pairs players and prevents them from enjoying a match with people similarly leveled. Through all of this change, the only people left playing this game are ones who started playing in the past year. They don't know what the game was once like.Save your money and buy something else.

Product received for free
												Okay so i like the game but there are some stuff in the game that really ruins it and pisses me off!You probably already know what the game is and if you dont read some other review.The 1 thing that ruins the gameThere is not as many people playing this game as it used to be a while ago. So it can take up to 6 mins to find a match!And once you are in that match someone can just leave whilst picking a character and then you need to wait yet ANOTHER 6 MINUTES TO FIND YET ANOTHER GAME!!! AND THEN THE WHOLE THING CAN JUST REPEAT IT SELF SO YOU ARE IN A INFINITE PARADOX OF WAITING 6 MINUTES TO JOIN A GAME AND THEN HAVING SOMEONE LEAVE THAT GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!But there is a nice community and a good game behind that. But with this problem i just cant recommend it because of how much it annoys me. Buy it when it is on sale or something because hopefully there will be many others buying it so that there is more people playing it since that is the biggest issue with the game at the moment.(EDIT)Oh yeah and yet another thing that i forgot to add was that how they have made a DLC for the game so that you can play extra awesomenauts (heroes/characters). Its like if you pay for a game you should get all that comes with it! It would be different if this game wasnt so small with 1 gamemode and all of that. But that isnt the case.			"

												The game was a pretty decent time killer, but not fun without friends.Even then, there's always those people who bought the DLC and just plain wreck everyone, so trying to be competitive already has you at a disadvantage if you're going to try to rank.At the end of the day, everything's pretty solid and there's many different ways to do your objective of killing all of your opponents/ taking their nexus.I'd recommend if you have friends. The game gets dull and boring pretty fast without some.			"

												I would totally suggest this game at the state it is in now considering the notice of how much time it will take to find a match allowing you to do other things while it searches. Not to mention the new UI for character selection is quite nice. Sure there may be some nonsensical purchases you have to make to get some characters but for those just wait for them to go on sale. Worth it to me. A lovely 3v3 good team competitive game with a salty community at times.			"

												Lots of fun, when it works (and you get a team that knows what their doing). But the netcode is abysmal, there's a plenty of lags and often you kicked out of game - happens particularly often when someone regequits. So you get a great game, you almost win and you get kicked. It's infuriating, and to add insult to injury you then get no bonus for winning next game - to punish you for 'escaping'. Great idea! Second problem, the game is not well balanced. But that can be overcome with teamwork, usually. Although soke combos are very hard to beat.			"

												I played this game when it first came out. It was a bit of fun and a slightly different concept. Online games were good as long as the lag wasn't too bad. They kept adding new characters which made it interesting.Recently I started playing it again after not playing for some time. I have to say the game seems incredibly imbalanced now, which is really frustrating. It does not make for a good experience. There are more characters to play, which is a positive, but there are also too many changes from the original version that make some characters really weak compared to others such that it is an imbalanced game.Additionally, you don't know what characters the other team will play in an online match; so if you happen to end up playing against a team with a tank and a healer, you're virtually doomed (and cannot counter by choosing a healer or tank for your own team in advance).Overall it's a bit of a fun game, but just recently the imbalanced aspects have really gotten to me that I have lost enjoyment in it. It's a fun game, but I have to say: be prepared for easy deaths.			"

I used to play this game a lot before, but not so much anymore. I'll give you a few pros and cons. - Pros - 1. Funny/comical game. In-game quotes and lines are well-made and just by playing a couple of different characters like for example Leon Chameleon with his serious but still funny lines and then playing Froggy G and hearing him talk about ""your mama"" makes you very statisfied.2. Ranking system not too advanced, and works quite well. The ranking system is easy to understand from 1-9 and basicaly anyone in the world would understand it by just looking at it. - Cons - 1. Not very fun without friends. I had tons of fun with my friends playing this game, but after them playing it less and less, it kinda faded out for me too, I was bored of matching up with others and would rather just enjoy playing with friends, maybe it's just me. But I feel like this game factors a lot by if you got friends or na.2. Depends more on co-operative play, and not individual skill. Now don't get me wrong, I love co-operative games, I play tons of them, from CS:GO to League of Legends, but this game isn't the same I feel.I feel the way that games like these should depends more on individual skill and less on team-play because it's harder to communicate properly in this game (with no voice chat/good team chat).Thank you for reading this review, please give it a thumbs up or thumbs down depending on how you felt about the review, you can always comment down below and tell me what I can do better in the future! ^^ "

												This is a dota-like 3v3 2d-side scroller. Only game of the genre, and it is also well executed.The good:The styling and theming is incredibly top-notch. The character theming is good enough to rival pre-hatfest TF2.All the different Awesomenauts are quite different from eachother, and while the balancing is never perfect, it is alright, considering the nature of the genre.Seriously, this is a 2d arena game where you have different moves at your disposal, and due to the size of the character pool, very few fights are ever going to be the same.High skill ceiling. You will see many people with many hundreds of hours put in this game. They are continuing to improve.The neutral:It is highly recommended that you get a friend or two to play with. Solo queueing is still completely viable and you can do great things, but friends will absolutely improve your experience. Lone wolves will get less enjoyment out of this game, social gamers will get more.The bad:No dedicated servers. Laggy hitboxes are a problem. If you hit somebody on your screen, it's pretty much guaranteed to be a hit, which also means that on the person's screen who is 120ms away from you means that it looks like they dodged it but they didn't. With skill, you can just try to anticipate 120ms away with your dodging, but this is just coming to terms with a real problem.Matchmaking can be fairly tricky. It has significantly improved in 2014, since I last played in 2012. At its worst, it's usually a stomp fest of a premade-3 vs a team of scrubby solo's, but as of late, I've had more fair matchups than not.Summary: A low-cost multiplayer arena title that is revolutionary and cool, but has a couple large mountains to climb that prevent it from being great.

												Okay, so as of right now, Awesomenauts is the most played game in steam library as well as possibly the game I've played the most.Is it because I'm addicted? No (at least I don't think so).Is it because the game is perfect? No, it isn't.Is it because I'm a masochist and I like flawed 2D Mobas for children where people rage? Close, but not really.To sum the game with one word would be ""okay"". It's an 'okay' game, great potential, 'not the worst' balance, crazy characters, fun community and a lot of 'okay' things from other Mobas are missing or are coming.Despite that, devs did their hardest for you to find new ways to enjoy this game. If after so much time, I can still enjoy this game, I think it's worth recommendation, no? I don't think it even matters if it's flawed or missing a thing or two, since devs so far delivered most of their promises and I know they'll keep delivering - at least till new matchmaking will come out.

												k so after playing this trahs heap for a couple hours i can finally compile a good enough report on this waste of data. Dont get me wrong this game is fun...... for the first hour than youu realise all the unbalncing and the absolutely terrible community. the game play is a basic shooter team game where teams of 3v3 duke it out until 1 of their bases are dead. this is hampered by characters being unbalanced. characters liek ayla, genji,and skree ruin the game entirely with their completelyy over powered builds that absoultly dominate any character. the maps also are crud because players can camp behind their turret and become virtually unkillable with exceptions being aoe attacks which dont comewithe very character mind you. Finally, character you get in teh begining like clunk or froggy g get absolutly replaced by characters like derpl zork and vinnie and spike.	The community is absolut trash as well. They are stubbern and never listen to any type of suggestione ven though this is a team based game and instead think they can rush an entire team and in the end die. The game is also barren with only 1 not even full game playing at a time (different time zones differ). Finally, the horrible ui is such a pain to work with sucha s having the settings out of game and having chat so odd to use such as having button delays, and voice being absolutly useless. The last thing i was saving was the mos stupidest decision ever. The quit button has a timer. What the heck why would i need time to decide if i want to quit I think i pressed it because i wanted to A. quit the game B. QUIT THE GAD DANG GAME. This is a terrible decision. This game is ok but is flawed.			"

												Fun while it lasts.Suffers the same problem most team based moba games, you either need to play it with friends or pray that you get into a decent team that knows how not to feed the enemy team. However, unlike most moba games, there is little to do with builds, item buying and order of things and more with pure skill and with just having two lanes at most, it's hard not to play as a part of the team even when you are ""lone wolfing"".I do wish ronimo did more maintenance on the game rather than just keep giving new characters, there are a lot of performance, server and matchmaking issues that need to be resolved. The fact that there is no pre-game lobby is also quite annoying and again makes careful strategising, preparation and team work pointless as most people go for carry characters rather than support making almost 70% of matches with random people have a whole team of lone wolfs.Simplicity of this game will draw in more people into more competitive scene of DOTA and LOL as most people do not get overwhelmed by the amount of things, items, characters, strategies they need to learn but instead learn basics of moba games and prepare for those bigger ones.Toxicity in awesomenauts still exists like in all other competitive games, but most of the times it's either trolling or easy to ignore as it is so hard to play this game and not be somewhat helpful. No one will be yelling at you for playing support and not placing wards, or not staying on your lane, or not joining in on a gank. You will however get flak for feeding and going afk, but if you do you probably deserve it :DAll in all the game is not without its problems, technical and mechanical, but because it's easy to learn, easy to jump into (as if you dc you get replaced by bots until someone takes up your space), you will get a guaranteed kill or 10 every game almost which gives you massive amounts of satisfaction. Big fights happen constantly, always keeping you on your toes and not making you feel like you are just a gear in a mechanism for the first 10 minutes like in games like DOTA - farm creeps, get to tower, retreat, farm creeps, get to tower... In conclusion the game has colourful graphics, great voice acting from some of the biggest youtube celebrities  and fluid controls (wouldn't recommend playing using controller though)			"

 Awesomenauts Awesomenauts is probably the first Platformer MOBA. Visual: 9/10 Awesomenauts is a beautiful game with a cool cartoon art-style. You kind of forget how beautiful the art-style is after playing for a number of hours, which is the sole reason I didn't give it a 10/10. Sound 9/10 Awesomenauts has a great soundtrack. The reason for this is the fact that every character ( currently 21 characters.) has a theme song, and a song for getting a killing spree with them. This keeps the game fresh by surprising you with new music for the first 20 hours of gametime. Gameplay: 10/10 Awesomenauts is a MOBA at heart, but has drastically changed the gameplay by switching the games viewpoint to a sidescrolling perspective as well as cutting down on the amount of players in-game (from 5v5 to 3v3.). The game also has 21 characters (as of the sixth of may 2015.) that you can play.The shop system has also been changed from the traditional system to a loadout system. The loadout system lets you choose 9 items before the game starts. They will be available for purchase once the game starts. This system makes it easier for players to determine what they want to do, and makes it impossible to counter people by buying what you need for a specific problem.This game is by no means a hardcore game, but it will still give you many hours of enjoyment if you aren't a tryhard winner. DLC: 8/10 The game has quite alot of skins which I won't go into detail about since it's purely cosmetic, however there is one DLC pack called Starstorm that introduces five new characters. This is usually not a problem, however they are still updating the DLC with characters which could lead to some balancing issues. The DLC is by no means gamebreaking at the moment, but the possibility of it becoming gamebreaking is there so be weary of it. Time/Money: 10/10 If you are interested in the MOBA genre but find it to hostile to join, then this is your game. I have put down over 100 hours of gameplay on this game, without feeling the need to spend a single penny (beside buying the game ofcourse.).			"

Whether you're playing with your friends, or with 5 random people online, I can guarantee that you will have a hilarious time playing this game. It's addictive, there's not many strategies and it's rare to find someone online who is cheating. In fact, it's so rare I've never found a cheater.The community tends to be nice, apart from that one hostile player (#muted) or yourself, if you so desire (#letthemutedbecomethemuter)...

												When I bought this game, I honestly didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I have. Awesomenauts combines light MOBA mechanics and action platforming nicely. The entire feel of the game is less hostile than other games that incorporate MOBA mechanics, simply because it plays much differently and has very few meta-game aspects. The gameplay is responsive, skill based, and the characters are designed so that they all have their own unique playstyle. Awesomenauts delivers a unique experience regarding the action platformer genre, plus an incredible art style and hilarious voiceovers.			"

												When you have a good connection, and no-one quits, this is an amazing game, genuinely one of my favourite games ever; great music, unique characters, fairly easy to pick up (easier than traditional MOBAs) yet very challenging at higher leagues. When the teams are balanced (which when you have a good connection, it is not uncommon) you can have a lot of fun, and it gets very competitive but usually still light-hearted. However. Lag can make it almost unplayable, with enemy abilitys hitting you out of no-where and you dying after you clearly got out, and this happens more often than it should. The game does not have a very large player base, so it struggles to match you up, and you will often join games half way through because someone rage quit.In conclusion, if you get annoyed quickly with bad matchmaking, this game probably isn't for you. However if you can soldier through the bad games, this game  is definitely worth it.			"

												I am really impressed with the direction ubisoft took with this game. Being the first game developed in Minsk, Belarus by a Eastern Orthodox female orphanage in 1913, the graphics exceeded the standard of its time.  Some astronomers consider this game to have been the reason for the economic boom in West Africa for the following 40 years.  The gameplay is very intricate.  This game is historically recognized as the first 2nd person hack-and-slash dungeon crawler taking place during the Shang dynasty in ancient Australia to incorporate 7-player split screen gameplay.  Unfortunately, the games sales plummeted due to Howard Taft's embargo of 1772, where the shipping of the game was banned in Latin America, Hong Kong and the Zambian empire.  Hopefully our generation and game review websites such as Zynga will recognize the innovation this game provided.  10/10.			"

												Played 900 hours.Bought a crap ton of DLC, I own almost all of them.Why? I don't know, I liked the cartoonish style, the characters, sounds, witty voice acting and generally a cool looking game that is hard to master.Problem with the game is everything else. Matchmaking sucks, the community is freaking terrible, constant lag no matter what when playing online, smaller and smaller playerbase, unbalanced characters that constantly change their gameplay mechanics because of balance reasons.I mean, the game had a crap ton of potential and it is super fun but the mishandling of the servers and inability to deal with the connection issues killed it. Basically every match you play you will face someone with a terrible connection either on your end on their end, 300 ping or more. There is no avoiding that in this game.I wish this game was bigger.Sad times.Goodbye Awesomenauts, I hope to return one day.RektThat being said feel free to grab this on a sale, it goes on sales frequently for dirt cheap, that's why I recommend it.

If you like moba games and kinda fast action, you should go into this one, it's not classical moba game, like Dota or LoL, it's 3v3 breath taking game I fell in love by the first look. If you like more fantasy/fast action/epic taunts and music, you should go in this one.			"

												This game has quite a number of issues. First there’s the lag. Because there are no dedicated servers, you can very easily manipulate your ping for in game advantage. I have a ping of 100 with only awesomenauts open, but when I open chrome and listen to music off YouTube, my ping jumps to around 300. Many players will manipulate their ping off and on throughout a match, changing it for when they need it. It doesn’t matter why the lag occurs, all that matters is that it destroys the gaming experience. Second, the game has a broken late join and abandoning system. Leaving a match incurs a penalty in the games leader board system, and you don’t gain as much experience from the next match. This has never discouraged anyone from ragequitting. If a match is not full (3v3) the game will hot seat someone in wherever they are needed. While that seems great, it’s a completely ineffective system of preventing people from leaving and an unbalancing effect of late joins. Almost every match I have ever played in this game has had at least one disconnect. When a new player joins, they get the average amount of ingame money (solar) to buy upgrades, so even if you’re stomping the other team they will join in with as much as the winning team. When a new person joins in with as much solar as you, they get the chance to build their upgrades around your team, while you have already picked your general build. I have played a good number of games where the other team is losing badly so they all ragequit, only to be replaced by a full team of new players who all have as much solar as us, as well as the advantage of being able to build to counter our players, while we’re all set up for a different match entirely. Furthermore, if you’re the host of match, you can force everyone in match to quit by shutting off your internet. This happens almost every time the host is doing badly. And yes, you lose “league points” when the host forces you to disconnect. You may even join a game that a player has quit seconds before the base is destroyed and the game is over with a defeat for you (which you will lose ranking for).The developers of this game are truly evil. You can purchase skins for the game, which are overpriced. Most games charge more than a dollar for skins, because they’re incredibly easy to design and they don’t change game play. Most of Ronimo’s skins are between 2.99 and 7.99.  Two skins are as much as the game was originally. A pack of skins is 15 dollars, which is 5 dollars more then the game. That is simply not ok. They also came out with an expansion for the game almost two years ago, for around 7 dollars. It unlocked (at the time) one character. Now it provides more characters, and they’re by far the  best characters in the game. However they sit behind a pay wall for almost the same price as the original game. This is disheartening to consumer, but forgivable if the game was balanced and had dedicated servers. But the final piece of the pie is that the expansion was crowd funded. They crowd funded an expansion, that when released only included one character.  They said quote “We want to take Awesomenauts to the next level, with characters, features, a new map, and more! Join us to make this happen!” Many of these features are yet to arrive. 7,496 backers pledged $345,835 to help bring this project to life. That’s more money than many people make in 5 years of work. For an expansion. Of a game that already came out. The expansion added features that should have been free and come with updates.

												I truly love this game, and I think if it looks appealing to you then you should give a try. It's pretty disheartening to see people with 1k+ hours throwing out bad reviews. They complain about the toxicity like its not to be expected from any online game then cry about it dying when they're the ones actively killing it. Most of these players probably lost to some toxic player who called them a doodoo head and rushed here to wring out their tears in a steam review. Ronimo is a very interactive company which is a great thing, but they've inadvertently created the most entitled, crybaby communities out there.Awesomenauts is a wonderful game. Everything about it is incredibly charming from the top tier art to the godlike music. There's a big cast of characters each with their own unique abilities, upgrades, and a baller theme song. The gameplay is neat-o. Smashing nerds with a giant anchor weilded by an armored squid never gets less satisfying.Listing any flaws would be redundant considering there are plenty of other reviews that exist for nothing more than to tell you all about them. However I will say that a lot of them can be avoided by doing the following:-getting good.-growing the f*** up. (Remember... it's just a game!!!)the peer to peer thing is an undeniable problem but nothing is going to be done about that unless this game somehow hits it big.  In my experience it's not a 24/7 issue like people make it out to be.Anywho, I love this game and I sincerely appreciate the work that ronimo has put into it for all these years. I would really hate to see it die so I HIGHLY encourage anyone who is interested to give it a go.yeh.			"

												This is the 9/11 of games! A total horrific tragedy. Every time the pathetic excuse for programmers put out a new update they make it worse. Imagine weeping herpes sores manifested as a game. This last update is the last straw. I played it for about four hours and realized that the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s took out the last remaining aspects of the game that I liked. NO MORE! I will never play this worm ridden pile of monkey♥♥♥♥♥♥again. I will tell everyone that I can to avoid it like the digital vomit it is. Way to take a good idea and repeatedly shove it up its own♥♥♥♥♥ I can't wait to hear that the game has gone bankrupt and a player has stocked from office to office putting all of the employees at Ronimo Games in the ground. I believe that this game is punishment for the sins of the world. DO NOT PLAY IT!!!			"

												I have played this game for a while now. It's incredibly fun and addicting, but the sad thing is the developers don't have any idea what they're doing anymore. With each update there comes a decrease in player base as they throw more and more characters into the mixing bowl without balancing the ones already in existence (the guy who ""balances"" the characters doesn't even play the game). It's definitely worth the buy if it is on sale but otherwise just keep it in your wishlist until that happens. Beautifully animated and put together with a lot more depth than meets the eye. The community is lot more toxic these days with rage quitters, stuck up pieces of garbage who think they're better than they are (yes we are all looking at you NotSee), and lag abusers. Also they still let people late join which is incredibly dumb and they refuse to spend the crowdfunding money theyh get to create dedicated servers. The dev team is mostly made up of artists which has its pros and cons. Anyway buy the game for a fun time with friends. I have met nearly 200 Steam friends just through this game alone. I still enjoy it with all these problems and hopefully someday it wll reach its full potential. 8/10 Vive la Chameleon.			"

												This game made me really happy!!Pros- Cute, awesome and futuristic design- Super fun and even more with friends! - It gets updated pretty often! I had to catch up with updates several times and they always amaze me with a new character! They even give a chance to regular players to participate and compete providing a new character design which actually they brought to life in-game, so that's lovely!- Loved how many characters you can play with! They are completely different one from each other and with a whole set of skills that always comes with surprises! - When I've started out being weak and competed against high level folks, I've managed with tactics and taking advantage of my skills + environment. It worked! :) CONS / suggestions:- I wish you could earn some clothes as rewards instead of always buying them. - I wish server were P2P  to avoid lag issues.- Brazilian people mostly took advatange of lag to win and kill while I was frozen. (not nice) As a solution I've created matches on my own to play along with highest lvl bots and issue solved.- That's it lol!This game! Love it!! It's gorgeous, lag will get fixed someday :) It won't change all the fun and love I've got from it! :PThanks!			"

												im gonna keep this simple and short so just sit back and enjoy the review.So i might not have hundreds of hours into this game but after what i went through i believe i reserve the right to say DONT buy this game. 1. If ur one of those gamers that cant afford GOOD internet do not buy this game! YOU will get pinned with the worst connection host's. And YOU will eventually disconnect. Unless you live somewhat NEAR the game host or have an ""AWE"" stunning connection you will not enjoy the constant ANNOYING ""reconnect"" sign above ur character that will eventually lead to ur RAGE.2. I think its absurd how there could be over 1k players online and still wait 4 damm minutes to join a match only to be met with cheap bots. According to Devs the matchmaking system searches in a ""WIDE"" range, HAHAHA what a load of bull$@#%, and guess whats worst? when the amazing gods of awesomenauts finally connect you to a ""DECENT match"" ull receive a wonderful greeting by heart-breaking host connection. In unwanting occasions the game will drop you in a near-ended match, its ur fortune or misfortune to join the winning or the losing team (say ur farewells to the league you were currently holding)It's a shame to see such a spectacular game being hold back by some FIXABLE problems. If you ask me, this is wasted potential.I dont really mind the rest of the imperfections.....but until some game-changing updates occur my perspective stands tall.			"

Oh boy, who will buy this game after reading such reviews?Sure, this games has a lot of issues. A LOT.

												9/10!Awesomenauts is Awesome!3v3 side scroll Moba game with great 2D graphics and effects, perfect for old-school side scrolling battle fans!you control 1 character that have unique skills for each of them, then you collect solar coins which is in-game currency to upgrade that skills to be more damaging, more power, less cooldowns, etc, you can setup your build before each battles to suit what playstyle you wants, nuker? support? or Tanks... and you battles with 2 more allies on your side, which have different abilities characters, you fight with other 3 characters that have different skills, and playstyles.the objective of this game is to destroy enemy's Drillcore which is in the deepest part of their base, and defended by turrets, droids spawns each couples of second to help you destroy those turrets, and don't forget that the enemies also have people to defend their turrets, so you have to balance between defending and attacking to win the gamethe only downside of this game is its connection-based server, if the host have bad connection, you'll get massive lag in the battles, but the mechanics of the game can migrate server based on the best connection player in-game, so it doesnt really matters much on the long rundefinitely must have!! :) "

												Really fun game. You'll need to know what type of skills to bring to the field. As you become more experienced with the game, you'll eventually know what type of skills are most effective for your specific character. This game also tests your skill in platforming like how to dodge enemy attacks, escape from them or chase after them. When you're playing online, a lot of teamwork is required to beat the other team. If you're looking for a fun online experience, Awesomenauts is definitely worth checking out.			"

												Awesomenauts is a cheap, good value and very enjoyable game. Definitely made for cross platform, playing it in big screen with a controller or with a mouse and keyboard feels just as intuitive, while it is a MOBA (Multiplayer online battle arena) game, a single game session doesn't feel as lengthy as for example DOTA2. I have had both short and long game play sessions. The format of game play is 3 versus 3 of either 'bots' (AI controlled) and humans or all human players. For any DOTA player's; there is no real jungling or item shop concept; however, ganking and stealthy play or killing an occasional stronger critter for a decent reward is possible on some maps. Players level up automatically by obtaining currency rather then experience and can use said experience to buy 'skills'.Gameplay feels intuitive, quick to grasp and the game is quick off the bat with some action. It may not always feel perfectly balanced, but if you are playing without friends in random games you may be in a group of hero's that overlap in roles, thus underperforming against well balanced groups. I've never found it really troublesome, you can always switch your hero in the midst of a game if you i.e. need a more damage oriented hero instead of support.With it's drop in and drop out game play you aren''t a permanent man down like in DOTA 2 when a player leaves, AI will replace a player until a new one joins. From my experience the game's online experience has been stable; however, online play sessions are hosted via another player so if your experiecing lag its a good bet it is on the host's end rather then the game's or the developer's end.Mix some RPG , action, side scrolling platform elements with moba game play wrapped in a neatly looking 2D graphical engine and you get Awesomenauts, a humor packed arcade-MOBA game.Try it yourself, definitely worth the 10'er and if you can pick it up on sale, even better.Lastly I'd like to say it is very doable to play it on split screen at home with a friend if you have multiple controllers to hook up to your PC. Of course; lan and multiplayer works too!			"

												Awesomenauts is a suitably awesome DotA style game but with 2 major differences, it is also a 2D platformer and is very easy to get into.Most DotA style games available at the moment are incredibly similar, with the exception of Smite which is taken from a 3rd person perspective. Awesomenauts is a side-scrolling game which allows for new ways to play the genre. Platforming feels great and gives new opportunities for escape and ambush situations which add to the intensity of the game.I also love the art style, which is very important to me because it can decide whether or not I play a game. It's cartoony, clear and fun and the characters are original and hilarious. The soundtrack is amazing and vast with each character in the game getting it's own theme and killing spree music.Awesomenauts is also easy to start playing. It isn't as complicated as other DotA games but still manages to have a high skill-ceiling which can be seen in the games competitive scene.Not only is it great fun but it is still growing! Since it's release on PC, Awesomenauts has recieved frequent updates with new characters, maps and features and as a result of its successful Kickstarter campaign, the game will be getting an expansion which will see even more stuff coming out throughout next year.

Posted: June 8, 2013
												I've decided I should update my review with my feelings as time has progressed.Maybe it is unfair to compare this to DotA, but the competitive moba nature lends to it well.  While the game is a lot more casual in nature, such that I feel like I can quit in the middle of the game if I need to, and that I do not need to invest as much energy or time to be competent in it, I find myself enjoying the game less.  In fact, as time has progressed, I feel I get much more frustrated with my games in Awesomenauts.  This is often due to matchmaking, or what I perceived as questionable balance.The matchmaking of the game is quit frustrating.  I don't know if there' s anything that can be done to improve this, as the player base is relatively small.  But as it is, when you get matched up against a premade team of excellent players, it can often feel like there's nothing you can do to combat the opposition.  And due to the small player base, this can happen often, and multiple times in a row, especially once you start getting to around tier 3.  I question the balance and design decisions of some characters.  The only character I feel with certainty is unbalanced is Lonestar, for his ability to take out towers singlehandedly, and with relatively little farm.  His bull gives him ridiculous pushing power, and his dynamite and high dps means he can pick at a tower more efficiently than most.  I feel like if my team is not completely dominating or the opposing Lonestar is not incompetent, then we'll stand to lose simply due to his pushing and anti-pushing power.  Even with a kill advantage this can be a problem.  That being said, a lot of other characters can be very frustrating to deal with, even if they are balanced.  Gnaws plants have a lot of hit points and regenerate health.  Skolldir can get an almost guaranteed kill if he manages to get within throwing range on some maps.  Froggy G can deal crap loads of damage, has quick mobility, escape mechanisms, and an ability that can make him deadly to attack.All in all, I want the community to grow, and I hope the developers consider revisiting the skills heroes and the mechanics of the game.  They do make balancing changes, so I do hope the game improves, especially with the Starstorm expansion in development.			"

The mechanics while very simple require a lot of skill in the higher tiers of the game allowing for both soft core and hard core players to join in on the fun! With a wide variety of playable ""Nauts"" (characters) you are bound to find one that fits you just right! There is a decent variety of maps (with more to come) , the devs seems very committed to making the game better and the community is strong to this day.If you are looking for a fun and approachable MOBA on steam this is a great option with a very good price tag.Highly recommended 8/10			"

												Really fun game. You'll need to know what type of skills to bring to the field. As you become more experienced with the game, you'll eventually know what type of skills are most effective for your specific character. This game also tests your skill in platforming like how to dodge enemy attacks, escape from them or chase after them. When you're playing online, a lot of teamwork is required to beat the other team. If you're looking for a fun online experience, Awesomenauts is definitely worth checking out.			"

												Awesomenauts is a 2D MOBA (like League of Legends or DOTA 2, where you have to destroy turrets and a base) that focuses heavily on platforming (for escaping and attacking). There's a wide range of characters (with more being added) and each character has the choice of upgrades they can buy in-game, opening up plenty of builds to try out. And unlike other MOBAs, there's little to no learning curve. As you play more, you level up, unlocking more characters and upgrades. Even though only being able to start with three characters seems limiting, it makes it easy to jump in without having to do character/mechanic research (the short tutorial is enough) or be intimidated by choices. I'd say the only bad thing about this game is the fact that there are limited maps (four at the moment), but they're varied enough that I often don't think about it. Overall, it's a MOBA that isn't too complicated but still fun to play, appealing to both casual and hardcore gamers of the genre alike. I'd buy it if you're interested in the genre but too afraid to devote yourself to learning it. And if you're a familiar, you'll feel right at home while still having different characters and mechanics to learn.			"

												This is a great game to pick up with some buds considering its 3 on 3 moba gameplay which is a blast to play and is surprisingly tactical. The in depth upgrade system is extremely intuative and easy to use, making it simple to make some very stong builds for your any character, of which there are so many unique characters and playstyles to cater to each players needs. Although some characters do need a little balencing and these characters tend to be a little overused in online play, making you rage ALOT.however that doesn't stop this game from being awsome.			"

It's hectic without being stressful, it's strategic without being slow, and it's action-packed without being exhausting. Each of the 20+ current characters is really fun to play in their own way, and I find the different feel of it really refreshing.Leon is frustrating as heck though fisjdak			"

												I stopped playing this game ages ago after over 550 hours of playing, in the past year or so though they have added so much to make the game fresh and new, it's incredibly fun and basically a less intense; side-scroller version of dota 2.The game is very fun, but the community on this game is the worst I have ever seen for a game and here's why.If you're winning- All enemy team ragequit- Your specific class is instantly ""OP"" (Mainly because the enemy team haven't figured out how to play their class yet)If you get a kill- ""Was way out of range"" - Mad guy on enemy team- ""Only noobs play that naut"" - Mad guy on enemy team- ""Oh wow _____ (you) Finally did something"" - Mad guy on enemy teamOn the positive side you can play as a chicken that explodes.I do seriously recommend the GAME, the devs put hard work into balancing each class and give constant updates, although £6.99 is cheap for the amount of enjoyment you get from this game I would still wait for the next steam sale when it will be only 99p again, or buy from tf2outpost.com for a key or so...

												This game is amazing. Great graphics, amazing soundtrack, unique characters, full player input. I admit, the lag and matchmaking are a problem but you have to accept lag as it is since the playerbase is small and if you're losing badly just quit. Ragequiting isn't a shameful act. It's there for a reason. This game has fast paced action, loads of humour and has a lot of character. It also stands out from other mobas because it takes place in space so all the characters don't have to be mages, knights, archers and anthros. Extremly fun game with a great community. A must buy.

												It's a pretty awesome dota-style game, and one of the few 2-D games of this type. Normally you will have 3 turrets to defend, and one base to defend from enemy attacks. The respawn time is pretty fast, and feeding doesn't seem to be as much of a big deal as it is in other games of this type, making this game fairly new-player friendly. The other team may be way better at player kills, but the winning team seems to usually be the one that isn't afraid to die now and then to target enemy turrets. The game itself is fun to play, but it can get complicated with a plethora of upgrade options, three of which for each category you will need to pick before the match starts in a limited amount of time. To get good at this game, you will want to be familiar with the characters and upgrades that you want to use long before the match starts, adding a layer of depth to the game that may be a bit daunting to new players. Overall, I'd recommend playing this game with friends. Splitscreen mode actually allows you to play on the same computer if you want to, which is rare in the world of PC gaming. The game is mostly balanced after many hours of hardwork from the developers. I do think that some characters are better than others, but the game is constantly being improved. I have yet to see a win-lose record in the game, and the game focuses more on your overall rank than anything else, which somehow makes you feel less pressure if you don't really care about being the top rank. This game is fun, and definitely worth playing with friends.			"

Now lets talk about deadlift... congratulations ronimo you managed to do a naut that isnt completely overpowered and broken on his release GOOD JOB! I think this update made game take a step in the right direction but the game can still be improved. Making the game free to play would increase the playerbase and expand the games lifespain a little bit. Thanks for making me love this game again ronimo!			"

												Awesomenauts is a multiplayer online battle arena [MOBA], like Dota 2. This game is my favourite game, I really enjoy playing it. On a level of difficulty Awesomenauts is in many ways easier then mos MOBAs, but in some other ways harder then some MOBAs. Unlike Dota 2 for example (sorry for only using Dota 2, it's the most well known), you have to unlock your characters meaning that you get to know multiple characters instead of always playing one character, you get to know a variety of characters!

												I overall enjoyed the playstyle of this game. I really like the fact that you can upgrade throughout the game and such instead of just being ""here are your powers for this person"". The controls are very well done and I enjoy the aesthetics of the game. It is a good game to just pick up and play with friends against bots or people. Games don't last long at all and you get a great amount of xp so the leveling is pretty fast. I do feel there like there still is a lot of balancing issues, but for the most part it is a fantastic game.The only thing that I didn't really like because of just my opinion, is the fact that when you play against people online, if they quit out someone else can join in and take their place. But that's because I am a traditionalist to where, you set up the lobby and if someone leaves they are replaced by bots for the rest of the game. 9/10			"

												Awesomenauts is a curious mix of MOBA / DOTA-like and platformer. Requiring more twitch skill than last-hitting ability or proper build order, this is a game in two worlds.The art style is cartoony, specifically designed to invoke the feelings of old saturday morning cartoons like Ren & Stimpy or Tom & Jerry. Slapstick humor is certainly prevalent all around and many of the character's lines are referrential; they even have a few big name internet celebrities doing character voices (TB, Jess Cox, dodger, and Myndflame are the ones i know of). Overall the game is fairly pretty with interesting variations between the maps.The game is very easy to get into as you level up incredibly quickly and early on most people don't know what they're doing, so you won't need anything but some good ol' Mario skill and common sense to get started, though i do reccommend playing practice mode first.The gameplay is tight and responsive, though it could be a teeny bit quicker on the uptake. There is a drastic problem though; the game De-syncs ALL THE TIME. I have had numerous games where I was kicked due to severe lag and sync problems due to low ping. EDIT: the game is hosted peer-to-peer. Do not play without serious antivirus software and firewalls or you could possibly get hacked. The game also has no games lobby of any sort, automatically searching for a game to get you in. This exacerbates the low-ping problem as you have no idea how god the host of the game is, and it's very reluctant to switch hosts. This problem will get you unfair kills and unfairly killed time and time again. Ronimo, if I have any reccomendation, fix this issue BEFORE releasing starstorm fully. However, if you can get past that, there's a surprising amount of depth to the game. Each character plays very differently despite having only 2 abilities and a special jump. The characters all also have their own items, and you get to customize which items are available to buy at the shop, which is where a great deal of the non-twitch skill comes in. Setting up proper builds is daunting, so i suggest taking an online build to begin with, then working on your own from the principles you see there.EDIT:A lot of people hav e complaints about the community in the game. For me and my under 20 hours at low levels, I have seen a few complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and one feeder, but overall people are quiet and react as you'd expect a normal person to; upset when losing (but not blaming the team except for the feeder, who was literally doing nothing so i don't blame him.), happy when winning (but only a few♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who spam the taunt button or act all superior when they win at league 9 [of 9]) and talking to the team only to ask for help defending a turret or something. I give it a community toxicity rating (with 1 being friendly and helpful while 10 being DOTA 2 or the youtube comments section.) of 6. More bad than good, but acceptable if you're patient and level-headed.Overall, the game is funny, can be challenging, has great depth, but at the same time still feels like a beta test sometimes. As for starstorm, I don't have it and am reluctant to pay money for extra characters in any game, despite it being a pretty cheap character pack. One final thing; this is a paid game with microtransactions. On the other hand, it's only cosmetic (unless you count starstorm which also has an extra map coming and AI editor) so you decide if that's fair.If you like platformers and competitive games and don't mind a bit of glitchiness and don't have a problem with the fact that if you want totalbiscuit Vinne you've gotta shell out extra real cash, The game comes recommended. I play it a ton and have enjoyed my time immensely. Using Nerdcubed's 1-3 rating system; I give awesomenauts a 2. This is without a doubt not a shining recommendation; the game has a laundry list of problems some of which can be fixed while others are the result of the good ol' internet community. I personally picked it up for 99 cents but I wouldn't have paid much more for it. Certainly not 10 dollars.			"

												Note the date of this review before reading it: March 17, 2014.A lot of people have complained about problems in this game, which primarily include matchmaking, lag, and balance issues.Matchmaking - Yes, matchmaking is an enormous problem. You could very easily be queued up against people that have logged 200+ hours your first game. You could also be thrown into a one-sided game where the enemy is already sitting in your base. Why this is, not a lot of people know. You are ranked leagues in this game, and matchmaking tries to find a game that has people in it that average out to be in a league that is the same as yours or adjacent to it. Now this seems ideal, but if you were league 6, and league 1 player could queue up with a league 9 player and you could face them in a match. This does happen sometimes, and the problem certainly needs to be addressed.Lag - Some hosts are very bad, and it makes competitive play obsolete in some cases. People overexaggerate this issue, however. All it normally does is result in an ability hitting you just barely outside of the range that it normally would.Balance - Patches, however infrequent, have made the whole balance issue a lot better. Some characters are a lot easier to master and are better on some maps than others, but it all really does come down to skill. I've seen some of the ""worst characters"" carry teams.These problems aside, I think the game is really fun. Excellent soundtrack, mostly a good community, and a neat gimmick to thrown into the MOBA genre. There aren't many characters yet, and none have been added in the 5 months I've been playing. If you get bored in MOBAs playing the same character, this game is NOT for you. However, if you want a relaxing little Saturday afternoon brawler MOBA to play with your friends, pick it up. It's addicting and fresh.			"

Though there are some overpowered characters that still need to be toned down a little, there are plenty of characters to choose from (and most likely, more to come!) to really create variety in the match. Not enough maps, plenty of characters to learn and choose from. Definitely recommended, because you'll have endless hours of fun with this game.			"

The gameplay is rather fun for something to waste time on but the voice-over and characters are so annoying I'm not sure how much time I want to spend on it. More on gameplay, It's your basic MOBA setup with a casual, cartoony, and vertical twist. So, if that's your deal, you'll probably like it.			"

												This is a great game! But it’s a hard one to recommend. Let me explain. It’s a 2-D MOBA. Yeah, you know, a MOBA like Dota or League of Legends. But regardless of only having 2 dimensions instead of 3, this game is actually ridiculously fun. Characters are very diverse in how they look, how they play, and there voice acting. Some characters in this game even have the voices of “famous internet celebrities”. However, I put that in quotes because if you don’t use YouTube for gaming recommendations/reviews or playthroughs, you will have no idea who these people are.If you think other MOBA’s are to hard, and their communities have to many a-holes, this is the game for you. And at the small price of 5 dollars when it goes on sale, it would be foolish to not pick this gem up and give it a test drive. Plus they update the game and continue to add new and crazy characters every once in a while so that the game never gets old. In short, it’s a steal, buy it.			"

												Sidescroller MOBA. It's nice and neat until you play it with those who has been playing this right from the release.Some bugs, unbalances and crucial dev mistakes can spoil all the joy it brings.I like it but imperfect (or simply awful) matchmaking ruins everyting. And lags. And balance.Waiting for new upcoming patches and DLCs.UPD.: Yup, now it blows completely. 2.13			"

												Great intro to MOBA style mechanics quicker 15-20 minute game to your tradition MOBA 50 minute games fun game to play even if you don't have 2 other friends to play with great cast of characters and brilliant map design.Each character bring something different to how the game plays as they each have different unique skills and abilities.Minor gripe is on occasion I wound just randomly de sync or drop from the game completely and boom I'm in a game on my own with a set of bots as I cant reconnect to any online games until I restart my computer which really should be sorted out.Great Value for the price when the connection doesn't boot you out.

												This game was a surprising gem. One often sees rave reviews of certain products that are often misleading. In this case, the reviews reflect the fun of this neat little game. It is an odd mix between a classic 2D platformer and an MOBA, and does it with style.  I found myself enjoying characters that I wouldn't enjoy in other MOBA games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a go anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface is oddly charming. As such, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game. As for the audio, the voice acting is grin-worthy, with music and effects adding to the 80's cartoon vibe.			"

												This game is certainly not what it used to be. I took a long hiatus from this game (I stopped some time after Starstorm came out, likely before 2.13) but I was very impressed at the time with it. It was essentially a MOBA for dummies, and I liked it. I really did. Once I returned, though, things had changed. Drastically. And certainly not for the better. Many others have said this, but I can corroborate that this game punishes you on a ridiculous level if you don't do exactly what you're supposed to. Premade groups demolish pretty much anybody against them, making solo play near impossible. Some of the characters snowball way too fast and are just plain broken (I don't think I've ever played in a game that didn't have someone playing Rocco). Because of this, you essentially can't play most of the characters. Slower build characters are impossible to play, because by the time you're ready to get going, the other team's finished with their items. Poor team comps don't even come close to standing a chance. There's also no real comeback ability, due the the snowballing characteristic I've mentioned earlier. The game's basically over just a few minutes in because someone died a couple times already. Poor balancing, impossible solo play, and horrible punishing earns this game a very disgruntled dislike. Pre-2.13, this game was a blast. Now, I can't recommend it at all. Ronimo, you had a good thing going, and you blew it. You really did.			"

												I enjoy the game. Its a 4 player online game. Fun characters . But i think its VERY VERY unbalanced.  Not sure what it was like before the Steam sale, so its hard for me to say oif they 'ruined' it.  Im still learning the ropes myself. Some charaters are way over balanced. Crazy that they want 200$ for their full package LOL. Very unbalanced as of right now, 1 guy can wipe out your entire team. Im sure some people use hacks. I have yet to have a good match. You either win it easily or you lose it easily. Doesnt seem to be any good decent 'even' matches. It will put a lvl 1 against a group of lvl 175's if it can lol.  Some characters can kill me in less than 1 sec. Im not the best player, but im far from the worste. Not worth 10$ but it was definitely worth the 5$ for 3 copies during the last Steam sale.			"

												You control a single “AwesomeNaut” online in a team of 3 against 3. The level is a side-scrolling platformer where you have to bust through enemy turrets and eventually destroy the base, taking out many minions and other AwesomeNauts along the way. As you play a single game your character levels up and you can upgrade their abilities. Each AwesomeNaut has a unique series of abilities and as you level up your profile, you unlock more AwesomeNauts, abilities and features. It was a fun experience, and I would definitely buy it on special if it weren’t for the single fact that I would forget about it after a week. Though if I had any friends (at all) to play with, I’m sure it would be more fun, especially when you devise particular winning strategies and combinations.Definitely worth a gander and if you're into DOTA, HONE or LOL. It's also worth the price.For full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2012/11/18/bwbf-awesomenauts/ "

												Awesomenauts is a very interesting and new take on the MOBA genre. Instead of going into a mythical/fantasy setting, the game is set into the very very distant future, where robots have anger issues, aliens surf around and stab you in the back and talk in pop culture references and '80s movie quotes and technology is so advanced that it became sentient and created two factions to fight each other for the rarest material in the universe, little sparkly cubes called ""Solar"".The art style and music is inspired by the american cartoons of the '80s.The game currently features a cast of 16 (more to come soon) very interesting characters, each with their own unique abilities and ways of play and 4 maps to show off your skills in 3v3 battle arena mode (take down the turrets, take down the base, ????, profit).It's worth noting that currently, there are a lot of balance issues, poor matchmaking that might put veteran players and new player in the same game (eventually leading to the rage quit of some players and leaving you with AI controlled bots, which are pretty good, most of the time), eventual laggy games and the leaderboards are a bit broken.Unlike other MOBAs, Awesomenauts is a more casual game, with fast paced gameplay, the focus of the game being teamwork and fast reflexes. The majority of the community is pretty good and you'll be called mean things and asked to commit suicide way less then any other MOBA out there.The game has very different mechanics from other MOBAs, players having to combine strategy with lots of jumping/platforming and shooting. I highly recommend watching a few tutorials first or trying out Practice Mode on highest difficulty.It's worth nothing that you if you are the kind of player that likes to go solo, get high on the leaderboards and have highest stats, either this game is not for you, or you'll find it as being a serious challenge.Bottom line: I personally found this game very enjoyable most of the times, the characters really funny and cool looking, the music is a treat, the gameplay really fast and addicting and besides the balance and matchmaking issues, all you need is a couple of friends to form a team and jump online and a few learning tutorials.Awesome Game! *thumbs up*			"

WHY DON'T I RECOMMEND IT?I do not recommend it based on its development over time and focus on competitive play: Community too focused on competitve play; Sudden change from a nice gaming experience that welcomes all to an overly competitve game that punishes freedom of choice in the loadouts and ways of playing; The game itself and its development are too focused on competitions and tournaments nowadays, making the game unwelcoming to new, casual players.IF I DID, WHY WOULD I RECOMMEND IT?I would recommend it based on its gameplay and style: Excellent controls; Fun platforming; Big roster of characters with great voice acting; Constant updates with content, fixes and tweaks; Colorful graphics.SHOULD YOU/OTHER PEOPLE BUY IT?It depends on your answer to the following questions: Are you a competitive player? Are you not affected by a foul community? Do you have friends to play it with? Do you like MOBAs? Do you like sidescrollers? Do you like 80s and 90s cartoons?If you answered YES to 4 or more questions above, I suggest you try it for yourself when it goes on sale. It does not happen that often, but you can be sure that at least at Summer and Winter sales it will go for pretty cheap. Otherwise, as it is, I'd suggest you give it a pass.Is it fun? Is it frustrating?My original review was positive. I've been following this game for almost three years now, since its release on xbox 360. The game was much different then, and posed as a fun, casual alternative to more hardcore games like DOTA 2 or League of Legends. The sidescrolling aspect, plus the cartoony characters made it very lighthearted, and the community was very supportive and fun.That is mainly due to the fact the community was very small still, so you'd mostly find people who really enjoyed the game in the public matches. Playing it with friends was a blast. I bought more than 30 copies of the game for friends just because I enjoyed playing it with others so much. I could not stop playing it. So whenever a friend wanted to stop playing, I'd go find another, buy them a copy and continue playing with them and so on until I passed out from exhaustion.As the game grew, so did the community, and you suddenly began seeing a sudden change in the pacing of the matches. Players were hateful, spamming the chat with swear words and offensive comments. The matches themselves became overly competitive, and you'd be shunned by your team mates for not playing in a specific, ""optimized"" way.What I am the saddest about is the fact that the game encouraged experimenting, getting custom loadouts and just trying whatever felt like fun at the moment. As it became more competitive, it seemed like you were being punished by trying to steer away from the known effective combinations of power ups. And other players, both in your team as well as the opponents, would make sure to point your ""mistakes"" out.The matchmaking is a mess too. Most of my friends who recently started playing the game complained they were thrown in matches with overpowered charaters, but thruth is the opponents already knew the most effective loadouts and stuck to it, so my frinds were decimated by them. It is extremely frustrating not being able to experiment and discover things by yourself as the online aspect of the game (which is its mais focus anyway) is filled with unfriendly, over competitve people who simply cuss at you should you dare mention the word ""casual"".Closing wordsI resent the path the game took towards more of an ""eSports"" kind of approach. I spent so many hours (close to a thousand) and so much money in it too, with the kickstarter, the extra copies, all the DLC, several DLC packs for friends... all because I believed this game had a great potential to be some sort of party game focused on a more casual style. I feel a bit betrayed, and that clouds my perception of what the product is today. If you like competitve games and MOBAs, this is a nice alternative, and definitely the best 2D one you can find, based on my own opinion and experience. But with the history I have with this game, I simply cannot recommend it anymore, as it not only shattered my expectations, but it has been a source of much disappointment and grief.Take it or leave it, the final choice is up to you.Go there, save the day!

												Fun, despite it's deep flaws, which are almost exclusively balance related. Which, to be fair, is true of practically every MOBA; there are inevitably a handful of characters who are significantly better, due to how mechanics work or raw numerical output. However, it rankles somewhat worse in Awesomenauts, as there's very limited numbers of characters to play to begin with.7/10			"

												Nice game with lots of characters to unlock. Every round of gameplay helps player to unlock new character or skill. Player have a choice to play as a offensive or defensive character depending on the skill build. This game does not have equipment to build up stats on the player, it tone down the gameplay to more simplistic and intuitive controls to learn. There is few maps to choose from in game to play with. Can be better with the overall gameplay such as improving the objective of the game to something further than destroying only turrents.			"

From Space Cowboys to Pimping Frogs, all complete with a nice soundtrack and theme song for each of the characters. Oh, and don't forget all of the quirky references and all, it IS like an 80's cartoon! .MOBA players will likely recognize key elements seen in other MOBA games. Towers, defense, Poison Characters, Creeps and Neutrals, Stealth/Invis characters, and all!And remember. Every character is OP!			"

												This game is very fun and easy to get into. You control one of about 20 awesomenauts in a 3v3 match where you have to push through lanes by defeating droids and turrets, all the way to the opponents base. You have tanks, pushers, healers, harassers, and so on so every kind of player will find at least one character they will like.Essentially, it's a 2D MOBA (think Dota and League of Legends) with a heavy emphasis on casual play, as well as co-op.The game is far from dead and is reasonably active, but most of the people playing it now have been at it for quite some time. So if you're new and you're going to play this at an odd time (like the middle of the night), matchmaking could place you in a very one-sided game. Though that should change for at least a week or two after a sale, when there's an influx of new players to balance out matchmaking.If you see this on sale, BUY IT. I guarantee you'll have a blast, especially if you're playing with friends. I'm personally picking up the Starstorm when it's next on sale.			"

												Pros:+ The level and character design are funny, excelent. The character voices and personalities are really unique and filled with easter eggs.+ It is not completely unbalanced.+ Excellent when playing locally with your friends.Cons:- The online mode sucks. The matchmaking just throws you inside an already existing match. Thus, you can logout and return instantly to the same match, changing the character. Besides, it is possible that you start in a match that is finishing, what means insta-lose.- It is not really well balanced.- Lacks characters.- This game was ""re-sold"" and we had to kinda re-buy it. Basically, they added new features, changed the name to ""Awesomenauts: Starstorm"" and every character released after that was Starstorm exclusive.Review:+ Yes. I still recommend it. It is really good LOCALLY.			"

												Gameplay 9/10Fast paced 2D MOBA, easy to understand, hard to master. Has some competitive potential and there are a few tournaments. The controls are great and the game rewards skill and teamwork. The game has some small balance issues, but they are constantly working on in it. Graphics 8/10The cartoon graphics are really nice. The effects are ok, but they are polishing them. They got much better over time.Sound 10/10The music, the nauts' theme songs/lines and the sound effects in general are awesome.Matchmaking 7/10Well, this is the main issue of the game, but I don't think there's much to be done if the playerbase doesn't grow. There aren't enough online players in each region for good matchmaking and lag free games. However, some small improvements could be done, like creating the teams after the six players needed for a match are found. This way the best players won't end up in the same team. Also, a pre-game lobby where players could talk and decide what nauts they pick would be great.MiscSome characters are quite original, the theme songs and lines are funny. The game is constantly updated and improved. They are adding new features, new skins, new characters and a new map is planned. The community is pretty great and they've done some great things, like websites where you can check the leaderboards, upload and download replays or where you can check, create and share naut builds. They are also organizing tournaments from time to time.Anyway, I strongly recommend this game, it's one of my all time favourites.			"

The community is typically a lot more friendly than Dota's or LoL's and the cartoonish nature of the graphics seem to work well at keeping people's comments from getting to mean. That being said, it is a moba and as such there is a bit of a learning curve involved, but not a steep one- practice one or two matches and you should be gtg.			"

												This game was a surprising gem. One often sees rave reviews of certain products that are often misleading. In this case, the reviews reflect the fun of this neat little game. It is an odd mix between a classic 2D platformer and an MOBA, and does it with style.  I found myself enjoying characters that I wouldn't enjoy in other MOBA games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a go anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games. The art style and interface is oddly charming. As such, I now use one of the characters as my avatar and a wallpaper from creating a card set for the game. As for the audio, the voice acting is grin-worthy, with music and effects adding to the 80's cartoon vibe.			"

And lags. And balance.Waiting for new upcoming patches and DLCs.UPD.: Yup, now it blows completely. 2.13			"

												Very enjoyable game for anyone that has played League of Legends and enjoyed it for a vast time. This is basically a 2D league, where you can gather up with 3 friends, or go solo, and fight 3 others. As you level up, you unlock more things to enhance your character. Very enjoyable and a nice change!			"

												Played the hell out of this game on XBLA when it was new!Platforming perfection married to the most addicting multiplayer of time. This game is the best multiplayer experience of the year, it is lovingly crafted and oozes fun.Just make sure you take some friends along, as at the time of this reccomendation, the matchmaking in this game can be downright awful. Apart from that, if you like platformers, love mobas and have a sense of humor-- snap this up without a second thought.Edit: One year later, roughly the same thing. Just with more characters and a new expansion pack. Until now, all content has been free save cosmetics.			"

												Fun, despite it's deep flaws, which are almost exclusively balance related. Which, to be fair, is true of practically every MOBA; there are inevitably a handful of characters who are significantly better, due to how mechanics work or raw numerical output. However, it rankles somewhat worse in Awesomenauts, as there's very limited numbers of characters to play to begin with.7/10			"

												I enjoy Awesomenauts a lot for its light-hearted MOBA attitude, fun and responsive gameplay, Saturday Morning aesthetic, and music I can't ever seem to get tired of. Doesn't even come close to having any semblance of balance between all the characters, or arrangements thereof: Some teams just don't work, and some teams can't be beaten.But even through it all, it's missing the toxic atmosphere that comes with playing League of Legends, and for that it's worth uite a lot to me.

												This game is very fun and easy to get into. You control one of about 20 awesomenauts in a 3v3 match where you have to push through lanes by defeating droids and turrets, all the way to the opponents base. You have tanks, pushers, healers, harassers, and so on so every kind of player will find at least one character they will like.Essentially, it's a 2D MOBA (think Dota and League of Legends) with a heavy emphasis on casual play, as well as co-op.The game is far from dead and is reasonably active, but most of the people playing it now have been at it for quite some time. So if you're new and you're going to play this at an odd time (like the middle of the night), matchmaking could place you in a very one-sided game. Though that should change for at least a week or two after a sale, when there's an influx of new players to balance out matchmaking.If you see this on sale, BUY IT. I guarantee you'll have a blast, especially if you're playing with friends. I'm personally picking up the Starstorm when it's next on sale.			"

												Gameplay 9/10Fast paced 2D MOBA, easy to understand, hard to master. Has some competitive potential and there are a few tournaments. The controls are great and the game rewards skill and teamwork. The game has some small balance issues, but they are constantly working on in it. Graphics 8/10The cartoon graphics are really nice. The effects are ok, but they are polishing them. They got much better over time.Sound 10/10The music, the nauts' theme songs/lines and the sound effects in general are awesome.Matchmaking 7/10Well, this is the main issue of the game, but I don't think there's much to be done if the playerbase doesn't grow. There aren't enough online players in each region for good matchmaking and lag free games. However, some small improvements could be done, like creating the teams after the six players needed for a match are found. This way the best players won't end up in the same team. Also, a pre-game lobby where players could talk and decide what nauts they pick would be great.MiscSome characters are quite original, the theme songs and lines are funny. The game is constantly updated and improved. They are adding new features, new skins, new characters and a new map is planned. The community is pretty great and they've done some great things, like websites where you can check the leaderboards, upload and download replays or where you can check, create and share naut builds. They are also organizing tournaments from time to time.Anyway, I strongly recommend this game, it's one of my all time favourites.			"

												Honestly my favorite game, as it is a mix of 2 of my favorite genres of games. Usually the only problem with MOBAs is if the developers don't tune the numbers, but Ronimo has been able to stick with it and balance the game well. The only complaint is that there are a couple of characters that aren't perfect yet, but that will come with time.			"

												Awesomenauts is a 3v3 team-based 2D shooter. I've played this for around 80 minutes so far and enjoying it. Okay, I'll admit it. I bought this game because of the TF2 items but I've been enjoying the game. The soundtrack is amazing, the gameplay is amazing (or should I say Awesome?). This game is a lot different compared to most team-based shooters but it is like Super Monday Night Combat where you'll need to defend your turrets and base. It would be more awesome (cwutididthere?) if my lovely (well most of them ) friends bought this game and played with me. Great game! (or Awesome?)			"

												You control a single “AwesomeNaut” online in a team of 3 against 3. The level is a side-scrolling platformer where you have to bust through enemy turrets and eventually destroy the base, taking out many minions and other AwesomeNauts along the way. As you play a single game your character levels up and you can upgrade their abilities. Each AwesomeNaut has a unique series of abilities and as you level up your profile, you unlock more AwesomeNauts, abilities and features. It was a fun experience, and I would definitely buy it on special if it weren’t for the single fact that I would forget about it after a week. Though if I had any friends (at all) to play with, I’m sure it would be more fun, especially when you devise particular winning strategies and combinations.Definitely worth a gander and if you're into DOTA, HONE or LOL. It's also worth the price.For full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2012/11/18/bwbf-awesomenauts/ "

												MOBA? Yes, of a sort. Awesomenauts is one of a kind, where it sits just below that of the other titans of the MOBA scene, such as DOTA and LOL. The only reason for this is probably because of the cartoonish style of the game which it pulls off really well in a sort of Saturday-morning-cartoon-show. The gameplay feels polished and balanced, as I can say that only a very few times I swore at my screen and called it unbalanced, where I later realized that I had f***ed up on my own. So really down to the bones it's a more relazed MOBA game, so there isn't any pressure of HAVING to win, you just play the game, and then GG at the end. One of the major things that is putting me off is the DLC, which adds new characters and maps, and I feel like this is splitting the community down the middle. 8/10			"

												Nice little MOBA-style game; it is a side-scrolling 2D platforming action-type of a game (whew, what a mouthful), but it is definitely a lot of fun.Pros:- Large variety of characters, most which you unlock as you level up- Constantly updated (bug fixes, character tweaking, additional DLC)- Very fast matches (match average time is roughly 15-20 minutes)Cons:- DLC is quite expensive (however, the only one that is truly worth it IMHO is the Starborn one, because it adds a lot to the gameplay and more robust characters; everything else is quite unnecessary)- Getting money (or ""solar"" as the game puts it) can become quite tedious, as even killing an enemy doesn't give you a lot, and there are a LOT of upgrades to purchaseSo the pros outweigh the cons, but if you just wanna relax and play a game where it's a little more competitive than casual (no actual ranked mode, and no one talks during matches, outside of at the end), then this is the game for you.

												I gave a couple of hours to Awesomenauts. In short - it's a funny enjoyable 2D 3vs3 moba. I started playing out of curiosity and because the game was on top of my games list:) It is a moba with 20ish (or less) different characters with its unique abilities each. Each hero has 4 tier abilites - one passive, one for default weapon, one for first magic and one for second magic ability. Each ability has 6 or 7 upgrade; you start with only 4 and then lvl up to unlock the others but you can only use 3 upgrade out of them all per ability. At the beginning you have only 3 heroes and unlock the others through time; the better you play the faster you unlock them all - i unlocked them all by 3rd hour or something like that. Heroes are specific and cool, some harder to play than others but in general i would say they are quite balanced. It's the team composition that matters the most. Some people are deflected of the game by its cartoonish look but I dont mind that. The biggest feature for me was that even if you die more than the other, soon you will unlock all your abilities - because you use currency (solar) for unlocking abilities unlike other moba games where by less money you have less items or crappy items. Here by less money you just unlock all your tiers a few minutes slower which is not bad, so they balanced the game quite nice and fair. It's the skills and team composition that wins the game in the long run and that is amazing. I managed to overturn a few of the games completely even if i had all my towers/turrets down. My biggest remark goes to sometimes laggy performance and variable ping. All in all - a good decent game to try out for a few hours and get addicted:)			"

WHY DON'T I RECOMMEND IT?I do not recommend it based on its development over time and focus on competitive play: Community too focused on competitve play; Sudden change from a nice gaming experience that welcomes all to an overly competitve game that punishes freedom of choice in the loadouts and ways of playing; The game itself and its development are too focused on competitions and tournaments nowadays, making the game unwelcoming to new, casual players.IF I DID, WHY WOULD I RECOMMEND IT?I would recommend it based on its gameplay and style: Excellent controls; Fun platforming; Big roster of characters with great voice acting; Constant updates with content, fixes and tweaks; Colorful graphics.SHOULD YOU/OTHER PEOPLE BUY IT?It depends on your answer to the following questions: Are you a competitive player? Are you not affected by a foul community? Do you have friends to play it with? Do you like MOBAs? Do you like sidescrollers? Do you like 80s and 90s cartoons?If you answered YES to 4 or more questions above, I suggest you try it for yourself when it goes on sale. It does not happen that often, but you can be sure that at least at Summer and Winter sales it will go for pretty cheap. Otherwise, as it is, I'd suggest you give it a pass.Is it fun? Is it frustrating?My original review was positive. I've been following this game for almost three years now, since its release on xbox 360. The game was much different then, and posed as a fun, casual alternative to more hardcore games like DOTA 2 or League of Legends. The sidescrolling aspect, plus the cartoony characters made it very lighthearted, and the community was very supportive and fun.That is mainly due to the fact the community was very small still, so you'd mostly find people who really enjoyed the game in the public matches. Playing it with friends was a blast. I bought more than 30 copies of the game for friends just because I enjoyed playing it with others so much. I could not stop playing it. So whenever a friend wanted to stop playing, I'd go find another, buy them a copy and continue playing with them and so on until I passed out from exhaustion.As the game grew, so did the community, and you suddenly began seeing a sudden change in the pacing of the matches. Players were hateful, spamming the chat with swear words and offensive comments. The matches themselves became overly competitive, and you'd be shunned by your team mates for not playing in a specific, ""optimized"" way.What I am the saddest about is the fact that the game encouraged experimenting, getting custom loadouts and just trying whatever felt like fun at the moment. As it became more competitive, it seemed like you were being punished by trying to steer away from the known effective combinations of power ups. And other players, both in your team as well as the opponents, would make sure to point your ""mistakes"" out.The matchmaking is a mess too. Most of my friends who recently started playing the game complained they were thrown in matches with overpowered charaters, but thruth is the opponents already knew the most effective loadouts and stuck to it, so my frinds were decimated by them. It is extremely frustrating not being able to experiment and discover things by yourself as the online aspect of the game (which is its mais focus anyway) is filled with unfriendly, over competitve people who simply cuss at you should you dare mention the word ""casual"".Closing wordsI resent the path the game took towards more of an ""eSports"" kind of approach. I spent so many hours (close to a thousand) and so much money in it too, with the kickstarter, the extra copies, all the DLC, several DLC packs for friends... all because I believed this game had a great potential to be some sort of party game focused on a more casual style. I feel a bit betrayed, and that clouds my perception of what the product is today. If you like competitve games and MOBAs, this is a nice alternative, and definitely the best 2D one you can find, based on my own opinion and experience. But with the history I have with this game, I simply cannot recommend it anymore, as it not only shattered my expectations, but it has been a source of much disappointment and grief.Take it or leave it, the final choice is up to you.Go there, save the day!

												Nice game with lots of characters to unlock. Every round of gameplay helps player to unlock new character or skill. Player have a choice to play as a offensive or defensive character depending on the skill build. This game does not have equipment to build up stats on the player, it tone down the gameplay to more simplistic and intuitive controls to learn. There is few maps to choose from in game to play with. Can be better with the overall gameplay such as improving the objective of the game to something further than destroying only turrents.			"

												The name says it all this game is really Awesome! :) Awesomenauts is a 3-on-3 side-scrolller battle game with a variety of different modes,chracters,maps,powers etc to choose from. The game mode i play most is the orginal one where both teams have a set of turrets and a base the aim of the game is to get into the other teams base whilst defending yours but to do that you will need to get rid of their turrets that are blocking the way. That is easier said then done with all the drones,bots and Awsomenauts in your path you are sure to have a action-packed,intense and amazing close game. The chracters are all unique in their own way but they are all different so a lot of chracters to explore and how you can use them to your advantage and dominate! the 2 chracters i use most is Sheriff Lonestar who can run and gun,throw dynamite (so with turrets you chuck them at that and run off which can work well), jet boots which can help to escape and a charging bull that pushes the other team back until they kill it. Skolideer is a robot who can also run and gun but with lasers,jets to fly to higher platforms,earthquake which is like a ground pound,and you can also throw enemies. The powers,chracter,weapons etc. everything can be upgraded in the store which is at your base but you need to collect solar during the match but it is also a healing station which is handy if you don,t want to go out and earn health in the middle of battle. The maps are really balanced and are suited to the game as the game is set in space so that fits with all the chracters. and there is so much more in this game and has so much replayability to the game as its always really fun and not endless.the DLCs are worth checking out as they give powers,coustumes and such to add to the chracter. Oh and 1 other thing chracters have different voice commands (they are same just say a differnt line) and taunts :) if you can you should deffenitely buy this game as it is so worth it as the matches are un-predictable ps the music to this game and i mean all the soundtracks are fantastic as it gives the game the cartoon feel which i really like as thats what the game is aiming to do oh and the graphics are fantastic! :).Very addictive weather your playing with friends or not.

												Pros:+ The level and character design are funny, excelent. The character voices and personalities are really unique and filled with easter eggs.+ It is not completely unbalanced.+ Excellent when playing locally with your friends.Cons:- The online mode sucks. The matchmaking just throws you inside an already existing match. Thus, you can logout and return instantly to the same match, changing the character. Besides, it is possible that you start in a match that is finishing, what means insta-lose.- It is not really well balanced.- Lacks characters.- This game was ""re-sold"" and we had to kinda re-buy it. Basically, they added new features, changed the name to ""Awesomenauts: Starstorm"" and every character released after that was Starstorm exclusive.Review:+ Yes. I still recommend it. It is really good LOCALLY.			"

												This game is brilliant! It is one of the most fun games I have played recently. The range of characters is great and each character has a totally different feel to it.You can even customize the playstyle for each character you play by changing what upgrades you can buy during the match.It could use a few more levels and some variation on them but that is not a big issue and in no way stops this game from being stupidly fun.Oh yeah also it has an amazing soundtrack that reminds me of cartoons from the 90s. I really wish I could get the soundtrack, it is the only videogame soundtrack I have ever wanted to actually buy.			"

From Space Cowboys to Pimping Frogs, all complete with a nice soundtrack and theme song for each of the characters. Oh, and don't forget all of the quirky references and all, it IS like an 80's cartoon! .MOBA players will likely recognize key elements seen in other MOBA games. Towers, defense, Poison Characters, Creeps and Neutrals, Stealth/Invis characters, and all!And remember. Every character is OP!			"

												This game is really fun to play. The GFX, the music, the sound, the balance of game mechanics... everything is really well done.To describe the gameplay is really easy: it's dota2, but as a platformer.It's damn good.That said, I'm a bit worried about the DLC. It may possible that a ""proper"" online character with ""proper"" items may not be able to be obtain without spending more money. For instance, the ""best"" heroes and items may only be available for those who pay more... those who then will crush those who pay less. I may be wrong, cause I'm not that far in the game (and if I'm not wrong, I will change my mind on the game).A last note, and not the least, this is like dota2: this is not for casual gamers. You will need to train and master the maps and heroes. "

												Note the date of this review before reading it: March 17, 2014.A lot of people have complained about problems in this game, which primarily include matchmaking, lag, and balance issues.Matchmaking - Yes, matchmaking is an enormous problem. You could very easily be queued up against people that have logged 200+ hours your first game. You could also be thrown into a one-sided game where the enemy is already sitting in your base. Why this is, not a lot of people know. You are ranked leagues in this game, and matchmaking tries to find a game that has people in it that average out to be in a league that is the same as yours or adjacent to it. Now this seems ideal, but if you were league 6, and league 1 player could queue up with a league 9 player and you could face them in a match. This does happen sometimes, and the problem certainly needs to be addressed.Lag - Some hosts are very bad, and it makes competitive play obsolete in some cases. People overexaggerate this issue, however. All it normally does is result in an ability hitting you just barely outside of the range that it normally would.Balance - Patches, however infrequent, have made the whole balance issue a lot better. Some characters are a lot easier to master and are better on some maps than others, but it all really does come down to skill. I've seen some of the ""worst characters"" carry teams.These problems aside, I think the game is really fun. Excellent soundtrack, mostly a good community, and a neat gimmick to thrown into the MOBA genre. There aren't many characters yet, and none have been added in the 5 months I've been playing. If you get bored in MOBAs playing the same character, this game is NOT for you. However, if you want a relaxing little Saturday afternoon brawler MOBA to play with your friends, pick it up. It's addicting and fresh.			"

It's Really fun to play alone, but it shines brightest when your playing with friends. Its pretty simple for a MOBA  but if anything it makes it even more fun not having to deal with a steep learning curve. Don't get me wrong there is a learning curve just not one that takes hours upon hours upon hours to master. I'm not a fan of MOBAs, but this game is the exception. It is simply awesome. 9.1			"

												Gameplay 9/10Fast paced 2D MOBA, easy to understand, hard to master. Has some competitive potential and there are a few tournaments. The controls are great and the game rewards skill and teamwork. The game has some small balance issues, but they are constantly working on in it. Graphics 8/10The cartoon graphics are really nice. The effects are ok, but they are polishing them. They got much better over time.Sound 10/10The music, the nauts' theme songs/lines and the sound effects in general are awesome.Matchmaking 7/10Well, this is the main issue of the game, but I don't think there's much to be done if the playerbase doesn't grow. There aren't enough online players in each region for good matchmaking and lag free games. However, some small improvements could be done, like creating the teams after the six players needed for a match are found. This way the best players won't end up in the same team. Also, a pre-game lobby where players could talk and decide what nauts they pick would be great.MiscSome characters are quite original, the theme songs and lines are funny. The game is constantly updated and improved. They are adding new features, new skins, new characters and a new map is planned. The community is pretty great and they've done some great things, like websites where you can check the leaderboards, upload and download replays or where you can check, create and share naut builds. They are also organizing tournaments from time to time.Anyway, I strongly recommend this game, it's one of my all time favourites.			"

												Plenty of variety with characters in the game, and the build you choose can either make or break the match. Every character counters one another, and it always leaves you on your toes. Though there are some overpowered characters that still need to be toned down a little, there are plenty of characters to choose from (and most likely, more to come!) to really create variety in the match. Not enough maps, plenty of characters to learn and choose from. Definitely recommended, because you'll have endless hours of fun with this game.			"

												It's not really my kind of game, but I got a coupon for it from a trading card badge. My first opinion of it is that the voice acting is completely horrible. The gameplay is rather fun for something to waste time on but the voice-over and characters are so annoying I'm not sure how much time I want to spend on it. More on gameplay, It's your basic MOBA setup with a casual, cartoony, and vertical twist. So, if that's your deal, you'll probably like it.			"

												This is possibly my favourite game at the time of writing, it is certainly the one I play most. I don't think, however, that I could call it a good game; the developers are legitimately bad. It is buggy, it has awful netcode, it is peer-to-peer. At a higher level of play, these things come close to completely ruining the game, and lead to a lot of frustration. Regardless, it is still, if things go well, very fun.Well designed, but not well made.			"

												This game is amazing. Great graphics, amazing soundtrack, unique characters, full player input. I admit, the lag and matchmaking are a problem but you have to accept lag as it is since the playerbase is small and if you're losing badly just quit. Ragequiting isn't a shameful act. It's there for a reason. This game has fast paced action, loads of humour and has a lot of character. It also stands out from other mobas because it takes place in space so all the characters don't have to be mages, knights, archers and anthros. Extremly fun game with a great community. A must buy.

												Awesomenauts is a MOBA. Like Smite, LoL, and others, but its much different. It uses a unique 2D perspective and fun gameplay with many characters (Aliens in this game). The price tag of 10 bucks is kinda a lot, since there isnt as much content as other MOBAs which are free2play. But the cartoon style and fast paced gameplay are a lot of fun, and keep the game from getting boring fast. Its fun to test out each Naut and see which ones abilities and items suit your own personal playstyle. Overall the gameplay is solid and fun and can be played on ANY computer even with low specs.7/10			"

Now lets talk about deadlift... congratulations ronimo you managed to do a naut that isnt completely overpowered and broken on his release GOOD JOB! I think this update made game take a step in the right direction but the game can still be improved. Making the game free to play would increase the playerbase and expand the games lifespain a little bit. Thanks for making me love this game again ronimo!			"

Why should you play this game?Because it's fun to play, both with friends and alone.Because it's challenging and you won't always win.Because it's still being updated, so things that might be annoying now, can get fixed later.Because new content is still coming.Because some people (Unlike what you mostly hear about this game) are kind too, and know how to teamwork.Get the game if you have the time to level up, train, get good, and wreck the enemy team, or just want a fun game to play with your friends and whoever wants to join you.

												After a few more hundred hours of gameplay I feel the need to update this review a little so the previous review will be located at the bottom.Prepare to have to carry every game (If you play on your own)Around 90% of the games I've played have been against premades who I know for a fact I would beat if it weren't for teammates who are obviously inexperienced, and don't even get me started with the inferior matchmaking ""Slapdash"" doesn't even start to cover how bad the system is.The game is enjoyable when it's fair a good comparison to this is call of duty back in 2008-2012 each team would have 4 low - decent skilled players and 1-2 good players most of the time assuming it wasn't a premade in which even the premade would normally rage quit in the event they were versing at least on decent player.The main reason I enjoy this game so is the 5% where both teams are equal and are having fun and as of recent events the percentage is rapidly declining.Another review said I quote ""Carry Simulator"" That is also a fully completed review of this game.The game is self if fun but after playing for a while it is totally broken here is the reasons why.#1 The community is the typical trash talking 7 years old call of duty player.#2 As a brand new player you can get put against people who have been playing for over 1000 hours and are in a group so you and 2 randoms who have played around 3 hours all together can get put vs a  team whose hours accumulate to over 3000.#3 The peer to peer basis on this game is terrible just plain awful you can have a ping of 03 and because the opponent who has 400+ he will have an enormous advantage.#4 I have played the developers in the game and asked them these questions and they always come out this the excuse.(After thinking these changes over and we have alot of times, we always try and improve the community ...ect....)And then they always say we can't do anything that's up to the bosses.As much as this game is fun it is paired to be completely unbalanced in almost every aspect and completely unfair and will drive you mad but at the same time can be a great experience and be extremely fun i would rate the game.6/10 Great game but needs a total revamp.

												Awesomenauts is a 3v3, 2D MOBA with a cartoony style developed and published by Ronimo Games.Narrative:The Good - Awesomenauts is one of the most over the top and silly MOBAs in recent memory. The name alone really does give a good idea of how absurd and cheesy the game is. The main plot is about a war between robots with a team of elite mercenaries in the mix. A really unique aspect is that each character is given their own backstory and interesting dialogue for when they're taunting or just bragging throughout the matches. The dialogue is funny and stupid and the characters are just downright odd. You've got Leon, a French speaking chameleon that is wanted for having sex with a ruler's wife after playing a bowls championship. You've also got Ksenia, an assassin who was tricked by her father into wearing a headset that made her think she was a hair stylist when she was actually killing his competition and now she still wears the headset to watch soap operas. Need I go on?The Bad - Nothing.Score - 10/10Graphics:The Good - Awesomenauts looks fantastic. While LoL and DOTA don't look awful, Awesomenauts is downright spectacular in the visuals department. The artstyle is cartoony and really appealing with a huge color palette. It runs at 60 FPS without issues and is incredibly flashy. Each character looks distinctly different so you always know who you're going up against.The Bad - Nothing.Score - 10/10Sound:The Good - Awesomenauts has a wide array of music with some fantastic, upbeat and happy pieces for the arena battles. The shop music is just perfect and the characters have some of the funniest theme music you could imagine. My favourite being Leon's because it's romantic music with some guy saying random French words in a sexy voice.The Bad - Nothing.Score - 10/10Gameplay:The Good - Awesomenauts is incredibly fun. It's very simple to learn and incredibly hard to master. Each character has access to a regular weapons like a gun or fists or something and has two purchasable moves that help give them a considerable edge in battle. The characters themselves are all unique and have their own playstyles and base health. Leon can pull enemies in and go invisible but isn't very tanky. Froggy G. is also pretty fragile but is able to dash towards enemies and activate a special tornado that allows him to shred through his problems. Voltar is able to heal teammates and lay down AoE healing devices. There's also quite a few characters to choose from. The base game offers up 18 different characters, most of which being unlockable as you progress. Most of them are very well balanced. Speaking of progression, the game has a rewarding XP system which will let you unlock more power ups for purchase at the shop in the arenas, helping give a sense that you're actually getting somewhere. The shop itself is awesome (ha, see what I did there?). It allows you to purchase new moves and buff them, along with your primary weapon and character's physical aspects. The currency you use to purchase these upgrades will slowly build up overtime and is gained more quickly by farming off creatures and killing enemy Awesomenauts. I forgot to mention that there's also a freefall onto the battlefield at the beginning of spawning which allows you to gain more currency and keep the player from becoming bored. The Bad - Awesomenauts' biggest issue is balancing. While for the most part the game is fairly good about it, there are times when it does a♥♥♥♥♥♥job and it really shows. Remember when I said MOST characters are balanced? Well I said most because there are a few that are obnoxiusly overpowered. Ayla is incredibly annoying since she can activate an AoE effect that allows her to catch anyone and take less damage depending on the number of enemy Awesomenauts in the area. Rocco is able to diss out mass damage and send out a projectile that can kill you in your own base in areas the enemy can't reach. And Nibbs is able to tank damage like you wouldn't believe while punishing anyone he gets near. I hate fighting these characters due to their obscenely good setups. Matches are also not balanced incredibly well so steam rolling and getting rolled is inevitable. Finally, the levelling system. As you kill enemies, you gain XP in matches which levels up your team. This boosts them with extra health and damage, making them even harder to take down. It basically means that if your team dies in the early game, you're pretty much screwed. This is the one aspect I want completely removed.Score - 7/10Longevity and Replayability:The Good - Awesomenauts is incredibly addictive with matches not taking too long at about a 15-20 minute average. The personal levelling system helps keep you playing and there's a ton to unlock. The game is also just downright fun.The Bad - Nothing, it's fleshed out.Score - 10/10Final Score: Awesomnauts really is awesome (I did it again!). It's engaging, simple, funny, absurd, and charming. It is most definitely worth the price, so long as you're willing to deal with some balancing issues.9.4/10 = Spectacular			"

												A very good game with no big flaws, lots of character balancing to keep builds under control and updates frequently. People want dedicated servers but in reality, if a player host is bad, the game automatically switches it, so they are just complaining fools. I recommended this game highly. (UP UNTIL 2.7)Since 2.7 - Every character has been buffed or nerfed to be op or unusable, all useful and fun abilities were taken out. New, much worse layout, and on top of that the matchmaking system is pairing my side up with new players and the enemies with 10 prestige veterans.Edit to 7/7/15 - The game has really picked up and all the big pros have stopped, so it's kinda fun and fair for all now. All the 2.7 updates that ruined everything have been changed and revoked, so the game is once again balanced and fun.			"

												Awesomenauts is awesome as the name suggests.This game is omfg amazing in near all aspects, there ARE a few problems (but they're only gonna ruin the experience if you focus on them):Bad Matchmaking (LIKE I WANNA VS THE PRESTIGE 10 TRIAD 3 LEAGUES ABOVE ME LIKE THANKS)Stuffs expensive (apart from the game itself its just skins you buy, doe.)Playing rogue competitively wise will murder youLow cast (barely 30)Apart from those four (and some balancing issues), Awesomenauts is an incredible experience and probably is the best MOBA experience you're getting  as it treads the path to AWESOMENESS for MOBAs in the future.

												Honestly, a good MOBA. It's not a F2P so that reduces players, also at times it is harder to pair to a match with real players. You usually start a match with bots. There is a lot of abilities and characters for each different playing style. A 3v3 and I love it, not a lot of players or anything like that. Basically a side-scrolling MOBA, so LoL or Dota 2. Only problem that I have with Awesomenauts is the servers. There is a problem with the connectivity and consistency. There is major lag at times and it gets annoying. I have very good internet 120 Mb/s Down 15 Mb/s Up. I have also heard other players have this problem as well. Other than that, it's a good time.			"

												After having just under 500 hours gametime, I feel I have appropriate experience to quickly review this game.A quick run-down:Awesomenauts is a fast-paced, strategic, 3v3, MOBA-style game in the style of a 2D-platformer. Like League of Legends, this game consists of defending your base and attacking the enemy team's base. Each team's base is protected by at least 2 levels of turrets per map and teams must destroy enemy turrets in order to successfully reach the base and attack. However, unlike games such as League of Legends and Dota2, Awesomenauts allows the player to have full control of their chosen character using W,A,S,D keys for movement and mouse-buttons to attack. Players attack in real-time rather than time-based attacks. There is a fairly large array of characters to choose from (seeing it has only been out a few years) and the developers consistantly bring out more each year, which changes the flavour of the game and mixes up the current meta-play.My opinion on the game:Awsomenauts has to be one of the most competitive and fun games I have ever played to date. It's quirky, quick and comes jam-packed with great artwork and a terrific soundtrack. Sound effects and music are composed by partner company Sonnic Picnic, who I must say do an excellent job. The developers are constantly updating it, with extra effort put into balancing character abilities, so there is always fair game.If you are new to this game, then I must advise playing offline against the bots to get used to the feel of the game and the different abilites of the characters; online can be pretty intense, competitive and difficult, which may repell new players who are fed up of losing. However, once some momentum is gathered, it becomes quite easy to identify new and better ways of playing, which are moulded by the in-game variables such as enemy team characters and the chosen map.I enjoy this game thoroughly and love going on kill-streaks; I don't believe I have felt a feeling like this since getting kill streaks on Gears of War 3.With satisfaction and frustration compiled into one, this game offers everything a player is looking for in an online MOBA game. If you're bored of LoL and Dota2, have a blast at this, I guarantee you'll enjoy it.			"

												When I first started playing the game and endured through the initial presentation/voice acting I thought to myself - This is going to be so bad... but what else could I expect for the price?Then I started playing the practice match... and it was fairly ok.... I then moved on to on-line gaming, and I played the first...... and the second,... and the third...until I had to stop because I was told I should prepare dinner otherwise we would starve.Basically, it is a sort of pvp 3vs3 tower defense game. You have to destroy the enemy core and bash some turrets along the way, while the other group is trying to do the same. The characters have very distinct characteristics and playing with a different one will force you to change your approach and strategy.What can I say , it is a very entertaining game and generates interesting battles, provided that you chose a character that suits your game style.It is a very enjoyable way to waste time. And I say ""waste"" in a good way, because if you get hooked, the time will fly and you will forget about some of your pressing obligations - such has eating			"

												What is Awesomnauts? A 2D Platformer Shooter MOBA, where 2 teams of 3 compete to take down the other's drill, while pushing down towers and the drill with friendly drones.What can be said about it? It's gameplay is extremely solid, leaving a lot to good aim and skilled platforming to determine the better player, in addition to strategy.It also feels as though they looked at other MOBA's (that shall remain nameless to avoid wars) and thought ""What flaws do these games have that can make the game boring, and how can we changes that?"" What results is a bunch of simple changes that make the game more engaging, such as respawn times getting partly replaced with a minigame to earn ""solar"" (in game currency), replacing loading screens with fan-art and themes of the character you chose, a variety of maps (each with gimmicks, such as a giant worm that can pop out when a button is hit), and removing the concept of ""items"" (now you don't have 20 characters who all build the EXACT. SAME. THING.) and instead special upgrades for your different abilities/attacks (such as increase damage, or give it a stun, or allow multiple uses but less damage per use) but also restricts these upgrades (You can only choose 3 out of 6 possible upgrades per ability, meaning you need to plan ahead due to no selling mechanic).The music is also amazing, and does not seem to grow old no matter how much I hear it (helped by the fact there is a new song that plays each respawn, as well as if you go on a killing spree). I often find myself listening to it outside of the game itself.The characters all have a lot of charm to them as well. You have a Worm and Pufferfish partner's in crime going ""We are going on a heist here, see?"", a space viking out on a war path because he was called fat, and the greatest action hero that ever existed (though we will touch on him later). Simple phrases such as how they taunt and use voice commands to what they say while shopping really show off these characters.One more great thing about this game: Local Multiplayer. You can play locally with somebody split-screen, but you can team up with them online. Few games do this, and it's welcome to be able to invite a friend over to have them join me for a round or two without them needing to own the game itself.Finally, unlike most other MOBA type games, you aren't dedicated to a round. People can leave their game (though it DOES count as a loss) at will, and that space gets filled with a Bot player instead of unbalancing the teams (and to be fair, bots are pretty competant in this game, a rare occurance in a lot of games), and a player can eventually replace that bot as well. Most other MOBA type games force you to sit through a whole game, or cripple your team, but this system prevents both of those issues.So what is wrong with it? Well, it's not nice to new players. A LOT of upgrades have to be unlocked, and while this is nice at first as to prevent a player from being overwhelmed, some important upgrades (such as damage for assassin type Nauts) don't get unlocked until hours upon hours of gameplay. Also, new players have a good chance to be paired up with players who have a LOT of experience (a flaw in a lot of multiplayer games) simply due to the system, where it pairs you against people of a similar ranking.Also, there is no dedicated servers. While it's nice as this means the game is never full, since players host the games themselves, this can lead to lag and hits are based on the client of the attacker. This can lead to some cheap deaths just because somebody is lagging or the host does not have a computer suited to hosting.Then there is DLC. Now, I wouldn't mind paying the $5 more to get the whole game, but it feels like I have been ripped off when I buy the game just to find out I can't use 5 characters because I haven't dropped money into it (Such as the afformentioned Ted McPain, greatest action hero alive).Finally, and this is a nitpick, but there are a LOT of references. Now, I am a person who likes a small reference now and then, but this game feels like a lot of humor comes from simply getting those references (A lot of characters items are references... There's even an upgrade called ""Skrogachu"" with a picture of what is clearly supposed to be a Pikachu.Overall, great game, though network issues could be improved. It's worth the money, worth playing through it, but expect to get kicked in the teeth by seasoned players for a bit. Get past that, you'll appreciate the game.			"

Eventually, their booboos will be too much for them to take, and they will commit suicide by flying away off the stage.  Currently however, there are only 8 playable characters, and they all have the same movesets.  They are Honic, Bobito, Cowboy, Woman, Megoman, Froggo, Brainos, and Slugzor.This game is well worth $10.00 though, and I recomend it to everyone.			"

Can be rather repetitive at times but the element of fun is still there.Pros:         +Enjoyable game-Has an almost refreshing appeal to it         +Has a nice effect with the 2D-Gives you a new look to RTSRPG         +Characters!-Oh the lovable characters. I <3 Leon         +Game Elements-The Drones,Turrets and Bases I find are better than creeps and towers!Cons:        -The connection  -The one thing that really bugs me is that depending on who the host is the reconnecting can be a nightmare and a complete distraction to the game       -Overpowered     -Some characters do have a slight advantage to most others and that almost makes the game to a rage-quittable one.Overall:            This game is very VERY fun (esp. With friends!) and dosen't have a boring effect like a lot of games in the same category. The action is forever going and you don't even notice how time flies in matches!

												If you like MOBAs or sidescrolling platformers, or just like fast action and crazy antics, this is a good pick. Best played with two other friends, its skill system is unique in its genre for doing away with items in favor of character-specific or ability-specific boosts.			"

												Awesomenauts is an excellent game that I highly recommend. It’s a MOBA game with a Saturday morning cartoon style and from a 2d view, yet works surprising well in gameplay. Visual wise the game is great. While playing I felt waves of nostalgia from the times I watched cartoon tapes on my VHS. In terms of audio the sound effects feel cheesy, but I personally think that adds to the charm. Each individual character has their own unique theme song and a bunch of witty one liners they shout during battle. Some characters are even voiced by famous youtubers like OMFGCATA, TotalBiscuit, PressHeartToContinue, Myndflame and HAWPofficial.	Gameplay is where the game really shines though. You, your two team mates and your three opponents pick a character. Afterward you get launched from a space ship in a drop pod which can be moved around to collect money as you fall towards your team’s base. At the base you will find the shop, which is vital. Your character has four rows total to buy from. The top rows are your abilities you must buy, and once you bought that ability its upgrade row is opened and you can use it in combat. Below them are your standard attack and utility which are unlocked from the start. Each row has six different upgrades that can be applied to the corresponding category, but you can only choose three of them. This adds depth to battle as you will have to sacrifice one thing to improve another and so on. The main goal of the game is to destroy the solar drill, which is stationed at your base. It is guarded by tough turrets, but if they are destroyed the drills open to attack. You and your team have to defend your turrets and destroy theirs, and I have to admit that it’s pretty fun! 	The major flaw is unbalance of newly released characters, but that’s solely because they just came out and get patched up pretty quickly. This game is very good, and I hope buyers will enjoy it as much as I do.  "

												this is a fun game and is really the only kind of competitive 2d platformer game out there. It is a MOBA but its learning curve isnt as high as others. there are currently 27 champions, each with 3 attacks and a total of 24 upgrades per champion. The mechanics of each champion feel unique and has multiple viable builds. Honestly, this game has a relatively low skill floor but an extremely high skill ceiling. It's a very good game.the balance has a few issues but the developers directly talk to the playerbase regarding it and works together with the community to improve the balance. I've seen things the community came up with get implemented that basically everyone agrees was an improvement. the game has a surprisingly strong competitive scene. Keep in mind that on average this is a game with an average of ~500 congruent players. In this year we've seen one doubles tournament,  another 2 month long league style tournament, 2 different 1v1 tournaments each focused on different characters, another 2 month long league style tournament, 3 different bracket based tournaments, and a  2v2 TDM tournament. honestly this game is way better if you have friends to play with. the community is one of those where everyone who plays regularly knows each other so its not terribly hard to find people to play with. since on steam sales it goes on sale for like a dollar it is well worth a try. you really gotta stick with it though. if youre not willing to try and learn the mechanics (which again isnt as advanced as other MOBAs, but the tutorial is trash and youre going to fend for yourself learning them) then you wont have a good time. This is one of those games where you can easily spend 1000 hours on it if you motivate yourself to get past the crappy first 50.			"

												Very nice game, in short, it's a simplified, casual and 2D DOTA. Pros: Easier to start off with than DOTA/LoLEach character has their own music and items, so each 'naut has more depthQuick matchmaking and short matches mean fast paced gameplay Brilliant characters with awesome voice actors  (including TotalBiscuit, Jesse Cox and Myndflame)Cons: Online lag can detract from your experience, but it is not too rampant.Naut balancing can be iffy, but Ronimo are always improving the game in patches. So overall I really reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys MOBAs and strategy games.			"

												Awesomenauts....Some say its an entirely unique game most...just say its kinda like LoL or Dota. It's a quirky humorous yet dark version of a spacey wacey timey wimey LoL. Unlike Dota where its more classes Each ""class"" Is a Character following along the lines of LoL. The backstories are a bit short and as far as I can tell not much has been added on by the fanbase but I'm getting off topic here. The gameplay itself is an interesting platforming type. It is a rather tactical game so most of you charge in guns a blazin fans probably won't do too well. I recommend this game because of the fact that eac character actually takes a specific mindset to truely master. I myself use voltar to his full exent but even then there are different ways the cahracters can be used. Anyone can take a character and if their items allow it make a build that they and very few others could master entirely. Not only that but with the recent expansion the random awesomenaut takes on a whole new use for Team Death Match. The game is just...its hard to describe especially for one like me.TL;DR Good game give them your money BUY ALL THE THINGS.			"

												I am not going to lie the first time i played this game the first thought that went through my head was "" AHH MAH GERD!! ITS LEAGUE A LEGENDZ!""and well it is, it is a very basic simplified version of LoL but in a more fun enviroment and easier to learn and easier to pick up and play. Sadly i have only been able to play this game either against Bots or with a friend and against Bots, as at the time i first purchased this game i didnt have a stable internet connection to play online with, so i dont know how well this game played online.The Charectors you can play as are varied and non of them feel overpowered compared to others ( well there is one or 2 that are weak and pointless when playing in a game against just Bots but would be very helpfull in online games) this helped the game become more about skill and not just about how powerfull a char is and what build they have.Review word of the day : my spelling			"

												Personal opinion: An overall great game! Can be rather repetitive at times but the element of fun is still there.Pros:         +Enjoyable game-Has an almost refreshing appeal to it         +Has a nice effect with the 2D-Gives you a new look to RTSRPG         +Characters!-Oh the lovable characters. I <3 Leon         +Game Elements-The Drones,Turrets and Bases I find are better than creeps and towers!Cons:        -The connection  -The one thing that really bugs me is that depending on who the host is the reconnecting can be a nightmare and a complete distraction to the game       -Overpowered     -Some characters do have a slight advantage to most others and that almost makes the game to a rage-quittable one.Overall:            This game is very VERY fun (esp. With friends!) and dosen't have a boring effect like a lot of games in the same category. The action is forever going and you don't even notice how time flies in matches!                   A must play!			"

												When I first started playing the game and endured through the initial presentation/voice acting I thought to myself - This is going to be so bad... but what else could I expect for the price?Then I started playing the practice match... and it was fairly ok.... I then moved on to on-line gaming, and I played the first...... and the second,... and the third...until I had to stop because I was told I should prepare dinner otherwise we would starve.Basically, it is a sort of pvp 3vs3 tower defense game. You have to destroy the enemy core and bash some turrets along the way, while the other group is trying to do the same. The characters have very distinct characteristics and playing with a different one will force you to change your approach and strategy.What can I say , it is a very entertaining game and generates interesting battles, provided that you chose a character that suits your game style.It is a very enjoyable way to waste time. And I say ""waste"" in a good way, because if you get hooked, the time will fly and you will forget about some of your pressing obligations - such has eating			"

												Now, im rewriting this review because of all the hate this game is getting in recent reviews, over the ""xp system"".First of all, the xp system isn't terrible, and doesn't ruin the game, but i can see why some may dislike it. Now to the review.Overview: simple platforming and 3 abilities to attack. Destroy turrets and the enemy drillcore to win. Colourful, bright colours and graphics. Addictive gameplay, easy to pick up and understand straight away.One of the only problems I can think of right now is the MATCHMAKING. Most people are complaining about this (as well as the xp system) but the matchmaking deserves the most attention. Being matched with someone who is A LOT better than you is not fun. And the skill range is rather large, so the matchmaking has to be at least a little better for the full experience.Still a great game, and an awesome multiplayer experience if you get some friends on it with you.

												Honestly, a good MOBA. It's not a F2P so that reduces players, also at times it is harder to pair to a match with real players. You usually start a match with bots. There is a lot of abilities and characters for each different playing style. A 3v3 and I love it, not a lot of players or anything like that. Basically a side-scrolling MOBA, so LoL or Dota 2. Only problem that I have with Awesomenauts is the servers. There is a problem with the connectivity and consistency. There is major lag at times and it gets annoying. I have very good internet 120 Mb/s Down 15 Mb/s Up. I have also heard other players have this problem as well. Other than that, it's a good time.			"

												Very fun an innovative MOBA game. The only drawback to this game is the system (Unfair Matchmaking , P2P hosts , no proper servers) But that is understandable unless Ronimo magically aquires millions of dollars. Overall great game ^_^			"

												Ok ok ok, this game runs perfectly on my crappy laptop (If need to use it) and the graphics are fantastic! Taunts, tacticle taunts, great costumes, reasonable priced DLC and costumes. Fully voice acted, great macanics, balanced. Whats not to love? The varaity of attacks, classes, costumes, and strats, and many other is great! They have lots of torniments to compete for things like Alein ware computers, and $7,500 dollar prize pool! In real cash! This game is great, and takes dedicated players to master. But I still love it! Go buy this, or wait for a sale, I got it for 1$ on the sale, and the DLC for half off. So wait for a sale or yolo it and buy the game, I don't care how you get it, just get this game!			"

												What is Awesomnauts? A 2D Platformer Shooter MOBA, where 2 teams of 3 compete to take down the other's drill, while pushing down towers and the drill with friendly drones.What can be said about it? It's gameplay is extremely solid, leaving a lot to good aim and skilled platforming to determine the better player, in addition to strategy.It also feels as though they looked at other MOBA's (that shall remain nameless to avoid wars) and thought ""What flaws do these games have that can make the game boring, and how can we changes that?"" What results is a bunch of simple changes that make the game more engaging, such as respawn times getting partly replaced with a minigame to earn ""solar"" (in game currency), replacing loading screens with fan-art and themes of the character you chose, a variety of maps (each with gimmicks, such as a giant worm that can pop out when a button is hit), and removing the concept of ""items"" (now you don't have 20 characters who all build the EXACT. SAME. THING.) and instead special upgrades for your different abilities/attacks (such as increase damage, or give it a stun, or allow multiple uses but less damage per use) but also restricts these upgrades (You can only choose 3 out of 6 possible upgrades per ability, meaning you need to plan ahead due to no selling mechanic).The music is also amazing, and does not seem to grow old no matter how much I hear it (helped by the fact there is a new song that plays each respawn, as well as if you go on a killing spree). I often find myself listening to it outside of the game itself.The characters all have a lot of charm to them as well. You have a Worm and Pufferfish partner's in crime going ""We are going on a heist here, see?"", a space viking out on a war path because he was called fat, and the greatest action hero that ever existed (though we will touch on him later). Simple phrases such as how they taunt and use voice commands to what they say while shopping really show off these characters.One more great thing about this game: Local Multiplayer. You can play locally with somebody split-screen, but you can team up with them online. Few games do this, and it's welcome to be able to invite a friend over to have them join me for a round or two without them needing to own the game itself.Finally, unlike most other MOBA type games, you aren't dedicated to a round. People can leave their game (though it DOES count as a loss) at will, and that space gets filled with a Bot player instead of unbalancing the teams (and to be fair, bots are pretty competant in this game, a rare occurance in a lot of games), and a player can eventually replace that bot as well. Most other MOBA type games force you to sit through a whole game, or cripple your team, but this system prevents both of those issues.So what is wrong with it? Well, it's not nice to new players. A LOT of upgrades have to be unlocked, and while this is nice at first as to prevent a player from being overwhelmed, some important upgrades (such as damage for assassin type Nauts) don't get unlocked until hours upon hours of gameplay. Also, new players have a good chance to be paired up with players who have a LOT of experience (a flaw in a lot of multiplayer games) simply due to the system, where it pairs you against people of a similar ranking.Also, there is no dedicated servers. While it's nice as this means the game is never full, since players host the games themselves, this can lead to lag and hits are based on the client of the attacker. This can lead to some cheap deaths just because somebody is lagging or the host does not have a computer suited to hosting.Then there is DLC. Now, I wouldn't mind paying the $5 more to get the whole game, but it feels like I have been ripped off when I buy the game just to find out I can't use 5 characters because I haven't dropped money into it (Such as the afformentioned Ted McPain, greatest action hero alive).Finally, and this is a nitpick, but there are a LOT of references. Now, I am a person who likes a small reference now and then, but this game feels like a lot of humor comes from simply getting those references (A lot of characters items are references... There's even an upgrade called ""Skrogachu"" with a picture of what is clearly supposed to be a Pikachu.Overall, great game, though network issues could be improved. It's worth the money, worth playing through it, but expect to get kicked in the teeth by seasoned players for a bit. Get past that, you'll appreciate the game.			"

Formidable.I bought this game on Xbox previously, and despite that, I bought it again for PC. Xbox had far less characters (Characters are very much unique with their own abilities and skins to customise them further.) and possibilities, but it was still fun. The PC version is extremely good & can be very addictive. I can confirm that it is certainly worth the cash and is exciting to play, giving you lots of choice over how you choose to play it.			"

												Awesomenauts is a fun moba that works in a 2D side-on perspective. It is very fun and, while simpler than other mobas it has a more casual air and a comedic style. There are 3 to 4 maps and currently 15 characters and with 4 more unlockable via dlc. Its 2D look means that it has platforming and verticality unique to itself.I would recomend this game to anyone who likes mobas or just wants a change as it is an easy to learn hard to master game that does support new players well. Its cheap price makes it very accessible to people who want to check it out.			"

												A fun 2D MOBA game where you have to aim to shoot the enemies, and manage to use your skills in a new way, kinda different of how MOBA usually works. It can be a bit hard in the beginning, since you need to aim, and you'll need to get used to it, specially playing with bots, so you can understand how things works.The characters are fun and somehow unique, each one have their own feeling and gameplay elements, it is one of those games that you'll truly get used to a character, but will not manage to play with another because it doesn't have your style.This game plays like a platformer, yes, you need to go up and down the stage, to defend your towers, you'll need to jump and aim a lot, so you need to be into this kind of world.A good aspect is that it doesn't use too many buttons, so it does have some simple elements to it that makes the game accessible for beginners. Still, there are some things in the game that you'll only get with time (like, when to fight the neutral bosses in some stages).You'll probably have some fun, the aspect of 3v3 is perfect to play with friends, it is easy to reunite 6 friends so you can play it. Still, if you don't have friends playing it, you can still have some fun playing this game in a more competitive aspect, with other unknown people. Either way you play, you'll find something here to like.			"

It is a lot less complex than DOTA in the sense that there's less upgrades/passive skills that you can buy as opposed to unlimited amounts of armor and weapons that you can buy and upgrade.

But if you play alone, against you could be team of 3 players, they got tactics, free communication and all the time fighting together. When your team just trying to deffend but they can't do anything. If you played dota 2, you know that you can't play in party against separate 5 players, and that is cool and exemplary.

												Oh my god a MOBA I actually enjoy. Don't get me wrong its still difficult to win against human players and probably require just as much stratergy and team work as others, but games aren't pain stakingly long and also only uses 3 players per team, meaning you have less people yelling at you for playing bad. Not only that but I actually like the characters even if there are less. It can lead to some matches having the exact same teams because meta games but its better for new players as you dont have to worry about lots of different heros you can't even remeber the name of. This is not an overly complicated MOBA, but it still invokes the same level of stratergy and team work as others yet still giveing a fun experience rather then a stupidly serious competative one. Its closer to TCGs and pokemon with its competativeness rather then poker or chess level competition, and that i enjoy.			"

												This game is really cool and funny :DIt's a 3v3 2D Dota/Lol type game, with 16 free nauts and 5 Starstorm dlc nauts.You start with the tutorial, it shows you basic stuff, there you learn how to use abillities. After you finish it, you get to experience a little crappy matchmaking system. It's like a skill based matchmaking system with ranks. The match is hosted by a person, and that person can be at the other side of the planet (you can choose in which region you play), when the host lags, game is on his side, he can really take advantage of it. When you join a room, there is no chat and the only thing you see is fan art and how many players need to join so the game can start OR wait till the timer goes to 0. While waiting, you can't chat or leave the room which is kind of a bummer because it really takes a lot of time sometimes. (You can chat while you play, but you can't while waiting for the game to start.) As i said, there are 16 free and 5 dlc nauts (it's just 1 dlc).Each is unique, in play style, upgrades and role.There are a few maps in the game, they really need to add more, and the map consists of a Solar drill (it's like your base that you have to protect). Each team has 3 or 4 turrets depending on the map and places where you can kill little critters for HP. There is also a shop, and a surface where you land, both are behind the drill.Upgrades:Every nauts has different upgradesEach naut can buy 3 items per abillity. There are upgrades for 2 abillities, 1 for the weapon you carry and body upgrades. (to be clear thats 4 upgrade types)Roles:Every character is unique because it has a role.You have heavy nauts which are like tanksYou have low hp nauts which are like supportAnd you also have those who heal you, put on the shields and help you in some ways.This game so far, isn't balanced well, but hopefully it will in the future.I will rate it somewhere around 6 maybe 7 out of 10.It's good, enjoyable. Recommended.			"

												This game isn´t an enjoyable waste of your time and money. Here´s why: Laggers are in every other game (fighting vs a naut that blinks around the map is stupid)They have NO servers (see above)The balance is comical There is a leave and repick to counter their picks mechanicFrequent steam sales has led to an enormous smurf populationChildish game art draws those 12 year old troll-crybabiesI used to think they´d somehow fix this game and was optimistic because i like the idea of a Platforming MOBAThey won´t, PLEASE DON´T BUY THIS GAME FOR YOUR OWN SAKE!!!

												Solid game that can cater to both hardcore and casual players.A lot of the reviews complain about the matchmaking, but I think the developers may have made adjustments to it more recently. The majority of the time I play really close matches. I've only gotten put against one obviously premade team.I think if you like 2D shooters like Metal Slug, and enjoy the MOBA teamwork, you'll enjoy Awesomenauts. Every character has unique skills, and within those skills you get a choice of 3 out of several upgrades for each skill, which means every player's character will evolve differently which is nice compared to games like DotA where the characters are always exactly the same.

												Awesomenauts is probably one of my favorite MOBA type games, especially if I don't have 30-50 minutes to kill. I'll admit the game is much better with friends, as some people don't understand teamwork, but all in all I don't regret buying it. There's really no reason not to give it a try considering it's on sale for little more than a dollar quite often.			"

												Awesomenauts is a MOBA, where there are turrets, and hiding spots, bases, upgrades, etc. Except this is in a 2D perspective. Instead of most MOBA's being over-the-top 3D games, this is 2D. It's a 3-on-3 battle and the map isn't that big. You can get to the middle quickly enough to defend. There are quite the selection of character, going from Lonestar to Coco to Vinnie and Spike. They all have different abilities and advantages, weaknessess, things of the sort. It operates just like any MOBA's you can find around the web. Verdict 7/10 stars. If you're bored of the same looking MOBA all the time, then definitely pick this one up. It may not be free like most, but it might be worth it. And it usually is.			"

												A very good game with no big flaws, lots of character balancing to keep builds under control and updates frequently. People want dedicated servers but in reality, if a player host is bad, the game automatically switches it, so they are just complaining fools. I recommended this game highly. (UP UNTIL 2.7)Since 2.7 - Every character has been buffed or nerfed to be op or unusable, all useful and fun abilities were taken out. New, much worse layout, and on top of that the matchmaking system is pairing my side up with new players and the enemies with 10 prestige veterans.Edit to 7/7/15 - The game has really picked up and all the big pros have stopped, so it's kinda fun and fair for all now. All the 2.7 updates that ruined everything have been changed and revoked, so the game is once again balanced and fun.			"

Team composition and the variations in the maps can vastly change play style for each naut and flow of the battle. I have seen total shut outs, and last man standing come backs that would make most players question reality. It has a great community and with Ronimo's continued development I see only good things for this games future.Sick of the tediousness of other MOBA’s? BUY THIS GAME! "

												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is way cool.So you're this mercenary hired to defend from other mercenaries in an ever lasting battle to the death.There are also like 1..2..3.. A BAJILLION CLASSES. Each of them function very differently and have different roles. Do you want to be the sniper who is really good at pushing? Or maybe you want to be the viking who is super fast and hits pretty well, but has like no range. Oh, or maybe you want to be the ninja chameleon? The diversity here is fantastic. Or maybe the sk8rgrl who says c ya l8r all the time.The maps are symmetric which helps with balancing things and there isn't too much of a gap between the characters in terms of usefulness. So, while there is likely a tier list I totally didn't look up or anything, the characters I played with didn't appear to be significantly better than any others. Anything that killed me was obviously overpowered, though.Team play is heavily encouraged for pushes against enemy turrets and the mechanics behind resources and respawning are great.My only gripe is that I didn't get to playing this game earlier.

												Want a game that is satisfying to play against the A.I.? A game that is filled with humor and pop culture references?18 characters without buying any DLC, and every one I try feels amazingly worth while, like a distinctly different playstyle expeience. Some are so utterly different that they may also change your play style when you are playing alongside them, even a little when playing alongside the A.I.For instance, Coco is always uber agile on her hoverboard, while Clunk or the Space Viking are like moving walls that are a challenge to slow down. Meanwhile Gnaw can kinda lay down some area control. Fighting Raylewn will put you on your toes whenever her laser sight signals she is about to snipe. And all this feeling of variety is just when playing against bots :DThis has been a load of good times, got it for only $2.50 during a Steam weekend sale, so it feels completely free from that perspective.

												How is a Naut awesome?This question has befuddled me ever since this game came down upon me and embraced my testes. I have delved into the bowels of the internet and searched beneath its seedy g-string. Upon further investigation it has become apparent that a naut may be a type of nut. Naut may also be referring to the Japanese furniture site, this, however, seems unlikely.Now we come to the second word; awesome. Google defines the word awesome as 'extremely impressive or daunting; inspiring awe.' However, it should also be noted that Google is run by Satan, who as it turns out, cannot be trusted, and also, for some reason, owns a vast collection of spoons. However, this interpretation must be considered under my investigation. After much contemplation, I believe that a Naut can often be considered awesome. Nuts, one of the definitions of Naut, can be extremely daunting and often aggressive, causing many breakups and issues within families It has also come to my attention that I may be a ♥♥♥♥ing moron and that it is simply called 'Awesomenauts' because it sounds 'cool' to the kids of today. This fact can be used to show the sociopolitical state of our world, however I am not allowed to say such things as I am apparently a 'boring♥♥♥♥♥♥'As a final note, I would like to direct any readers to the previously mentioned Japanese furniture site as it is rather intriguing: http://www.naut.ne.jp/ "

												Awesomenauts is one of my all time favorite games. It is a cartoony MOBA game. It may look and sound like a little game, but is just so fast paced and exciting. It becomes very addictive to rank up in the leader boards. It is WELL worth the money.			"

Thats right for 5 easy payment of 'don't buy' this game you too can get matched against 3 prestiges with a whopping total of 0 prestiges on your team. the absolute most balaned sidescrolling MoBA on the market folks. I personally give this title an IGN/IGN score.			"

												Introduction:If you already know what this game is about feel free to skip the introduction. If not read on! Awesomenaut is a 2D Action Rpgish game (Or in other words a 2D MOBA game which is based on strategy) that can statify a competitive or casual gamer with certain circumstances for competitive gamers. It mainly focuses on team based play and it is quite in depth in that respect. Now for the good things about the game.The Good:Awesomenauts is a fun game with a satisfying amount of characters each with their own role. They're colorful and have a very nice art style not used much anymore. The game has variety with several maps to play on and many builds to make your character fit your play style. In the introduction I mentioned teamwork, now let me expand upon that. The teamwork in this game is very intriquet with player's varying playstyles, characters, builds, and several other variables. It is very rewarding if difficult at times and I've won rounds with a disadvantage just because of teamwork. Overall a good experience, but not without some drawbacks.The Bad:At certain updates of the game it has been terribly unbalanced with characters clearly better than others and certain builds and team compositions dominating. Some characters did way too much burst damage or sometimes had too much healing power. Even now there are some character and build items not even used or barely ever seen. Also some characters are just bland and gimmiky, I don't end up playing a good lot of them because of that. Along with some wonky hit boxes certain updates can make the game super frustrating, but don't give up on this game just yet.Overall:Despite all the bad I personally think the good out weighs it, also the fact that there isn't another game I can think of quite like this one. I wouldn't hesitate on buying this game if you plan on playing with friends. Balance doesn't mean much if you have a laugh with your friends and use some teamwork. If you're not playing this game with your friends AND you want to play it competitively I'd strongly reccomend you wait for the game to go on sale so you can get a friend a copy. In the end a solid if off balance kind of game, but if you like the concept and balance isn't your top priority pick it up!			"

												I find this to be a very attractive game, the characters and the design is good most of the time, but it does have its disadvantages, due to this games expanding community and popularity it's gaining a larger character roster and more often then not its roster is very disbalanced, the current characters still need balancing and many other characters are often not equiped to challenge them, the games handling isn't at all very great more often then not having to deal with entity collisions that dont make any sense, the way servers are set up is even more frustrating because more often then not your ping is bound to be a 70 or higher to due player hosting, since most people aren't using the crem dala crem internet and software games often run slow and are usually bullcrap when fighting, the game although is being worked on and hopefully will see these fixes which is why I'm going to give it a ""Yes"" rating although this may change if these things aren't dealt with in a reason fashion...

												This game is an incredible take on the MOBA genre. Unlike games like DOTA and LoL, Awesomenauts is based on the premise of casual competition. It is designed to be fun. An interesting result of that is the lack of a real consequence when somebody quits your team. He is replaced by a bot that is often more competent than himself and continues to play in his stead. Another player can join mid-game to replace the bot at any time.Awesomenauts also has a great community (official forum, not Steam). It has a thriving fanart community, a modding one, a tactics one, etc.This game really opens itself up to modders. It allows creators to modify in-game bots and make their own using an AI editor. Modders can also create gamemodes using this tool. If Ronimo likes a bot, it can find its way into the official game. I have made two of the in-game bots, myself.Overall, I highly recommend Awesomenauts. It has a thriving community that you should not miss out on. The gameplay is very fun, if less competitive than its other MOBA counterparts. All that is lacking is you.			"

												This review does focus on several community issues, as such this may appear biased. Let's start by saying Awesomenauts is not a bad game. I've enjoyed it a lot, in my meagre to some playtime (I'll come back to that), I should say however, most of my enjoyment came when playing within premades; not in solo queue. One major flaw is the matchmaking.Even after reworks matchmaking is still an issue, that's in small part to the small player base. For example, my first game after not playing for a few months I tried solo queueing, probably not my best idea. First I was matched against a coordinated premade and obviously lost, second game it appeared to be all solo-queuers but this time it was an easy victory. With such a huge variance of player skill in a single league, as a solo player, you're out of luck starting mid-season if you want to play with similar skill players. What's more, there is still no incentive to fight out tough no-win situations instead of simply leaving so I'll address the developers directly here. Ronimo a short no-queueing punishment does not stop leavers, they simply do something else whilst the duration of their punishment clears. I can say with great certainty that half the community is straight up toxic, especially certain elitists with either high league rankings or 1K+ hours. Many of which have a horrendous attitude to lower tiered and low time players, specifically those sub 200hrs, and that is absolutely atrocious. Now I'm not saying it's everyone who reaches high playtime but it's apparent there is enough of them to warrant commenting about. Both these players and those who create dead game threads and reviews also ward off new potential players and those who would be interested in returning which in turn perpetuates the dwindling player base, one need only look at steamcharts[steamcharts.com] to see. On a lighter note, Awesomenauts has a fantastic art style especially with characters being reworked like cluck to look even better. There is also the great variety of music within the game. Beyond that, they've done well to create a cohesive world that can still take itself less than seriously. Recommended if you have friends who already play and are still actively playing, if not the avoid until some issues are resolved.Starstorm Expansion - Overdrive Expansion - Offical Soundtrack "

												I thought I hated MOBA's, then I played Awesomenauts.The combat is amazing, the game flow is surprisingly balanced, the art style is wonderfully retro -- Saturday morning 80's cartoons, the video game. The community is nowhere near as toxic as what I've found with DOTA2, League or Strife... it certainly has some salt and bitterness the more leagues you climb, but all in all the community is much less aggressive than others I've found.There are known faults... the matchmaking is inadequate, and the server structure is entirely peer-to-peer which lends itself to inconsistent lag for all connected parties (both of which Ronimo has acknowledged and made the next major development priority). Spectator mode does not currently exist, but is roadmapped.That all said, its quite possibly the best $1 I've ever spent for a video game, in 30+ years as a gamer.10/10, would ragequit again.			"

Awesomenauts:Awesomenauts is a new and fresh take on a MOBA like League of legends or Dota, although since these are in 3D awesomenauts is not. The game feels very original when you play it, as unlike the other MOBA titles, Awesomenauts feels more like a sidescroller/platformer like mario.Bots:Bot games is something I rarely do, but when I do them I ALMOST never think that I'm playing simple programmed bots. The bots AI's have been programmed in such a way that it almost seems as if you're playing real people unlike like most other games of this genre, although you do realize that you're playing bots when they sometimes get stuck somewhere and move from side to side until either you come near, unstuck or kill them.Characters: Personally I find that the characters are oddly balanced and that quite a few characters should be nerfed, For example: a tank is already though to get them down to 0hp, add a ton of dmg to the tank and it requires an entire team to do a 1persons task. Currently there aren't many characters to chose from, which is kinda good to get to know all of them I guess, each individual character has its ""own"" style of attacking. For example: there is a support which mainly heals the others of his team, then there is another more ""stealth"" approached character who works well to finish off an enemy character .I've grown a hate & love relation with Awesomenauts due to queue really, the Queue isn't as specific in selecting who you get partnered up against for example: Recently I had a lot of games against high prestige players while I haven't even prestiged myself, this makes the game really out of balance and as result you get roflestomped and won't enjoy the game if you are competative minded.I surely didn't mind buying the game as it gave me lots of hours to enjoy and play with friends, my advice for this game: BUY IT! it isn't a waste of money, you'll enjoy the game for sure if you love a MOBA and are interested on a new take on the genre!

AwesomeNauts is an awesome game, if you don't own it you're missing out on a lot. It's probably best to avoid the multiplayer community though.Awesomenauts is a unique, challenging, and addictively fun MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) 2D Shooter game.Pros+ Requirements are low, can be run on most PCs.+ Players can either compete against bots or against other players.+ Plenty of Characters and Maps to Unlock.+ Plenty of Challenges.+ Includes 58 Steam Achievements & 14 Steam Trading Cards.Cons- Most game content needs to be unlocked or bought via the DLC.- There seems to be an abundance of annoying people within the community.- Announcer is terribly annoying and distracting.My Rating: 9/10 (Recommended) "

												With a name like ""Awesomenauts"" what could go wrong!? Well, a lot of things. But dont hate the game hate the PLAYER. Mentioning player, did u know players can choose from a wide vareity of 20+ characters and still adding!!! This game has constant updates, so non-stop fun. But not too many updates like splatoon. It gives you time to adapt to the changes. Now I know what your asking. ""Is my money worth this?"" Short answer is yes, but ill expand! Once you have the game you get the ability to unlock the new characters released (besides the DLC ones) so you dont have to buy, buy, buy to actually have fun. There are skins but they dont really effect the actual gameplay. There are so many characters, if you dont find a character that suites you, your not playing the right game! The graphics are fantastic! The voice acting is great! The characters all have unique abilities that allow you to play the way you want to play (some players dont like the way you play) Theres so many words here its hurting my eyes so ill sum up. This game is going in a great direction, and its only getting better. Buy.....this.....game			"

												This review does focus on several community issues, as such this may appear biased. Let's start by saying Awesomenauts is not a bad game. I've enjoyed it a lot, in my meagre to some playtime (I'll come back to that), I should say however, most of my enjoyment came when playing within premades; not in solo queue. One major flaw is the matchmaking.Even after reworks matchmaking is still an issue, that's in small part to the small player base. For example, my first game after not playing for a few months I tried solo queueing, probably not my best idea. First I was matched against a coordinated premade and obviously lost, second game it appeared to be all solo-queuers but this time it was an easy victory. With such a huge variance of player skill in a single league, as a solo player, you're out of luck starting mid-season if you want to play with similar skill players. What's more, there is still no incentive to fight out tough no-win situations instead of simply leaving so I'll address the developers directly here. Ronimo a short no-queueing punishment does not stop leavers, they simply do something else whilst the duration of their punishment clears. I can say with great certainty that half the community is straight up toxic, especially certain elitists with either high league rankings or 1K+ hours. Many of which have a horrendous attitude to lower tiered and low time players, specifically those sub 200hrs, and that is absolutely atrocious. Now I'm not saying it's everyone who reaches high playtime but it's apparent there is enough of them to warrant commenting about. Both these players and those who create dead game threads and reviews also ward off new potential players and those who would be interested in returning which in turn perpetuates the dwindling player base, one need only look at steamcharts[steamcharts.com] to see. On a lighter note, Awesomenauts has a fantastic art style especially with characters being reworked like cluck to look even better. There is also the great variety of music within the game. Beyond that, they've done well to create a cohesive world that can still take itself less than seriously.

AwesomeNauts is an awesome game, if you don't own it you're missing out on a lot. It's probably best to avoid the multiplayer community though.Awesomenauts is a unique, challenging, and addictively fun MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) 2D Shooter game.Pros+ Requirements are low, can be run on most PCs.+ Players can either compete against bots or against other players.+ Plenty of Characters and Maps to Unlock.+ Plenty of Challenges.+ Includes 58 Steam Achievements & 14 Steam Trading Cards.Cons- Most game content needs to be unlocked or bought via the DLC.- There seems to be an abundance of annoying people within the community.- Announcer is terribly annoying and distracting.My Rating: 9/10 (Recommended) "

												This game is an incredible take on the MOBA genre. Unlike games like DOTA and LoL, Awesomenauts is based on the premise of casual competition. It is designed to be fun. An interesting result of that is the lack of a real consequence when somebody quits your team. He is replaced by a bot that is often more competent than himself and continues to play in his stead. Another player can join mid-game to replace the bot at any time.Awesomenauts also has a great community (official forum, not Steam). It has a thriving fanart community, a modding one, a tactics one, etc.This game really opens itself up to modders. It allows creators to modify in-game bots and make their own using an AI editor. Modders can also create gamemodes using this tool. If Ronimo likes a bot, it can find its way into the official game. I have made two of the in-game bots, myself.Overall, I highly recommend Awesomenauts. It has a thriving community that you should not miss out on. The gameplay is very fun, if less competitive than its other MOBA counterparts. All that is lacking is you.			"

												I thought I hated MOBA's, then I played Awesomenauts.The combat is amazing, the game flow is surprisingly balanced, the art style is wonderfully retro -- Saturday morning 80's cartoons, the video game. The community is nowhere near as toxic as what I've found with DOTA2, League or Strife... it certainly has some salt and bitterness the more leagues you climb, but all in all the community is much less aggressive than others I've found.There are known faults... the matchmaking is inadequate, and the server structure is entirely peer-to-peer which lends itself to inconsistent lag for all connected parties (both of which Ronimo has acknowledged and made the next major development priority). Spectator mode does not currently exist, but is roadmapped.That all said, its quite possibly the best $1 I've ever spent for a video game, in 30+ years as a gamer.10/10, would ragequit again.			"

Awesomenauts:Awesomenauts is a new and fresh take on a MOBA like League of legends or Dota, although since these are in 3D awesomenauts is not. The game feels very original when you play it, as unlike the other MOBA titles, Awesomenauts feels more like a sidescroller/platformer like mario.Bots:Bot games is something I rarely do, but when I do them I ALMOST never think that I'm playing simple programmed bots. The bots AI's have been programmed in such a way that it almost seems as if you're playing real people unlike like most other games of this genre, although you do realize that you're playing bots when they sometimes get stuck somewhere and move from side to side until either you come near, unstuck or kill them.Characters: Personally I find that the characters are oddly balanced and that quite a few characters should be nerfed, For example: a tank is already though to get them down to 0hp, add a ton of dmg to the tank and it requires an entire team to do a 1persons task. Currently there aren't many characters to chose from, which is kinda good to get to know all of them I guess, each individual character has its ""own"" style of attacking. For example: there is a support which mainly heals the others of his team, then there is another more ""stealth"" approached character who works well to finish off an enemy character .I've grown a hate & love relation with Awesomenauts due to queue really, the Queue isn't as specific in selecting who you get partnered up against for example: Recently I had a lot of games against high prestige players while I haven't even prestiged myself, this makes the game really out of balance and as result you get roflestomped and won't enjoy the game if you are competative minded.I surely didn't mind buying the game as it gave me lots of hours to enjoy and play with friends, my advice for this game: BUY IT! it isn't a waste of money, you'll enjoy the game for sure if you love a MOBA and are interested on a new take on the genre!

I've enjoyed it a lot, in my meagre to some playtime (I'll come back to that), I should say however, most of my enjoyment came when playing within premades; not in solo queue. One major flaw is the matchmaking.Even after reworks matchmaking is still an issue, that's in small part to the small player base. For example, my first game after not playing for a few months I tried solo queueing, probably not my best idea. First I was matched against a coordinated premade and obviously lost, second game it appeared to be all solo-queuers but this time it was an easy victory. With such a huge variance of player skill in a single league, as a solo player, you're out of luck starting mid-season if you want to play with similar skill players. What's more, there is still no incentive to fight out tough no-win situations instead of simply leaving so I'll address the developers directly here. Ronimo a short no-queueing punishment does not stop leavers, they simply do something else whilst the duration of their punishment clears. I can say with great certainty that half the community is straight up toxic, especially certain elitists with either high league rankings or 1K+ hours. Many of which have a horrendous attitude to lower tiered and low time players, specifically those sub 200hrs, and that is absolutely atrocious. Now I'm not saying it's everyone who reaches high playtime but it's apparent there is enough of them to warrant commenting about. Both these players and those who create dead game threads and reviews also ward off new potential players and those who would be interested in returning which in turn perpetuates the dwindling player base, one need only look at steamcharts[steamcharts.com] to see. On a lighter note, Awesomenauts has a fantastic art style especially with characters being reworked like cluck to look even better. There is also the great variety of music within the game.

The game has good support and a lot of additional content, including now a expansion. If you are a MOBA fan and wants something different from the traditional ones, Awesomenauts is your best choice. The graphics is not realistic but cartoon, a beautiful kind of art. Matchs are balanced, giving you lots of fun in an easy gameplay.+Not realistic graphics but beatiful+A lot of unique characters+Good online mode+Easy and good gameplay+Offline option with bots+Lots of fun-Few scenarios-A little repetitiveThe game is good and is constantly updated, a good option for MOBA fans  8/10 "

												A friend got this game in a Humble Bundle, gave it a try for a laugh.  A year and a half later, Awesomenauts is easily in my top 5 favorite games of all time and has yet to lose my interest.Though billed as a ""casual MOBA"", this game is extremely addictive and can be quite competitive in higher league play.  Simply put, it's a simple team-based, fast-paced platformer ""multiplayer online battle arena"" that doesn't take itself too seriously.The music is catchy, the graphics simple yet stylish, the voice acting excellent.  Best of all the game has a sense of humor and atmosphere that's missing from the major MOBAs.Unlike the communities for similar games, the vibe is relatively laid back for beginners.  You will, of course, encounter some toxic elements in higher league play, but what good is competition without a little salt?Pros: Relatively friendly community. continually evolving gameplay, hilariously fun(especially with friends)Cons: Latency issues can be severe in some situations(supposed fix in the works)Bottom line: Some of the most fun I've ever had in gaming, and in a genre that I normally wouldn't even consider playing.

												This game WAS fun. It used to have interesting characters to play with with really memorable songs, addicive gameplay, rewarding cooperation and their characters had amusing characteristics. However most of that is gone now.Don't take just my word for it, look at how the play rate of the game use has gone down and all the latest negative reviews.In an effort to pump out more characters they can charge money for, all attempts to be creative was thrown out the window. The new characters songs are both forgetable and have no actual lyrics (but that may be for the best). With the new leveling up system, there is no making a comeback, there is only snowballing as the team with a lower level gets steamrolled. The new characters are also very steriotypical. Now we have: a generic anime robot with kid in it, mechanic inventor and a spanish bandito. Compared to the older characters like: a sociopath girlscout, fish bankrobbers and an icecream knight. Overall it feels like the design team is more concerned with making more money and pumping out more content than their players having fun and the creative detail they used to have.			"

I could say that some characters are too OP but it could be just me sucking at playing against those characters so I won't say that. But team match ups were really not good. It came lot to luck if you would win with unbalanced matches so many times you just ended feelig hopeless when you had to wait the match to be over because you could do nothing to save it from other team power rolling over yours.But at least playing with friends was ton of fun, so I'm giving thumb up.

												The biggest issue you'll hear anybody mention with this game is the matchmaking. I agree, it's pretty nonsensical at times. But even in League of Legends you still wind up with a Diamond in a match filled with Silver players sometimes. The lack of dedicated servers is also unfortunate, but servers cost money and it's possible that Ronimo just can't swing the bill right now. Awesomenauts has been growing in popularity lately, so lets hope they pony up the dough for some dedicated servers soon. These cons aside, the game is fun and filled with plenty of character. It often goes on sale for just $0.99, so jump on it then if you're unsure.			"

												With a name like ""Awesomenauts"" what could go wrong!? Well, a lot of things. But dont hate the game hate the PLAYER. Mentioning player, did u know players can choose from a wide vareity of 20+ characters and still adding!!! This game has constant updates, so non-stop fun. But not too many updates like splatoon. It gives you time to adapt to the changes. Now I know what your asking. ""Is my money worth this?"" Short answer is yes, but ill expand! Once you have the game you get the ability to unlock the new characters released (besides the DLC ones) so you dont have to buy, buy, buy to actually have fun. There are skins but they dont really effect the actual gameplay. There are so many characters, if you dont find a character that suites you, your not playing the right game! The graphics are fantastic! The voice acting is great! The characters all have unique abilities that allow you to play the way you want to play (some players dont like the way you play) Theres so many words here its hurting my eyes so ill sum up. This game is going in a great direction, and its only getting better. Buy.....this.....game			"

AwesomeNauts is an awesome game, if you don't own it you're missing out on a lot. It's probably best to avoid the multiplayer community though.Awesomenauts is a unique, challenging, and addictively fun MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) 2D Shooter game.Pros+ Requirements are low, can be run on most PCs.+ Players can either compete against bots or against other players.+ Plenty of Characters and Maps to Unlock.+ Plenty of Challenges.+ Includes 58 Steam Achievements & 14 Steam Trading Cards.Cons- Most game content needs to be unlocked or bought via the DLC.- There seems to be an abundance of annoying people within the community.- Announcer is terribly annoying and distracting.My Rating: 9/10 (Recommended) "

AWESOMENAUTSREVIEWExcellent game, a variant from LoL and DOTA, Awesomenatus offers a MOBA in 2D, with a galactic setting and a lot of unique characters with their own trait. The game has good support and a lot of additional content, including now a expansion. If you are a MOBA fan and wants something different from the traditional ones, Awesomenauts is your best choice. The graphics is not realistic but cartoon, a beautiful kind of art. Matchs are balanced, giving you lots of fun in an easy gameplay.+Not realistic graphics but beatiful+A lot of unique characters+Good online mode+Easy and good gameplay+Offline option with bots+Lots of fun-Few scenarios-A little repetitiveThe game is good and is constantly updated, a good option for MOBA fans  8/10 "

												This review does focus on several community issues, as such this may appear biased. Let's start by saying Awesomenauts is not a bad game. I've enjoyed it a lot, in my meagre to some playtime (I'll come back to that), I should say however, most of my enjoyment came when playing within premades; not in solo queue. One major flaw is the matchmaking.Even after reworks matchmaking is still an issue, that's in small part to the small player base. For example, my first game after not playing for a few months I tried solo queueing, probably not my best idea. First I was matched against a coordinated premade and obviously lost, second game it appeared to be all solo-queuers but this time it was an easy victory. With such a huge variance of player skill in a single league, as a solo player, you're out of luck starting mid-season if you want to play with similar skill players. What's more, there is still no incentive to fight out tough no-win situations instead of simply leaving so I'll address the developers directly here. Ronimo a short no-queueing punishment does not stop leavers, they simply do something else whilst the duration of their punishment clears. I can say with great certainty that half the community is straight up toxic, especially certain elitists with either high league rankings or 1K+ hours. Many of which have a horrendous attitude to lower tiered and low time players, specifically those sub 200hrs, and that is absolutely atrocious. Now I'm not saying it's everyone who reaches high playtime but it's apparent there is enough of them to warrant commenting about. Both these players and those who create dead game threads and reviews also ward off new potential players and those who would be interested in returning which in turn perpetuates the dwindling player base, one need only look at steamcharts[steamcharts.com] to see. On a lighter note, Awesomenauts has a fantastic art style especially with characters being reworked like cluck to look even better. There is also the great variety of music within the game. Beyond that, they've done well to create a cohesive world that can still take itself less than seriously. Recommended if you have friends who already play and are still actively playing, if not the avoid until some issues are resolved.Starstorm Expansion - Overdrive Expansion - Offical Soundtrack "

												I have spent a large amount of time in this game which implies that I enjoyed myself.  Thing is, I had for the first few hours, but over time, as I came back months after months later, the game was no longer the same.  While it is an addicting game in of itself, Awesomenauts doesn't have much going for it other than the music.Quite honestly, the music is the best part about this game.  Everything else is just not up to par.  Matchmaking is probably the worst offender.  While they do have a league set-up, the game tends to not even match you up within the same league.  If that's not enough, even if you turn the ""find players worldwide"" option off, you'll still be matched with players from Australia.  Coupling the bad matchmaking with the awful, unbalanced Awesomenauts, you'll find yourself irritated as you play longer and longer.The way that they balance their Awesomenauts is through a group of players known as the ""Betanauts"" who play and give suggestions on what to change.  While this may not seem too bad when you first think about it, you need to know that they alone decide the metagame.  Characters that are unbalanced are likely to stay that way as time goes on and other characters that don't need nerfs will get them to the point they're unusable.  Furthermore, the way the game is set up, it benefits whatever team does more burst damage, to the point where you can have a team that just can't challenge the other team at all because of the matchups.Of course, that wouldn't be a problem if you could see who the other team picked and what map you were playing on.  Which you can't, of course, nor can you even communicate with your team through a chat while picking characters.  Furthermore, out of the 4 maps, only 1 is even remotely good as the others are unbalanced and make the match drag on for far too long.  In my recommendation, you should honestly pass on this game.  While it is addicting, it's not very fun and you're more than likely to get irritated while playing.			"

I was sad to realize that this was not so much fun I tought it was going to be. I could say that some characters are too OP but it could be just me sucking at playing against those characters so I won't say that. But team match ups were really not good. It came lot to luck if you would win with unbalanced matches so many times you just ended feelig hopeless when you had to wait the match to be over because you could do nothing to save it from other team power rolling over yours.But at least playing with friends was ton of fun, so I'm giving thumb up. Play it with friends if you want to enjoy!			"

Ele não tem muitos personagens, mas cada um deles tem sua forma de atacar e de lançar suas habilidades, o jogo tem 4 mapas que tem coisas especiais neles (como androids ajudantes que voam que só tem em 1 mapa). O jogo também possui um Shop que você pode comprar suas abilidades e itens para melhorar habilidade/ataque/corpo (corpo é quando você compra um item pra andar mais rápido ou pra aumentar o HP), e por se tratar de um jogo em 2D, pode rodar em PC's mais fracos.

												Awesomenauts, a game dear and close to my heart. I've spent a fair bit of time with this game, perhaps making it the only MOBA I've put the most time into. I do have a good bit to say about the game so if you want to know my thoughs about it, then strap in.Awesomenauts is a fun fast paced, 2-D side scrolling MOBA. Different and original, it sticks out of the MOBA ooze that has pleagued the video game market as of late. How does it achieve it's orginialty and also be fun?Here are the pros:*Music is perhaps the best I've heard. I love all the seperate character theme songs and the alternate killing spree songs that just get you more pumped up!*Graphics are nice and so is animation. Bright, beautiful and sometimes vibrant, it's appealing to the eyes.*All the characters are memorable and have unique personalities and looks. They are all also voice acted and some by famous youtubers!*Gameplay is just the best. It's fun to jump around and fight in a group or one on one. It doesn't get boring.*Unlike other MOBAs, there is multiple maps and they help change up the background and playstyles so each game is a little fresh.*Item customization for skills isn't bad and has some good depth to it. You can make your own or watch how the pros set up characters!*There is a pretty nice community of gamers and even an all chat to help get into games together. They may be odd but they are good people.So with ALL these pros, what could POSSIBLY be the issue?Cons:*There is a fair share of connection issues at times with causes characters to freeze in place for either a free kill or just annoyance. *Low population of gamers means this game might not be alive for much longer. It also means you'll be most likely facing the same people over and over...and onto that...*Matchmaking is hell. If you're new or even alright, you'll be slapped around by higher leagued gamers. You may think it could help you learn how to play better but when a game that is supposed to last 20-30 minutes ends up 5-10 from a slaughter, you don't learn a damn thing. *There is no punishment for people that leave games early or who are pretty rude, which ends up creating trolls and ragers. More likely than not, you'll have someone on your team drop out from rage (I will admit I do it often because I rather not keep dying and trying in a useless effort.)*Comebacks. It's nearly impossible to make a comeback in this game. For some reason, when you die you loose 30 solar while all enemies gain 40, with the killer gaining 70. I'm sure this sounded great on paper but if you think about it, it makes for some horrible matches. If your teammates are being slaugthered or even just one person on your team dies 3 to 4 times early on, you've lost. That team will begin to steam roll your entire team, turrets, and base in no time flat. Resistance is futile. *The last thing I want to point out is how broken some characters are and team compositions. You'll learn fast that there is really one a few true nauts that people will play. Ayla, the AA-auto healer from hell. Gnaw, the weedling walking and poison apocolapse and Nibbs, whos fire and teleportation makes her a pain to catch and kill. More likely than not, you'll face one or more of these naughts in each game. Also, some nauts work SO well together, that it makes it impossble to counter their team unless either REALLY lucky or you and your allies are more badass than the other team. Which will most likely be pros due to low number of new players.So with all these cons, why still the recommendation? Sure it's a game riddled with issues and has the possibility of dropping off the face of the earth soon due to the community but its still a fun game in the end. Yeah, you'll rage and you'll hate the stupid things in it but you'll oddly enjoy yourself and find yourself playing it more. Thats how I am, I hate all the dumb things but I still play it because the pros of this game are so good, you can overlook the cons...somewhat. Anyways, do get this game when you can, you'll have fun with it. Get it now for its price? Little hard to say, unless you really want to help the devs and keep this boat alive, wait till a sale and buy some copies for friends.			"

												The title of this game suggest it's best adjective, Awesome. One of the best MOBA games around.A nice and colored cartoon 2D graphic, full of smooth details, easier to play than the others of its genre, neat and funny characters with their own themes and killing spree's remixes; however the number of characters is very limitated compared to the other mobas around, and to play 5 of them is needed the Starstorm DLC, which costs nearly as much as the base game.Also the composition of 3 players for team makes the game easier respectively to the standard of 5, with more possibilities to focus in the game, less efforts to collaborate with your team and less chances to get flamed in a game. Also easier to group up 2 of your friends than 4, or 5 than 9 for a friendly match.A great MOBA game suggested for trying out a new kind of perspective in these kind of games.Only problem is that the connection is host-based, so you are most likely to get laggy games.

												I'm going to start off this review by saying that I do really enjoy this game from an on-paper level, and that if you want to have fun with your friends for a bit? Go ahead, this will appeal to that type of gamer. However when it comes to balance, this game, especially for one that is in the MOBA genre (dota, LoL, smite, etc) This game has to be hands down one of the most unbalanced I've ever seen. Clear counters are not at all in place, snowballing is a massive problem, and even when the game is fairly even, some characters are incapable of proper use or play against certain other ones, and the game often comes down to character vs character if you're going to win the entire game or not. There is also a lack of communication options so expect to try and type a lot to play with strangers. I could go on about network and reconnecting issues but they are fairly tame honestly, at least for my experience. The real issue for me was the lack of reporting options, because people will often willingly feed (get themselves killed by the enemy team on purpose) also a lot of players if they're winning extremely hard, will refuse to end the game just  to drag it on and get kills. This also brings into play the lack of surrendering as an option for matchmade games, and with a game so extremely broken because of snowballing and balancing issues, you'd think surrendering would be an option. Do you want to play this game extremely casually with friends? be my guestDo you want a solid moba with proper balancing across all characters including dlc characters? (dont get me started)This will not be the game for you if that's what you want.			"

												Have you ever wanted to get into games like Dota 2 or League of Legends, but didn't want to get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked for 100 hours before you came proficient in it? This game is for you. I love this game, and have quite a bit of time in it. I've heard it referred to as a ""Entry Level MOBA"", and I think that's a great explanation. It's 3v3 gameplay that still gives the feel of teamwork and intense focus, but also is relatively easy to get into and isn't as daunting as Dota 2 or LoL. Some people use the fact that each character has a very limited set of viable builds for competative play, and that's true. At the same time, that's also the beauty of this game. There's a few ways to play each character that works well, and that makes the game MUCH easier to get into and you'll feel skilled with a character much faster. If you need more than that, and want all of the complexity of games like Dota, then just go get Dota. This game is for the people who want to dip their toes into the metaphorical MOBA pool, having fun and enjoying a more simplistic version of the aforementioned games. And even with it's simplicity, you still feel immense satisfaction after that one good match.			"

												So, I'm going to write a real review: Awesomenauts is a fantastic game, even for those who do not like Mobas. It takes out all the clicking in one place, and replaces it with actual skill based mechanics (It's like 2D smite in that way) The characters are extremely colorful which is amazing. They all have a personality (occasionally one sided, but all unique) There are some gripes that I have though. Some of the DLC characters are slightly overpowered (i.e. one having the highest DPS in the game, excluding map hazards, available about every ten seconds) and the matchmaking system sucks. Leauge 9 players (the lowest leauge) often get paired up with players who are around leauge 2 or leauge 1. It's very rare to find a truly balanced match. TL;DR a wonderful game with some minor issues. 8.75/10			"

												Awesomenauts is a very good game. I personally prefer it to both League of Legends and DOTA2. It's quite fun to jump around in this 2D world and DESTROY your opposition (or lose horribly, depending on your skill level). The 18(I think, could be slightly off) characters add good variety and the unlock through leveling is a good system to keep it balanced.P.S. Froggy G 4 lyfe			"

												A super-fun and competitive 2D MOBA game, that is the genre invented by DOTA.  It's a little easier to get started with than League of Legends or DOTA 2.  It's not free-to-play, but you can get it pretty cheap, and it doesn't tempt you with with a lot of add-ons (although there is some DLC coming).  I bought a 3-pack for me and the boys.

												  I put almost 1,000 hours into this game and those were from actually playing not from card farming. I bought this game for the full price almost 2 years ago and I have seen most of the changes the game has gone through. It did have problems with matchmaking as others have said but with the latest update, Galactron, I think those issues have been fixed.   So far all the games I have played since the update have been full and no one has rage quit. Also the connection is a lot better now. Before there were many issues with lag when some players had a high ping. But again, that has seemed to have been fixed with the Galactron update.   I say give the game a shot and don't let the recentish negative reviews put you off. I think that as time goes on more people like me will update their reviews to be positive due to the matchmaking fixes with the Galactron update.			"

												Awesomenauts is a fun 2D MOBA game with a cool graphics style and a large cast of heroes to play as. To bad a lot of them are locked behind DLC pay walls. The game does suffer from some balance issues as well, where some heroes just seem to be a lot stronger than others and some are so weak they are unviable. You must level up to unlock most of the heroes although this does not take long at all, even playing against the bots can net you 2-3 levels per match. The online community is small but dedicated. Ive heard alot of people complain about the toxicity of the community although in my experiences I did not recieve any of this nor did I see it, probablly because I told people right from the beginning of the match that I was new and learning. The issue I do have with match making though, is that because the community is so small you will lots of the time be ranked up against people who are far beyond your rank and at a much higher skill level. The game supports local Co-op and you can take your local buddies and play online as well. Overall I enjoy the game and mainly play local multiplayer with my girlfriend and our friends and it has earned my recommendation just for that. If you are looking for online play, be aware that the skill curve of the community is going to be hard to over come, maybe try grabbing a couple of friends to group up with to make the experience better.Game Showcase-

												Don't get me wrong I loved Awesomenauts, but in the past month the game has become crap. Ronimo creators have lost their mind in trying to balance characters out. Ronimo's 2.9 patch is probably the worst patch they have ever created.Ronimo's 2.9 patch problems: Leon's attack doll there was no need to put that in without buying it and replacing it with baggot, Nibbs start of 2.9 patch was fine, but was buffed 3 days ago and now can kill ppl in their spawn area with fire, ayla well I have 500 hours on her alone now she is altered so much that she is♥♥♥♥♥♥to me, usually every Awesomenaut has two specials she is reduced to 1 because Rage is now literall garbage, Gnaw in the attempt to nerf him which was not even needed Ronimo buffed him out of control where is a game changer late game just like Nibbs no matter how little you have played them with full upgrades you could win a game easily, and lastly Raeyln her Time Rift has become buffed to the point where if a person walks in during mid game they could easily die, the hit points on it have increased way to high.(REQUEST) I'm a League 1-2 player in awesomenauts and have played with many top tier players that love this game. I propose that Ronimo bring back UPDATE 2.8 the only exception is Nibbs but the way she was when you first presented her, Voltar's healing is fine, and so was Ted's upgrades. Other than that please bring back UPDATE 2.8, FUTURE UPDATES SUGGESTION: MAKE AN AWESOMENAUTS COMMUNITY VOTE FROM THE PLAYERS: Whether to nerf or buff a character because I know many ppl who discover these new traits from the recently buffed characters are just as mad as me.

Originating from PS3 and the Xbox Live Arcade, Awesomenauts lives up to it's name for being a awesome space 2D MOBA with plenty of hilarious characters with their themes. Although I had bought this game for $3.33 dollars from a steam sale, I can clearly tell you that paying the full price of 10 dollars, is completely fine when considering the game mechanics and the ability to keep having continuous fun. One of my favourite casual games, with the cartoony child-like art style, the most comfortable innovating soundtrack and as mentioned previously......THE AMOUNT OF FUN GUARANTEED.			"

												Sigh where to begin with this game? Awesomenauts is a 2d online moba, which has a roster with over 18 different heroes which are called awesomenauts. The game play  just like any otheer moba if not a little easier. Its upgrade system is pretty straight forward, on each of your 4 rows in the shop (utility, autoattack, character specific ablity 1, character specific ablity 2) you get to choose out 6 upgrades per row, however you can only pick 3 items per row so choose carefully! The game looks pretty great with it art like graphics, the sfx and music is great aswell. Every character has its own  theme, which can be listened to ingame when a player gets 3 kills without dying,6 kills and the last time  at 9 kills. The killing spree's are all pretty good aswell. You can either play this game offline vs bots and even splitscreen. There is also ofcourse online multiplayer. However, in online matches you will defintily notice how unbalanced and unfair this game can be. And not to forget the bad match making and a lot of lag, will turn off a lot of possible playeres. The community used to be good, however it has become quite toxic and some morons will make you want to ragequit and throw your pc out of the window. These problems may not sound like much compared to the pros, but unbalanced characters and bad mathcmaking make moba a lot worse and less enjoyable then you would expect.Do i reccomend this game? yes, if you can grab it during a sale and try to make certain you have friends to play it with. Fun for the first 30 hours but because the lack of ton of online modes makes it boring afterwards. 7/10 "

												I love this game. It's amazing if you like side scrollers like Castlevania or Megaman. Moreover, it's a MOBA, so it uses the mechanics of League of Legends or Heroes of the Storm. The music is wonderful, the art is cute and bright and there's a lot of skins for the characters that are full of memes and amazing references. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes MOBAs or sidescrollers. Even if you like MOBAs but you don't like to play online because people are toxic to new players... well... you're in luck! The bots mode is simple enough to play through for new and veteran players and if you just dont like chatting with online players... MORE IN LUCK!! you can completely shut off the global and in-game chat box.Give this game a try. It's amazing.			"

												This game is a lot of fun, especially for its price (even though it seems to go on sale quite a bit). While the MOBA genre has something of a reputation for steep learning curves, I noticed Awesomenauts was fairly straightforward to learn. This said, I also noticed that it does a really good balance of remaining accessable while still rewarding high skill (both through good decision making in game, and just generally gaining experience with characters). One way the game manages this balance is by unlocking new powers/items/characters based on experience so some degree of specialty can be developed.The freshness of the game's approach to a relatively new, though often imitated genre (MOBA) is usually indicated through the little touches. For instance, having a bit of a mini-game just before respawning is a good example of a thoughtful touch that keeps the game fun and engaging, even if you keep dying a lot.Overall, MOBA fans will find enough similarities to feel at home, but enough originality (especially through the platform shooter approach) to still feel like a beginner and experience the fun of learning from the start. Non-MOBA fans will find an engaging shooter with a fun multiplayer element that encourages teamwork and competitiveness without being as 'in your face' as its peers.It is one of my go-to recommendations for a friend looking to try something new.

												Awesomenauts is a MOBA game, but it differs from the mainstream titles in the genre. You see, it's also a 2D platformer. The control scheme does not take long to get used to, and the game is quite easy to learn. Of course, if you want to get really good, you need to invest a lot of time into it. You can play bot matches and online matches, though there's also the option to make a custom game with all kinds of settings for you to adjust. The developers are frequently releasing updates and bugfixes, which just adds to the fun! Some players may be a bit rude at times (especially if you're not doing so well), but it's possible to mute them if you so desire. All in all, Awesomenauts is...well, AWESOME! Naturally, not everyone will enjoy this game, but I think it deserves a positive review.			"

												The only PvP anything that has hooked me for this long. A fantastic mix of individual skill, DOTA-style matches, character building, and just all around high intensity fun. The community is great for the most part and with a massive expansion on the horizion, now is the perfect time to give it a go.			"

												I've played this game almost daily for 2 years now, and I love this game. I love colorful fun and cartoonish graphics, I like the layed back competetive elements, I love it. It's a deliciously fun moba. The characters are unique, and the mechanics are fun. If I had to fish out some cons; it has some big lag issues, the matchmaking could be better, and it sometimes feels like the developpers don't know what they are doing. But overall, I would give this game 8/10.			"

												I'm going to review this from a non competitive and non-caring standpoint. With the latter point it sounds like I'm bashing mobas, I'm just more talking that with this game i'm a casual player and don't totally care about rising the ranks or becoming the best player. I play awesomenauts roughly every year for a little bit, and honestly I cannot say that there is a reason to play it in it's current state unless you are already really, really good.I heard there was a new DLC so I jumped on with my friend to have a few laughs, see other people play the new characters (that are locked behind the DLC), and reminisce on good times had with this game. We played 2 matches, and horribly lost both of them. We kind of got frustrated and quit (the queue times didn't help).I still felt a pang to play this game more after we hung out and played it together, so I tried playing it by myself later. I'm not going to pretend i'm the best player in the world at all, but i'm prestige 2 so I can at least say I know how the game works. Matchmaking has slowed down to a snail's pace since I last played, taking about 2 minutes per match to find. I guess all things considered for a smallish indie game that's pretty decent to still have a community this large to even find games at all, but i'm sure the sale right now is also boosting the playerbase.So I finally get into a game and one of two things happen:1) get matched against people who have never played the game before, they keep feeding me kills, we wipe the floor with them and in the end have no fun because I felt like I just beat a bunch of people who didn't know better and didn't get any better at the game2) get matched against a prestige 10 and have him completely dominate the floor with our team and spamming the taunt button with no chance for a comeback and have no fun because well, it's pretty obviousthrough the matches I played recently, not one of them was a close ""fair"" fight. There seems to be an obvious split between completely new players and players who have played non stop since release, and the slow matchmaking throws these people in a pit and flips a coin. I didn't have fun in a single one of these matches because I was either facerolling or being facerolled.I know I literally didn't talk about the actual game contents at all so far. They're pretty good. Music is well done, I like the ideas done to the genre, and all the characters are unique for the most part. The graphics are really cute too. Some of the voices are annoying, but in terms of the game itself that's the only big complaint I can think of. The fact that the matchmaking and community are so small and badly put together is such a huge glaring issue I cannot recommend this game in good conscience.			"

What a f*cking rip offAlright, so let me clarify real quick, this game IS fun, it's decently balanced, the community is pretty good, fun gameplay, but why would you charge 9$ for a game, that has over 200$ worth of DLC?? And the DLC isn't just cosmetic DLC like costumes, they charge for things that actually change gameplay, like actual characters! Seriously avoid this game, I played it on free weekend, but I wouldn't spend a cent on it, until they finally come to their senses, and make it free.Edit:It's sad to see where the video-game industry is going, especially with companies like EA, that cut off parts of the game, and ask you to pay for them, at a ridiculous price. Unfortunately, it's also games like this that contribute to this.			"

												Don't get me wrong I loved Awesomenauts, but in the past month the game has become crap. Ronimo creators have lost their mind in trying to balance characters out. Ronimo's 2.9 patch is probably the worst patch they have ever created.Ronimo's 2.9 patch problems: Leon's attack doll there was no need to put that in without buying it and replacing it with baggot, Nibbs start of 2.9 patch was fine, but was buffed 3 days ago and now can kill ppl in their spawn area with fire, ayla well I have 500 hours on her alone now she is altered so much that she is♥♥♥♥♥♥to me, usually every Awesomenaut has two specials she is reduced to 1 because Rage is now literall garbage, Gnaw in the attempt to nerf him which was not even needed Ronimo buffed him out of control where is a game changer late game just like Nibbs no matter how little you have played them with full upgrades you could win a game easily, and lastly Raeyln her Time Rift has become buffed to the point where if a person walks in during mid game they could easily die, the hit points on it have increased way to high.(REQUEST) I'm a League 1-2 player in awesomenauts and have played with many top tier players that love this game. I propose that Ronimo bring back UPDATE 2.8 the only exception is Nibbs but the way she was when you first presented her, Voltar's healing is fine, and so was Ted's upgrades. Other than that please bring back UPDATE 2.8, FUTURE UPDATES SUGGESTION: MAKE AN AWESOMENAUTS COMMUNITY VOTE FROM THE PLAYERS: Whether to nerf or buff a character because I know many ppl who discover these new traits from the recently buffed characters are just as mad as me.

There are a lot of DLCS AND NEW Characters you need to buy with money.Here a few update ideas to make this game better:  NEW MAPS  NEW CHARACTERS !FREE CHARACTERS!]  NEW GAMEMODES (Domination...)

												- 7.5 / 10 -Pretty sweet MOBA-like side-scrolling action platformer with the usual DotA elements. Decent cartoony-like graphics. Good sound assets & voice acting - including TotalBiscuit's contribution to the character Vinnie & Spike. Characters are unlocked by playing - or with DLC purchases (which includes custom skins) - however leveling & unlocking characters isn't grindy @ all. There's a nice variety of skills & unique powers that can be upgraded in-game by collected currency drops / pick-ups, which adds interesting modifications to your skills. The game has support for controllers & local co-op / online - for those couch gaming sessions with a buddy - in a horizontal split-screen mode, which looks good on wide-screens. Nice drop-in / drop-out system with the AI filling in any gaps for balancing. The community does seem rather active, so finding a populated online game isn't usually a problem.  Good fun!			"

												Imagine a mad Soviet-monkey who flies a jetpack that can manipulate time and space fighting a squid-admiral who tries to slam him with his anchor. If you burst into laughter while you tried to do this, this game is for you. And if you didn't you should try it as well, because Awesomenauts offers some really slick gameplay behind it's silly façade.Awesomenauts is a match-based MMO that is best described as the child of a SNES-era Mario title and League of Legends. Don't go away yet, my fellow LoL-hater! The only elements this game borrows from LoL (and other MOBA's, such as Dota) are that you have to destroy enemy turrets behind the cover of your minions and that you win by destroying the enemy's nexus, or the drilling core as it's called in Awesomenauts. The Mario-element would be it's cartoony style and ofcourse the fact that it has only two dimensions.Well, now you've got an idea of what to expect from this game, I will proceed to the actual review. The presentation is pretty damn neat. While the cartoony style might not be for anyone (I don't know what to think about it myself), you have to be a downright madman to call it ugly. Oh, have I mentioned the humour? I think this game is the funniest I've ever played. The music is great as well: all 16 characters have their own, unique theme in the character selection-screen and the in-game music is pretty neat, too. I do believe that the character themes are a bit of a wasted effort, though, as I think the devs could have spend the time and money better by fixing some of the issues I will address later.The gameplay is almost as fancy as the presentation. It's pretty neat to jump around the map and shoot your enemies. You can also upgrade your character as the match progresses, in a similiar fashion to LoL. However, the upgrade system is much more simplistic. I consider this positive, as LoL's system requires quite some time to dive into and Awesomenauts's absolutely doesn't. You'll fully understand it by the time you complete your first match.However, not everything of Awesomenauts is as beautiful as the butterfly spirit (yep, that deity can actually be summoned by a certain character). Although it isn't critical, the game suffers from some balancing issues. Some characters are quite a lot stronger than others and easier to play, too. This means that you'll find a few characters constantly dominating the match. While it is entirely possible to counter them for an able player I think the devs should pay some more attention to this problem.A much more major issue are the servers, or rather their absence. Each match is hosted by one of the players. This means that when the host has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet, you're screwed. Things become even worse when the host decides to quit. The game will go black for a few seconds as it attempts to find a new host. Don't be scared away by this fact, however, as it's really the only major issue I can think of.All in all, you should really buy this game, even when it's not on sale (;			"

												In the beginning this game was fine, new charecters and updates, but then they released the ""balanced"" DLC. 5 charecters that all have overpowered moves and abilitys. Though you would think they would nerf or buff them to make them fair, one of the dlc charecters still has the ability to shoot fire right through terrain, no one else is able to shoot though terrain but this charecter and another dlc charecter that bombs a comom of the entire map. these charecters are sold in a bundle that cost more than the base game in most sales. Furthermore the skins that they allow you to buy are accually about 5 dollars for one, this is obserd and a blainent money grab.In conculsion, I belive this game is a money grab attempt and a pay to win game thoug h their dlc. It is for these reasons that I would not reccomend this game for anyone hoping to find a fun 2d moba, as the dlc makes you lose almost anytime you face them.			"

												Do you like tower defense? Do you like platformers such as Megaman and A.R.E.S.? Are all of your friends playing League of Legends or DotA(2) but you don't want to get in with all that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t?Then Awesomenauts is the game for you! With vibrant characters set to the theme of a 1990s Saturday morning cartoon, that all house their own unique abilities (4 skills per every character (vertical movement, attack, and two unique abilities)), and loads of fun with one of the most amazing soundtracks by SonicPicnic and all the references and memes you can handle, you're sure to have fun for years on end.Games are fast-paced with a maximum of 2 turrets per each lane, multiple maps with their own features and unique layouts, a drop-in drop-out functionality that will grant all new players an average amount of money to hop right in on an equal level with everyone else in the game. 3v3 fun in about 15 minutes per match!Oh, and let's not forget! Since this was originally a Xbox 360/PS3 title, it was made for local multiplayer! Up to 3 people playing on the same split-screen with full controller support! Dual-stick and completely custom button layouts! What more reason do you need?Updated reguarly (about once every 2 weeks) with new characters, skins, music, maps, and various things from time to time, not to mention the recently successful Kickstarter for the upcoming DLC, things are bound to be active and fun and fresh for ages to come.Oh, and let's not forget, since it's Steam account-specific stats, punishment in the form of losing online-play access, and actually costs any amount of money to buy the game so you can play it...the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are rare and the ability to smurf is practically non-existant!

												This game is a lot of fun, especially for its price (even though it seems to go on sale quite a bit). While the MOBA genre has something of a reputation for steep learning curves, I noticed Awesomenauts was fairly straightforward to learn. This said, I also noticed that it does a really good balance of remaining accessable while still rewarding high skill (both through good decision making in game, and just generally gaining experience with characters). One way the game manages this balance is by unlocking new powers/items/characters based on experience so some degree of specialty can be developed.The freshness of the game's approach to a relatively new, though often imitated genre (MOBA) is usually indicated through the little touches. For instance, having a bit of a mini-game just before respawning is a good example of a thoughtful touch that keeps the game fun and engaging, even if you keep dying a lot.Overall, MOBA fans will find enough similarities to feel at home, but enough originality (especially through the platform shooter approach) to still feel like a beginner and experience the fun of learning from the start. Non-MOBA fans will find an engaging shooter with a fun multiplayer element that encourages teamwork and competitiveness without being as 'in your face' as its peers.It is one of my go-to recommendations for a friend looking to try something new.

												Awesomenauts is a MOBA game, but it differs from the mainstream titles in the genre. You see, it's also a 2D platformer. The control scheme does not take long to get used to, and the game is quite easy to learn. Of course, if you want to get really good, you need to invest a lot of time into it. You can play bot matches and online matches, though there's also the option to make a custom game with all kinds of settings for you to adjust. The developers are frequently releasing updates and bugfixes, which just adds to the fun! Some players may be a bit rude at times (especially if you're not doing so well), but it's possible to mute them if you so desire. All in all, Awesomenauts is...well, AWESOME! Naturally, not everyone will enjoy this game, but I think it deserves a positive review.			"

												A 2D cartoon-styled platformer/MOBA.Incudes a whole cast of characters with their own sets of upgrades and 5 different maps each with different layouts and special features, one features a blazing inferno, while another contains an antigravity device.This game also includes a great multiplayer community(apart from everyone that says Leon and Froggy G are OP)When you join a match, there will be a red team and a blue team, each with a maximum of 3 players on each. If a player leaves a match, an AI bot will fill in the empty slot, and if a player joins, a bot will be filled in by the joining players.There is also a DLC called Aweomenauts:Starstorm, featuring 4 new characters, with 1 more getting added in the future, and a new map. The DLC also allows you to host highly customisable custom matches.My opinion: Worth the 10 dollars.			"

												Overall, “Awesomenauts” is an extremely fun and addicting game.  The AI is unfair at times, but I still find solo play to be a viable way to level up my player profile.  Playing with human players is a lot more fun and balances the game out a bit more.  I like the fact that I can play using local co-op, though I can’t imagine split-screen being easy to play with unless you have a large television to hook your PC or laptop up to.  With the normal price tag of $9.99 however, most people will be able to afford their own copy anyway making online / LAN play a lot easier on gamer families looking to blow each other up.  Those who enjoy games like League of Legends and DOTA will be able to jump right into this game without too much of a problem, though those who are new to the genre should catch on fairly quickly.  I really enjoyed “Awesomenauts” and look forward to spending many more hours taking my profile to the next level.

												A 2D cartoon-styled platformer/MOBA.Incudes a whole cast of characters with their own sets of upgrades and 5 different maps each with different layouts and special features, one features a blazing inferno, while another contains an antigravity device.This game also includes a great multiplayer community(apart from everyone that says Leon and Froggy G are OP)When you join a match, there will be a red team and a blue team, each with a maximum of 3 players on each. If a player leaves a match, an AI bot will fill in the empty slot, and if a player joins, a bot will be filled in by the joining players.There is also a DLC called Aweomenauts:Starstorm, featuring 4 new characters, with 1 more getting added in the future, and a new map. The DLC also allows you to host highly customisable custom matches.My opinion: Worth the 10 dollars.			"

												This has grown into one of the worst games on Steam.Balance:         0Gameplay:      2 (balance ruins it)Matchmaking  -5Maps:             0Dev Profit:       lol, theftThat is absolutely the worst moba currently in existence.  The Devs have repeatedly ignored cries for balance, and then WANT TO CHARGE MONEY TO PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH A GOOD MATCHMAKING SYSTEM THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE GAME IN THE FIRST PLACE!  That is so dumb it should be illegal.This game signifies everything that is the worst with kickstarter & crowdfunding:  The devs make the game broken and then charge you to fix it.  And by fix, I mean... make it broken in a different way so they can charge you to fix it again.  Not only that, but they have abandoned projects that were crowdfunded to fix these things!  Absolutely do not buy this game no matter what the price.  You will enjoy it until about your 3rd game, when you realize it's not you being a noob, the game is truly that broken.I recommend with the highest possible force that you stay away from anything produced by this Dev.  This game is nothing short of theft.			"

												Overall, “Awesomenauts” is an extremely fun and addicting game.  The AI is unfair at times, but I still find solo play to be a viable way to level up my player profile.  Playing with human players is a lot more fun and balances the game out a bit more.  I like the fact that I can play using local co-op, though I can’t imagine split-screen being easy to play with unless you have a large television to hook your PC or laptop up to.  With the normal price tag of $9.99 however, most people will be able to afford their own copy anyway making online / LAN play a lot easier on gamer families looking to blow each other up.  Those who enjoy games like League of Legends and DOTA will be able to jump right into this game without too much of a problem, though those who are new to the genre should catch on fairly quickly.  I really enjoyed “Awesomenauts” and look forward to spending many more hours taking my profile to the next level.

												Great game for 10 euros.DLC's are expensiv but dont buy em if u are just causaly playin the game.Game is constantly getting new updates witch is pretty good.I love the game because its not like any other MOBA game.U can choose 1 character witch u want to main and u can always play that champion with diffrent style.Only thing bad about the game is that sometimes u have to w8 for a long period to find someone online and sometimes u can join in middle of the match witch is pretty anoying.I reccomend u to buy this game on sale its much cheaper :)			"

												Awesomenauts is by far, the worst purchase I have ever made on Steam. It starts out with just about the most terrible voice acting I have ever heard and instead of redeeming itself, it throws you into some shotty, slow, flatout badly designed gameplay. So if you enjoy low quality and unoriginal clones, then Awesomenauts is for you. Risk of Rain is a game you should look into if you don't.			"

												If you've played SOLDAT and Dota then it's pretty much both of those combined. Many people will whine about characters being overpowered but the Devs do balance it out to some extent. There are some glaring problems with the game but hopefully they'll be fixed soon.Overall a good pick up if you can snag it on sale.			"

												Fun game to play with friends. Characters are diverse and all a blast to play. Devs seem like cool dudes. Another big thing I want to mention and praise is the soundtrack. It is amazing getting that killing spree and being able to hear that theme while continue the match. If you have friends or you're looking to try something a bit different then you're in the right place with Awesomenauts.EDIT: changed here to hear.			"

												Hands down, the best game I have ever experienced. Though it was made in 2009 it has graphical capabilities akin to next-gen consoles. The narrative storytelling seems real, beautiful, as Microsoft Sam always does. I feel as though I need to help the Rats or my purpose in life will never be fulfilled the Rats need me, and I need the Rats. I will never put this game down, the sheer heavenly, awe-inspiring, near-♥♥♥♥♥♥ic experience this game gives you is like nothing else I have ever seen. Beware: this game will, 100%, eat away hours, days, months and eventually years of your life as the lifelike physics bamboozle you thank you Invent4 Entertainment you are all Gods and will live in my unworthy, mortal heart forever. Simply the greatest game developers that have made the best games the have ever existed. I salute you. Well, now my heart-filled intro is over, I really need to stress how good this game is. The developers tease you greatly with the USP (Unique Selling Points) on the store page and they are: Revel in your success as the cat meets a violent demise in any number of humorous ways at the hands of Bad Rats... Comic cartoon violence and cartoon blood Realistic physics simulation 10 Specialist Rats, anxious for revenge 11 different and bloody deaths for cats 10 other functional objects to help you 44 Maps, from easy to very hard Internet and local records Original, cartoon styled characters Challenge your creativity, intelligence and logic Unlock all the Steam Achievements But that's not all, there is a spiritual side to this game that I don't think even the developers know they implemented a oneness with the Gods. While you can have fun earning every achievement each one unlocking a sense of pleasure more than you can ever experience with any other game no any other moment in you're entire life. Each puzzle is an embodiment of pure culture and art. Art made by Rube Goldberg-Esq physics and complex solutions. This game, oh, this game, I really cannot say enough about it I love this game. I can't say it enough I love this game, and so will you. You will succumb to the awesomeness of this game the, the thorough and overall righteousness of this experience. If you don't own Bad Rats, you have not lived a full and proper life in anyone's eyes. I would rate this 11/10 if I could. While writing this, I am currently crying all over my keyboard due to the beauty of this game, my keyboard is now soaked and some keys don't seem to be working. I sob because not everybody owns this game and that means they have never, ever, been truly happy. I love you, Invent4 entertainment, for developing this game, and I also love and cherish you, Strategy First for, on the great day of the 20th of July 2009, publishing this game and blessing this small, humble world with the holy, out-of-this world, pure greatness that is the one and only: Bad Rats. Now, to Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge. People think that this is the exact same as the original, but it isn't. It has all the things that the Godly original had, the Nobel-prize worthy 4:3 screen mode so beautiful that there was no need for 16:9 and not to mention the fact you can play in a 1240 PX resolution. The technological world, no, the entire world, all the worlds the universe did not foresee the striking difference 1240 PX game play has against the standard 1280. But, Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge is something perfect, people said Braid was ""The Perfect Game"" but then they played Bad Rats said it was Godly and then realized the power of Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge it has something that neither science nor religion can explain. Something only a unknown, un-comprehendable higher power can give a reason for, a true explanation. The Rats' Revenge seems to be able to unite everybody and has been documented to have been able to end wars, and be the first real, legitimate sign of world peace being achievable. In the great war of 2009. the US government, CIA, and FBI created a game capable of sending waves of peace across the world. Everyone who played it was happier than they had ever been, and realized the was no reason for fighting when you had Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge. No other game or other form of media had been able to achieve this, to give this amazing degree of hope to a mortal world plagued by war. The game was a message from God, a holy beckoning that has ultimately saved the world from utter destruction. The game has saved all of us, and that is why we need to pay our respects to it. I say that this day, the 1st of November, after the day of the devil Halloween should be Bad Rats day, to show that we are past the evil spirits that once doomed us because of this one, singular, 300MB piece of pure glory. On this day, the world will pray for the Rats and show non-believers what this game really is, by sending copies to everyone we know. This is why it is on sale, it is holy. 10/10			"

												Great fun for local multiplayer. But the online scene died a long time ago. The golden age of Nauts is gone. Devs made some crap choices along the way and it lost its magic. Also p2p game hosting is the stupidest thing anyone ever decided to do. I put well over 400 hours into this game, But the constant balance changes and extream mechanics tweaks wore me down. I wish we could all roll back to when there was only the original characters. Simple and Fun. lol			"

												Eh. I do like how this game is designed, it's a MOBA for idiots like me who are incapable of multitasking and so will never be any level of competent at something more serious like DOTA. But it's just too laggy. Most games I just feel like I'm winning or losing because I'm on the host's team/opposite team. If they fix the connectivity issues (which they won't, I've owned this a long time and come back to it every now and again and my first impression is always just ""wow, I can't even move without DCing""), it's a half-decent casual MOBA. The community is toxic, I suggest muting all chat, which is probably the best feature of this game. The worst feature is that it doesn't let you rage quit.			"
