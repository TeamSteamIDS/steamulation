												I played this game many years ago when it first came out. So I bought it on Steam to to preserve until the end of time...This game is absolutely fantastic! This is a RTS game but basically you take control mostly 4-5 soldiers per missions. So it is commando like and more tactic than gathering resources and build build and train troops... You always have to focus on the mission objective and you can solve any way you want to get the job done. Maybe this sentence as an example will be a bit spoiler so I warned you: the mission is to destroy 2 battery guns, you have 4 soldiers against lot of enemies, you can easily sneak to the first battery gun and instead you blow it you can use to take out the other gun on the other side of the map rather fight your way through the enemy... then just blow the first one and get out.Spoiler ends.If you start with only handguns, kill a few enemy and take their weapons. There are 4 campaigns, each with 4-5 missions. If you preserve your troops from the beginnig, you can use the same troops on the following maps with the same inventory. Note however, the American campaign a bit different.. and if anytime you screw the map and have to restart a mission you loose your own man and will get default troops. So keep saves on different slots.You can destroy anything if you have the correct weapon in your hand or under your a+s+s... Oh, you dont have tank, kill its crew then repair and use it. Your tank have run out of ammo, neutralize another one (dont blow it) and take its ammunation. You dont have AT weapons but there are strong vehicles in your way? hmm.. you have molotov cocktail! Aim at the engines and watch the firework! Use covers all the time, lean from edges or just lure the enemy out from a field with lighting fire. Are you surrounded with enemy troops, blow a hole in the wall and escape. There are 50+ enemy heavy tanks, you have katyusha......Do you like write history again? Then you are a Hero of World War 2.			"

												Great game, if you like Men of War, you will love Soldiers Heroes of World War II. Again its not your run of the mill RTS. You can take direct control of units, and every unit has an inventory. ANY weapon an enemy is using you can kill and take, tanks have different types of ammunition, different weapons use different bullets, full destructable terrain and buildings, realistic physics for tank shells and bullets.. the list goes forever GET THIS GAME.

												This is one of the best ww2 rts games I've played. It is fully in 3d and you control soldiers, cannons and armor to complete your Commandos-like mission. In every map you are outnumbered at least 10 to 1 and it is a pure joy to defeat the enemy with these odds. Many things are interactive, like railroad switches, blowing up bridges and buildings (it has great physics), burning down forests (with matches) to flush the enemy. It has a ridiculous amount of units types anything from a tiny motorcycle to a king tiger and lots of weapons such as mp44, panzershreck, and mg42. You can heal soldiers and repair tanks and even strip weapons from them (you can grab a 50 cal from an american jeep and walk around Rambo-like). I've had a blast with this game and what makes it even better is that the sequels such as Men of War are even better. I give it 8.5/10 , you should try it. (Note: This is a Russian made game so it may be brutal difficulty-wise. I recommend you start on Easy mode).			"

												I now understand very well why tanks tend not to do well in urban combat.(It takes too long to destroy everything with HE so you actually have a clear field of fire.)AT grenades. I hate AT grenades so much. D:<On the plus side, Michael Wittman driving into Villers-Bocage with one Tiger and leaving with five Shermans, a Chaffee, and a Matilda is one of the most fun things I have done in a long time. Even if it's totally ahistorical. Especially if it's totally ahistorical.It's a pity the Katyusha mission only gives you three men, or I would have driven away the entire tank company, and the trains, too.It's the sort of game that I sit down and decide to play half an hour of at 8pm, and look up after a while and it's suddenly seven in the morning.tl;dr:10/10 battlefield looting simulatorwould loot again			"

												In the Battle of the Bocage in 1944, after destroying countless Allied tanks, German tank ace Michael Wittmann stepped out of his disabled Tiger tank, picked up a .50 cal machine gun from a destroyed Matilda tank and single-handedly mowed down the whole 4th armored division.Top notch history lesson.

												The starting point in the genre of tactical RTS. «Soldiers: Heroes of World War II» marked the beginning of a series. At one time there was a breakthrough on many points, such as graphics, physics, gameplay, and even now, eleven years later, it looks worthily. This is the main index of the living classics. It never gets old.Now about the pluses, a sizeable number of which we have.Let's start with campaigns. It’s four of them with 5-6 missions each. Given the fact that each map  will take at least 3-4 hours of game time, we heve more than 80 hours for the first walkthrough. It all depends on your natural talent, skills and patience. Plus, the mission completely replayable.You can always try the other, unbeaten way. Can, and will likely want to, because the number of possible tactics is huge. It is not my first strategy, neither the second, and I know that the starting missions of the campaign is usually takes you by the hand by its plot and slowly show all mechanics and the perspective of easy victories. «Soldiers: Heroes of World War II» from the start makes it clear, that you are in a meat grinder, to get out of that and, even more to win, will be not that easy. It gives you to understand the responsibility of choice and the value of human life. You can not throw units lives. Firstly there are few of them, but number of enemies, waiting for you is incalculable. You start first map of the campaign with one tank, one armored vehicle and two foot soldiers. And that's all. You need to calculate every move, to act covertly, gently, and then maybe, I repeat, maybe, you will win. And that, for a moment, in the first map, which is usually taught to build barracks. No construction, by the way. And that's great, because not everyone is interested in building “Theme park” in the game about World War II. If you, comrade, like to focus on killing enemies, rather than taking care of flowerbeds, then “Soldiers” just for you.The visual component, as I said in a brief introduction, is good even now. It does not hurt the eyes, and sometimes even surprising. And this, for a moment, in 2004. I remember this year. Then released “Warhammer: Dawn of War” and “Rome: Total War”. So «Soldiers: Heroes of World War II» looks on par, and in some places handicaps such titans as above. Especially impressive is destructible, and the ability to use anything and everything that is on the map. Want to swim in the water, want to hide behind a haystack, want to bring down a monument to Stalin with the tank (i did). And you can do this and much more. The map has no blind spots. All that you see is interactive. You can damage, destroy and explode practically everything. No vehicles scale of lives, as a plus. Vehicles are divided into components, each of which is also interactive. Shot down a caterpillar, as a result, the tank is not going anywhere, hit the tank’s turret, and it will never shoot more. At least until you repair it. Yes, you can repair vehicles parts. As i said, fully interactive.But the biggest bonus is inventory for any unit. Yes, yes and vehicles too, which by the way is stuffed by a crew of 2 or more people, fully playable and with their own inventory too, of course. Other words, playing «Soldiers: Heroes of World War II» you control all! So the game will be interesting not only for hardcore strategy fans, but roleplayers too. And direct control mode will attract shooter fans. In other words, it is almost for everyone. But there is one limitation - not for the faint of heart. If you want a jaunt or a Pulp Fiction, this is not the case. «Soldiers: Heroes of World War II» - is James Joyce of RTS.«Soldiers: Heroes of World War II» as delayed onset muscle soreness. Yes, it hurts, but that's okay, because you know that pain makes you stronger. After all, what is the life without a challenge. "

												I highly recommend trying this game out even if it is old. This game is by far better than anything else we have found (as of january 2016) in terms of 2-4 player co-op WW2 micromanagement of squad level. You start out with one or few soldiers (and maybe a vehicle or two). Each soldier, gun and vehicle has it own inventory. Soldiers have stamina and health. Vehicles have each part as a component that can break and an inventory for ammo and other stuff, for example repair kit. Soldiers have primary weapon and a secondary slot (can have multiple of each if inventory has space).  Between and during the fighting you spend time looting for ammo, guns and explosives, repairing vehicles. For example a track can get blown off of your tank and you will have to get a repair kit out and try to fix it maybe under fire. Tanks and big guns have their own caliber so you have to check the ammo you find. Your vehicles have fuel and it can run out. In that case you can take a Jerry can or an oil barrel and loot fuel from other vehicles. You can complete missions in many different ways; for example there is a tank that has its crew outside smoking cigarettes? take the crew out and steal their tank. Vehicles have slots for driver, gunner, loader, commander and you can also sit guys on top of the tank. If you have less than full crew in a tank, you can't for example drive at the same time when they load the gun and so on.You can lay mines against tanks and against infantry and you can find a mine detector. You can find pistols, assault rifles, grenades, smoke grenades, bazookas, submachine guns, machine guns, normal rifles and sniper rifles and there is lots of variety on them. Each soldier also has 'skill' on how well they can use specific weapons (that little white dot or two above the gun). You can loot machine guns from tanks and also replace that damn Bren on the british ones with MG-42 if you want. You can mount a field gun or a Nebelwerfer you find and use it to shoot indirect fire. You can drive all vehicles by either clicking on where they should go, or even better (This is the best part of the game), you can press CTRL and control the vehicle directly (or soldiers for that matter). Driving a tank around and shooting is VERY satisfying feeling. All buildings also crumble when you shoot them with HE shots or AT grenades. You have to select AP ammo when trying to take out a tank, or you could throw an AT grenade or Molotov cocktail on the engine. Everything is thought out and just works. Missions are often quite hard and unforgiving; There is no save possibility within the missions. You can (and should!) have Fog of war on to have more realistic gameplay. Missions take 15 mins to 2 hours depending on the playstyle. You start most of the time with only few soldiers and few clips of ammo and your task is ""ambush the convoy"" or ""destroy enemies in town"". Normally your soldiers have revive kit of three charges to help out a bit. We play LAN over internet by using Hamachi and it works perfectly well.This game also has very few bugs, I don't remember seeing more than one or two in 11 years of playing.You have 4 single player campaigns as well as CO-OP campaign missions but you also have more game styles, such as Deathmatch, Assault, Escort (don't remember all).In addition you have domestic animals such as cows and chicken. You can give out your soldiers to your co-op partner and vice versa. You can accidentally light yourself on fire. You can swim over rivers or lakes, you can drown in swam.			"

												Difficulty in the campaigns is all over the place, some missions are insane, some are super easy, usually in that order. I had a couple of issues where you get the objective to get to the point X, the game never tells you where it is. But I like it.It's gameplay is a mix of XCOM and WW2 with surprising attention to details, such as physics, weakpoints on tanks and enviroment destruction..For example, once I ended up having to fight a heavy scout car, that was impervious to small arms fire. Ofc I had no AT weapons, so I hoarded a bunch of HE grenades on one guy and spammed them at the scout car to see what happens.It's tires blew up on one side and the moment the last tire flew off, whole vehicle flipped over to theside, rendering it useless. Buildings can be destroyed in a manner similar to Battlefield Bad Company 2, but much simpler. You can colapse them with tanks and most armored vehicles, sometimes a really good tactic to surprise attack a tank is to move behind the building trough which the enemy cant see you, boo! You're within 20 meters of the tank (preferably the backside).Even though it has its flaws and the resolution support is a bit wonky, I have never played a more complex and realistic WW2 RTS. And yes, I have played CoH 1 (much simpler vehicle system) and 2 (""butthurt"" button spam) and neither come close to this game.8/10 - Had to take off some points for horrid voiceacting and badly done campaign. But the gameplay itself is stellar. Just take note, some key's cannot be changed (use macro keys on your keyboard for these) and the default keybindings aren't meant for a human being with two hands.			"

												I can't recommend this game enough.This is probably one of the BEST RTS/Strategy games I've played in a while. If you've played Men of War (any of them) think of a much smoother flowy system with what I believe to be better sounds in game. This is the OG, all of the Men of War games (except Battle of Empire) content came straight from this game, but this game did it best. Campaign has a perfect story mode and missions. Instead of a multi-layered ""attack this"" mission like on the AS campaign, this game has good stealth, challenging attacks, and all other sorts of goodies for you to enjoy. With several campaigns with at least 6 missions each, and I believe it was 7 Bonus Missions for you to play with this game provides hours of enjoyment. I believe there is only one grip I have with the game and that's the lack of an editor, however I can forgive that because this is the first in the series.9/10 - 10 Scale90 - PC Gamer Rating Scale1/1 - My Rating ScaleEdit: MAKE SURE YOU RUN IN COMPATABILITY MODE!!

TLDR:Best way I can think to describe this frenetic and incredibly challenging game is this:  picture yourself nursing an LSD-induced sense of bravado as you watch re-coloured b&w WWII movies on a 6"" Zenith, while being jazzed on copious amounts of Pop Rocks and Dr. Pepper (with your wife yelling at you in the background).  That pretty much sums it up :)Pros:+ Impressive modeling of vehicles+ Historically accurate unit representation+ Immersive graphics and battle sounds+ Highly detaled soldier actions/responses+ Covers US, German, UK, and RussiansMids:* Music can get annoying (also LOUD)* Some tanks feel stretched out (wide)* Unpolished voice-overs lack credibility* No true multiplayer (death-match) mode* Limited to static pre-programmed missionsCons:- Hard to make out elevation and angles- AI appears to be overly accurate/effective- Ridiculously difficult missions (like puzzles)- No dynamic content (little replay value)- Discontinued with no DLC or expansionsConclusion:Single-player and co-op real-time game (with action pause).  Similar to the titles in the Blitzkrieg series (though with a far more polished UI and better graphics).  If you can overlook being limited to a few multi-mission campaigns (30 missions total - over 4 campaigns), extreme difficultly, and cheesy music/voice-overs, then you will find this to be a keeper.For enthusiasts of tactical combat games that are up for a serious challenge, this will be right up your alley.  This is an impressive game with a rich historical flavor, offset occasionally by some highly fictionalized missions.  The soldiers mimic real-life behavior, the responses to situations are believable, and chaos rules.  While the battles may not reflect real-world circa 40's enagaments, they are loads of masochistical fun.  I personally like it quite a bit.But damn... the difficulty :)Thumbs up - if for no reason other than my being a glutten for punishment (lol).			"

												This game is very fun and detailed for such an old game, plus you get a lot for the price. However, it is VERY unfair, almost seeming like it wants to make you rage and quit playing it. Several levels it gives you 2-4 men with nothing but pistols and tells you to take out 50+ enemies by themselves, giving you no help whatsoever.Also, there is no autosave, so even if you do manage to have one person survive and take out half the map, one mistake and it's back to the beginning.All in all, worth picking up just to experiment with the mechanics and gameplay, but not a long lasting game you'll want to come back to, (unless you're a masochist).

Soldiers: Heroes of World War II fits into a small category of games that are called a 'masterpiece', retaining this status even by today's standarts, 12 years after it was first released on the market. The overall quality and innovation which this RTT possesses make Soldiers: Heroes of World War II a unique product, and a predecessor to an entire series of similar games (Faces of War, Men of War, Assault Squad 1 and 2). Every individual aspect of this game was designed with professionalism, contributing to the overall quality. However, the gameplay itself is where this RTT really shines. Unlike many other real time strategies or wargames of those days, Best Way (the developers) decided to go with a fresh approach, making their game a hybrid between strategy and action. As a result, Soldiers: Heroes of World War II became something entierly new and never seen before. The game, as the name indicates, is set in World War II. Players have an option to play 4 seperate campaigns, all of which are historically accurate. Players can use an immense arsenal of vehicles and infantry weapons to aid them during missions, and each battle is extremely entertaining due to the game's engine - GEM. Every single object in the game is destructible. Unlike classical real time strategies, in Soldiers: Heroes of World War II, players can enable direct control of vehicles, thus aiming with the mouse. In the game, there are two types of cannon shells, HE (high explosive, used against light vehicles and infantry) and AP (Armor piercing - used against heavier tank armor). Damage models are extremely detailed, and both friendly and enemy tanks will be less prone to being destroyed if shot in the front of the hull or turret. Heavier tanks are more resilient to damage, but can be flanked easier and dispatched by being shot in the sides or back. Essentially, unlike in other wargame or RTS titles, in Soldiers: Heroes of World War II, the player doesn't see everything being designed in points. Your armored units won't have HP bars, instead being either functional, damaged, or outright destroyed (vehicles in this game are composed of many seperate parts like the hull, treads, motor compartment and the cannon). Infantry can crawl, run, flank and hide behind cover, thus being very versatile and deadly against vehicles when in numbers and if being used correctly. In a nutshell, this game has an insane amount of detail, and original detail at that. Back in 2004, the quality of the graphics that this RTT possessed was easily described as awesome, although today, this ofcourse can no longer be said. However, graphics in Soldiers: Heroes of World War II are still very neat, very pleasent to look at. As with the gameplay, the graphics also shine with a wonderful level of detail, both in terms of textures and physics (don't light an enemy soldier ablaze with matches unless you want to get your helmet blown off). Audio is of excellent quality as well. In-game soundtracks are intense, tragic and very atmospheric. Sound is top notch, everything from bursts of high-caliber MG's to creaks of tank treads is highly dynamic. Soldiers: Heroes of World War II, in my personal opinion is not only a progenitor to the ""Men of War"" series, but also the best game in the entire series as well. I recommend this game to everyone, it's a WWII RTT that won't leave you bored, and you will soon find yourself beating it without noticing how fast time has passed by.P.S: This game also has multiplayer available. Back in the day, when Gamespy was still operational, there was a fair amount of players online. Nowadays, you need a program such as GameRanger or Hamachi to play, but if you find someone to play with, you won't regret it.			"

												One of my most favorite games from childhood. This is the first game of 'Men of War' series which use the first version of the engine. Although the game is quite old it feels and plays almost as good as the latest 'Men of War' games, with the difference of less mass control of the units. You'll have to control separate units more often so it might feel like some kind of commando style game rather than typical 'Assault Squad' massacre.The campaigns are challenging as hell, but logical and rewarding. If you played 'Men of War' games before and want more story-like missions, this game is for you.BEFORE YOU BUY!The game is from early 00's so you'll have to launch it with Windows XP compatibility mode if you use newer OS. And beware: there's NO widescreen support, you can't put textures options to high, only to normal and low, which is the issue with newer graphics cards, I suppose. You can't edit controls in the game, you'll have to do it manually via editing configs using text editor if you need, which is I think a bug with newer operating systems.			"

												As for me, one of the best games of the series ""Man of War"" (if not the best). If you are familiar with at least one game from this series and if you like it, then this one definitely likes. It is worth buying, if not by full price, then at a discount, for sure.///Как по мне одна из (если не самая лучшая) лучших игр серии ""В тылу врага"". Если знакомы хотя бы с одной игрой из этой серии и если она вам более менее понравилась, то эта и определенно понравиться. Стоит покупки, если не так, то по скидке уж точно.///			"

												I played this game when it first came out years ago. Great game, Absolutley worth the buy if it on sale - witch it is now. $1.24 - Unique RTS feel mixed with 3rd Person shooter aspects - control your own individual soldiers and thier realistic inventory. I reccommend.			"

												The first time i played this game was in 2004, bought from the grocery store. at this time it was one of the best games i had ever played. Today 11 years later, its still one of my all time favorites.If you like the <men of war: assualt squad> games i can tell you that the games are very identical to each other. You can egage combat with direct controll, that was an amazing feature in 2004, that they chould have in more games today. unlike men of war: assualt squad, Sodiers have a great story line that does not involve waves of waves with enemy soldiers.Playing single player missions in LAN with your friends never get old.Except some bugs that you have to expect from a old game, I hope this game will reach your Expectations.

												Still one of the most fun co-op games I have ever played, and still do sometimes.it has a very realistic feeling to it in that all vehicles need gas, you can blow the tracks off tanks and everything dies in a very small amount of bullets.You can co-op small campaigns for the Americans, British, Russians, and Germans, ranging from sneaking into  a fortified beach to managing a Tiger crew. Each player takes control of one or more characters and can swap with each other at any time. Nothing beats jumping into a flack cannon ,going to town on masses of poor infantry and accidentally kill all your friends before you run out of ammo.The controls are not the best, and most times if you die the controls are to blame. But once you get a hang of them they become second nature.			"

												Soldiers: Heroes of World War II is a real-time strategy game little like red alert but with limited units that can't be replaced.Everything seems nice for a 2004 game. It's basically exactly the same as Stalingrad but without the technical difficulties except having to run it in windows xp service pack 3 compatibility mode.The fog of war is your greatest enemy, having even foot soldiers destroying your tanks if you didn't notice it. It's a very enjoyable game, but there's no tutorial so you have to figure things out, having played red alert before, it's really similar in terms of play style. It's kinda hard to explain due to the similarities to red alert, 1 word, ""Realistic"" should explain it all.I do suggest getting it if you like red alert and do recommend getting it during an offer.

												I wanted to give this a good review.1. My cursor goes off to my left monitor causing me to see the extreme right side of the map in 0.2 seconds.It's 2017, fix the bounding of the gameplay area. 2. My view is FIXED at about 45 degrees down plus or minus 10 degrees. This means I cannot see anything more than 10 meters in front of my guy. Unforgivable. In the previous Men of War games I was given free camera freedom so see from ground level all the way to right on top. Fix this.3. This I find unforgivable for a Steam title. It failed to work out of the gate. Yeps, I had to again waste my time and go to the internet to find out I have to run the game in compatablilty mode for Win7! Um... I RUN Windows 7!  Silly.4. I go to remap the controls and I find it keeps resetting them to the default controls. Again, I had to waste my time to find out I actually had to edit a cfg file for my controls to work.I am so angry right now I will not make any rash decisions like demand a refund. It might be a good game but for crapsake, polish your game if you are going to ask $10 again for it!			"

												Lots of positive reviews on here for this one. Meaning lots of masochists love this one.I wanted a more hardcore RTS where troop management mattered more then popping out the right buildings. When trying to take on an entire battallion with two guys armed wih pistols, I realized I had gotten in over my head.If you want some serious trial and error gameplay mixed with a lot of unit micro management then look no further!There are some good aspects to this game but those are throughly covered in all of the glowing reviews, so go read those.And if it sounds like your cup of tea then great! Have at! There is some fun to be had here. I just didn't find much of it due to the brutal nature.And side note, DO NOT even bother with multi-player unless you really hate yourself. You can at least manual save in single-player. If you can in multi, I never figured it out. And that led to a whole lotta pain.			"

												This is basically the first men of war and plays the same as the other games in the MOW series, however i can't recommend it mainly because two reasons. Firstly the AI is totally brain dead, it often won't respond to commands or go the wrong way if you order them to go somewhere, this forces you use direct control most of the time (mainly for vehicles). And this brings me to my second reason, the camera movement is really limited and makes it frustrating as you are forced to play at weird angles and this limitation really bugs me. There are plenty of good MOW games to enjoy, just not this one. (side note! if you still bought the game and it crashes on launch, run it in comparability mode, that should fix the launch issue)			"

												This game is probably one of the best WWII strategy games out there. Heck, its my favorite RTS ever! The single player campaign proves to be a bit of a challenge, but it just makes it alot more fun and more satisfying once you've beaten it. With all of your moves, you have a sense of urgency hoping your soldiers don't get shot up as they move from cover to cover. The multiplayer matches are definetly alot of fun, and you can even play by yourself to get the hang of things. You can test out all of the vehicles and troops for each of the four countries. The mods make the game a TON more fun, and some can add a plethora of tanks and troops and balance out troops more. It sure adds to the game, and i would highly suggest this if you have friends to play it with!			"
