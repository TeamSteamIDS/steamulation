												Crusader Kings 2 is a complex grand strategy game.  The most complicated game I've ever played. Be prepared to spend hours and I mean hours confused as hell, looking at youtube, the wiki and forums.   Once it clicks though, it's awesome.  Not for everyone, but its kinda like playing through 'real life' Game of Thrones (there's a game of thrones mod too). You control a land owning character starting on any date between 1066 and 1453 AD (The Old Gods DLC will push this starting date back to 867 if you wish).  You can start as a powerful emperor or a lowly count.  The map you play on is more or less Europe stretching into parts of Asia and Africa.  Your sole goal in the game is to keep your bloodline going (and I believe holding land).  Other than that, there isn't a win screen, there aren't defined goals, its open ended, you play until 1453AD and then the game ends (save exportable to Europa Universalis 4 to continue your game with the purchase of a DLC).  You get a 'score', but that is just a rough estimate on how prestigious and pious your bloodline was.  It's quite possible to have 400 years of super rewarding gameplay without getting a high score.  This is a trend you will see me developing on and is a big part of what makes CKII so awesome.That's kinda hard to grasp, but it is less awkward than it sounds.  The goals sort of present themselves naturally.  You don't often sit there with no idea what to do (again, once you understand the game), you kind of always have something you're working towards.  For a first time player this is usually just become as powerful as possible, i.e. aquire land, become a king, then become an emperor and expand your empire.  If you're an advanced player you can set your own crazy goals, roleplay, or do other things to spice up the game.The game runs in 'real time', with a day going by a few times a minute on normal speed.  You can fast forward and pause.  Most of the time you will indeed be going through various menus.  Arranging marriages, keeping tabs on powerful families, plotting assinations, acquiring territory through political shennigans, keeping your subjects happy, bringing in powerful characters to tutor the children of the realm and hold office, and much more.  You can micromanage to your hearts content, play a more hands off style, or switch between the two.When combat breaks out, it is done by moving stacks of armys around the campaign map, meeting an opposing army will cause a battle.  These really just compose of watching numbers go down, and kills go up, so if you're looking for Total War style combat you arent going to get it here.  Don't be fooled though, many times I've been on the edge of my seat watching these numbers change.  The combat system is quiet nuanced as well. To be the most effective you have many things to consider. Terrain bonuses, attrition penalties, appointing competant commanders from your realm, and more add depth.In all I highly recommend this game to anyone who has played something like Civ or Total War and fancy themself a strategy gamer, is looking for a challenege, and has a lot of patience.  This is kinda the next step you can take into something quite a bit more complicated.  That is the path I took into the game am loving it.The game is still actively having expansions and patches developed for it as of the writing of this review 11/25/2013.Full disclosure:  Your reviewer has not quite finished a playthrough yet but am close.  I have 120 hours playtime. I own the dlcs The Old Gods, Legacy of Rome, and the Europa Universalis 4 save converter.  I solely purchased EU4 because of how much I enjoyed my crusader kings 2 game and wanted to continue playing my empire, I haven't even played it yet.Also: Don't buy for full price.  Even though it is worth it, getting the game and all the dlc all at full price is pretty expensive. The base game is often on sale or in bundles.This is my first steam review so if you think this is helpful give the thumbs up and I'll do some more reviews.  Hope you enjoyed reading.			"

												*Update* So good I nominated for an award!Word of warning when buying this, it will will ruin all other strategy games!I was a big Civilization fan and whilst it isn't really far to compare the two (they are wildly different in many ways) going back to something like Civ now seems like a huge leap back in terms of depth. The politics, emergent story and shear possibility of genuine scheming in Crusader Kings 2 make other dilpomacy games almost a joke. Once you've conspired to kill a duke with the help of his wife and the hope of triggering a civil war to potentially swing in the favour of your first born heir as your final legacy, nothing will offer the same devious pleasure in other games.By all means try the demo, but don't be scared off by the amount of information. Whilst great, the interface is certainly intimidating at first, but the tool tips are excellently written for just about every button. Just take your time and don't worry about losing to much at first, just mess around and it will soon come to you. This is the type of game that makes you want to write down your stories just to share with other people. Like that time I murdered my own inbred daughter because she was in a plot with my uncle to kill me! Beat that!			"

												At the age of 16, my character developed a mad crush on a local girl. He crept into her room and banged her, then declared he loved her. 9 months later she gave birth to a child, he decided he didn't like it, smothered this child in its crib, pushed his lover off a balcony and then married a horny Greek princess and did it all over again until he commited suicide at the age of 72 because his son turned gay after coming back from a visit to Constantinople. Brilliant!			"

												With 400 hours played, my biggest hope is that they stop releasing new DLC so that I can stop buying it.The game is certainly not for everybody, and as above the amount of DLC can be intimidating.  But if you enjoy the thought of creating a dynasty and playing it throughout history then this might be the game for you.			"

												I am sussex, one county in england at the 769 start.I realize I picked a bad start, and need to get land fast. so I took over kent, the de jure duchy.I am now the duke of Kent, but am stuck with mercia, wessex, and northumbria. so I decide to take those too.I am now the king of England. Unfortunately, ireland and scotland seem to hate things that aren't celtic and think they can attack me at will. so I take them over.I am content with staying on the empire of Britannia and never expanding as that brings trouble. except the vikings think they can constantly spam raids on me. so I take over all of scandinavia to stop the germanics.now that I am no longer surrounded by long boats, I can finally rest...and then the muslims invaded aquataine. realizing how screwed I am if the muslims manage to take france and germany, I proceed to commit genocide across the iberian peninsula to ensure christian safety. I can now finally stop conquering...until I notice that africa is only made of muslims since the shia took over mali. so to make sure that I don't get steam rolled later, I take them over too...I finally stop conquering for 50 years... until the mad emperor decides that he wants jerusalem, france, germany, italy and middle francia. so he conquers them all and eventually dies from a combination of stress, depression, and a wound.good thing that his genius son managed to keep the empire from being broken apart from all the lords who just don't like the Haesting family. unfortantely, I lose jersualem from every single muslim joining the jihad. but thats okay, I pushed into egypt and took control of the byzantine empire.The caliphate must have realized what I was planning, for 30 years after the fall of jerusalem he thought he could take anotolia. Neither he nor I expeceted the christianized mongolians helping me. I keep anatolia and eventually take back jerusalem.on May 30th, 1350, I was crowned Roman Emperor and given the nickname 'the glorious'.EDIT: At 820 hours, I have finally beaten my first ironman game. This game lasts far too long if you start at the 769 date since the game lags bad at the end.			"

												Easily one of the best games I've had the fortune of playing. A grand stragey, which rather than being abstracted out to the extent of Civ or Europa Universalis, allows you to take on the role of a head of state (or, head of county or duchy) and do essentially what you like. Want to conquer Britain? Do it! Want to sit as a count for 400 years? Do it! Want to overthrow the Holy Roman Empire? Well... Good luck.Although the core game only allows Christian rulers (thanks ahyangyi!)  to be played, Sword of Islam adds Islamic groups, The Republic adds republics, The Old Gods adds Pagans and Sons of Abraham adds the Jewish kingdom. Each provides a new style of gameplay, distinct from the others.Grand strategy at its finest, though frustratingly hard at times.			"

												I bought this game in a Humble Bundle package and activated it on May 14th of 2015. In the 566 days since that day, according to Steam, I have logged 1310 hours in this game. This means that 9.6% of my life since adding this game to my Steam library has been playing Crusader Kings 2. If you adjust to exclude 7 hours of sleep per day, 13.6% CK2 time. If you adjust to exclude a 40 hour work week, this figures to 20.5%.Since installing this game, it has occupied one fifth of my waking non-work life.These are all facts. Hard, sobering, mathematical facts. Some day, if I stop playing CK2, perhaps I will reflect upon these facts. But until then, I'll be conquering the world.			"

												Dear Diary, Day 1, I played CK2 as a Viking Lord in Norway. I was able to get FedualisAm and reformed Religion. 65 years old and on death door I was able to get Primogeniture passed as a tribe and formed kingdom of sweden and norway.Day 2, Today the throne was passed to me by my father. I was able to take over Finland and Denmark to create an empire. Found a new home in England and that will be the target of my son.Day 3, My father was a viking berserker, He lead an army of 5000 men charging toward 3000 skirt troop but he was manage to get surranded and killed. I got on the throne just 14 years old and I will probably rule it a long time.Day 4, I am still on the throne and now i am now 70 years old. A lot things happened and United Kingdom is now under viking Banner and I am still a bit short of forming the wendish empire. It's Already midnight here so a new day will start.Day 5, It's pass mid night and i will play until i pass the throne to my son. as 70 I will need to slow down and manage my titles, county and Duchy well. Time to be a bit ruthless tyrant and once I die all bad behavior will be washed away.PSSSSttt.. I am now 83 years old.. Why won't i die? All the vassal are extramly unhappy with me taking duchy, Banish overpowered lord. I had to bribe people regulary. Murder over powerful faction member. And forget about Fabricate Claims I need it to keep my subject happy. MAARARAFDAAS... I am now 93 years old.. I accepted the fact that i won't die anytime soon And it's 5:30 in the morning already. Meh.. This is a review? Not a Diary?

Product received for free
												So I think it's about that time when I actually review this game. I've played it off steam for more than 300 hours and about 1500 hours on steam, so it's fair to say I've experienced just about all the bugs, highs and lows, DLCs' and changes to the game's mechanics through the never-ending patches on Paradox' end. I will preface this by saying I'm a history nerd and a complete and utter sucker for the medieval era. I'm a nostalgic dreamer who always used to dream about a game that was dynasty (family) focused, as opposed to the total warfare/dominate the universe-type game. So when I got this game as a gift, it was like someone had created the game for me. It's my go to when I just want to pass time and see whatever my Swedish countess or Scottish duke are up to. The level of micromanagement is ridiculous. I love it. But it's borderline insane. Go through the tutorials of the game, and you'll find yourself lost with a sensation of you might know what you did wrong. Don't go through the tutorials, and you might as well be trying to fill in for Slash at a concert, when the most experience you've had playing a guitar was looking at a banjo through a shop's window. It's intense. In the beginning I lost whole countries to distant relatives in other countries and was scratching my head, but eventually I got the hang of it. I think everyone can play this game, but you have to be prepared to put in a lot of effort and willingness to learn its mechanics. And then after that, there are lesser things to learn, such as your wife trying to kill you because you had a sweet dalliance with her sister. Or perhaps the fact that leading your own troops could result in the unfortunate event of you losing your life, and your 3-year old, imbecilic son inheriting your entire kingdom. There's always more to learn, no matter how much you play this game - its excitement will last you a long time. I love this game because of its neverending possibility for replayability. No game will ever be the same. You can customize your characters with an inexpensive DLC (get the DLCs - at least ""The old Gods"" and a few more. They add so much to the game), and you can create the basis of your new game with a new objective. The word sandbox is key, because in this world, you are not only the lord of your demesne, but of your own fate. Do you want to take that neighbouring county? Or do you just want to keep your family strong and safe, provide good husbands for your daughters? Maybe your king has been getting on your nerves and you want to gather allies and usurp his throne? This medieval world is all yours - if you have the gold, skill and time. On the downside of things, I think CK2 is worth €40, but for a four-year old game it's on the steeper side. It's frequently on sale though. Add it to your wishlist and wait; you can snatch it up for a fraction of its original price. I've enjoyed this game so much and had so many angry, funny and downright amazing moments. Wars I thought I'd lose have turned and I've won entire kingdoms. I've romanced my way through entire courts to get women to join my plots to kill people. The level of intrigue, surprises, horrors, joys and entertaining moments are endless. Oh, and...I seduced the pope once. As a gay king. 10/10.			"

												Crusader Kings II is in my opinion one of the best strategy games out there. Do you like medieval times? Times when you could call your vassals forth and fight against the invader? Or against an ally? Your brother? Your sister? Your cat? Then shut up and give them money!You can play as the brutal vikings and sack the coastal regions, or an Irish nobleman who wants to reunify the broken country, or a republic? Do you want to be the prince of Persia? Ok jokes on the side, additional content has been recently announced, the game is constantly being updated by the devs, and they are truly working hard on it. You have a save file converter to continue the adventures of your dinasty on EUIV, another grand strategy game. Start out small, and try to make your family name shine! You can even customize your rulerz (an additional dlc though). Yes this is a fanboy review.			"

												My friend and I decided to play a multiplayer game of Crusader Kings II earlier. Never in my life have I ever been more frightened in a video game. Let me explain.My friend and I decided to be counts in different kingdoms and empires. My character was a little interesting.First Name: 12Last Name: ISISGoal: Spread my ""seed"" to all corners of the worldLocation: EnglandRank: Count of KentI had set the goal of spreading my ""seed"" all over the world because I thought it would make for some interesting gameplay, and boy did something interesting happen.The game started off normal, my friend was in the Holy Roman Empire as a Duke, and I was in the nearby province of Kent in England, not far from the border of the Holy Roman Empire so we were both well within diplomatic range. I started to spread my ""seed"" by seducing as many women as I could. I tended to seduce the women who had high rankings, such as the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire, the Queen of England, Queen of France, and other higher ranking women. My fertility was well above average, and basically any woman I seduced would have a child.After a couple of decades having passed, my friend had become Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, and I spread my seed to almost every major kingdom and empire in diplomatic range (little did my friend know, he was actually playing as my illegitimate child that I had with the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire). You could always tell which children were mine based on their names. Most of my children had the most ridiculous names like, ""THANKS OBAMA"" or ""Nigerian Prince Simulator"". But, there was one child I had that would cause a lot of problems for everyone. His name was ""Forgot the Condom"".""Forgot the Condom"" was a normal child at first. He grew up till the age of 6 relatively normal, but then something went horribly wrong. While trying to seduce more women, I got a notification in the game. This is essentially what the notification said: ""My son 'Forgot the Condom' is not like other children. He does not scream or cry or even get upset, but he observes the world with keen interest. This morning, he burst into bubbling laughter when a cook cut his hand badly and there was blood everywhere. Animals do not like him and he makes a strange buzzing sound when near other children. Courtiers whisper 'demon spawn' and the servants have started to avert their eyes and make covert signs to ward off evil."" After telling my friend about the event (he had a lot more experience in the game than me), he immediately mentioned that I should stop whatever I was doing and kill my child. My friend exact words were, ""Your son is a demon, you have to kill him or it will be too late.""""Too late?"" I asked. My friend remained silent. At the time, the only way to kill your own child was to imprision them and execute them. So, I decided I would try to do that. Well, whenever I tried to imprison ""Forgot the Condom"", he ended up escaping and fleeing the country. I explain this to my friend and he tells me, ""We have to kill him, somehow."" At the time, neither my friend nor I knew about the character search tool in the game, so we had to manually find ""Forgot the Condom"" in all of the provinces. We looked for 30 minutes, and could not find him. After we finished searching, we decided to continue with the game as normal. ""Let's just hope nothing bad happens"", my friend exclaimed.Five years pass, and I get a notification. It reads: ""My dear daughter 'SWAGYOLO420NOSCOPE"" must have suffered a stroke in her sleep last night. She was found drooling in bed, one eye bloodshot, mumbling about a small monster that stabbed her in the eye before it ran off. There are dark rumours about the so called 'demon child', my son 'Forgot the Condom', again... As always when something terrible happens, she does seem inordinately happy."" I thought we had been rid of ""Forgot the Condom"", but he was back, with a vengeance.I tried finding ""Forgot the Condom"" again in all of the provinces near me, but I could not find him.Another year passes, my son ""URLUCKYIDIDNTABORTU"" dies. Then my daughter, ""6 Salads"" dies. My son, ""Taco Tuesday"" dies. At this point I realized, ""Forgot the Condom"" is killing all of my children. I entirely dedicated to finding and killing him. I'm looking around for him, and he is killing all of my children. We look for him for 2 years in game, when my friend says something.""HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ I FOUND HIM!""""WHAT WHAT, WHERE IS HE?"" I ask.""Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ he.... he""""What? What's wrong?""""He is the ♥♥♥♥ING POPE.""I immediately check to see if he is right. My son... my son, ""Forgot the Condom"" is the ♥♥♥♥ing Pope. My friend and I start to freak out, ""How the hell did he become the Pope?!?!"" ""What do we do?"" ""HOW DID WE NOT NOTICE THIS BEFORE?!?!?!""Immediately we start a plot to kill ""Forgot the Condom"". We have to kill him before it's too late. We have to kill him before it's too late. We have to kill him before it's too late.We had 167% plot power, we were going to kill him, but then the worst thing happen. I get a notification: ""My dear son 'Ebola Paitent 0' has died."" So, what is so special about Ebola Paitent 0? Well, Ebola Paitent 0 was the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, aka my friend. My demon child ""Forgot the Condom"" killed my friend. At this point in the game, the entirety of my children and lineage, the ISIS family line, had been completely wiped out. Except for one person, except for me, ""12, 12 of the family ISIS"". I could no longer kill my son because you cannot plot against your children, I was stuck. I had no where to go. I was going to die, the ISIS family line was going to die. I struggled to find any way to kill the Pope, my friend could not start a plot because his new character was a child. We had nowhere to turn. We were out of options.Eventually, the worst came, ""Forgot the Condom"" killed me in my sleep. I was dead, the legendary ""12 of ISIS"" was dead.The game ended. I had no heirs, and I was eliminated from the game. The game was also hosted by me so it ended for my friend as well.""WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ was that?"" my friend said. I didn't even say anything. A few minutes pass, we were staring at the defeat screen the entire time.""We must remember this in some way."" I explained. ""We must remember '12 of ISIS' and 'Forgot the Condom'. We need to memoralize them forever."" ""How do we do that?"" my friend asks.""I don't know, but we must remember them. They are legends and must never be forgotten.""TL; DR The game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.			"

 Everything You Need To Know  (She just want to smoke and create the definitive review for CK2, I said, ""Girl, that's all that we do."")  That Good Good  Good News:  The game is great and endlessly replayable. Pros beat the cons. Stop reading this and buy it, nerds.   Good News:   You don't have to force it. If learning the game isn't immediately fun, stop. You're not missing enjoyment later. Good News:   Losing is fun!  History has its eyes on you. Good News:   Winning is fun! There are easy starts for first time players. Cornwall 1066 is great place to hide.. Good News:   The Game of Thrones Mod is proof that life is worth living. Look how lucky we are to be alive right now. Good News:   The Conclave features getting roasted in the negative reviews can now be disabled, mostly.  Good News:   You're smart enough to succeed even if those Conclave features couldn't be disabled. I appreciate you, a lot. Good News:   Civilization is a strategy board game. If you'd prefer a historical rulership sim, this is it. You're home. Good News:   Most of the DLC is unimportant. Plus, it's easier to learn by starting with the base game anyway.  DLC Importance The base game is playing a Christian Crusader King. Most game features cater to them. The Holy Land awaits.DLC releases are accompanied by free updates, so the current base game alone is still better than the base game at launchDLC rulers (Indians/etc) are advanced variations on the rulers in the base game. No need to buy them until way later.For example, Vikings are a blast, but only if you can appreciate how they're different from normal kings.You won't enjoy these rulers if you don't at least somewhat enjoy the basic ones, so, again, DLC not a major key upfront.DLC rulers are not needed to play the game as it was intended. They explore playing the game as it was not intended. It's not ""You want to play Super Mario Bros as Luigi? Fifteen bucks.""It's more ""For your 1000th playthrough of Super Mario Bros, would you like to pay to play as the Goomba Caliph?"" DLC Cost Remember, the game had plenty of people hooked before the DLC features existed.Buy the DLC you want over time. I had to do that, they weren't out yet!If you still like the game after 100 hours of play, buy The Old Gods. If you still like it 100 hours later, buy Way of Life and Legacy of Rome.After 300 hours grab Sword of Islam. (And Ruler Designer and Customization if you want to get creative.)Snag Conclave and Charlemagne on hour 400, and then you're done.Buy Way of Life upfront if you want. Or add these DLCs in a different order or at a different rate. It doesn't matter.They're not starter material, they're meant to add a fresh spin on a game you want more of. Game is fantastic, but maybe some of these nitpicks are dealbreakers/I don't know your life/You do you   Bad News:  Tutorial is not helpful. Check YouTube or just feel it out. If your hype dies, stop playing. I stayed hyped. Bad News:  This game's multiplayer isn't good but the real problem is them even putting it in at all. Games can take weeks! Bad News:  Bugs. Enough to make Ironman (where console commands and manual saving are disabled) unappealing. Bad News:  Like other detailed projects (think Skyrim, Fallout), it's gonna crash. Mods turn this up to 11. It's worth it. Bad News:  The combat system is functional but uncomplicated. This is not Total War. Don't push it in that direction. Bad News:  Unlike the rest of the game, ideal army composition is not something you'll figure out by playing. Bad News:   Plenty of names from plenty of languages and zero pronunciation hints. Bad News:  Feudal rulers were not absolute monarchs. This can be difficult. You will be tempted to mod this out. Don't. Bad News:  The Game of Thrones Mod is so damn good. The base game is comparatively lacking in roleplay elements. Bad News:  The Game of Thrones Mod is so damn good, but you're better off waiting until you're a seasoned CK2 veteran. Bad News:  Occasionally, you may feel like you arbitrarily have less control over your character than you should. Bad News: AI is stubborn, impatient, insecure, and can't see the big picture. Bad News:  AI will be equally mad about being harmed and about being denied some extremely unfeasible goal. Bad News:  Your council gets upset at your heir when you die for... not being you. Bad News:  There's an education event where you can make your kid functional if you harm yourself in return. It's never worth it, and ignoring it is impossible because... Bad News:  This event can actually be gamed, as all mentors can receive it. Simply make a rival mentor a kid, then watch him become a inefficient mess. Unfortunately, this can also wreck valuable NPCs or  anyone whoever mentors anyone . Bad News:  AI never considers that the situation they don't like is still their best option. They always prefer change. Bad News:  Loyalty is not measured separately from opinion. The ramifications of this will become obvious the more you play Bad News:  You lose too much control over your children if they're not in your court. Bad News:  Similarly, you have no power to intervene on their behalf if you couldn't do the same if they weren't family. Bad News:  Split custody issues exist but there's no way of predicting some of them and no mechanic for fixing any of them. Bad News: : When you die and become your heir, you're not given context or explanation for what they've been up to, even though you're now them.  Bad News:  Some of your council resigns when your heir takes over, but they don't mind being immediately rehired.... what? Bad News:  Your heirs will sabotage the stability of your realm even thought it will hurt them later when they're in charge. Bad News: Enemy rulers sometimes continue to rule from places you've already conquered, making them uncapturable. Bad News:  No boat combat. Not a big deal, but the cost of getting and maintaining boats is a lot for just a troop transport.  Bad News:  All of inner Africa south of Muslim-held West Africa feels poorly thought out.  Wack Issues   Bad News:  The game map has grown. India will make your game slower even if you never go there.  Bad News:  You're never going to India. Bad News:  Your laptop will heat up. Blame India. The Game of Thrones mod similarly is plagued by Essos. Bad News:  They chose adding India over strengthening the base game. It has no reason to be here. Bad News:  Norse and Muslim rulers are key to Europe, so their expansions helped the base game. India? Not so much. Bad News: : I just don't get why India is in this game. It adds a huge problem for weaker PCs for a minimal payoff. Bad News:  Dealing with raiders becomes an annoying chore if you control many coastal provinces. Bad News:  Adventurers/Rebels (can be disabled) get bizarrely huge armies. You'll understand when you see it. The Wackest Issue (In-game) Costs are laughably expensive and not relative to each other. The different random events where you can spend money on things often require a literal king's ransom. Some mundane costs are equal to a month's income of Europe's largest kingdom. It is frustratingly nonsensical.  Small Issue w/ Bad Vibes The ruler designer, which is a paid add-on, will not let you create an unbalanced character even if you aren't playing in Ironman for Achievements.This is absurd and an actual legitimate DLC grievance. You can futz around with the console to try to fix it, but it's not a perfect solution. Mod fix is available. Vote Dukakis  "

												Just minding my own business down in the little duchy of Serbia when three royal marriages and two feasts later I get a notification that I have inherited the entire kingdom of Denmark. This game, with all of its DLCs for its full potential, is absolutely brilliant in that it brings character customisation and character development to a whole new level. Certainly different from the other Paradox Interactive franchises but in the best way possible. Each Paradox Interactive grand strategy has their own unique focus of gameplay which corresponds accurately to the time period and Crusader Kings II has definitely nailed it with their focus on indepth feudal systems and royal relations. Also I imprisoned all my Danish vassals and watched Denmark plunge into anarchy under my command. 10/10 would usurp title again			"

Incest simulator ?This is the title that many jokingly have given this game on the internet. However this far from what the game is, can you perform incest, yes, however the deepth and dynamics goes far beyond mere incestual relations. Main purpose or goal?You are the head of a dynasty, at the beginning of the game, you can choose which dynasty, and who within that dynasty that you want to play as. Do you want to take control of one of the powerful rulers of the mighty Karling dynasty? Or do you want to repeat history by trying to bring a small count in Switzerland from an obscure family known as Habsburg to their glory, as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, and spread the Habsburg from there on. With the customize ruler DLC you expand you game a thousandth-fold, you will have to power to not only choose who you want to play as, but you can create you whole new dynasty and ruler. Want a genius hunchback who rules over the Arabian Empire? Do you want to try and backstab your way to the top of the Byzantine Empire with a powerful spy? It is up to you!There is one indicator on how well you have done, that is your Score which the game at the end compare with other great historical dynasties. You increase your score by having rulers with high prestige and piety, but also having other dynasty members in high positions, will generate prestige to your dynasty, giving newborn a higher starting position in life, when it comes to their prestige.There are so many DLCs!Many seem to get overwhelmed by the amount of DLCs this game has, however many of those are cosmetic DLCs, adding other graphics or sounds to the game. The main DLCs that expand gameplay are:I will rank them, with the top being the most important expansion to get first, by my own opinion.Ruler Designer - This will enable you to create your own ruler, only your imagination will limit the replayability of the game.Legacy of Rome - This expansion not only gives more deepth to the Orthodox rulers of the Byzantine, and greek cultures, it also provides new game mechanics, such as military retinues. (Also allow the possibility for castrating and blinding prisoners playing as a ruler of the Byzantine culture group)The Old Gods - This enable you to play the game from 867 CE, and also make Pagans and Zoroastrian rulers playable.Sword of Islam - Makes muslims playable, as The Old Gods each unique religion has its own mechanics.Sons of Abraham - Adds more deepth to the abrahamic faiths and also Judaism. Heresies for religions are also possible.The Republic - Want to try out the merchant life of Venice? With this DLC that will be possible, take control of a patrician family, amass wealth and control the trade zones around the shores of the known world.Charlemagne - Introduces a new starting time, at 769 CE, gives you the option to create custom Kingdoms and Empires.Rajas of India - Allows for control of the Indian rulers. Way of Life - Focus the life of your ruler towards certain areas of his life, want to became a great hunter to catch the fable white bear? Or became the greatest architech in the whole realm?Customization Pack - Customize your ruler ingame, change the beard, hair style, even the dynasty name or shield.Sunset Invasion - If you want to add an extra level of crazy to your game, only recommended for veteran players of CK2, what if the Aztec discovered Europe first? And decided to invade?Save Game converter - If you own Europa Universalis IV and want to continue your saga from CK2, this DLC will enable you to export your CK2 game into EU IV.All the other DLCs are cosmetical.Mods!Crusader Kings 2 has more mods, that will expand your game, one of the more popular mods is a total conversion into a Game of Thrones universe. Where you can encounter spoilers from the series, but it will also make you play out the stories in George R.R. Martin's universe in another direction, should Tyrion Lannister have the Iron Throne? Learning curve?It has a steep learning curve, and the ingame tutorial only scratches the surface of possibilities. I would recommend picking up the game, and play with a friend online, or experiment as a count in Ireland. But when you get a hang on it, it will grab you, and pull you deeper into a world of intrigue, murder, war, romance, and much more. In an forever going struggle for power over the realm, and the world. "

												As a northern Jarl. My ambition was to unify the Northern people, as my father had did before me. I set out and subjecated my neighbours. Soon Norway, Sweden, Denmark and half of Finland was mine. My most favored and ONLY son, a true prodigy of my blood line; did me proud when he said he wanted to service in the Byzantine Varangian Guard.With tears in the back of my throat, my heart beating with pride as I saw the ship sail away to a golden sunset. Many months passed without a word from my son. I had many daughters in his absence. I ruled and I went and conquered the Saxon kingdom. The south was open for the taking.I reccive words after putting down a foolish rebellion. That sails bearing the family standard. A Golden tree on a field of green. I made prepartions in the hall. Odin be praised! My son was finally home! As the doors slams open and a man I bearly recognize as my son steps into the light. He seems ashamed despite my smiles. After the feast, I told him it was time for him to take on a wife and make a family.Dark became the hall when he told me the news of deeds in the Byzantine Varangian Guard. Sleeping with one of the wifes of the Emperor. He had lost his manhood. I had not gotten my son back... but another daughter.I told my housecarls to seize the creature before me and put him in chains. He did not scream nor complain as my men dragged him away. I have to respect him for that.The day came when it was time for blot, so I personally was the one who placed the blade at my former son's throat and made the leathal blow. The Jarls of the Kingdom, seemed pleased at this. But I knew that behind their false smiles that their resentment of me was now higher without an heir. I had only daughters.Who would have known that my sons life was connected to my own. Bloodlines are like trees. Roots are the ancestors, the trunk are you and the branches are the children. Now without the branches my line has come to an end.As I see the army of my wifes brother come over the hills eager to see my head detached from my body, I can only think what will happen to my memory. Will someone remember this bloodline? Or will we fade into oblivion? Even so, I will see my son in Valhalla. And there we will feast with the Aesir. Odin see me!This is my story.What will be yours?This game is worth playing.			"

												If you care about the amount of gameplay you get for your money at all, this game probably rates higher than any other game. (Last I read, the average player had over 500 hours on this game.) Crusader Kings II is a strategic game where you spend most of your time looking at a big map of Europe cut into little counties, but it is drastically different from a game like Medieval II: Total War.  Whereas in those games, every nation had rigid boundaries and an entire nation was a distinct, unified entity, Crusader Kings II focuses upon the feudal system of governance, and especially its hereditary system of succession.You are not a nation, you are an extended family through the ages.  You may start as King of England, but lose the throne in a succession war, only to wind up inheriting the Kingdom of France, instead.  It is a game of political machinations more than warfare.You can't just declare war whenever you want to, you need to, by hook or by crook, manage to get a claim to that land you want to invade.  Battles are relatively quick and hands-off (play that Total War if you want to manage the troops directly) but it's the space between wars that makes the game interesting.  To get that claim, you probably need to find some way to get the princess of that land in your bed (or your son's bed), and it's this medieval bloodline plotting that make up the meat of the game.  For that matter, you don't necessarily need to declare war to gain land - just marry into the family that succeeds a throne, and make sure that, one way or the other, your chosen heir also manages to be the chosen heir of a target kingdom, and the kingdoms will be unified upon the death of your current character and the current king of the target land. Likewise, just because you gain land doesn't mean you can keep it.  You need to delegate land out, and succession laws can fragment your kingdom so much that you see hard-conquered lands slip out of your grasp by inheritence without your consent.  EDIT: And since writing this, Conclave has come out to add complexities to keeping your nobles in line.Worse, while whomever you give land will be quite grateful for the first 20 years of their rule or so, their children will have no gratitude for the gift of land your father gave them, and will likely be burning with ambitions you have to keep in check.  Every few decades, your character ages and dies, and succession wars and civil wars are the primary way the game keeps your over-arching ambitions in check.  Rather than letting a large empire mean that no external threat can challenge you, and no internal threats exist, the larger you become, the less vulnerable you are to external threats, but the more vulnerable you are to internal ones. You spend more and more time trying to find a way to bludgeon the rebellious nobles and religious minorities into line.If you get tired of games of Total War, and don't bother completing them because, once you are the strongest power on the map, there's nothing to do but steamroll everything else that stands in your path, then CK2 is a great remedy to this.  (You can still make a world-spanning super-empire, but it's much more interesting to try to keep it when the owners of that land still fight you when you plant your flag there than to just have them mutely pay taxes to you and have assumed loyalty to your cause.)It's a game that's just hard and realistic enough to make the things you do actually feel like you're thumbing your nose at history.  You can play an Irish earl, rise to High King of Ireland, and conquer England.  Or play as the West Africans, and conquer the Muslims and convert them to your pagan faith.  Being a norse viking that captures the pope and sacrifices him to Odin is always fun.  (And nabs the Holy Smoke! achievement.) And if you do it with an unbroken line of Viking empresses, all the better.Mods are also a high point: Play the Elder Kings mod, based upon the Elder Scrolls, and conquer Cyrodiil and beyond as an immortal or vampire, using magicks to summong hordes of demons when under threat. There's an A Game of Thrones mod, as well, and mods to turn the game into something like a space 4X game.  DLC still comes out for the game, as well.  While more than a little annoying to be nickled and dimed, the trickle of new content keeps the game fresh and new achievements are meaningful challenges, requiring players to take up historic underdogs to rise to glory.  Getting a full board of achievements is extraordinarily difficult, but enjoyable for the challenge they provide.  Compare this to Activision, Ubisoft, or EA, where you buy iterations of the same game every year, and throwing down $10 for another year's worth of life in a game is well worth the price.			"

												I recommend the living ♥♥♥♥ out of this game.Seriously, if you like grand-scale strategy games, but want something with a deeper ""roleplaying"" element in it, this game is right up your alley. Ultimate goal of the game is to advance your familial dynasty to the top of medieval Europe's feudal pecking order through war, diplomacy, subterfuge, and all sorts of other scandalous medieval shenanigans. You play the game through your character, who experiences text-based events occasionally that you, the player, must choose how he reacts to. You will mobilize and lead armies, fall in love, conquer foreign (and-not-so-foreign nations), marry your cousins and breed your children using the power of eugenics to secure your family's power in future generations -- though not necessarially in that order.Fun♥♥♥♥♥♥ 10/10 just like the real medieval times.

												11/10 - Would become Earl Cadoc of Cornwall again.CK2 – The Misfortune SimulatorThe Life of Cadoc of CornwallWilliam the Conqueror succeeds in his invasion of England, which is good as Harold was good for nothing. In his wisdom, William decided to create the Duchy of Cornwall and NOT make me the Duke. I remain a lowly Earl.Start plot to assassinate the current Duke of Cornwall, I want that position. Nobody likes me enough to join it. End of plot.The only guy who actually liked me a lot and had great traits, my Chancellor, today died of depression. The only two suitable replacements look more like the living embodiment of the Seven Deadly Sins. I chose one of them with reluctance.My wife is pregnant. Hopefully it'll be a boy!My first daughter, whom is to be my heir, refuses to learn any of my traits. To this day, she remains Ambitious, and only Ambitious.The child is born. It's a girl.And to add the icing on the bitter Cake of Feudal Disappointment, my loving wife died giving birth to said child.Got married again!Wife insisted on becoming a Spymaster. Funny, both my wives have been Spymasters...Treason! Rebellious scum have risen in Cornwall, and I am besieged. According to someone of little importance in my Council, this rebellion only had a 6.5% chance of actually happening. I should buy a ticket for the Great Monarch Lottery.Duke Arsewipe of Cornwall has aided me in removing the rebellious scum that infested my lands. I still hate him.Praise be to God! A plague of Typhus has swept Cornwall. Perhaps Duke Arsewipe shall be given a painful and miserable death.Duke Arsewipe lives...yay.My wife is pregnant, I hope it's a boy. I'm sure the saying goes “Second time lucky”.Apparently the saying goes “Third time lucky”, and I am now the only man in a house of my wife and four daughters.Instead of consoling me, today my Court Chaplain came to me to spread heresy. Naturally, I imprisoned him.My Steward is dead, and there are no candidates to replace him. I now spend a portion of my day keeping the chair warm.Today, I learned that Duke Arsewipe had a previous wife who tragically died of Camp Fever. I'm still unsure as to what the hell kind of name 'Hungifu' is for a woman. Those weird Anglo-Saxons.My wife is once again pregnant. Since this is the 'third time', maybe I will be in luck.My first daughter has married the son of the King of Denmark. We are now far more Prestigious, and Denmark are now my allies.It's a boy! Cador is born!My eldest daughter has given birth to a daughter.My second eldest daughter has just married the son of the King of Navarra. We now have an alliance with Navarra. Duke Arsewipe better look over his shoulder from now on.My niece has asked me to help her find a suitor to marry. Rather concerning is the fact that someone has put my newborn son on the list. I will choose her someone that isn't related. I decided to hold a marvellous feast, with only the finest food. Unfortunately, I only have one guest. The feast went well.Managed to convince my Bishop, whom was formerly my Court Chaplain, to become a Catholic once again. Upon doing so, I released him from prison.I have started a new plot to kill Duke Arsewipe, and with a little (a lot) of coin, I have convinced two others to join me. At last, my enemy shall die!For whatever reason only known to them, my two supporters backed out without telling me. To add insult to injury, Duke Arsewipe had the nerve to ask me to let a member of his family educate one of MY children!Turned 50 today. Happy Birthday to me...yay.Today, my WIFE discovered that my eldest DAUGHTER is planning to kill my only SON and heir. I think my family has finally hit rock bottom.My wife is pregnant...A boy has been born! This is becoming a big family, hopefully they won't murder each other.Alas, sickness murdered my newborn son.It's been twenty years since Duke Arsewipe became duke, and for some reason, he still insists on breathing more life into his wretched soul. I may be older, but I will outlive him!My wife is pregnant...again. I really need to calm down in my old age.It's a boy. The family seems to be evening out a bit now.I have no idea how I do it, but I've managed to get my wife pregnant again. My Court Chaplain insists I stop these so-called “shenanigans”.I am blessed with another son.Duke Arsewipe has stepped over the line now. He has asked me to allow HIM to educate MY son and heir. May the Devil take him!60 today. I insist upon outlasting Duke Arsewipe!My eldest daughter's husband has died at the age of 31, and the circumstances are very suspicious.My son and heir is now married to the princess of the Holy Roman Empire!My half-brother, Dumnarth, died today. He will be greatly missed.Insulted my wife by calling her gluttonous and a monster when it comes to table manners. I shall not be doing that again.It is done. Duke Arsewipe finally had his last breath on August 1st, 1101 at the age of 69. I can now go to my grave a happy man.At the age of 72, Earl Cadoc of Cornwall died after a period of illness on November 2nd, 1103. He succeeded in his goal of outlasting his mortal enemy.Rest In Peace, Earl Cadoc of Cornwall. "

												I suppose that now that I've logged over 1,000 hours playing Crusader Kings 2 I should carve out a little time to say that this is demonstrably my favorite game of all time (by a factor of five, if you're curious).  There are 16,000 other reviews that will give you more details of what's great and what's not about the game, but let me just add that I have never found a game that better simulates  internal  political conflict within a country.  Think about it: you play most ""great"" strategy games like Civilization, and you'd think that nations were made up of uniform automatons - the worst it gets there is some city riots because you didn't build enough ""Happiness"" buildings.  In CK2 your vassal rulers are individuals, with their individual ambitions and characteristics, and they can be a real pain to manage - sometimes they fight with one another, sometimes they fight with you, and ultimately it's about who's got the most leverage.  The only difference between CK2 politics and modern democratic politics is that ""leverage"" in the 12th century is usually counted in swords; besides that, the backstabbing and intriguing is pretty indistinguishable.  A strong king, just like a strong president, is one who dominates their internal foes so that they can in turn dominate their external ones.That simple innovation is what's made this my all-time favorite game, the one I've been coming back to year after year.  Add to that a dedicated modding community that let's you play out the same internal/external conflict in Game of Thrones, Ancient Rome, or Warhammer, and, well, you've got at least a thousand hours of fun ahead of you.

												Crusader Kings II is an exceptional game in that no other title will make you feel like a ruler as well as it. You're not just a country, like in other grand strategy games. You are a ruler with qualities, flaws, vices and virtues. You can be a Duke who is a brilliant diplomat with a hunchback, an ugly, stuttering dimwit count, or a mastermind plotter/lesbian queen. (I'm NOT making it up). And you can be all that within in a single playthrough, as you re-incarnate into your heir when you die. You have to be good at managing your realm, but you've got to be even better at managing your dynasty by arranging favourable marriages, assassinate pretenders... It's all very involving and requires a lot of micro-management (which you may or may not like).It's not without flaws: the interface could see much improvement and the game starts to slow down when you become powerful. By slow down, I don't mean that your computer has a hard time coping, I mean that there are many more events that require your constant attention, making things move at a slower pace. To be honest, after several hundred hours, I think I'm a bit burned with the game. And that, even though there are entire DLCs I haven't really explored yet: I have only really played as a Catholic or Muslim ruler, but DLCs let you play as pagans, Orthodoxes, republics...And then there are a couple of Mods that are probably worth exploring as well: ""Game of Thrones"" and ""Tamriel"" (from the Elder scrolls series)Still, with so much content and the unbeatable feeling of being an actual Middle-Ages ruler, it's hard to rate CKII anything lower than a 9 out of 10.

												This is a good game.A fantastic game, even. To my knowledge it's never really been done before (besides crusader kings I, obviously)It's incredibly entertaining. You can do some absolutely hilarious thingsIs it worth 40 USD? Of courseDoes it cost 40 USD? Not quiteScroll upSee that 'Downloadable content for this game' section? Click see all.Scroll downYes, 194.49 218.46 USD. That's how much DLC is in this game. Remember all those youtube videos you watched? Remember how fun it looked? I can guarantee you most of the entertaining features you saw in that video are going to cost you at least another 5 USD each. Remember seeing that youtuber raiding england and pillaging all the churches as a viking warrior? 15 USD. Remember seeing them ruling mediterranean trade as the venetian republic? 10 USD. Remember how they conquered all of europe for the caliphate? 10 USD. Remember how they united india under one glorious empire? 15 USD. Remember how they designed their own character to conquer europe with? 5 USD.Remember how not all of the different nationalities looked exactly the same? That's going to cost you another 2 USD per portrait set. Remember how not all of the units looked exactly the same? 2 USD per unit set. Remember all of that different music in the background? That's going to set you back as wellIt's a great gameWould it be worth 40 USD? YesIs it worth 234.48 258.45 USD? No. Not at all. Which is why I couldn't possibly recommend itNow, if there were a way to play the full game without spending hundreds of your hard-earned (insert currency here), then it would be a different story...(EDIT) If you can catch it on a 75% sale like what's on until the 5th of october then that's a solid deal, just know that the 'collection' doesn't include all of the DLCs like you'd be forgiven for assuming			"

												This used to be my favorite game ever. I have hundreds of hours logged into this game. I even loved crusader kings 1. But Paradox has decided to let some no talent idiots take control of the Crusader Kings 2 project. Essentially they have repalced the main development team and the vision of the game has drastically changed. I have almost all the DLC's for this game and have spent quite a bit of money on it and NOW they start ruining it? Instead of giving us new things to conquer or new characters to interact with or new cool things to do they have decided just to make the old things harder and more annoying. Between conclave and the proposed black death dlc the developers are severely limiting game play by injecting annoying, illogical and unrealistic events into the game. People already plotted to rebel and acquire power for themselves but conclave made it easier for them. There were already illnesses that caused quite a bit of devastation in the game so the new DLC is proposed to maximize that already annoying situation. What fun is that going to be?? Well let me tell you it will be about as fun as micromanaging all your vassals is in Conclave. Basically none. The UI and real time mode of game play severely limit micromanagement oppurtunities.I am very unhappy with the direction crusader kings 2 is going with the dlc's and I will no longer be purchasing them. But even that doesn't stop the new jerk developers because they patch in idiotic things like broken retreat into the game whether you like it or not. I have quite a bit of money wrapped up in this game and the jerks have made it unplayable. The developers are so arrogant and foolish they don't even make their stupid new rules optional. This is what happens when you don't allow negative feedback on your forums and fill it with bootlicking yes men. They pretty much ban anybody who makes the slightest criticisms of their games on their forums. Don't believe me go and see. Screw you paradox. No more money for you.			"

However since learning to play EU4/CK2, all I can think of while playing other strategy games is ""Why isn't this game as good as the♥♥♥♥♥♥Paradox makes?"". The gameplay is so deep and so enjoying with Grand Strategy Games like CK2 that I almost regret picking it up. I sometimes wish I hadn't open Paradox's box of terrors and maybe I could've lived in ignorance and enjoyed Rome 2, Civ and Beyond Earth. But sadly, I did.Beware:Buying this game may ruin all other games in the strategy genre for you.Ignorance is bliss.			"

												Playing virtually any dynasty in this game, big or small, feels like trying to balance on top of a ball on top of another ball. Just when you hit that sweetspot your leader dies, and you fall and have like 30 seconds to have the new guy get up there and figure out how to not lose his balance or else it's game over; or atleast a gut-wrentching downsize.If you bought the game and can't figure it out, play a small dynasty several times through. I've always been interested in Italian history so I played several games as the Duke of Ferrara starting in the late medieval era (1337ad) who controls only two counties. Starting in 1337ad makes it so your technology, baronies, temples and cities are universally well developed, meaning you can concentrate on learning the rules of medieval rulership and how they apply to the game and acheiving your goals for the playthrough. For your own game, try playing as a few different powerful leaders and then as a few weak ones so that you see the difference in player control over your realm.I've now gone back to 867ad Italy, with the Duke of Tuscany, Adelberto Bonifazi. The king of Italy, a foreign invader from the Karling Dynasty of France is leige to the 5 major Italian duchies, and is moderately respected within Italy. Europe is divided from west to east by three different Karling Kings, and the throne of Italy is up for grabs within their house. It makes for fantastic storytelling of italian unification, or fragmentation (which is more consistant with the history books). Find any dynasty that tugs at your fairytale strings and you'll create the adventure yourself. You compile your own ruleset for winning, and you'll play again and again to get it 'just right'. You are allowed to pick and choose from a wonderful list of histrorical characters from the 760's through the 1300's (more with DLC). You might even find yourself on wikipedia learning about how europe, northern africa and western asia used to work. Once you are briefly educated on succession laws, title claimancy, and holy war you'll be well on your way to taking Rome for the Byzantine empire and converting all Christians to Orthodox and thus resolving the great schism, or perhaps you'll begin as a small vassal, in control of a single county and have your progeny expand and reclaim The Holy Roman Empire. Or maybe you'll just want to keep a small duchy in Italy safe from foreign invasion generation after generation and keep your family safe at all costs. It is at its core a sandbox game. You create the goals, you amend them, the world changes drastically, your position changes, there's an opening, the window closes, alliances are broken, new friends arrive at court to save the day, and eventually you forget what the original goal of winning was to begin with. You watch and contribute to the story as generations of genetic triumphs and failures are constantly bickering, warring, dieing, plotting, changing sides for no good reason, and are also generally trying to make sure you don't have a larger army than they do. Don't forget about all the neighbors, who are convinced that they would be better suited to rule in your lands than you are.There are a thousand pitfalls to success in CK2 as there surely were in the more noble times, so always learn from your mistakes and try again. Use google. And always have enough gold to hire an appropriately sized mercenary army and pay them for 12 months. Always. Eight hour playthroughs that fall because of premature spending will remind you of that. Keep your neighbor rulers in the character watch list, keep a constant eye on beneficial marriages, and constantly scan the character find sheet for potential courtiers that would join your court and could serve as councilmembers. Remember that the safety of the family is top priority, so always be able to defend yourself, be it through your own army, your vassals or your alliance's, but never have a substantially smaller force than the neighbors or vassals. That will always spell game over. And lastly, please try to remember at all times that those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it.			"

												I will not talk about how Crusader King II compares to other strategy games on the market because it wouldn't be fair to them. You do not compare a Picasso with children drawings from school. Students have to do quick flashy drawings for good grades, and do them as often as they can, with accent on flashy rather than on detail. Crusader Kings II is a game that puts the accent more on detail, quality rather than quantity.The game itelf may feel a bit hard to understand at first, but if you give it a moment of your time, it will surprise you. But buyer be warn, if you just wanna play a game where you plug in, then all you do is fancy easy war TW style, or EUIV, then better avoid CK2. Crusader Kings II requires the player to think, quite a bit actually, and consider choices and plan ahead, sometimes for a few decades. It is a real strategy game, and as such it is a gem, since I do not think there is another game on the market that challenges you truly at this level and in such a complex way.Why is it challenging? Well for one, you need to plan your dynasty, you need to plan your marriages to seek advantages and gains, secure the blood line, be wary of who will you end up playing next, and after that, manage your vassals, manage alliances which can only be made through marriage, manage your holdings so you can have more income and troops, manage your realm to pick laws which will either upset or make your vassals happy, or play nice to your liege if you are not independent, watch over your armies when you raise them, pick terrain carefully as it matters quite a bit, be carefull who you put in charge of your armies, watch over you flanks, be carefull what troops you use when, since the holding they come from gives them bonuses, plan your technological advancements, mind religion, convert, play the cardinal game, expand, go on crusades, plot to murder your enemies, to revoke titles, fabricate claims, and so much more.You think that list is big? Its small, even more so, get a mod from the Paradox Forums, and you can get 2-3 times more features, some mods even take you to other worlds, use maps from settings you know and love and add a ton of events and new features. The ammount of depth this game and its modding community offer is mind boggling. Crusader Kings 2 is the Skyrim of Strategy Games. Its got depth, its got versatility, its got deep modability, its a gem.And trust me, nothing compares to the feel you get, when after starting as a Count, you end up an Emperor for the first time...UPDATE: 2 years and a lot of DLCs later... This game is killing my free time still. To date the most addictive game in my life. I've never spent so much time over so many years on the same game...			"

												This game has so many different narratives it's amazing, it's essentially a book where you're the author yet you're also the reader. What follows is a pretty epic series of events, I'm not the greatest writer but I love this story.Through much  political intrigue and disease alike, Queen Cumman of Eire (Ireland) sat on the throne. She had four children.Her eldest daughter, Muirne, married a king of Scotland who shortly after died in battle against the English. The king's brother inherited the throne and offered his hand in marriage to Muirne. Her Ambition made the choice for her. Five children later, she died in childbirth at 32. Her youngest daughter, Tuathflaith, was born Ugly and through her upbringing, became Deceitful and Gluttonous. No man desired her and so she resides in her mother's court. Through her many pleas to be married to have a family, Queen Cumman is considering one of her many courtiers for an arranged marriage. Her eldest son, Cathal, the twin of Muirne, was taught as a child by Tressach, the Marshal of Eire, a Brawny man who none could equal in tournaments. He grew up to replace his mentor as Eire's Marshal but not for long. The Queen named him as the Duke of Ulaidh, a territory of four provinces including the county of Ulaidh. Her youngest son, Aedgen, wasn't taught in hand to hand combat yet excelled his siblin on the battlefield as a  Brilliant Strategist. Through his desire for land, the Queen entitled him to the county of Ulaidh, essentially the capital of the duchy of Ulaidh. Cathal had declared independence from his mother to create the Kingdom of Ulaidh, to the Queen's surprise. Although not on his own terms, Aedgen joined him. However their relationship with their mother did not change such was their loving relationships. Years passed and King Cathal became consumed by his power. He was now known as Cathal the Tyrant. Having enough and seeking reformation, Prince Aedgen had declared a revolution against his brother. The timing was perfect as Cathal's troops were abroad in Wales attempting to expand his territory. However he had not anticipated Cathal sending a crow to the Queen of Eire who came to stop the rebellion. She had turned a blind eye to Cathal's method of reign, he was her eldest son and heir after all. Although the Queen was old she was a warrior at heart and so met Aedgen on the battlefield.  The rebellion was destroyed in an instant.King Cathal had thrown his brother in the dungeon for a few years despite his mother's pleas to release him. Eventually Cathal had offered to ransom Aedgen for 46 gold to his mother. A ransom for his brother to his own mother. She accepted immediately although not as fast as she realized King Cathal wasn't the same Cathal she had raised. Previouslly unbenknownst to her, she discovered that he had even renounced the Lord, following instead the cult of Waldensian who were heretics of the Church. Queen Cumman made a heavy decision that very same day. She declared war in the name of not only Christianity or her Kingdom, but for her own family. She had petitioned the King of Scotland (the same one, who had now married one of the Queen's kinswomen) for aid to which they accepted without question. Cathal the Tyrant's men were raised. The Queen ordered only her own men to gather, leaving her vassal's men to defend their territories. The Scottish were rallying but it would take them months to arrive. King Cathal the Tyrant marched from their capital, leading 4300 men, half of which were heavy infantry. He was accompanied by a Waldensian priest. The Queen's men of 4458 also marched. Queen Cumman decied there was only one man who, in every right, should lead her army. Prince Aedgen. Her faithful commanders, Mugron and Tressach (the very same man who mentored Cathal), secured his flanks. The two armies met on the plains in Bréifne. This clash would decide the dynasty of Eire. The battle of Ceann Lios was about to begin.SO this story is unfinished because I just had to write about this in a review. I've literally paused the same just as they're about to fight and I'm about to resolve it xD I was controlling the Queen in all of this but everything else occurred because of the game, nothing is scripted and that's what makes the game so amazing. It's a great strategy. At the time of writing, I've logged 39 hours and I bought this game four days ago D:TLDR : If you like grandy strategy and diplomacy, this game is really for you. You don't get to control anything within a battle when it commences (well you can retreat) but watching the events in the battle screen is equally as thrilling as fights in Total War.			"

												I never played this game before. I bought it on a sale with a hole bunch of what looked like a millian DLCs and had it sitting in my library for quite some time. At some point I decided to pick it up and give it a try. Since I like playing the underdogs I decided I'd try to create a Buddhist World Empire. So I picked some random Buddhist dude on the top right corner of the map, designed a nice flag for him, browsed briefly thru the hair styles and gave him some nice sounding name. And there I was, a new Buddhist Lord in the year of 769. Boy was i confused. So damn much was going on and I didn't understand half of it. I soon found out that I had picked a guy who was the vassal of some other Buddhist lord. It took me about 30 years, but within my first character I was able to marry my lords daughter. My first character did nothing more then that, he just waited until he finally died so his son could take over. After that it was a ever so slowly progression. The more I learned how to play, the better it was. Slowly and steady I extended my new Buddhist Empire, taking over county by county, then losing half of them again to my brother the moment a transition from one leader to his son happened. Rinse and repeat. The bigger I grew, the more I understood the importance of keeping my vassals happy. I tried to adopt. A few times I had to reload because my empire had been torn apart by revolution. It took me about 200 years, until 800 something, until I felt ready to extend to the north. So I slowly took over the Tengri region above me. This worked out fine. I spend some time mixing up the bloodlines, dealing with revolts and stuff, until I finally had something of an stable empire. Now the only way to grow was to the west, into the Arabian empires. I had to reload some times and figure out the best time and approach. I seeded revolutions over there and struck just when they where hit hard by multiple regions braking into independence. This went on for a couple of years, slowly extending county for country into Muslim area. Each time I had conquered a country I did my best to convince the leader to convert to Buddhism, eventually, and very forcefully, spreading the word of the Buddha to the west. By this time I felt pretty confident that I could extend all the way to the Indian regions, where some bits and peaces of Buddhism where still existing. My dream of a big Buddhist World Empire was closer then ever. Boy was I wrong. In the year 1220 a huge army of Mongolian forces arrived and stood all of the sudden right in the power center of my empire. I was, at that time, able to round up a total of almost 11.000 men, a number I had seen increasing over the past 100 years and was incredibly proud of. The Mongols landed with something around between 50.000 and 70.000 men. I gave up fighting withing the first year. I was thrown into prison and most of my direct holdings where taken from me. My Buddhist Empire that I had been so fond of was forcefully integrated into the much larger Mongolian Empire. After some years I was demanded to change my religion to Hindu, which I did with great reluctance. Struggling to survive I tried to marry myself or one of my hires into the Mongolian Empire, but since they where Hindus alone the “Not the same caste” message killed me of. Nether the less I managed to keep my bloodline alive and seed some of them into the Mongolian Empire. I took some of my titles back and could at the very least keep my little Buddhist Kingdom, even thou the Tengri Part was lost for good, since the Khagan himself had inherited that title . I did some attempts of murder, but had no backers and mostly just ended up begin “politely” asked to drop it. I even tried to reclaim the title by force, when I saw a huge stack of 80.000 armies pass thou my land and into India, figuring I might have the time to win this war before they could reach me. I was wrong. So I ended the game as I had started it: a pitiful, meaningless nobody in some little remote state, that had given up his believe and lost every bit of his power to a greater leader.I bow before you, game. I enjoyed every single hour of this almost 60 hour game. I regret nothing. Next time I have so much more I know, I might even not fail as bad. Or even more – who knows. Next I' ll try to conquer the world with some Afrikan Empire...			"

												Actually, this is not a grand strategy game, but rather an RPG.When you are about eighty, when your face represents a bloody scar from cancer, when all your kids and your dear husband have deceased in the war or of sickness, even your only friend with whom you were used to play chess has passed away, and when nobody believes that you are able to last another year, but quite the contrary, they begin to reach out their paws for your titles and your collection of pictures, which you have been gathering your whole life –all of a sudden you start writing poetry, retire more and more often to your chamber lost in prayers and reading the Bible, that remained from your father to whom you owe literally everything, and then you catch your second wind, go to victorious war against nearby empire and conquer its capital, undertake a succession law reform on a surge of popular jubilation and become a true leader of the boiling, transforming society;and once during the night walk in the distant abandoned corners of your garden you face a cheeky kitten going to become your new and last friend.

												This is by far the most accessible of the Grand Strategy Games that Paradox has made. A wonderfully convoluted game, where you define your goals and the means to achieve them. Be warned, you learn this game by playing it, gradually blooming into one of the most magnificent machiavellian meanies (darn you, profanity filter) the world has ever seen. Rewrite history as you see fit, Scheme and plot, command armies and then laugh at your demise at the hands of your subjects, your enemies, your supposed friends, your children and the wonderfully cruel winds of change and chance.But be warned, this game does not provide you with a goal aside from survival of your dynasty. Do you wish to unite Ireland and then subjugate the heathens that currently hold Jerusalem? How about bringing forth the downfall of the Holy Roman Empire as just a lowly Count of France? Or maybe you really just want to make that one guy pay who plotted the death of your insane, crippled and infirm Court Jester? Do what you want and suffer the consequences.All in all, this game is ripe with dark humour and seems to be easy at first. But it deceives you, sucking you in and suddenly gripping you by the balls, as you die from consumption, your son gets killed in a crusade and your remaining heir turns out to be gay, possessed and a complete lackwit, all while your allies drag you into wars and your vassals rise up in arms against you.So, laugh at the cruel twists of fate, or grow mad from the revelation. Or maybe just enjoy a quiet, uneventful life as a lowly vassal to better lords.			"

												Good stuff, maybe even the best work of Paradox...But sometimes really unfair (in ironman) e.g.:- started as the count of Nassau- asked the pope for a claim of the duchy of francia - managed to become the duke of francia. - PROBLEM: the family of the former duke had still their counties and were in the position of heritage.- imprisoned and killed all of them, children, women and men.- became a tyrann- Due to feudal election east francia seperated from its former kingdom of west francia.- weak king always lost wars against his neighbors and my own duchy was in high danger- I was way stronger than my king and declared war for the crown- after a few fights the stand of war was 99% - won the last battle- BUT my duke got improisoned=> lost the war imediatly- king took almost all of my counties back- regent refused to buy me out of prison - died imprisoned- the last few counties were split up- lost it, took my mouse threw it at the wall- girlfriend said I was insane - I explained myself to her - she left...10/10 would rebel again "

												* Started as a random count in Ireland in the 8th century. * By 800 I had become King of Ireland. * By 1000 I had established the Empire of Britain. * By 1100 I had conquered all of France. * By 1150 I had taken control of all of Italy and crowned myself Holy Roman Emperor. * By 1160, I had launched a war on the Byzantine Empire, won, installed a Catholic on the Byzantine throne and by 1190 the Orthodox Church had been completely eradicated.* By 1200 I had inherited the Byzantine Empire after marrying its Empress, and promptly established myself as the true Roman Emperor. * By the game's end, the Irish Roman Empire controls the entirety of Western Europe and North Africa all the way up to Lithuania, Somalia and Persia, has entirely reversed the Arab conquests and seized control of Mecca and Medina (confining the Muslims to Eastern Arabia and Pakistan), and has even established several trade posts in India, effectively beginning the colonial period several hundred years early. Technology is incredibly advanced, heresies are spreading like wildfire and nobody really seems to care, so effectively the Enlightenment has begun several hundred years early as well. To top it all off, Iceland, the British Isles, most of France, most of North Africa and most of Hungary are now fully Irish.This is just one of the things you can do in this game. Just one.Do I recommend?YES.(Lag gets a bit bad in the late game, apparently because all the Greek characters are using up processing power trying to figure out who they can castrate out of all the characters in the game. Yes, you read that right - the game runs slow because the Greeks are trying to castrate the entire world. Other than that simultaneously annoying and hilarious problem, the game is great!)			"

												I had a Slavic count take my daughter once. To retaliate, I took his wife and two 15 year old daughters. After his daughters ripened, I made them and his wife my concubines. In a fit of rage, I then took over all of Scandinavia. After living to the ripe old age of 101, my character died in battle. Playing as his grand-nephew due to elective, I imprisoned the daughters, wife, and the children my former character had sired on them. After waiting another 7 years, I took the children of the concubines as MY concubines. I eventually had my bloodline ruined due to incest.10/10 would concubine again.			"

After that, I haven't put it down.Its challenging, fun, but not at all a game you can really get through in an evening.  Not at all for the casual ""I'll pick this up, skip the tutorials and master the game"" style of gamer.  Spend some time, learn the game and if you like strategy mixed with RPG mixed with the desire to conquer the world, this game is for you.Link to the Beginner's Guide I mentioned above:https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/25w95c/the_oh_my_god_im_new_help_guide_for_beginners/ "

												I went from a Count to a Duke, got married, had childeren, even managed to marry off my daughter to the 3rd in line to the throne and let her keep her name.Then civil war broke out over the crown between the king and his eldest son, I fought for the king and beat back the forces on all fronts except one ( The king and his army were there, so i assumed they would take care of things )But tragically the king died in battle, which left his heir and recent enemy of the crown to become rightful ruler over the lords and lands in the kingdom, concluding the war and putting me in the bad books for taking his farthers side.I decided to rebel, in hopes of being able to give my son in law and now 2nd in line to the throne the crown.The war waged on for many many years and took it's toll on everyone involved.The kingdom was split in half, the West fighting to rid the evil tyrant and the East fighting back with every thing the crown had, but it was not enough, the king's forces were pushed all the way back to the capitol.I was quick to gather more troops from the few of my vassals that were able to help.These were tough times on the kingdom, after so many years of war the kingdom's financial state was in tatters, the lords  were struggling to keep their provinces under controll while fighting off the mass hordes of troops invading their lands.But i knew the moment we had fought so hard for was close at hand.I launched a seige on the capitol with the few hundred troops i had left, the seige lasted over half a year before my forces managed to break through and begin the assault on the castle.It was a bloodshed, an absolute massacre, the king and all his men and been defeated but not before i had lost over 3/4 of my army in the attack.But the war was over, the new King had taken the throne and peace had come to the land.After all the years the kingdom spent in turmoil, only a couple of faces were familiar from the begining.most of these lords are the sons and descendants of those that rode with me against the prince before he became king.Many of their fathers fell in the war but they continued the fight for them.As the years pass following the over throwing of the old king, The lords and houses fight and conspire against one another but nothing major happens within the realm until the king, my son in law and father of my grandson, becomes ill.Shortly after he passes from his illness, many of the lords start to question my grandsons right to rule.A few small rebellions start over in the far east end of the kingdom.My son, heir to my lands and house, rides east to meet the rebels in battle.he defeats three of the rebellions before lossing the battle and his life at the fourth.With only my grandson to carry on the family name, i try my best to gather enough troops to march over the rebels and stop them from usurping the throne.All my effort is wasted tho as the young king mysteriously dies from causes unknown.I spend last years of my life fighting against the kings that come and go, only to fall victim to a event that causes me to be a paraplegic and die alone and incapable of doing anything.10/10 would feel like it was all for nothing again			"

												One of the best games I've ever played. It looks like a historical strategy game: a large real-world map to play on, countries to control, lands to conquer, etc. But don't be fooled. It is actually a “life simulation game"". You have a country (or part of it), but what you really play is a dynasty, or family. You rule, you fight, you want to see the death of your regent, you kill, you murder, you have parties, you make friends, you meditate, you do business, you love your wife, or make wild loves with your lovers, you have enemies, you are supported by your vessels, you travel around the world, you educate your children, you become the king, you are defeated on the battlefield, you lose your titles, you are nobody again, you are old, you die, you leave nothing but chaos to your sons. You go over the rises and falls of the family, interact with everyone around, and play your particular part in everyone's own story. There are tens of thousands characters in the virtually living world, everyone with his or her own life being written. Sadly you can never have sufficient energy to learn every unique story! This is one of the best games I've ever played, definitely top 5. It depicts every shining and awkward, elegant and wretched moment of a normal medieval noble guy. 12/10Those who give only 11/10, you guys are so mean.			"

												Endless replayability. CKII may take a while to get into, but once you learn about most, if not all game features, you'll find countless things you can do or try to achieve. Story unfolds itself, because while there is no narrative or script, your actions and actions of others really change the world and characters around your dynasty. Vast personal traits and characteristics that every single one character in game can have make up the story, as their actions are mostly defined by the personalities they have.			"

												Quite simply one of the greatest strategy games ever made.From the outset - Crusader Kings is not for everyone. It will be best enjoyed by people who are interested in deep systems and the interplay between them. Those seeking a way to crack the ""optimal"" way to play, and those seeking to ""win"" will be disappointed, whereas those seeking emergent systems and effects will enjoy hundreds of hours of discovery. It is therein that lies CK2's greatest strength - creating a narrative through emergent systems.Crusader Kings II relies largely on the player setting their own goals and then working towards them. Be they immediate goals, medium term aspirations, or long term dreams, a large part of CK2's appeal lies in pondering how best to ""exploit the code"" to reach your ends. In fact, the best way to play CK2 is not to play to win, but to let the game ""happen""; to let your dynasty's fortune ebb and flow with the passage of time, creating a narrative of a family streching across the centuries. Crusader Kings 2 is a game that you can sink literally hundreds of hours into and still find out new and exciting things to do. CK2 isn't a perfect game; the learning curve can be steep, particularly for those new to the genre, and the presentation is a little short of the cutting edge. But, with a fantastic level of developer support, continual free and paid content additions, hundreds of mods, and a lively, friendly and supportive community, it is fair to say that CK2 is one of the greatest strategy games of all time and, for strategy fans, possibly one of the greatest games of all time. For this writer with over 30 years of gaming behind him and hundreds of hours on the game (mostly on the Gamersgate version), it's certainly cracked the Top Ten!			"

												Below are two versions of my review...  Angry Rant	 I'm tired of all these DLCs and their inflated prices. The content added often brings new depth to the game, but frequently has features that we shouldn't have to pay for. I'm looking at you Ruler designer! Also you dirty portrait, unit and music packs should be ashamed of yourselves for existing! If you look at other game companies, they often give comparable content for free as an update. At the very base of it, I'm sick of all this piece meal DLC. I can understand expansions increasing the longevity of the game, but seriously Horse Lord's cost is 37.5% of the price of the base game. And don't you lie to me and say that any of these expansions add enough content to justify their price. Most of these are just paid unlocks, not anything ""expansive"". Also don't talk to me about steam sales, the most recent releases only get 35% off. For Horse Lords, that's roughly 5 dollars, whoopee do. By the time, we get a substantial ""deal"" on any DLC, it's often way down the line and Paradox has already churned out another one. All of this means two plainly disappointing facts. You'll pay considerably to have a complete and current content version of any Paradox game and that when a new game releases it's evident you're only getting a bare bones version of the eventual game. However, I know that nothing will change as long as people keep apathetically buying the product. And so this 'just another ranting guy on the internet' is going to reach into his wallet, pull out his credit card and buy the next ""grand"" expansion for CK2 because oh well, right?  Slightly More Rational Rant I'd prefer that more game developers learn from CD Projekt. Witcher 3, as an example, has become incredibly successful and it doesn't require a smattering of DLC to be enjoyable. I have no problem with additional content coming out after the base game's release, but it shouldn't take away the enjoyment from the base game. At some point just make a new game and quit selling us content piece by piece. Ck2 is an incredible game, but suffers from the DLC making the base game unappealing by itself. I didn't want to buy this game for the longest time because of the now classic DLC approach. I can understand that, after 4+ Years, having at most 6 expansions costing $5 to $10 could be reasonable especially if the base game was more fleshed out to start. However, the existing cluster pile of DLC acts as a major turn off for players. It creates the feeling of having to pay for the basic structure of the game and to flesh it out. At this point, we're not judging whether Paradox will make a good game, but how much it will cost us to enjoy every bit of it. I honestly enjoy Paradox games and I hope to enjoy more in the future. Just as usual if you purchase any of their games remember to be patient, wait for sales and slowly navigate the DLC barrier without letting it kill your wallet.UPDATE 4/10/16:With the release of Mare Nostrum, It's evident that Pardox Interactive is trying to milk their games in increasing fashion. This is pitiful and doesn't show well for the future of Hearts of Irons 4, Stellaris and their other franchises. These are good quality games being subjected to obnoxious pay walls. Paradox makes base games that are just good enough to entice people to buy multitudes of DLC fillers which in the end ruins consumer enjoyment. Paradox knows what it's doing and all of their community streams and involvements are distractions to make us buy into a friendly exterior and therein be consoled into buying their products. The only action I'd want them to take is in their DLC practices. If you're going to sell us the game piece by piece then at least make it more worthwhile. Combine the cosmetic and music packs into their corresponding  main DLC expanisions then lower the prices to $9.99 and lower. You may think you'll lose far too much profit this way or that your efforts are underrepresented at such prices, but you'll have both a greater purchasing base and a longer lasting franchise to milk if you do this. If the reason prices are so high is because not enough people are buying the product then this solution would solve that problem in the long term. If you have merely caluclated that you can sell at these unreasonable prices and still make a hefty profit then whoever made that decision should be fired. Our else, your company will be crushed under the boot of companies like Sega, who specifically has turned CA and Relic Entertainment into DLC producing Cash Cows that take all the heat.Your CEO has stated you're undergoing the IPO process, therefore you'll be an option for buyout within a year or two. The gaming industry is full of puppeted developers straddled by larger publishing corporations that use them as proxy moneymakers without taking any real accountablity. You're on a path that will be your undoing; please become something better, Paradox, not something so pitiful and so often seen with developers.			"

What is Crusader Kings 2?Explaining what Crusader Kings 2 is is difficult. There are 9 ""Major"" DLC""s for this game, which add as much content as the base game, and drastically opens the game. So what Crusader Kings 2 is, greatly depends on which DLC""s you get. What this game is though at its core, is a real time strategy game set in the medieval era's, the base game is from 1066 to 1453. The DLC's The Old Gods and Charlemagne allow for a start date of 867 and 769, respectively, allowing for over 700 years of game-play through the early dark ages, all the way to the beginning of the Rennaissance period. You can start playing as a Duke of a few provinces, under a King. A King, or an Emperor. Through this time, you will be restricted by realistic ""rules and laws"" which governed the world at that time as you balance your lands among your vassals, and family. Keeping the Feudal system together, your people happy, and making sure vassals don't revolt, is much tougher than you'd think. You could start off as a King with 40 Vassals, 70 counties, and countless castles in your control, and in 200 years, find yourself owning nothing more than a half disseveled castle in a province nobody cares about, having lost your seat on the throne, to an usurping vassal who got the better of you. Or you could find yourself in the same situation in reverse, having bested your King on the field of battle, and taking the throne for your own. Holy Wars, cultural differences. Supporting, and or working against your King, or Emperor, vassalizing near by independent rulers, and sometimes, even attempting assassinations against your own family, are all things which you may need to do, to keep your next of heir securely in line for the throne, and your current holdings and estates safely in the family. The game revolves, not around the country, but your family. In Medieval ages, your family ""house"" is whats important. As your current ruler dies, you will take direct control of the next of heir of your house, and they will gain the titles which the laws of your country allow depending on succession laws. The politics are setup pretty realistically to how it was in those days as well. Marrying off a daughter is what made alliances, nothing else. (Not 100% accurate, but damn close enough to be considered ""historical""). Succession laws of how your children are allowed to take the throne, greatly impacts your future as well. All in all if you love Medieval history, and want to learn more about how it worked, this game will teach you things you never knew. If you own Europa Universalis IV, there is a converter which you can get for Crusader Kings 2, Allowing you to convert the world exactly as it is from Crusader Kings 2, into Europa Universalis IV, allowing you to continue your reign of your Kingdom, as you move from the Medieval ages, into the age of Rennaissance and exploration.  There is no game that has better replayability than Crusader Kings 2. I have played nearly 400 different games, and have over 1000 hours in this game. (Before I got it on steam), and not a single one of my games has been remotely close to playing out like any other. -------------------The DLC'sI know there are some upheavels about the amount of DLC's, and some people screaming bloody murder and cash grab insults. I have to beg to differ, and I'd like to explain why if you're one of those people who have been hearing this. This game was released in Feb, 14th of 2012. That's 4 years as of this year in 2016. In those 4 years, Paradox has released 9 ""Major"" DLC's, which open the game up tremendously, and add in depth mechanics, new events, and great game changes, all of which are superb. (You can tell if it's a ""Major"" DLC if the price is over 1.99) These DLC's are not ""DLC's"", they are the equievalant of legit expansions from back in the day, when a developer would release an expansion to a game you had to pay for, which adds just as much as the base game originally had. The Old Gods for instance, allows you to play as the Pagans. All with their own 100's of new events for both pagan and non pagan leaders, new mechanics for the pagans, and opens the game up tremendously in that area, as well as pushing the start date back another 200 years. The Republic expansoin does, well what you think. Allows you to play as a Merchant Republic, such as Venice, AND allows any leader to setup a Merchant Republic within their own country, which greatly increases gold income. Playing as a Merchant Republic is vastly different than playing as a feudal lord, and is yet again another major expansion, adding 100's of new events, entirely new different type of game-play to play around if you're playing as a Merchant Republic, etc. The list goes on for every single one of those 9 ""Major"" DLC's. None of which are a rip off in anyway for the price because of how much each add to the game as a whole.  So what about those countless 1.99 stuff? This is where I can understand if people say ""cash grab"", however I personally would still disagree to some extent simply because being an Indie developer myself, I understand the work that does need to be put in to make it viable. Albeit it still isn't much work over all. The 1.99 little DLC's which change sprites on the map, or allow for more family house crest art to personally change, etc. its over all cheap, and it's entirely up to you to buy it or not. They however in no way take away from the game by not having them, and are all cosmetic. The ones I personal like are the ones which change the look of the people and their outfits, etc. to fit the time and appearance they'd of had for that culture and area in the world a bit more than the stock game. These are all very cheap however, 1.99 to about 3.99, depending on how much it adds, but all of which are about 10x cheaper than going to the movies, which only nets you 1 hour of annoyance while you try to enjoy it, and people decide now is a good time to be loud and annoying.. I'd rather pay the 7 small DLC's for the same price and fully enjoy it for the rest of my life... Step aside movies..			"

												Iam sorry Paradox, but i have to write this now. I realy like Crusader Kings II, as i played nearly 300 Hours and many more on a non-steam Version. You can have fun with these games, spend hour after hour with it. I will not say the game is bad or not worth a bit of money...but there is a big argument against this game, or i would say against the DLC-Policy of Paradox. It is just insane how this is managed. Just take a look at the numbers...Steam tells me all DLC cost more than 270€ now. Okay lets say half of that is stuff you dont need, content packs etc...still 135€ plus the game for 40€. Iam no new player and played from the first years on and bought everything when it came out. But do you even know how stupid it is if you have friends just starting the game and telling them which DLC they need and stuff? They release a new DLC every few months with a few new things. Often they are good and iam very exited. But the are not everytime worth all the money. And they must be making alot of money thinking about the price. And i know...they say we put out new DLC to get some money to further develop the game and the game will get new content as long as the people buy the DLCs. Okay, that may sound good at first. But how do other game studios manage their stuff? Do they need to get out new DLC every few months for 15-25€(DLC+Contentpack)? NO. And that is almost the price of the whole game. And a DLC might bring some new stuff but not half of the game. So it is just too expensive.But it does not stop there. Iam a real Paradox-Freak you could say. I play almost all their big titles, Victoria, Europa Universalis, Stellaris, City Skylines, Hearts of Iron...you name it, i played hundreds of hours. And almost everywhere it is the same b*llsh*t!!! I want to play some Crusader Kings? Have to buy 2-3 DLCs to be on the newest Version. Stellaris the same. HoI4 the same. Skylines the same. What is that? I was so hyped about Stellaris. And the game was only half done, felt hollow and now they probably want to go the EU4 way and fix it over the years with tons of DLC. I just cant stand it anymore. After these many years iam frustrated and angry. I dont want to support this any longer. And what i hate the most about it, that maybe in a few months, i have some money, theres a sale and i will buys this freakin DLC anyway. BUT I HATE THEIR POLICY! AND I STILL WANT TO PLAY THAT STUFF! THEY GOT ME AND THEY USE ME! Combining all their game i probably payed them over 1000€ already. *Put a bad word here*!But they could do it differently. Why not bring out REAL DLC or a decent Add-On. Or Victoria 3. Where the hell is Victoria 3? Victoria was the best game they made in my opinion. But whatever. Someday Paradox will see that their way is the wrong way. Many people i know think the same. They are ruining these great games.tl;dr:If you are looking for an advice...the game is fun and you will probably like it. But Paradox has a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC-Policy. After a few years you will hate them, just like me. (I wrote almost the same Review for other Paradox Games. Everywhere the same Thing)			"

												Do you enjoy unintentionally (or intentionally...?) marrying your younger siblings to your elderly parents, or conspiring to murder every member of your family, in order to work your way onto the throne? No? Well good, as that probably means you're perfectly sane.However, if you enjoy hilarious occurrences such as this in video games, (especially when they're entirely unplanned!) as well as plenty of random events to help mix things up, I have no doubt that you'll enjoy Crusader Kings II; as CK2 is essentially a peek into the lives of medieval murderers, sex-fiends, club-footed harelip Dukes, as well as many more different combinations of humorously incapable royals inbreeding their way to glory!UPDATE: After a whole string of expansions came out since originally writing this review in Feb 2012, I've decided to re-write it and have added in the list below, containing some of the more essential expansions, as not all are necessarily required:LEGACY OF ROME - This pack adds retinues and factions. As I recall it originally got a bad rap as it didn't unlock additional regions of the map to the player (like Sword of Islam, for example), but these days it really is a staple expansion, and adds a lot to the game.THE OLD GODS - Vikings! And an early start date. Honestly, I feel that the Norse add enough that this is worth putting on the 'essentials' list, as it does shake things up a bit, from the standard 'European feudal lord' formula. Might want to get this after playing a game or two of CK2 though, as a regular feudal lord, perhaps.WAY OF LIFE - I might get flak from some people by putting this into the 'essential' list, but it adds a lot more to do, during peace time. Plus Paradox has fixed the Europe-wide orgy caused by the 'seduction' focus being super-powerful, so it's not as crazy as it was right after its initial release. (For better or for worse! :P )And now for a ""good to have, but maybe don't get it until you've played the game a few times"" list. (Rolls right off the tongue, eh?)SONS OF ABRAHAM - Adds more options, events, etc. for the three Abrahamic faiths (Christianity, Judaism and Islam). Solid expansion, but not strictly required. Good for a second playthrough, or if it's on-sale when you first buy/play the game.CONCLAVE - Kind of goes hand-in-hand with WoL above, I feel. Adds more to do (particularly during peacetime) as you're not the sole power within your realm, as your council will try and gradually curb your power and become a force to be reckoned with - so don't underestimate your councilors! Definitely adds a fair bit more difficulty though, as this expansion can result in a lot more civil wars occurring, if you aren't adept at ingame diplomacy and gaining favours, etc. so you may want to save this for your second playthrough.SWORD OF ISLAM - Makes Muslim rulers playable, and adds in decadence mechanics for them. Good for a second or third playthrough, after you have your fill of playing as a Christian.THE REPUBLIC - Same as SoI above, except it makes Republics playable. Adds in trading post mechanics (among others) for more money-making opportunities.REAPER'S DUE - This pack expands upon the existing disease mechanics, and makes the Black Death a very real threat! It also allows you to hire a court physician, who will then proceed to cut your leg off and/or gouge your eye out, in order to cure your cold. Fun expansion, but not essential.CHARLEMAGNE - This adds in a start date even earlier than TOG's start. Good if you want extremely long games that wind up taking a heavily alt-history route, but be aware that Europe will most likely be occupied by 4-5 huge blobs by 1066, so it might become a bit of a slog, late-game.RAJAS OF INDIA - OK if you want to play in India, but be warned that unless you get a huge, sprawling empire going, there won't actually be much (if at all) interaction between India and the rest of the game world. Really, I think they could've just made this into a separate game mode/campaign option.			"

												Since this is the game I played the most on Steam, I figured it was about time I reviewed it. Now, I don't approve Paradox DLC policy but I played my entire first game of about 90 hours as the empire of Britannia (All Hail Brittannia) without any DLC and the game was still very fun to play. So if the price of all the DLC scares you, give it a try without any DLC and, even once you decide to buy DLC, just get the one that you actually want. For example, I never even use the game music, I always just mute it and play my own playlist so I obviously won't ever get any of the songs DLC. That being said, even if the DLC do not scare you, this game is for hardcore strategy games fans. The first 5 hours of the game will be mostly you figuring everything out and theres really not much tutorials to help you out.If you can get past all that though, this is the most fun and deep strategy game I have ever played. There is almost nothing you can't do in this game. Wanna make your loyal little brother an anti-pope since the pope excommuniated you because the french king (who happens to be his best friend) really hate you? And then later go to war with that pope and make your little brother the official pope for every catholics. You can. I know you can do that cause I did. Wanna make your last born son your heir even though he has 6 older brothers because he has by far the best stats since he was born a genius. And then have to imprison all your other sons when they inevitably plot to murder him? You can. I know you can do that cause I did. Want to make Buddhist the official religion of everyone in Europe through war and oppression? You can. I know you can do that cause I did. History is yours to write however you want. Thats why I love this game.The game is also full of random events that always keep the game interesting. Hell, after almost 400 hours, I'm still running into random events that I hadn't seen before (it helps that Paradox sometimes add new ones.) So yeah, despite its flaws, this is my favorite game on Steam and I have no doubt that I will probably play another 400 hours of it eventually.Oh and by the way, when you start a new game, turn off shattered retreat and defensive pacts cause those really sucks and break the immersion. That patch was the worst idea Paradox ever had.			"

												Let's set things straight: this is one of the best Paradox game and probably my favourite one since it covers a period of time I like a lot and since it's less complex and tactical than other Paradox. It has got, instead, a great RPG component. An amazing mix which makes the game very addicting.Why the negative review? Because this game alone is almost nothing. It lets you play just a very small amount of countries. If you want the full game you must buy the DLCs... nothing new you could think. Well, the problem is there is a HUGE amount of DLCs and after years from the publishing of the main game they're still developing new one. They're getting always more useless, DLC after DLC, while the price gets higher (some of the last costs half the main game...LOL).As a loyal and old Paradox fan i get frustrated not only because they're obviously trying to get any cents out of my wallet, but mainly because after 4 (FOUR!) years I still can't enjoy the full game: whenever you start a new campaign (and a CK game can be pretty long and time consuming) they announce a new DLC with new features and new rules and you feel like you're playing an useless match and feel like abandoning it and wait for the new DLC. Problem is: when you get it, they have already announced a new one.Also, every DLC comes with patches which totally change the rules of the game and you have to learn them again and again and again. It's like playing an early access game, but I've always hated those and I would have avoided it if I had known.Basically they're policy with games lately has become: ""let's publish an incomplete game and let's charge a lot with DLCs if they want to play its full version"" and they're not the only company to do it, but when they finished the game they started to make useless DLCs (there's one of fantasy history in which aztecs invade Europe... which is not a great thing in a game of such historic realism) and to change the rules to worse just to justify new DLCs. They're literally to the point in which a great game is turning into a bad one.Saddest thing for a loyal customer like me was the DLC to convert CK2 games into EU4 games to continue a campaign there. So I, a huge fan who bought all of your games, get rewarded for this by being forced to pay 10 euro just for a crappy converter if I want to ""fuse"" together the Paradox games I possess? Nice policy Paradox...To give you an idea, today you need 165€ just to play the full game (without even considering the massive amount of graphic and soundtrack DLCs or the EU4 converter) and DLCs are still coming out. The game can be good but its not worth half of that price.You better wait till they start working on CK3 and stop squeezing money out of this game. Then maybe they'll lower the price of a 4 years old game (prices are still the same even for the main game) and you can buy a cheap package with all the DLCs.It's not worth a penny before that. You can trust someone who loved this and other Paradox games.			"

												Edit: I'm about to pass over six hundred hours of playtime on this game and it's all pretty much legitimate. No other game has held my attention for as long as Crusader Kings 2 has. Years have passed and I still come back to this game simply because there is still so much more to do and Paradox Interactive has done a tremendous job in supporting the game with content post-release. Simply put, Crusader Kings 2 is my favorite game of all time, hands down.I've spent over three hundred hours on this game and I don't regret a single minute. Well, not exactly. I regret a lot of things done during my playthrough of this game but it happens after playing a dynasty for four hundred years! This is a fantastic game and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in spending hours upon hours trying to decide whether to assassinate that dimwitted son of yours currently in line for your throne!

												I played as the king of Jerusalem and was determined to make an all Christian holy land.  Unfortunately, I discovered when my son turned 3 that he was the antichrist.  At the age of 16 he became a heretic and began trying to end catholicism in my kingdom.  At the age of 18 he assassinated me and took the throne.  My spymaster is now a dead fish, My queen is a witch, I am receiving military advice from Jesus, and I have an army of 40,000 devil worshippers.  Tomorrow I shall march on Rome and begin my Satanic empire.Ave Antichriste!			"

												Crusader Kings II is, IMHO, Paradox's best game.  It's a grand strategy game that throws many of the popular complexities of the genre such as a complicated tech tree, deep strategic combat, and a rich economy and city building out the window for very simple implementations of each and replaces it all with one thing: interpersonal drama.  It's all about what other people have that you want and what you have that other people want, and it produces epic struggles, dramatic twists of fate, and wonderful soap opera fodder.  At the start of the game if you have a small nation, you can play it a bit like a standard 4X.  Locate a smaller neighbor with no major allies, conquer, repeat.  As your empire grows, however, you begin to need to split up your holdings among relatives and friends- a province here, a duchy there.  And then those people begin to want things, and have armies, and begin to plan among themselves.  And maybe you have too many children, and those who aren't getting enough of the land start to hate you.  And maybe your king dies and his underaged heir who fewer people like and nobody respects takes over under the care of one of your trusted vassels, who may even now be plotting regicide.  When that daughter you married off a decade ago and forgot about suddenly inheriets a third of the Holy Roman Empire due to an accident of inheritance laws and a suspiciously high mortality rate among the nobility?  The knives will begin to come out before the crown has had time to settle on her brow, and damage control doesn't even begin to cover what follows.  Play enough of this game, and familicide won't even be an interesting enough story to warrant telling your spouse about after another play session where you stayed up three hours later than you wanted it.  Crusader Kings II is big, and imposing, and takes a long time to play, but there's pretty much nothing like it out there.  It might take a dozen hours before you really get what's going on, and I suspect most people who even try it will bounce off of it without understanding why it's such a big deal.  If it bites into you, though, your time will be repaid with an endless array of amazing stories and crazy alternate histories of Europe.			"

												This is probably one of my favorite games of all time, but Paradox has gone mad with DLCs, content packs, and basically just any way to get money out of the consumer that doesn't require improving the actual game itself.It's like painting over a wall with a giant gaping hole in it.Oh, and you're paying for the paint.

After receiving exhorborant bribes from him we set our Spymasters to work exacting judgement on this trifling woman and her lovers.

												Let me tell you a little story.I was a mere count in Italy, an unimportant man, living my little life, raising my son, loving my wife. But I was pretty popular among other counts and dukes and so it happened that I was elected a king of Italy. Being young and ambitious I started to build my kingdom and earn the fame and glory I knew I was destined for. My reign was glorious, no revolts, no problems, only growth and prosperity and so holding a great tournament seemed like a great idea. But I was a diplomat, not a warrior and so it happened that I got maimed. Two years later I died of a combination of my wound and common flu. My 15 years old son became the king, but the vassals didn´t like him and soon enough they asked him to hand over the crown. He wasn´t gonna give it up so easily and so the war over the kingdom of Italy began. However my son underestimated the strength of his opposition and was forced to surrender. The new king imprisoned him and refused to ransom him, because he still had a claim on the kingdom. Three years later my son died and because he had no heirs, the game was over.This little story, my friends, is the reason why I f*cking love this game.			"

												I bought this game about 2 years ago for Christmas while it was about 35% off along with Fallout 3 and Dishonored. The trailer for CK2 made me intensely excited for it so I could live out all of my medieval fantasies to my heart's content. Upon opening the game however, I found myself seriously outmatched by the game's steep learning curve. That, coupled with the fact that I had bought two other masterpieces, made it difficult for me to rationalize spending the hours it would take for me to truly get into the game. About 2 months later after beating Fallout 3 and Dishonored, I dedicated myself to learning CK2 and to this day, I regret not doing it earlier. For anyone who wonders why it is so difficult to learn this game, the answer is very simple. It was very difficult to be a successful ruler in the medieval era. How should you know what you can and cannot do without experience? With this in mind, I encourage everyone to buy this game and sink about 20 hours into the game before making their judgements. I am certain that you will think differently about your purchase by that point and truly feel that it was worth it.			"

I'm not sure the latest patch has helped or hindered the experience, but the ironman mode makes it a real challenge.  Seriously if you haven't tried this game, there are so many different things to keep people interested.

												""Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."" - Lord ActonThe Medieval Age wasn't the brightest moment in human history. War, Assassination, Torture, Greed, Betrayal; those are merely some of the words associated with the atrocities committed by the rulers of the realm. Some good and honest men have ruled, but most rulers couldn't resist the temptation from the power they wield; the power to rule. They were tempted to gain more power, and they are willing to use even the most atrocious of acts to gain it.Crusader Kings II gives players a taste of that power.Starting at any point from 1066 (Or 769 with a certain DLC enabled) to 1453, players are allowed to choose from a very large amount of historical characters that once ruled over a part of Europe and parts of Asia and Africa. From the lowliest duke to the highest emperor, the game has no final objective whatsoever, leaving players to create their own story and decide their own goals for their dynasty. Do you want to be the most prestigious family in the world? To work your way up and create an empire that will last for generations? Or simply to make sure your bloodline survives through all the coming conflict? Grand strategy games typically put players as an eternal invisible guiding force controlling a single country, viewing the world from above as a map as they manage the country’s Politics, Economy, Military, and Diplomacy through various factors. These games use simple visuals to accommodate the large scale gameplay. There are no fancy Total War-like massive battles or anything of sort. Almost every aspect of the game depends on numbers. In other words, the main part gameplay is to manage those numbers and the various factors affecting it to the player’s benefit.Crusader Kings II offers a sandbox grand strategy experience into a more personal level; giving players control over a single Catholic ruler (later DLCs adds the options to play as Muslim, Pagan, and Jewish rulers) and continue on as his/her heir after passing away. Instead of dealing with faceless countries, the more personal approach allows the game to have a large amount of characters, be it a lord or a simple courtier. Every character in the game has their own set of skills, traits, and relations with other characters. A major part of the game is managing the relationship between characters by various interactions. You can cement the loyalty of your vassals by keeping them happy with gifts and inviting them to feasts. You can increase the odds of success of an assassination plot by inviting treacherous people within your target's court. You can declare a war for a title your courtier has a claim on. Be wary as other characters could do it to you as well. The best option is to trust no one, not even your friends and relatives. These interactions increase the depth of Crusader King II's strategic gameplay in a very dynamic way.The trademark Paradox's grand strategy gameplay is still present, even if somewhat simplified by the time period. Politics are mostly done by the character interactions mentioned above; with the addition of a player-manageable council the players can use accomplish certain tasks. Economy is much more simplified, with very little emphasis on trade. Instead of training units to form standing armies, you form a temporary military force in time of war, then disband them when the war is over. Your military comes from raising levies both from your personally owned holdings and from your vassals. (Retinues were added with a DLC). Religion plays a major role in the game, with each religion having some unique gameplay mechanic that differ them from the rest; such as the Papacy for Catholics and Decadence for Muslims. While the strategy gameplay itself for most the most part lacks depth compared to other Paradox grand strategy titles, Crusader Kings II still stands on its own as a well-made and unique game.Crusader Kings II is visuals are simple, yet fitting for the game. The map is fully rendered in 3D, it’s nothing breathtaking, but you can still appreciate the beauty of its landscape; although you'll probably spend most of the time using the political map mode. The character portraits are a great mix of realism and cartoony art style which provides a variety of colorful characters faces.The musical score for the game is also worth praising. While not all the music in the game is memorable, they rarely distract you from the game, and for the most part they complement your playthrough with a variety of beautiful music fitting for the era.The game is without its flaws, of course. While the tutorial is an improvement from previous Paradox titles, you will still need to learn most of the game’s mechanics on your own by trial or error. While it could be a part of the fun of playing the game, some people may dislike it. I’ve encountered several minor bugs, but the game is fully playable as of now. Another minor complaint is the lack of naval combat. While historically there wasn’t a lot of naval combat at the era, I wish that navies could be more useful such as for blockading ports. But as for the time this review was written, the only use for navies is for troop transport.Describing everything about Crusader Kings II’s in detail would take a lot of time and energy. Both of which you could be using right now to purchase and experience Crusader Kings II on your own! (Or at least try the demo) Go and create your own story with your dynasty. Be patient and play as an honest, good natured ruler. Or fall to the temptation of power and spill the blood of anyone who stands in your way. The choice is yours.Deus Vult.			"

												My favorite game of all time. 800+ Hours. They ruined it with this patch. They ruined it with Conclave. I fell into the machine, I bought almost all the DLC (unit packs and songs and content packs excluded) yet they finally broke me. To those of you who know the problems then this was a shattered retreat, a destruction to everything good. This is the greatest game of all time before 2.5. Now it is mediocre at best. They keep trying to fix the game but don't realize they are trying to fix things that were never broken. Wars, factions, CHILD EDUCATION. All broken. They add in terrible things that were never there like coalitions. I wish they stopped adding content after horselords. Unlike most I have an almost inexhaustable wallet for things I like such as this game. Most can't handle these DLC purchases which allow you to use things that should've been in it in the first place. Muslims, Pagans, Nomads, the Byzantine Empire, Republics, Indians. That's a solid chunk of the map unplayable to you unless you continue on with purchases. This was a game where you could play 800 hours easy, but now I'm sick of Paradox ""improving"" the game, and my eyes are open to the money grabbing and micro-transactions which have all but made people hate Total War: Attila. Too many good games have fallen to micro-transactions, it's rude and insulting to us the consumer. Those of you who lay down, eat Paradox's excrement and praise the taste are only encouraging this gross mismanagement of success. I hope this game is fixed, but I will not play it until my grievances are at least somewhat addressed.			"

												At the time of writing, this $40 game has $240 of DLC available.Crusader Kings II is a great game - and I'm not using that word lightly, it's a GREAT game - but I can't recommend it.  I've put a lot of hours into this game (more than Steam has counted), but it's never been a fulfilling experience because of all the goddamed DLC.Listen, I'm no enemy to DLC, if a developer makes more content for their game, I'll pay to play it.  But the way Paradox does it is straight up insidious.""This new update adds North Africa to the game......but you can't play there unless you buy the Sword of Islam DLC""""The newest update adds all of India to the vanilla map.......but you can't play there unless you buy the Rajas of India DLC""""We just added the entire Asian continent to the game.......but you can't play there unless you buy the Horse Lords DLC""DLC in this game isn't comparable to DLC in other games, it's not like it adds a weapon skin or an extra level.  Crusader Kings II DLC fundamentally changes the core gameplay of the game, and some things that have DRASTIC changes on how you play (such as the ability to have a standing army, form custom kingdoms, or even the existence of the Jewish religion) are hidden behind 4 years and $240 of DLC.To put it simply, I have never felt like I was playing a finished game.  Every time I turn it on, there's an ad for yet another piece of DLC.  Once I finally save up enough to buy the next biggest DLC pack, another is announced.  It's just not fulfilling.Until Paradox decides to wrap this game up like they've done with Europa Universalis IV and Hearts of Iron III, and put their energy to developing Crusader Kings III instead of squeezing more DLC money out of current players, I can't recommend it.

												Crusader Kings II on first look seems like just another game styled after so many other well-known games that use an overhead map and a time period. That’s where things steer into a different direction. This game may well be the best game created by the game smiths at Paradox Development Studio. It’s a huge strategy game with layers. I would suggest running the tutorial in the game. In fact I would also suggest keeping the hints option on, it is full of valuable playing information.Taking place over a 400 year time span the players take on the persona of a character running the realms and struggling to make it in these troublesome times.Throughout the game life, the character deals with the world and other characters of the court, they have stats and traits; they marry, and have children in hopes of conceiving an heir to the throne. That is the main point too, having a legitimate heir to the kingdom. As that first main character grows older and or dies before their time, as long as there is an heir the game goes on to 1452. Hierarchy and the bloodline are of some importance in this game as it was in yee olden days.The game plays in different ways depending on how the player chooses to start. Hierarchy plays a role here. So if the player starts out as a lower rank of the upper class, say a Count, well you have some leveling to do. There is so much information to be had during game play it can be over whelming at times; thankfully Paradox Development Studio has integrated so many buttons and drop downs to assist the player in keeping track of events and information. Plus the game can be paused to take a break or assess the situation. The interface and game play seems polished enough, though the animations took some getting used to.As gaming goes in the grand strategy style, there is some replay ability here, with so much going on, try different playing styles, be aggressive, or less so. See how things turn out, be a tyrant if you like.The graphics of the lands and seas are beautiful to behold, with clouds shadow and weather passing over the lands as you look down from your almost celestial view from above. Sound is pleasing as well, with music and sound bites setting the mood for events appropriately. This is truly one of the better games to come out from Paradox Development Studio, now like most strategy games, things do not progress always at a fast pace. So some patience in gaming is involved here. Crusader Kings II is exactly the sort of game I was hoping it would be. As deep and complex as its predecessor, but more accessible.			"

												Ultimately, after 200 hours on a game (I'm not really a gamer so 200 hours is _insane_ for me to spend on a game) like this, you'd think I could recommend Crusader Kings II. Sadly, I am just not able to anymore. My view of CKII is pretty mixed, so I'll try to give the good with the bad. I'll start with the good first, since I plan to expand more on the bad.THE GOOD-The map is gorgeous and easily the best looking of all of Paradox's games. -Music, even without the music pack DLCs, is pretty great and I've never really gotten tired of it.-The history is, at least on the surface, simulated pretty well and I enjoy having some of the weirder and obscure characters in history able to be played like the last Karling, a random Christian ruler in Seljuk Anatolia, and so on. It's nice that they'll include stuff like that even if you can only access it by skipping to a very specific year.-The early DLCs, particularly The Old Gods, are genuinely fun. I love playing as the Norse during the Age of the Vikings and it's honestly one of the best parts of the game. It's to the point I almost wish The Old Gods was spun off as a different game (similar to For the Glory) to focus on just that era and expand more into Viking clans, religion, etc.-Unlike most I've played Crusader Kings 1 extensively and while there are a lot of steps back from that game, I do like that the council does more than just improve ruler stats. Letting your council micro-manage your realm (before they ruined it with Conclave) is genuinely very fun and makes it feel more like an actual feudal state.-It got me, someone who doesn't really like video games enough to be called a ""gamer"" (most of the games on my Steam are gifts are stuff I bought and never played), to play for 200 hours so that's got to count for something.THE BAD-First off, the DLCs. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ the DLCs. Paradox, when I am expected to pay $15 to play as a Jew, when there are literally fewer than 10 Jewish players to even play in nearly _700 years_ of gameplay, how do you even justify that? Really, the DLCs have turned a good $60 game into a bloated mess that Paradox wants you to pay nearly $200 for. Even as someone with the means to do so, this game does _not_ deserve that price and is simply not good enough for it. I've bought strategy games for the PC that start at $100 retail because they are done with mind-boggingly amounts of research, study, and care. Crusader Kings II is not that good.-Besides the price of the DLCs, which is crazy, the amount of content that you have to add on to the game is out of control. Not only does it mean the base game is almost worthless, but that you start to break your game the more you add on to it. It is simply ridiculous and is something that warns off new players when they see mountains of DLC.-Patches that you have no control over that break your game. I am one of the poor people who bought Conclave on Day 1 and even though I have since turned it off like any sensible person, the forced patch means that I can't escape some of the worse parts of the DLC whether I want it or not. Paradox breaks your game for you and there is no real way to go back. I miss the days of the old Paradox games when I refused to upgrade EU 3 for over a year until better patches came around.-Conclave. Just...♥♥♥♥ing Conclave. If you want to know why it's so bad read one of the other reviews but suffice to say it breaks any sense of believability or historical playability of the game and turns it into a game that is almost impossible to play if you are anything more than a duke, and a minor duke at that. -Speaking of which...Paradox, either accept that your games are, you know, games or try to be more historical. You can't be either. Iqta government is not feudalism, CK II can't even begin to simulate medieval economies, and India. Didn't. Work. That. Way. I am a history nerd myself and that's why I enjoy Paradox games, but the way the game has been lately with the recent expansions it is almost impossible to try to play a game historically with the way that CKII works. Economy is a joke, armies don't work how they should, vassals aren't simulated anywhere near realistically, rebellions happen more often than they should for some countries and never for others (I have yet to see the Golden Horde have any problem ruling all of Russia past 1300 and often survives all the way to the end of the game fully intact).-A lot of the bad things in the game feel like a step back from Crusader Kings 1, which is one of my best games ever to this day. Events are basically nerfed and pointless now which severely hampers roleplaying, different numbers for a vassal's opinion of you and loyalty are gone which makes holding empires together almost impossible, armies and economy are massively changed and almost never for the better, and in general CK II just feels...less in depth. In Crusader Kings I, despite a smaller scope, I could really get lost into the intricacies of day-to-day rule. By this point in CK II with all the patches I rarely if ever care who my king is and never interact with him. I can't remember the last time it mattered who I marry beyond alliances, even.Overall, CK II is a slick-looking game with a ton of problems underneath. I keep playing it because it is, on a level, addicting, but it's far too broken and mismanaged for me to totally enjoy it or recommend it. Sadly, since the release of Conclave my playtime has taken a nosedive and it's unlikely I'll keep playing. EU4 is at least fun enough without Mare Nostrum to keep playing but with the forced patches and general unlikeability of the gameplay, I can't say I'd tell anyone I know to play CK II. Oh well, at least we'll always have CK 1.			"

												I will start by saying I really enjoy playing the games that Paradox creates. My first thought is to recommend their product. But then we start this DLC instead of update policy. Time and again I have seen this company release new content for their games (many of which seem based off of player mods, and add little to none in way of expanding upon it). I woudnt mind one here and there. Or perhaps if they didnt try to make you pay for portraits, music, and additional gameplay options. It's bad enough paying $15 for a DLC which does very little in the way of mechanics, but Paradox goes much further than that. They want to charge you for new music, new portaits, and new character models. EACH SOLD SEPERATELY. So basically, the games are amazing and fun, but the DLC policy has become so outragous and nickle/dimes you so much that I can NOT advise anyone to purchase their products.			"

												It's easy to start up CK II and not get what the fuss is about. Another Euro-centric medieval simulator, like we haven't seen that before. With a snail pace and no sprawling, Total War like combat, it seems more like a ""watch time pass"" simulator than a game.But you start a game nonetheless. You chose to start as a small, independent region - maybe the one where you or your ancestors hail from - glory to the motherland and all that. And you just want to learn the ropes, no need to get into anything large. The game starts; you press play and fiddle with the speed. Nothing happens. You leave it on high. Minutes pass; nothing happens. 'OK', let's see what this button at the top left does. You spend the next half hour fiddling with all the info there, trying to make sense of it. From time to time, pop-ups show up, detailing little events that seem to have no impact on the game. 'Oh, cool. This random courtesan fancies me. Who friggin' cares?'.But one message catches your eye - the neighboring♥♥♥♥♥hat has decided he likes your lands and he'd like to make them his lands. You quickly raise your impressive army only to watch in horror as ten times as many butcher them with ease. Your dynasty ends with its founders head on a pile. Game over.OK, that went as well as can be expected - can't be be blamed for not winning with the small guy on the first time. You start up another game, this time as the biggest, baddest nation that you see - what greater joy could there be than to steamroll all your punier neighbors into fine grains of dust? As the game starts, you watch with greedy eyes as the gold rolls into your treasury. 'Yeah, time to build some♥♥♥♥♥♥. 'What? It takes one year, costs that much and increases my army by ♥♥♥♥-all percent in this region only?? Screw that, time to slaughter some franks'. 'OK, diplomacy, declare war... Why is it greyed out? Casus Beli??? WTF is that?'. But no matter, while you were scouring your memory of high-school Latin, the guys to the south have graciously decided to bring the fight to you. 'Pathetic basters, they're like half my size. This is going to be fun'. You raise your levies and merge them into one big glob. 'That skull must mean I'm one deadly S.O.B' you think to yourself. And you march to meet them head on, only to see your guys start to die off before you even get there. 'Doesn't matter' you think to yourself, 'I still outnumber them 2:1'. By the time your armies meet, it's more like 1.5 to 1, and you still barely beat them. But you do. Time to reap the rewards...Your peasants have taken up arms against you.Your vassals have risen up to lower crown authority.Your king has died, only to be inherited by a possessed dimwit.You have been excommunicated.The franks have decided that that small little province on the border is theirs and they are willing to drown you in blood for it.Game over.At this moment you are fuming. You steel yourself - this stupid game isn't going to get the better of you. You start thinking, 'what's the best starting point?'. You start again, this time as a count in province deep in the heart of a stable empire. You start slow, making friends with everyone. Then your lord and brother dies, making you the new Duke. 'Oh, so I don't have to attack everyone to take their land'. You make a mental note. The years pass; through claim fabrication, key marriages and poisoned wines you grab a few more adjacent duchies. A few gold coins later and you are the King of Bavaria.This makes the emperor uneasy. He demands that you release a duchy that he claims is rightfully his. You're too weakened from your last conquest to fight him - and it's just a small province anyway. You grin your teeth and accept his demands. And the years pass again; your line is well loved and respected by your emperor and fellow vassals. You are seen as a keen supporter of his Imperial Majesty. But the strangest thing keeps happening. All the bright, attractive or strong princes, they never seem to make it pass infancy. As generations pass, the crippled, the dim and the feeble seem to favored by some unseen force and raise to the crown. Unsurprisingly, your fellow lords are not happy with this rule.The time has come. You start a movement, to replace the inheritance law with an elective one. A bloody civil war erupts and, after many years, you emerge the victor. You are now next in line to become the most powerful man in Europe. Just. one. more. assassination.And... the Huns happen. Your empire is too weak and you fail to protect your lands against the scourge.GAME OVER.It's morning. You have to go to work in about an hour. You call in sick.You probably are...			"

												An Indian family fleeing from oppression in their home province found asylum in my Kingdom of Norway. Why not, I thought. The father of the family was a decent warrior, so I allowed him to command troops in battle. He distinguished himself in many wars over the years and was awarded one of the recently conquered counties in Northern Germany. He continued to serve me loyally and has even converted to Norse religion. For his service I gave him a duchy to rule. Generation after generation his descendants continued to marry local nobles.Now, nearly two centuries later, Germany is ruled by white dudes in turbans who think they're Indian, worship Norse gods and train War Elephants. Breaking history has never been so much fun!I started playing CK2 during a free weekend. It looked like something I might like, so I gave it a try. I bought the game the next day along with several DLCs and never stopped playing. CK2 has now climbed to number 1 of my most played Steam games, in spite of being in my library for less than a year. I don't recall another ""game addiction"" that lasted this long for me. And there is the fact that nearly 400 hours into the game I've only played as one of the many game religions, one of the numerous cultures (disregarding the training scenario). Playing as a different religion, culture, starting location, starting rank changes the way you play the game. You could even start your second play through in the exact same character as last time and the way things will go will be entirely different. This game is more complex than any other strategy I've played before. It takes a while to take it all in. Luckily there are in-game hints to what every screen means and what every button does (you can switch these off later, but I found myself checking every now and then). There is also a tutorial campaign that will teach you how to play.What adds to the fun greatly is the fact that you play as a specific character. Their traits and abilities make them more appropriate for certain roles within the Kingdom than others. The current King might make a better priest than military commander, but you don't say that out loud in front of your liege (or their spymaster). Once your character dies, you play as the heir to their titles, this being usually one of their children, depending on the hereditary laws of your realm.Feel like expanding your Empire? You don't necessarily need to wage war to achieve that. Why don't you marry your eldest son to that second daughter of the neighboring empire and then make sure the first-born daughter (already married) has a little accident before she has children? However as I am not the patient type I prefer marching my armies into enemy territory and be done with it. What I love about the battles is that the smallest thing can change the outcome of the battle (much like in history). The commander of your strongest flank was killed shortly after the skirmish began and his confused troops now run around the battlefield like headless chickens? Well, s**t happens. There is always a chance, however small, that things will go wrong. It's up to you to play the odds (don't put your only heir in battle, especially while he's sick) and have a backup plan in case things don't go your way or you might end up losing your realm, or the entire game. Once I lost a major battle and most of my personal army. One of my vassals decided now was the good time to revolt, my stronger neighbor saw it as an opportunity to invade and on top of that a peasant uprising started in one of my counties. Bottom line - I lost it all and had to make tribal huts in Norway my capital, which was a bummer after living in a mighty castle in Western France for two generations.The good news is you can appoint commanders as you see fit, provided your authority within the realm is strong enough to do so. Each of the several types of troops (and culture specific special units) has a different attack and defend stats and these evolve as you research technologies and construct special buildings. Your commanders can employ various tactics during battle, some of which depend on their personal traits and/or martial capability. There are many situations you will find yourself in - often thanks to random events, most of which require very specific conditions to be met first. Many events are bound to a specific time and realms that existed at that point. I will not spoil these for you because I found it to be a lot of fun to face some of them followed by a palm on the forehead and an exclamation: “Of course, I (sort of) remember this from history lessons!”I’ve always been interested in history and considered my knowledge of geography very decent and yet I’ve learned a lot of new facts by playing CK2. My natural curiosity took over and I've since researched many medieval realms and rulers online.If you’re feeling competitive then know that achievements are only awarded if you play on Ironman mode. So please make sure that if you come across a player with some of the most difficult of achievements you salute and/or bow as appropriate.At some point you might find yourself lying on your death-bed. Your son and heir might be an imbecile, your younger brother has possibly convinced half of your court he'd make a better King than you and yet you’ll enjoy every minute of it. This game has my full recommendation.If this looks like something you might like then give it a try. But be warned - You might be buying the new number 1 in your library and may thus face the ""Should I do something meaningful with my day or should I finally become the King of England?"" decision. And we both know it can only go one way from there.			"

												This game will teach you all you need to know about subjective morality, medieval history, and incest. If you think you're a good person, I dare you to try this game. You too will be murdering unneeded and unlanded family members and cheating on your spouse while blackmailing the priests who serve under you for better tithes within no time. Ever watched the show Game of Thrones and thought that that Jeoffrey guy was on to something? Maybe you're a fan of Henry VIII, a King of England who lived and breathed debauchery and intrigue (whatever you judge it as morally, that must have been a compelling life, no?) and made war whenver he felt he could? You can more or less act out any medieval power fantasy you'd like here, with options becoming more and more complex as you learn to manipulate diplomacy and how to plan more intricately.I cannot recommend this enough if you're into grand strategy like me.

												If you love strategy then you have to play this game cause it will put your skills to the test.The only bad thing is how the game can move at a snails pace, but its great excuse to do something while it plays.Like eat some pizza, do a bit of cleaning, or watch some videos.My personal favorites for this game is the long spanning games you can have with it and the organic stories to be had.One story of mine goes as followed.....I was a lowly count of Athens, clawing my way up to Doux/Duke and one day emperor.After many years of conquest of my neighbors I had four counties to my name and finally took my title as Doux.Now I served the empire as Marshal of the realm, loyally I fought wars againest the neighboring pagens and muslims.Thing took a turn for the worse when I was wrongly accused of♥♥♥♥♥♥ I had hoped my liege would merciful, he was not....Years after my death, my son lead a revolt for elective monarchy and won, shortly after he became emperor.It was then I would get my revenge by executing the last emperor's son.With my vegance complete my family went on to restore the Roman Empire and bring order to chaos.

												I'm going to tell you a brief history of the magnificent and prestigious Pasta family; one of the most prevalent Venetian trades families that reigned Venice on and off for some 600 years. Throughout their years and with a very sordid and complicated family tree the Pasta family (stemming from their patriarch, Serene Doge Spaghetti I ""The Fat"") came to amass a previously unthought-of level of wealth. Legend has it that in the late 11th century Venetian spending ground to a complete halt as the city-state had quite literally too much money and not enough places to invest in. A ruthless and cunning family, the Pasta family spared no expense in making sure their trade ports were renowned the world over. If money was being spent in the Mediterranean, the Pasta family got a cut; to do business and avoid them was difficult. To avoid Venice altogether was impossible. While avoiding open conflict as much as they could, the Venetians did get in a few trade squabbles with the Amalfi, only to render the Greek patricians an afterthought when it came to doing business in the Mediterranean. Using a mix of intrigue and some well-placed military show-of-force, the Pasta patricians were able to get a monetary lock on almost the entire Mediterranean Sea, and were even looking to find a weak county along the Red Sea to capture so as to expand their trade empire into India. Venice made many political and cultural strides in southern Europe, notably by turning its back on Roman Catholicism in 1207 to adopt the Cathar heresy. This did very little to dissuade people from trading with them, however, as Rome itself was home to a particularly busy Pasta trade port for several hundred years at that point. It wasn't until Serene Doge Cavatappi III in 1349 did cracks begin to form in the illustrious Pasta mansion, so to speak. Through a series of marriages to various Saxon and Bavarian princes the Pasta family came in posession of a few counties in mainland Europe; far away from warm, balmy climate of Venice. Sitting on a veritable mountain of gold at this point, the Venetian powers that be tended to ignore their lands to the north, and left it in the capable hands of their respective rulers. After Penne IV, son of Cavatappi III lost the election to become the next Serene Doge (an event that did happen a few times during the 600 year Pasta tenure, but few and far in between), he decided to turn his back on Venice altogether and tore his family's ties from the Republic. Adopting a few of his rightful counties in Bavaria and suffering a hard but brief blow from the bizarre Sunset Invasion, Penne and his kin lived in a financial nightmare. While by no means broke, the family now had a mere fraction of the wealth they amassed during their mainstay in Venice. The reason not much has been written about the Pasta family is because after this exodus the dynasty pretty much lost all of its prestige and money. Left with a few counties in Saxony (which were quickly overthrown by their bigger and more powerful Frankish neighbors) and no historical records left over save for a few manuscripts found in the wine cellar of the old Pasta mansion (discovered only recently), the Pasta family became a cold, stale remnant of what it once was. The only surviving history of the family for a while was of its brief stay in mainland Europe, which was far from glorious. ...I did all of this by clicking things on a map and looking at spreadsheets. 10/10 would create a grand trade empire only to fade into obscurity and have a terrible score at the end of the game again.

												It's not that I don't like this game, but the DLC is completely ridiculous. Expansions are alright, but there is no reason that they have to release other DLC with them. They have already released face packs, music packs, dynasty shield packs, and probably something else that I'm forgetting, and in their latest expansion, Charlemagne, Paradox proved that they are experts at squeezing every last dollar out of their customers. Just when I thought they had run out of face and music packs to sell, they added clothing packs. There is absolutely no reason that these cosmetic changes can't come bundled for free or at a reduced price with the expansions. In total, Crusader Kings II DLC now costs over one hundred and seventy-five dollars. While there is nothing wrong with the game by itself, the DLC model that Paradox uses is horrible, and is only defended by a group of people that have a cult-like devotion to the company.			"

 Crusader Kings II Name  - Crusader Kings IIGenre - Grand StrategyPersonal Opinion - The best strategy game there ever was! This is a pretty big game and this is my first review, so I won't delve into it too deep!  Also time played is not true, I have played this game quite a lot offline, unfortunately it does not show offline play hours. Review Crusader Kings II, a game where you can be a King, a Duke, a Count, or even an Emperor, with each level of nobility bringing a new level of difficulty, whereas if you start as a Count, you may start with only one province and depending on where you start you might end up being a vassal to someone else or even have some of your own!Given that you are a vassal, you  may   will  have to compete with other vassals, who will either be lower or higher than you, in some cases you might join a faction with other vassals to try and force the current leader of the country to do things, such as lowering taxes and gaining independence, if you gain enough support you can get things in motion by issuing an ultimatum to the Emperor/King/Duke asking for these things, and if they refuse, you will be able to start a war to get it happening.Then there's marriage, you can just about marry every single person in your kingdom, given that they aren't the same sex as you and they are 16 or over, however you can arrange a marriage for people under 16 (Betrothal).Of course it doesn't just end there, after marriage you can have little clones of yourself (Kids), and build your dynasty, then marry em' off and possibly inherit more land!Also, there are some awesome events that are random and pretty fun. Such as being a lunatic and appointing your horse as your chancellor, or giving birth to the anti-christ. Also, being an absolute tyrant and just murdering your way to the top.Why not discover the ""What if"" part of history, reclaim the Old Roman Empire, make Britain actually conquer the world, kill the pope, conquer the papacy, restore the persian empire.

												Do I recommend this game?Yes, truly I do. Its an awesome game. It develops every single aspect of a strategy game set in the past that are left out of other games. You can have families, friends, allies, non-aggression pacts. You can imprison, execute and banish annoying vassals, you can marry yourself with the daughter of the King of England, and  through the descendants of that union get a claim on his lands. The game is varied, as you an set your game in various time periods across history with hundreds of different factions. You can be a Mongolian Khan or a Holy Roman Emperor just as much as you can be a count in Iceland with no wealth, armies or power. In most strategy games, who YOU in an empire is mostly irrelevant. In the CIV series you're simply a great leader of your nation that rules it forever. Or in the Total war series, you can have a defined character bu everything about him is mostly out of your control or irrelevant. in CK2, all the focus is on your family, as it should be. Your daughters can be married to secure alliances or become great rulers in their own right. Your sons can lead your armies, and can be giving titles you win through war. Some of your sons will love you, others will only try to seize power for themselves. Every single character as a personality, related to their trait that ACTUALLY MATTERS. Be a jerk, become a tyrant and people will hate you, resent you and might even try to murder you This world feels organic and you truly feel a part of it. For all of those reasons, I recommend this gameHoweverIt cant be denied that this game unfortunately has TONS of issues that affect game play. The kind of which will make you want to scream at your screen at how stupid what just happened was. Complete nobodies who actually like you will have you murdered for no reason or  will get themselves 20000 men armies out of nowhere to attack you even tough they don't have a penny on them or apparent claims on your lands. The AI can be incredibly stupid! They cant ever hold on to a king title without being crushed by continuous groups of rebellious vassals. After a century, ever single important christian kingdom will have an elective system of law. Why? Because its what theirs vassals want and the AI cant handle rebellions. You want to battle certain foreign dynasties across history? Too bad, the AI is also incompetent at keeping themselves alive for any long periods. Most great houses in say, 1066 will have disappeared in a bout a century  which COULD be considered historically accurate but at the same time it makes you feel like you're playing this game alone with no actual competition. The AI for the pope can be brain dead. Calling crusades against Kingdoms in India, forcing crusaders to cross the Persian desert to reach their target!The DLC in this game is horrendous. Its DLC whoring that's EA worthy. You have to pay for portraits and songs in the game!!! PURE AESTHETICS STUFF THAT DOESNT CHANGE GAME PLAY. Are you sick of hearing the same 2 god damn songs in repeat? Pay money.The worst about those DLC is what they offer. Without paying extra, you cant play pagans, you cant play Indians, you cant play muslims and you cant play republics. Thats right, more than half of the starting areas are impossible for the player to play unless they pay extra. Others are simply broken and as such are complete rip offs AND THANK GOD I never bought some of them!! They allow you for 5.49 $ to customize your ruler on regular mode BUT not on Ironman mode. But, thats something you could ALREADY DO THROUGH THE CONSOLE. Its vastly useless! The Way of life DLC makes every single male in your kingdom horny dogs that go after your wife, your heirs wife etc... which means, in a game about dynasties ruling across history, your son might just be the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ son of some random count who, thanks to the seduction focus, repeatedly slept with your wife 35 times right under your nose. The ONLY way to make sure your wives don't end up sleeping with every single man in the Kingdom is to pick a chaste one (trait that I rarely see and that they often end up losing) or a lesbian. Apparently, according to paradox, all women were ♥♥♥♥♥s in these times! Seeing how they refuse to truly fix this, thats the only conclusion I can arrive to. They tried to with a new ""reject seduction attempts"" system but since theres always a few master seducers running around it doesn't stop anyone. The conclave DLC makes the game way harder and sooo much less fun. The Republic DLC forces you to use seniority succession and nothing else! Always playing 75 years old? isnt that fun???The Sword of Islam dlc should've been in the base game, same for the old gods. There's no excuses to leave so many factions unplayable even at an 1066 start. Theres also new updates. Lots of complaints about the new update regarding coalitions that can make pagans, muslims and christians band together against you because you took a duchy through a religious war. They NEVER make coalitions USEFUL agaisnt the AI, this feature is SOLELY used to stop the player from expanding, forcing you to wait 30 f*cking years for infamy to go off unless youre willing to fight 8 nations at the same time. Shattered retreats make your enemies armies magically undestroyable while they basicly have safe conduit back to their territories. Which means, wars now drag for SO FREAKING longer than they need to because you can't kill their armies! You cant pursue them either because you will never have enough supplies and risk losing men needlessly. Sometimes, your own armies will retreat at the WORST POSSIBLE PLACES. When you raid a coast with boats and your raiders gets defeated, they sometimes retreat further in the AIs territory even tough their boats is RIGHT THERE. Theres as of date NO OPTION to turn those off. You dont like them? too bad. You have to use mods on the workshop and disable ironman mode to be able to play without themIn short?? This game offers SO much and at the same time sucks the fun out of the game with questionable design decisions, horrible dlc, and annoying AI. Is the game fun? Yes. Of course it is. But after several hours, you realize all the shortcoming of this game and you're bound to be annoyed by them. Btw, buy this game on a sale, that game is often on sale at 40% or 30% off (cant remember the percentage) Yet every other day its over 200$ to acquire the ""full experience"". Just wait a little while and get it on sale			"

Yet this game maintains a good rating, how? If EA did this♥♥♥♥♥♥ the masses would lose they're ♥♥♥♥ing minds. I love playing this game but that fact that so many cool features need to be paid for is just way too expenivse, and unless you're a hardcore fan of Grand Strategy, it just is too expensive.			"

												Loved this game, I considered it one of the best games I ever played. I also liked some of the major DLC such as The Old Gods, Rajas of India and Charlemagne. Even DLCs that added things I felt should have been there at the start such as Sword of Islam did improve the game. Hell I even liked Sunset Invasion because it made gameplay more interesting in the west even if it is nonsensical. A few of the DLCs did make the game better. There's also some enjoyable mods such as the GOT mod and the Elder Kings mod. I also love many of Paradox's games. It should have been impossible for them to turn me into an annoyed customer.That said the devs have simply made to many changes with patches and DLC that have just made CK2 a lot less fun and they're going to continue changing it. At a certain point all their changes were doing was make everything take longer and be more frustrating to do. The changes to the council, shattered retreats and coalitions for example just make the game more tedious. If the changes you're adding don't make the game fun but just make it last longer then what is the point? All you're doing is annoying the people that are playing and buying your products; you get sick of them changing the game for the worse. That's all without mentioning waiting for them to fix bugs in their new updates, DLC and the ton of cosmetic and sound DLC for the game. The other fact is it must be so offputting for someone thinking of buyng the game fresh. There's just too much DLC. I cannot imagine how offputting all the DLC must be to a new player I mean what is there like 50+ now? I don't get how Paradox don't get that seeing a £30 game with 50+ DLCs with a price of £122 is extremely offputting especially to new players or players that didn't keep up with the DLC. I love CK, EU, HOI and like Victoria but I'll not buy another paradox game. They seem to enjoy releasing DLC after DLC that eventually just end up changing the core gameplay for the worse by making the games more frustrating and take longer. On top of that a lot of the DLC seems to change minor things yet are priced the same as the stuff that makes significant changes.They've ruined EUIV imo, CK2 isn't ruined YET but they've definitely made the game worse than it was and since they're apparently going to be releasing even more DLC for it at this point I've basically braced myself for the game to go more and more downhill. So basically I'll never by another one of their games because I know they'll release DLC after DLC that will eventually suck the fun out of the game I liked. They change things that don't need changing and add things the game was better of without and it's frustrating watching a game you like become worse. If it ain't broke don't fix it would be a good principle for Paradox to start following :(.			"

												While I love this game and have played it more than any other game in my entire life, I am nonetheless extremely disappointed with the Conclave DLC. The funny thing is, I haven't even purchased it - meaning I can't put my review on its page - but parts of it have still seeped into my game anyway.Shattered retreat is complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and does nothing except pointlessly prolong already one-sided wars. The decreased opinion bonuses from vassals make them a hundred times more of a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ and they seem to remain in factions against me even when their opinion of me is extremely high. I've heard plenty of other complaints about the proper DLC as well, like ruining the child education system and making the council as reasonable as a brick wall.It's unfortunate, really. This is such a great game, but this DLC has accentuated everything I didn't like about it and added virtually nothing in return. I can't imagine what Paradox was smoking when they made this, but until they get their act together, I can't recommend a purchase.			"

I declare independence from France, forming a phallic image thrusting into the ocean blue of the Atlantic. I wrest control of my duchy from my former liege and execute the king of France because why not.I proceeded to get my great-grandson onto the throne of the Byzantine Empire by assassinating at least 2 teenagers, unifying Western Europe and the Byzantines.Then the mother ♥♥♥♥ing Muslims and their 50000 troop doomstacks came and wrecked my realm that was seperated by all of Germany and castrated one of my vassals in rage.Would recommend for aspiring world conquerers wishing to revive feudalism.

												This was my experience:Play a few games but I don't really understand the game. Finally after an hour and a half of going throught the tutorials a second time I figure it out. Start up an empire in Iceland. I don't bother anyone. I marry a Danish girl and help out my father-in-law with a rebelion and a small war but I don't really cause any trubble. The king of Norge (Norway) keeps wanting to start wars though. One day I get a letter, he wants peace as long as I fly his flage. Seeing as my wife was sick and had died a month before and her father was now losing a war I did not have the gold to help him win I had no other choice but to submit and accepted Norge rule. Immediatly the King of Norge invites me to his grand feast. He treats me well and offers me protection and safety. Alpha as ♥♥♥♥ King of Norge fights the Scots who have been bothering me for years. I ask if my son can marry his beautiful daughter who will one day be the Queen of Norge, and without question or hesitation he sends his daughter to Iceland and congradulates me on entering the family. WIth this my son is happy and I can concentrait on my kingdom. Over the next few years I build up a great army and nearly 1000 gold in wealth. However, I am an old man. I fear the fate of my father, I fear that soon I will die. The King of Norge is not a young man either anymore. One day I get another letter. The King of Norge is plaining to invade Scotland. Seeing as my other son married Godwinson (The King of England)'s daughter I was prepared to invade Scotland and claim all of  England and thus most of northern Europe for the King of Norge. I constructed a fleet of ships, hired thousands of men from the country side and some extra mecenaries just in case, and set sail. This time I was prepared for battle, I knew what would come. It was minutes laters as I prepaired my assault that I watched a Scotish fleet came from the deep ocean and landed on my shores and slaughter my people. Half of Scotland fought me in Scotland while the other half banded together and invaded my homeland of Iceland. And that folks is the story of how Crusader Kings II gives you a cookie, lets you eat it and enjoy it before slaping you across the face and wash your mouth out with soap and hot sause. And I'll be god damned if it wasn't the most fun I've ever had. I laughed and I cried. I was filled with joy and then crushed with defeat. I was a king...I was THE KING...and then I was nothing...11/10 would loose everything again			"

												Scene: The Duke of Edessa, finally recovering from a recent Muslim invasion and the wounds suffered from it, invaded by the neigboring Byzantine Empire. His armies are crushed and his son is captured and castrated. He loses the war and is left as a one provice minor. He catches the plague and goes insane. He vows his revenge. 100 years later another Duke of Edessa and Antioch, now a vassal of Byzantium, begins revenge for the misfortunes of his ancestor. First he weasles his way into the current Emperor's inner circle and gains his trust. He then seduces all of his daughters and has a child with one of them. He then kills all of the sons of the Emperor, while luckily not being caught. He then recognizes the illegitimate child as his own. He then kills his wife and marries the byzantine emperor's daughter, who promptly dies of syphilis. He then  marries the daughter of the HRE thus forming an alliance with them. He then bides his time until the Empire is at its weakest point. The wait was not long, since 5 years later the Caliph of the Sunni faith called a Jihad for Anatolia. The emperor won the Jihad, but at the expense of most of his armies. The Duke, after waiting patiently for so long struck at the rival family. He raised all of the men of the land and used every last coin enlisting the help of mercenary bands. They marched towards Constantinople to meet the Imperial forces. After winning the battle the duke laid siege to the city. Just as the war was about to be won, syphilis struck again not only killing the duke, but his sons as well, leaving the fate of the dynasty and the war in the hands of a 62 year old, possessed, insane and childless relative. All hope was beginning to fail as the war took a turn for the worst. Then in final attempt at survival he sent the last of his armies to face the larger byzantine force. Then in a stroke of luck during the battle, his troops we able to capture the emperor and his last surviving son. He then in a bout of madness castrated all of his prisoners including the emperor and his son. The war ended and the emperors daughter took the throne, the 62 year old then attempted to seduce woman multiple times until finally it suceeded after his 65th birthday. A sickly, clubfooted, imbicile child was born, who the duke legitimized. He then killed the childs mother and himself leaving the young 1 year old as emperor. The duke's revenge finally seemed complete, until the one year old died from syphilis. (I have no idea how he got syphilis)10/10 would syphilis again			"

												The first thing I did as the King of England was assassinate the King of Scotland. It wasn’t for any particular reason. I had just started running the game for the first time, and wanted to check out the King of where I actually lived. But then I saw the assassinate button. I pressed the assassinate button. There was suddenly a dead Scottish monarch and a massive civil war.Crusader Kings II is a ‘Grand Strategy Game’ by Paradox Entertainment, a lovingly created, complex board game of Europe, where you play as historical character. Unlike other strategy games, where you’re the godly hand that guides a country or force, here you’re a Count, Duke, King or Emperor, with all the extra complexities and joys that brings. You have to handle your lineage – marry, have children, assassinate children, change succession laws – so that the game continues. It is the only must in CKII: create an heir, or on death without one, it’s game over. The rest is really up to you. You could try and forge the Empire of Hispania as one of the Spanish Catholic kings, unifying the other catholic nations there and driving out the Muslim rulers. You could play peacefully as the King of Scotland in a different game, only stooping to war when vassals rebel for their own claims on your kingdom. With certain DLC, you could play as Muslim rulers in Africa and Saudi Arabia, Pagan rulers, or even as a patrician, vying for control of the sea highways and port to get the most profit possible.The board deserves some explanation also: unlike many other strategy games, which use hexagonal or square tiles, here real counties are used, such as Gowrie, Cumberland, Middlesex, Badajoz, Leon, and Maine. And they aren’t just bits of land to get to make your Kingdom look bigger: they hold cities, castles and religious buildings that will increase the size of you or your vassal’s levies (army) when annexed and your income, from tax. You can even improve and build new holdings in these counties, to increase both of these. This is one of the many ways you spend your gold, along with creating kingdoms and duchies, hiring mercenaries, bribing the pope (yup!), assassinations, ect.Though out the game, you will be collecting this gold from the taxes, which is the commodity you will be using most often. Also throughout your characters life, he’ll gain Prestige and Piety: both add to your end game score, which you can use to measure just how well you’ve done after playing all those hundreds of years. Both also act like currencies, with you gaining prestige and piety from certain wars and events, but losing them with other events such as destroying kingdom titles (prestige), creating empire and kingdoms (piety) and reforming pagan religions (piety). Upon your characters death, they add to your score – not, however, a reason to die early.War is enjoyable in Crusader Kings II, but possibly not as important as in other strategy games. You can’t declare war, willy nilly. You must have a cause for war, the ‘cassus belli’. This at first feels very restrictive, as in some catholic countries, the only clear way to expand into neighbouring catholic nations is through the slow fabrication of a claim on the county. But eventually it blossoms into the complex strategy, as you juggle where to war with, with what cassus belli, to what end. It becomes delightfully full of opportunities. The Catholic Kingdoms can declare Holy Wars against Pagans and Muslims and claim their land, along with participating in the Crusades the Pope occasionally calls. You also have ‘De Jure Claims’, where you can conquer counties and land that belongs to the predefined ‘de jure’ duchies, kingdoms and empires, depending if you are a Duke, King or Emperor. Pagans can conquer any bordering counties, or subjugate entire kingdoms once in a life time. There is a treasure trove of reasons to war. And with your army, you can choose who leads the armies, and whether to engage them in battles against other armies, or to siege enemy provinces in the war. But it isn’t the only way to gain land: ensuring you’re the heir to the kingdom through assassinations and plots; through offering vassalization to the weaker, smaller independent rulers nearby. But wars are one of the more enjoyable points in the game, as long as you know how to handle them. There really is no better feeling than slowly building your independent duchy into a sprawling Empire over the years.It is important to say that all the rulers on the map are actively acting towards their own goals, with the games superb AI letting hundreds of characters act and change Europe, even in places far from where you are playing. It is sometimes enjoyable to pause the game, and just look around the map, at what’s happening far away. Seeing distant kingdoms fracture, far of empires grow, really gives the game a sense of scale that is great.And in multiplayer, you can have friends play in any of the Kingdoms, replacing one of the AI rulers. It can be incredible fun, with you playing as different Kingdoms, competing as you expand. You can choose whatever way you want to play with friends – you can assassinate them, declare war on them, or offer to join their wars. If they play as the same culture or religion, you may want to help them, to spread it, or fulfil goals that will help you all. With me and a friend playing Norse Pagans (Old Gods DLC), we started trying to expand my kingdom so that it controlled enough holy sites to reform the religion and grant us much needed security for successions. We’ve also had to aid each other during widespread civil and international war and bail each other out. It’s incredibly satisfying to bail your friends’ kingdom out of an independence war, and know they owe you one when you want to take over a nearby kingdom.The downsides of the game is the initial bafflement due to the complexities of how to combine all the systems for your own benefit, and the occasionally irritation caused by wars for the kingdom after succession. Multiplayer also requires all other players must download the host save file every time they play, which can be a slow, but is thankfully all handled in game.This game is one for those who wish to carve a story and a kingdom out of Europe, and are willing to learn through all the complexities and systems to do so. Once the game finally clicks and you’re away with it, it really is a magnificent game. Whole heartedly recommended.			"

												Don't get me wrong. This game is pure heroin. It's so addictive. I have about 400 hours off-clock.It's just the amount of DLC this game has that makes me not recommend it. It's worse than Civ V. The main game is worthless. If you want to actually play the game, you must buy at least some of the DLC.Stay away until the price drops... a lot. More than -75%, if you ask me. No reason to support this kind of shameful business, where the game is cut to pieces and then each piece is sold separately for a small fee.			"

												Some people bad-mouth this game saying the dlc costs too much or that they should fix this and that before adding in more. But for me a game that 150 euro (or 250 if you buy the dlc later) it been worth it, why, becuse Crusader kings 2 has given me over 1k hours (So far). That's a lot. You'd had to play more than 40 days straight non stop to catch up with that. For me crusader kings is more than a game it's a hobby. Some people spend just as much money (or more) and hours to fix a car for example. In the end it's up to you if you feel like investing time and money into it.			"

												I keep on returning to Crusader Kings II at random times, wanting to give myself a new challenge everytime.- Start an early era game and play as a Irish Cheif, just to see if I can become Emperor of Britan.- Start an mid era game and play as a vassal of a mighty sultan, and from there on try to take his place. And after that; try to convert all of Europe into Islam.- Start an early era game as a viking cheif, and turn into the mighty emperor of the skandinavian empire, which stretch all the way from Norway till rome.I keep on returning to great DLC's that don't cost much, and I can enjoy for hours and hours. And If I don't like the changes, I simply switch off the DLC...I love Crusader Kings II, my friend did good by adviceing me to try it, and I advice everyone who loves a great grand-strategy game to try Crusader Kings II, along with all it's DLC's!

												I like this game. I really do. It is well crafted, has phenomenal replayability, and is constantly being updated. The problem? The sheer greed and avarice of its creators. To gain access to the full gamut of features available to players of this game, you'll have to spend upwards of $200. Most of the ""expansions"" for this game are in the form of $15 DLC packs that add as much content as a minor patch for similar games such as the Total War series or even Civilization.Long story short, don't buy this game unless you are willing to pay nearly $300 for the full experience.

Expand a bit of the map and add a couple gameplay mechanisms--that'll be 8 pounds please (or whatever your local currency equivalent is).The money-grubbing cynicism is getting tiresome. It's £70 for the game with all the DLCs. Get f***ed Paradox.			"

												Oh the thoughts this game makes you think. ""If you have another child I'm just going to murder him as soon as he turns sixteen so his older brother Pandolf inherits the whole kingdom.""""I could do a quick raid to steal some of their gold OR I could beseige their castle, capture all their womenfolk and either sell them for ransom or take them as my concubine.""""If I press my subject's claim on a city halfway across the continent resulting in the deaths of thousands of soldiers and locals in the process, I might be able to get another half a percentage point more prestige closer to crowning myself emperor.""You start thinking about these things in the shower, then just before you go to bed, then you stay up starting at the ceiling mapping out your strategy for the next time you hop on, growing anxious if you saved and quit right at the end of a massacre at the hands of a Mongol deathstack or your infertile wife turned forty, discovered your plot to murder her and went into hiding. It will consume your life, and even work will be an endless scroll through /r/crusaderkings just waiting to get home and play this productivity vacuum.			"

												Crusader Kings II if you love strategy games this is a must have.  Start out as a low level vassel and work your way to king or the harder to achieve emperor. Start out as king and lose your kingdom or achieve greatness.  Institute rule by the fist and have vassels revolt for major civil wars.  Build up your empire to have to fall apart by your heir.  This game is a must have for any strategy game lover.  Once you get the main game and if you love it you will buy the DLC's.			"

												RIP in pieces CK2.  It was a good 4 years!Conclave patch ruined the game.  Buy and downgrade or DON'T BUY IT AT ALL.  Better yet, huehue, you know what to do. Whatever you actually decide to do, don't reward them for trashing one of the greatest strategy games ever made with the latest patch.  It's absolutely garbage in every way, from destroying the war score system to implementing extremely imbalanced laws, EVEN if you don't buy conclave, you'll still have that horrible patch ruining the game.  Oh yeah, they actually introduced coalitions into CK2 LOL.  THIS ISN'T EU4 YOU SILLY PEOPLE. WHY ARE YOU DEVELOPING THIS LIKE EU4? URGGGGHH.For the love of God, do not buy this broken game as it is.  DO NOT reward them for making extremely terrible design decisions and implementation.  If you must, downgrade and find old mod versions that are compatible with the last patch.  CK2 IS DEAD.P.S. I realize I don't sound like the most rational human being in the world.  But coming from someone with 775 hrs in the game and even more on another account, they REALLY, REALLY, REALLY messed things up this patch.  Not only that but they're also nickel and diming you for every f-ing update.  They actually released an additional CONTENT PACK for the newest dlc, conclave.  I mean, seriously, they actually did that.  /endranttl;dr, they done goofed and ruined ck2.  if you buy, figure out how to revert back to an older patch and if you want mods, figure out which previous mod versions you'll need to run on the old patch. gg paradox.

												This is something of a Gateway game to take people into the genre of Grand Strategy games in my opinion, starting you in the place of a feudal lord, merchant republic patrician or as a pagan seeking to reform their faith. I think variety is one of the most important aspects in a game and this game provides hells amount of variety and then some. The scenario is constantly changing, and I literally mean constantly changing as feudal lords die, and new rulers take their place and wars coming from the thin of air to turn the balance in their favor.The game is complicated to grasp at first, and requires some dedication and willpower to see through the initial shock of all the concepts, but it can very much be compared to team fortress and all the new weapons and learning things bit by bit. Same concept of learning, and if you ever master this game there will always be Europa Universalis IV to move onto with the save converter, or if you're feeling bold, Victoria 2.Start your character fresh with ruler designer with only yourself to expand it, and in two hundred years it could become THE leading dynasty. Pick up the Old gods and take the Norse sons of Ragnar and conquer Scandanavia and maybe even Britannia, France and the Holy Roman Empire. This is the game where you aren't restricted by anything, and in a series where alternate history is the norm.Edit: My only concern is that much of the game is locked away under DLC. While I love supporting a developer like Paradox I think I should also offer warning that playing without any expansions will limit much of your variety. I started playing the game when it originally came out and bought the DLC as they came out, but the price will seem daunting to those coming into the game. If you're just coming into the game without knowing anything, I'd recommend grabbing two DLCs in particular: ""The Old Gods and The Legacy of Rome.""			"

												Coming from games like the Total War series or the Civilization games, you might notice similarities to both at once. Think Medieval Total War played completely on the overview map but injected with a touch of Civs intrigue and a lot more provinces/factions. But that is barely, if ever scratching the surface. If you are a fan of Game of Thrones court politics or a history buff interested in having his own alternate timeline sandbox to play in, you are right at home.Want to be an English duke who sleeps with the king's wife and then assassinates said king to inherit his realm? You can do that.Want to start as a Hindu Indian raja and expand all the way to the Mediterranean while crushing the Arab Empire? You can do that.Want to be an ambitious Norse pagan in Scandinavia who amasses enough men to conquer Britain and impose the worship of Odin on all of Europe? You can do that too.Want to be a Zoroastrian prince in the Asian steppes who marries the princess of another khan but also has a b:astard son he got with his own sister? Guess what? Fair game. Before said description drives you to buy everything, be forewarned. 1.If this is your first grand strategy game, you have a bit of a steep learning curve in the beginning that, once surpassed, simply makes the game ""click"".  I absolutely recommend a must watch tutorial by Arumba on Youtube that does a far better job explaining stuff than the otherwise solid in game tutorial. You also might want to start as an Irish count in 1066 to get a hang of the game mechanics. 2. The base game has come a long way since launch and you can have a solid amount of fun with just it in your library. But the meat of the game and the huge range of choices is locked behind DLC. That wouldn't be too much of an issue if there weren't so many of them. I would absolutely not recommend paying full price for everything - sales are your friends as they usually group a bunch of DLC together for a fair price. You also don't need many of the flavour DLC. If you do buy the base game and decide to get the DLC gradually and later, for the safety of your wallet and for the biggest wealth of content, two are a must and are not expensive in sales - Sword of Islam and the Old Gods. Both unlock previously unplayable factions (aside from India) and Old Gods gives you an earlier starting date in the 9th century which many consider the best one (I tend to agree as Charlemaigne, while starting even earlier, isn't well balanced or pretty to look at). The rest you will get will be mostly based on your interests as each expansion tends to target one group of factions and mechanics.If you do have all or most of its content, you might agree with me that this is the most content packed and interesting role playing experience you have or will play in a long time. Simply for the amount of fun, investment and character immersion it is as of now my absolute favorite game of all time, faults and all. If the two points above don't scare you off, give it a chance and you will be heavily rewarded. What is more, the game is probably the best intro to grand strategy games you can find. Europa Universalis IV is another game from the same developer focusing on the Early Modern Era and it has an interesting feature where you can continue your CKII saves in a new time period, potentially making your game last for over 1000 in game years.Join in and welcome to CKII! Deus Vult!			"

												It's just awesome!This is one of the best game I've ever played so far. It's a strategy game in real time with the pause button :-)It's a sandbox game though there aren't specific targets, but you have to set your own goals, but you'll find yourself reviewing them continously adapting your strategy to either planned or unexpected events.In the game it's well represented the feudal system of the middle age, though you can start playing as Count, Duke, King or Emperor and therefore ramp up and grow your domain size caring about relationships within your own realm, your vassals and the court members, but also building alliances with other rulers via weddings.When you start a new campaign, you pick a ruler between 1066 and 1421 (Christians in vanilla, other rulers unlockable via DLCs like muslims, sea republics and pagans) and the target is to make your dinasty becoming more and more powerful. It's possible to start from 867 with ""The Old Gods"" DLC.You're noble then you should manage only castles or county having a castle in the capital (you could play as mayor if you have The Republics DLC).There are 3 types of character in the game nobles, religious and mayors which manage different types of holding and contribute to their liege's economy and armies in different ways. You can't have under your direct control all your lands, because any ruler has a limited number of holdings (demesne limit), beyond that you get huge penalty in relationships. You can earn other titles in many ways: you can inherit some lands if you're the heir of the relative title;you can speed up when this happens via plotting or assassination of the title holder or why not all the line of succesion before of you;you can push claim raising war, or even fabricate some or use claims of your vassals or relatives to raise the war and expand your realm;or why not decide to have your own antipope, which you can install, therefore having a really thankful pope, and in some conditions it will be even your vassals.For catholics the pope plays an important role, because it can excomunicate you or others, call for crusades, conceding divorces or granting you possibility to invade and therefore seize some other title.The game has also elements from RPGs, indeed any characters has 5 skills: diplomacy, martial, stewardship, intrigue and learning. And many traits either phisical traits or behaviour ones.  You can try to change skills and traits via proactive actions (ambition and plotting) or via casual events.Each ruler has a council of 5 people which helps them with specific matters: chancellor for diplomacy, marshall for armies, steward for the finance, spymaster for the intrigues and court chapelan for religious issues.There are other aspects in the game like buildings, technology research and ... All of these can be done either in single player or mutiplayer!So I've just tried to mention the most important to give an idea of what game you'll play, you're advised that this game has a steep learning curve.I warmly suggest to read the manual, see some let's play and then expirementing, and look for advices, but once you start mastering the game you'll get all the satisfaction and you'll find yourself sinking hours playing without even notice it.

												I have played this game for over 400 hours. Expanded my Empire from one small Baltic tribe. Expanded real Baltic religion to nearly all north Europe. Then - wham! New patch! Patch which broke all game system. Technology points were all gone, vassal opinions were all gone or of some enourmous amounts. Prestige points, piety points, score points, all gone or of enourmous amounts too. Contacted Paradox, asked for help - got replay that game system changed becouse of the latest patch.Okey I thought to my self, scew these 400 hours or carefull planning and conquest. I will start anew, better Baltic Empire. Not to mention the pain with Viking leaders/founders of Kiev rus and Novgorod, which are imba, packed with stats like on uber steroids, but they also get a huge packs of army right from the start. So I had to defend from them. Plan my battle carefully. Picking a place and time. I beat them in first battle and made them retreat and then - wham! New mechanic - ""Shattered Retreat"".""Shattered Retreat""So that imba unber steroid packed doom ball just retreated and I had to chase them all the way to their lands. Till I got to them, they have already recovered in morale and received reinforcements. I nearly lost that other battle. And it happened again - they just made Shattered Retreat again! And again I had to run around threw all the map just to get into same doom ball with full morale and reinforcements! But by that time my vassals were mad at me because I took their armies for too long and my gold account was empty.I have bought nearly all DLCs for this game. It's roughtly 250 EUROs and I get this, Paradox?!So this is what you developed all this time using your player community money, Paradox?!I am stating very clearly for the new commers - DONT BUY THIS GAME !!! You will be scewed up time after time and after time.Shattered Retreat mechanic was a last nail into the coffin that I am putting this game into, Paradox. You failed miserable... just pathetic.EDIT No.1: Tried to find some solution to this ""Shattered Retreat"" crap. Looked all over the internet: Reddit forums, Paradox forums, YouTube, etc. The only working solution I found was on Steam Workshop mod called ""Normal Retreat"".But guess what?! After activating it, my savefile Ironmode got corrupted. This means I can't do/complete any game achievements! Well done Paradox! I tried a new game, same thing! Well done, Paradox!!! Standing ovations!Looks like Total War games from now on.			"

												Where to begin.. I'll begin with the bad. This developer is probably the most guilty of nickle and diming it's customers for DLC. Just look at the price tag of this game 159 USD?? I'm sorry, but no game no matter how good it may or may not be is not worth such a price tag.  So, no I would never recomend this game, nor any game made by Paradox due to it's policy of overpricing, and diving small bits and bobs they've released later after the initial release of the game when they should have bundled most of the dlc available into a proper expansion pack as an honest game developer would instead of taking advantage of the consumer.                    The base game is good enough, the graphics aren't great but not everyone is worried about that. It's good strategy fun but at such a price, no. Do not buy this game, it's only driving prices for our games higher and higher, its bad for the industry and even worse for the consumer.			"

After pressing your claims on a neighbouring area (be that be a county, duchy or kingdom) you find yourself in a similar situation as 1938 Nazi germany. The whole world hates you and is ready to start a world war at a moments notice. The pope will join muslims and pagans alike in this global war against you (despite the fact you are a devout christian) and you will soon find yourself fighting on 4000 fronts at once in a war for a SINGLE province. Rather silly.Do not buy this game in its current state.			"

												A brilliant game one of my favourites and totally worth the money......if it was £30 with maybe a few £5 DLCs on topIt's not a brilliant game for almost £200 for the base game and DLC; it's been out 4 years and the base game is still £30.Give it a rest paradox, stop trying to fleese your fanbase for every penny.

												I've only played this game for a little bit, but it's definitely fun every now and then. You absolutely won't find yourself playing for hours straight on the weekend or a day off when you thought you were only going to play for an hour at most. I've never felt the desire to cancel on plans or dates with other people due to intriguing events occuring in my realm. Realisstically speaking, this game has some replayability, and though it isn't addictive to the point you actively avoid sleeping, it's still an engrossing game.Oh and you should absolutely buy the DLC when it comes out, and not when it's on sale. Paradox is extremely fair with their DLC prices and you'll never look at the 6 million DLCs and think ""wow, don't you think that's a bit much for that little content?""			"

												I just started playing CK2 and cannot believe how much I've been missing over the years.  I love history. I love strategy games.  And I love roleplaying.  This game scratches every itch that I have as a result of those fascinations.  And it's the only game that I have ever played that can do that.This game tells a story unlike any other game that I've ever played - while also providing a good dose of strategy and challenge. Admittedly, due to the extensive amount of information provided, it requires a good bit of imagination to keep up with the story - but the game comes in at just the right level of abstraction so that new things can happen every game.  Paradox clearly understands emergent gameplay - which so many modern developers fail to understand.I own the vast majority of DLC and do not mind purchasing it.  If this keeps the game relevant and growing, then keep it coming.  I do not expect developers to work for me for free after I buy their initial product.  (Plus, many of the free patches added so much to the game by themselves.  Negative reviews seem to ignore this fact.) Anyways, I've been gaming for over 30 years and have not encountered a phenomenon like CK2 before.Count me in for as long as the developers keep pushing this wonderful game forward.			"

												Was playing online with friend. Seduced friends wife but got caught in the act. Friend castrated me as a punishment. 10/10 would give friends wife syphilis again.It should be called Walder Frey simulator 2014. Seriously everyone seems to get assassinated at weddings, your spy master is constantly telling you that people are homosexual and you should execute them, your wife is trying to kill you for no reason at all, your 4 year old daughter is married to a 62 year old dwarf from northern Africa, everyone is in incestuous relationships, and you have no idea what is going on. 10/10 game!At first a lot of people are put off by the presentation of this game (those who don't play Paradox Grand Strategy Games that is). The closest the majority of gamers (apologies for the generalisation) have gotten to a strategy game is Total War, Age of Empires or Civilisation; games that keep their audiences interested by dumbing down the complexities and keeping audiences hooked with visual entertainment through battle sequences (Please note, I am not criticising; I am a huge fan of these games).CK2 on the other hand is a colourful map, on first viewing, at best. This is a game that, at first glance - and I'm extending that time period out to your first 2-4 hours with it - seems like a cold, number-driven strategy game. Something only grognards can enjoy, in between tabletop wargame sessions and forum arguments over the finer points of Napoleon's invasion of Russia.And to be fair to first glances, it is. This is a Paradox grand strategy game, one that doesn't just crunch numbers, it grinds them to dust, sprinkles them across 11,715 buttons and menu options and feasts on them. It's an intimidating game to come to grips with, in no small part because Paradox are so terrible at tutorials, and almost as bad at creating intuitive user interfaces.Stick with it, though, and my. Oh my. What begins as a blind exercise in clicking things and getting your♥♥♥♥♥kicked all over Europe slowly begins to blossom. You start to realise what those little ""lustful"" and ""deceitful"" character traits on every character mean. You realise that the marriage system is an entire mechanic built into the game, not some pointless piece of window dressing. It clicks that, outside you own little fiefdom, the game is populated by every single noble, religious figure and courtier across Europe (and most of the Middle East).In short, you realise that this isn't a game about war, or empires, or money, or some pre-anointed goal you must achieve to be the ""winner"".It's a game about people. And the relationships between them.So why is it so addicting? That's simple, because it's the only game to have ever been developed (successfully) that's about sex and politics.Most others are about killing. And don't get me wrong, as head of a medieval dynasty, there will be the blood of thousands on your hands when your game is done.But in Crusader Kings II, unlike most other games - its strategy brethren especially - the wholesale murder of your enemies is but a sideshow. A diversion. The hammer you break out when all other approaches to victory have failed.You don't play Crusader Kings II as some disembodied hand, guiding the fate of a people. You play as, literally, a character within the world, part of a medieval dynasty. You can marry. Have kids. Send them off to be educated. Educate them yourself. Choose your own council. Assassinate people. Arrest people. Chop the head off the people you arrested. Arrest their kids, who revolt after you chopped their father's head off. Ask the Pope to excommunicate them. Arrange your kid's marriages. You can even invite people over for dinner.Every time you do one of these things, your relationships with people change, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. They'll remember your past betrayals, and respect your past achievements. So aside from juggling the economy and the military of a Kingdom, you'll be spending as much (if not more) of your time juggling politics.And it's amazing. It's not until you're knee-deep in♥♥♥♥♥kissing and horse-trading (well, daughter-trading) that you realise, in all likelihood, you've never done something like this before. At least not something like this that works. And it really does work. Sure, it's based on numbers - quite literally, with each character screen giving you two numerical values, one reflecting another's opinion of you, the other, your opinion of them - but those numbers are just the game's way of communicating the complexity of the relationships, and you soon overlook them, reading past the values and seeing the overall feelings and sentiments driving them.From the mightiest empire to the lowliest county, you'll need to keep tabs on those closest to you, lest someone sneak in one night and poison you. Or stab you. Either or. If they do, well, it's game over.Oh, wait, it's not. Because this is Crusader Kings II we're talking about here, and it's smarter than that.When I said you're playing as part of a dynasty, that was only partially true. You are, but you're actually in control of the dynasty itself. So when your first character dies, provided they have a dynastic heir - whether that be a child or close family member - you take over as them, assuming control of not only a new character, but all their own personality traits, history, family and, most important of all, relationships.Say you're the King of England. You're loved in all corners of the land. But then, one day, you fall from your horse and are suddenly killed. Your son takes over, you think everything is gravy, but then... oh dear. Turns out your son is a homosexual, something jealous enemies can blackmail him (well, you, now) over. You're a coward. A weak ruler. Your wife, probably because of the whole sexual orientation thing, won't give you heirs.Before you know it, a once-happy Kingdom is in turmoil as power-hungry nobles attempt to overthrow you. You scrape your armies together, begin to crush the rebellion, advance on the final enemy, and then... you're killed on the battlefield. Your combat statistics weren't as good as your dad's, you see. You take control of your sole heir (who you suspected was someone else's kid anyway, since he was born while you were off fighting), a kid whose regent is even more incompetent than the last King, and before you know it, the throne is lost. You've gone from control of one of the mightiest Kingdoms in Europe to lording it over a few crummy towns.This should be game over. Or at least the point where you chuck it in, realising that there's no hope of victory from here. Only... remember, there is no victory. And there's 400 years of history to play through. It's entirely possible - and I know, because I've done it - to go from a King to a nobody and back to a King again in a few hundred years, courtesy of a slow and methodical game of revenge, of marrying the right people, cutting the right people's throats, climbing your way slowly up the ladder of political power.That scenario I just described? With heroism, tragedy, intrigue and scandal? It's just one story. From one game. In a complete playthrough of 400 years of European history, from the Norman invasion of England through to the 15th century, you'll encounter dozens more. Start your next game, even if it's in the exact same place, and it'll be a whole new experience. Start it somewhere else on the map and it'll be even more different still.The clashes of armies are just as important as clashes in the court or the bedroom, and by pinning a grand strategy game on your relationships with people, Crusader Kings II does just as good a job as George R R Martin has.Happy gaming!

												At first the DLC expansions sounded like a good idea.Then they started breeding faster than the Zerg.I stopped playing the game altogether because it always feels incomplete since I can't afford to buy all the (gameplay) DLCs at the rate they are putting them out.To top things off, Paradox stopped putting DLCs on a 75% off discount, and you can hope for 66% at most. Doesn't sound like much of a difference, but hey, 1000x 1 euro is a lot.Unless the publisher puts out a DLC bundle (which gives you a discount based on how much DLCs you already have) I'll probably never play this again.Whew, managed to go throught the review without comparing them to EA and Ubisoft.

												Feels great when you're playing as the King of Abyssinia and Nubia but need the kingdom of Egypt to create the Abyssinian Empire and you set up the proper marriages and your heir inherits the Byzantine Empire from your wife and your heir's heir likewise inherits the French Empire, allowing the expansion of the rightful world Empire of Great Abyssinia, stretching from Iceland to Sri Lanka.  Next game, you play as a Croatian duke and grow to take over basically everything from the Greek borders to Northwestern Spain, becoming the most powerful man in the Byzantine Empire (despite not actually being the emperor) and eventually declare independence because these ""laws"" are for lesser men.Next game, you decide to change it up and play the Game of Thrones mod and play as the Reynes of Castamere and see if you can beat the mighty Lannisters (instead of having Tywin wipe out your entire house).  After years of carefully setting up marriage alliances, you realize you may have overdone it as the combined armies of the North, the Riverlands, the Reach, and Dorne all join you to defeat the Lannisters.  But hey, as long as you have alliances with all but two of the Lords Paramount of Westeros, why not just take the Iron Throne and rule them all?Oh, don't forget the incest, murder, and seduction for seduction's sake!

												So right out the gate: Crusader Kings II is a good game. It's got scope and range in spades. The kind that you can get lost in for a dozen hours, whatever kind of gamer you might be. The mechanics are pretty versatile, fitting the sort of playthrough you're looking for. If you're one of those gamey, tournament-style players and you just 'have' to minmax to take over half the world before that turn of the century... the tools are there. More power to you.There's also some meat in here for us slow rolling guys. Come up with a neat historical premise and work it through to completion. Or get caught out and castrated by angry rivals. It's your oyster.There's also a whole lot of story going on in this completely emergent simulation. If you're like me and the thought of creating your own alternate histories gets your rocks off, then you're in luck because CKII has by far the most in-depth alt-history game out there. One start date you can create a lasting Catholic Kingdom from within the belly of the Byzantine Empire... another you can fight off William the Conqueror and retain a truly Anglo-Saxon England... or maybe you want play as Poland and take a lesson from your Slavo-Russian cousins and carve an Empire out of the Holy Roman one... Pretty grand stuff and damned rewarding in their own right. The roleplay elements are pretty slick too. The characters you play as (Moreover, their dynastic line) can get as convoluted and involved as your HBO fantasy series. The cool thing about CKII's minimalist style is that it reads a lot like a book, painting a picture in your head of vast fleets of ships and clashing armies. You start to root for these little characters as you aim for a lasting Kingdom/Empire of their very own.But this segues neatly into the game's major shortcoming. If you want a fuller experience, you'll almost HAVE to dig into DLC. It's how Paradox operates. My advice? Your best bet is to take a look at which packs are on offer and nab the ones you can see yourself getting into. Myself, I immediately went for The Old Gods expansion because I'm nuts for Vikings. As you expand your repertoire with the game, you'll know exactly where to branch out. (I also suggest getting Charlemagne if you want the ability to create your own 'original' 'new' kingdoms: like any good Alternate History buff would wanna do) It almost goes without saying that you should wait for a Steam sale if you don't want to fork over your life's savings.In the end, Crusader Kings II is far and away one of the best strategy games on the market. It's also a gateway drug for learning more about medieval history. You'll get to know everything from the Mongols to the Magyars like the back of your hand. Impress all the folks with your grasp of that sort of worldly stuff.Like I said, it's broad. You can dig into this one for 400 hours and still be surprised by the next hundred. Thumb is up.			"

												This game's learning curve is not just steep... the tutorial is garbage and only slightly grazes the major aspects of the game (it doesn't go into any of the in-depth mechanics that the game so notably advertises about, and it definetly doesn't do a good job at teaching how to play).I play all genres of games and am used to learning strange and odd game mechanics.  I am 30 years old and have been gaming since the original Atari console.  When I read reviews about this game I wasn't phased by everyone saying the learning curve was steep.  I have owned mostly every major game console released, as well as have played a few years worth of game hours in PC games.  On top of that, I have played dungeons and dragons (the dice version with a DM/GM), I have played text-based games such as the original kings quest... I have played many board games, book games, card games... etc... What I am trying to allude to is that I am an experienced gamer with above-average technical and troubleshooting abilities; usually I am the one my friends go to when they need help with figuring something out.I have spent close to 3 hours in the game and still feel I have no control over what is going on within the game, nor do I feel I have a solid grasp on how to gain control over what is going on within the game.  I understand not being able to just pick up a game and master it... but 3 hours is too long to spend in a game to still be constantly feeling at a loss in trying to do something and not being able to do it.  I can play the game, but I in-no-way enjoy constantly feeling frustrated because I'm trying to do something that I can not do.I no longer have the time I had when I was younger to play games, so when I play a game, I want to enjoy it.  I feel I would need to invest a minimum of 10 hours into this game, just to have a solid grasp on how to play it.  That is too much for me, considering most modern non-rpg games can be beaten in less than 10 game-hours.I'm not saying I'm not willing to invest hours into a game, as I've invested close to 120 game-hours into some of my games... but I have searched for more reviews and people, like me, have also had major difficulties in understanding how to manipulate the game (even when some people who are experienced in playing the game helping them).For me... with the horrible tutorial... the insanely large amount of ""buy in"" time required to learn the game... this game just isn't worth it.  There are many easier-to-play and more in-depth games out there similar to this.			"

												I love this game. The systems and mechanics seem to be balanced perfectly for emergent narrative. While the strategy is awesome, I find the best part of this game is the stories that develop from those systems.The depth is amazing. I’ve played over 100 hours now and have only really played one full game, and 2 half games. My first Ironman game (no loading saves) I started as Denmark. I managed gained Norway, but lost it despite assassinating tens of people in the succession line ahead of my heir. I made inroads into Sweden before taking it entirely (after the then King got taken down by a mercenary army), then married my way onto the throne of Lotharingia and used my new power to take Pomerania - in the process becoming the most powerful ruler in the Holy Roman Empire. I demanded independence from the Holy Roman Emperor who buckled before me, splitting the Empire in two. I basked in glory for several decades (holding several feasts and tournaments) before a massive continental war spanning over ten years, during which my successor lost control of Lotharingia and Pomerania. Once the dust cleared, I had to settle for being Queen of Sweden and Denmark. But you don't mind stuff like that happening - playing a count or a duke can be as much fun (and way less stressful) than being a King or an Emperor. I held onto those two kingdoms while gaining Finland, before marrying the Kaiserin of the Holy Roman Empire! Everything was coming up Chris, but then she sadly died in childbirth - leaving my son as the Kaiser. Comparisons to game of thrones in game form are not far off, in fact there is a mod (I haven't tried) and like GOT there is absolutely no guarantees of a happy ending. In my game I managed to become the Kaiser and clung grimly to the throne until the end of the game. All that in just one game - and I haven't even got the latest expansion yet, which adds India. The multiplayer is great too, playing with a friend means you can work together and there is someone there to enjoy the narrative with you, and leads you to great stuff like marrying your buddy (in the game) and then cheating on them. Or making them your Master of the Hunt. One complaint would be the learning curve, in that I had no idea what I was doing for the first 20 or so hours. Also periods (years sometimes) can go by with not a lot happening, but I just speed it up in those instances. Once you invest 25 or so hours into learning the game, the rewards are amazing.			"

												TL;DR: Crusader Kings II takes a long time to learn, so don't buy it expecting it to be something you can just jump into unless you play a lot of strategy or Paradox titles. If you have a lot of time to kill, are imaginative, and love character oriented games then this will probably be a good fit for you. There is a wide range of mechanics from choosing a spouse to trying to assassinate anyone (in the entire game, no essential characters). The DLC isn't as money-grubbing as it may appear at a glance. Not all the DLC may fit any one person's preferences, so I recommend researching what the expansions are and what they contain. I approve of this game!   Crusader Kings II is the game that I absolutely must review (133 hours and growing playtime). I will do my best to remain impartial throughout this review and to address the game as it is, while offering some opinions on things such as DLC, despite being somewhat biased. The game is rather difficult to learn at first, so if you are not a patient person or do not have the time to learn the game and want something you can just jump into, then Crusader Kings II probably isn't the game for you (it took me 8 hours to learn how to play).  On the other hand, if you like strategy titles, participating in assassination plots, conquering lands and have a lot of time to kill, then this might be a game that you'll enjoy. For the most part, I think Crusader Kings II has something to offer everyone, even the strategically challenged (like me. I'm awful at this game and therefore use console commands, but it doesn't hamper my enjoyment at all). At it's core, Crusader Kings II is more about the characters than conquering everything. Indeed, the game ends at a certain date (1453) rather than when everything is under one's thumb or certain conditions are met (excluding the date being reached). Characters have their own randomized events (often fun and quirky) that can shape their stats and relationships with each other. Events can range from having an affair to being possessed. Some events have choices, while others do not. In addition to events and the obvious fighting, there are also plots which allow you to do things like try and arrange someone's death through assassination, go on hunts, or hold a feast. I know I'm really starting to beat a dead horse here, but nearly everyone that has played multiple games of Crusader Kings II has that ONE character that sticks in their mind (mine was a guy that adopted a cat, lost an arm in battle, held a massive funeral for said cat when it passed of old age, and then died of an infection shortly after the cat's funeral). The characters of the player's and game engine's creation are something so wonderful.Some other mechanics include: Marriage (anyone of opposite gender can be married if conditions are met), Lovers (same-sex or otherwise), dungeons with prisoners that can be executed, ransomed, or released, fabricating claims on land to go to war, going to war, hiring mercenaries, converting areas to your religion, and whatever mods may add. The mod community for this game is really awesome, variety-filled and big!  One thing that I rather dislike, but makes sense, is that you have to have a Casus Belli (cause for war) to be able to declare war and go out to fight. This is either achieved by being of a certain culture, having differing religions, or a claim (fabricated or legitimate). On the bright side, this does prevent the AI from ganging up on you.Something rather off putting to a newcomer of the game, at least it was to me, is the large number of DLC. Most of the DLC is cosmetic in nature, while a few do add some changes to the game (improvements or otherwise, I'm looking at you Conclave). The really neat thing, in my opinion, about   the DLC that adds functions is that some of those functions are patched into the game for free. One such example would be India's landmass was patched into the game for free so that players may fight and conquer India, but to play as an Indian you must own the DLC. In terms of which DLC to buy, I'd say use the search engine of your choice, figure out what the expansions are, and then what they contain (if that strikes your fancy, of course). I will say that while amazing, I don't feel the DLC are necessary and that the base game provides more than enough entertainment, but they certainly are fun!			"

												Crusader Kings II is a great starting point for anyone who's been looking to get into the grand strategy genre but has been overwhelmed by Paradox's previous titles. Fairly easy to learn, and with all the gameplay improvement and alternative history mods, you'll get plenty of time for your money.As someone who's played over 500 hours in Deus Vult, I did find it a little disappointing that Ck2 didn't inflict the same amount of ungodly punishment that the previous games did; One of the best experiences in Deus Vult was getting beat down constantly and getting back up, but I'll be the first to admit it was probably for the best. Ironman is a very interesting feature that suffers slightly from the constant autosaving disrupting gameplay, but this may not be such a big issue if you have a good computer that autosaves quickly.Now one major concern is the unending horde of DLC. I really don't approve of the direction Paradox Interactive is going with their DLC for Ck2, paying for historical dynasty shields? Ehhhh.The game is priced at $40To get all the major DLC's (Expansions) alone costs $55As It stands, CK2 is not worth buying full price. Wait for a sale where the collection is 75% off and grab it.

												Starting as Byzantine Emperor in the Viking Age in Ironman mode, I promptly began fighting off the Muslims on the border of my Empire and reclaimed several small islands. Given my huge income of 100+ gold from all my vassals, I decided to upgrade Constantinople and many of my holdings. Hours later, I mended the Great Schism by conquering Holy Lands and declaring them mine. Most of Europe became Orthodox and I removed the Pope from his seat, leaving no Christian rulers. I was then known as ""The Saint"", and gave birth to a long line of Byzantine Emperors who ruled with iron fists, seeking to return the Legacy of Rome.After years of crusading and aggressive expansion into Italy and the Middle East, I reclaimed the old Roman Borders. The Roman Empire was once more established, but Rome was not done. All the land from Constantinople to Egypt, Egypt to Spain, Spain to France, Germany, parts of Russia, and all of Scandinavia were to be conquered. I gained the S.P.Q.R achievement for restoring all that belonged to Rome and more. Much of the Middle East was conquered and pushed back. With an income of 500+ gold a month and trading posts spanning around the entire Empire, I was set.Until it all changed, the Golden Horde formed and attacked me after I just finished off the 10th civil war to lower crown authority. The Khan stole a great chunk of land, and I was seriously low on man power. The Golden Horde continued to push foward, while my army was busy fighting off civil wars and religious rises. I finally managed to win my civil wars, and was left with a few years time to rebuild my army. 600K+ troops later with a personal levy of 80K retinues, I took back what was mine and destroyed the Golden Horde. With less than 30 years left until end game, I was looking forward to saying I conquered most of the world without cheating. Yeah, not so much. My cousin forms the Kingdom of France and fights for independance, and somehow most of my Empire flocks towards him to rebel against me. My army is cut in half, and I am busy trying to fend off France while also being attacked by mysterious figures that start assassinating my bloodline. I eventually murder all of my cousins children, excommunicate him, and then murder him. I am victorious, the Great Emperor Buoso II. Little did I know, I had a falling out with the rest of my bloodline for killing a family member. My title is usurped, and I am forced to watch as my Uncle begins to lose Kingdoms worth of land to vassals rebelling against their liege. I assassinate him and try to marry my child into power, but before I can do that his son is also killed by that mysterious assassin. This leaves no rightful hier to the Empire of Rome, and it splits apart again.Every duchy, county, kingdom, and what have you in the entire world splits up into over 500+ independant states. Everyone starts fighting for power, and I sit there having just lost a game I spent over 50+ hours on. My jaw drops. My computer couldn't handle the entire world fighting and I eventually just gave up on that game. Crusader Kings II can change in the blink of an eye.10/10. I'd play that♥♥♥♥♥♥again.I have some pictures here (not of my final result, but showing much of the progress).http://i.imgur.com/2I9JmLT.jpg?1http://i.imgur.com/REBviYv.jpg?1http://i.imgur.com/5nLhLny.jpg?1http://i.imgur.com/pYaMvOg.jpg?1http://i.imgur.com/UHs9d9a.jpg?1http://i.imgur.com/Xcqa26M.jpg?1http://i.imgur.com/Iy0Tsj8.jpg?1 "

												The title Crusader Kings 2 falls under the so-called grand-strategy games. The term is well-earned in this case and before you start the game be warned that there is a steep learning curve. Do not pick up this game if long-winded games that requires hours of hours to finish is not your thing. Do pick it up if you like games like Civilization, Alpha Centauri, or Europe Universalis. Having said that, and perhaps you do not know these titles, lets get into what Crusader Kings 2 actually is.Like all grand-strategy games Crusader Kings 2 is (but need not be, I will get back to this) for instance about creating a dukedom, kingdom, or empire, keeping those under you happy less they revolt, and creating a proper army. Unlike many other grand strategy games (outside of other Paradox titles) this game is actually historically correct for medieval europe, the middle east, and India. That is right, did you ever want to play as William the Conquerer? This game gives you that opportunity.That immediatly leads to 'need not be' clasule I said before. Unlike other grand strategy games you do not play a 'faction' or a 'nation', but you play as an individuel e.g. Ghengis Khan. The game doesn't end when you die, however, no it follows the rise (and fall) of your family as your dominion grows on the map. Depending on your succesion laws you might be playing as your oldest, youngest, or even a random family member. You might even go super modern and have daughters rule on purpose, not 'just because' the male line ended as was more the case in the time period between 769-1452 AD (which how long the games played out assuming you have two DLCs).The game features cultures (e.g. German, Anglo-Saxon, Berber, Russian, Visigothic, and Tamil) as well as religions (e.g. Hindu, Catholic, Coptic, Karasite, Tengri, Sunni, and Germanic) and this including with recently conquered, traits of a person, your history with them perhaps, can all influence what people think of you. Wil you marry out a daughter for an alliance, or perhaps with that genius of a man so you can get him to court and get a good advisor? This is all dependent upon you.Thanks to all these features, as well as the fact that once the game starts randomness kicks in and the historical accurate timeline is lost, means that you will never(!) play the same game ever again. Mechanics wise yes, but give it enough time and the map will look quiet different from last time, different kings and emperors, and perhaps e.g. the Byzantine empire might have fallen by 1100. What will you do? How will you influence medieval Europe? I say it is time to find out and play Crusader Kings 2 for yourself.			"

												Backstab, fight, talk and murder your way to victory.Wow, just wow. Another hit title by Paradox, an almost certain must buy! Launch yourself into an immersive, and ever changing campaign, spanning over 500 years (providing you have the Old Gods DLC). Ever wanted to be King of England? Kaiser of the Holy Roman Empire? Or simply wanted to be a low-lying Baron? Look no further, Crusader Kings II is for you! Crusader Kings II is certainly one of the best Paradox games out there, with a whole new gameplay interface. If games like Victoria II and Europa annoyed you because the lack of character interaction, Crusader Kings II is perfect to settle that fetish of yours.Dive into the famous Godwin family in 1066, and try fight of the Norse hordes, and the Norman aggressors, or make your own House (with the ruler designer DLC), and help it rise into the anals of history. CKII has an in-depth system of character interaction, where you can do anything from sending them a gift, assassinating them, offering them vassalage, or organising a marrage, anything is possible in CkII.Buy this game, all it's DLCs, and get lost in the (almost) never-ending and ever-changing campaign, which will get you hooked from day 1, to the end-day.Enjoy!

												This game is awesome. Start out as a little guy in Ireland and become the Emperor of the British Isles, and then lose it all in a generation and you're a count again. Except this time you're a count somewhere in Germany because on a previous character you married some German count's daughter, and he had a feud with someone who murdered all of his sons and you ended up inheriting it. Well now I guess you're in Germany so you start all over again. You fabricate some claims, and invite some claimants and land them, allowing you to take land for them that will be added to your overall realm. Eventually you're big enough and you've bribed enough people that you manage to get yourself elected Holy Roman Empire. Now the might of the Reich is going to go down upon that upstart Duke who thought he could overthrow you as Emperor of Britain.Every game can be this interesting. Try it.			"

												-Plays multiplayer as king of Denmark with a buddy as king of Sweden. We unite Scandinavia and reform the faith. I basically become the Pagan Pope.-The King of both France and Germany (Charlemagne's empire before the creation of Holy Roman Empire) dies... last and only heir is a guy exiled in muslim Spain who converted to Allah.-King of France and germany is now muslim zealot, refuses to convert to christianity, forces most aristocrats to convert to Islam and uses them to convert the people too.-Allies himself with Muslim Spain and proclaims Jihad after Jihad on us because the Pagan holy sites we captured used to be Frankish lands. Muslims form the most powerful alliance in Europa. We hold our ground, losing and taking back Saxon lands. We pillage neighbouring lands to invest into the army when the onslaught begins anew.-Catholic brits and italians send crusade after crusade to try and retake Catholic lands to no avail. They slow the Andalus down but they keep coming to die in the frozen wastes... It has been 5 Jihads now. Around 20.000/30.000 soldiers thrown at us...EACH TIME.-We manage incredible victories due to clever strategy. We counter-attack with our own holy wars because they cannot declare war on us at their leisure during truce. I take the lands of Flanders. My friend takes Germany, I crown him Emperor of the Germanic people, bulwark of the faith.-Most of France is converted now. The holy wars still rage on, though the muslim threat is being contained by a clever use of Pagan and Christian Holy wars during muslim internal struggles in order to even the odds.-The last king of Italy dies and the Byzantine Emperor inherits the title. A new challenger joins the fray. Stronger than ever. Catholic Aquitaine revolts and with our indirect help, becomes independent.-Yet it does not end... I can already hear the warcry of the faithful heathens coming to spill our blood. Allahu Ackbar... Allahu Ackbar...Ragnarok, the end times, are coming and it's symbol is a golden crescent.10/10 Would create nightmarish dystopian far-right propaganda by accident again.			"

												Thought I'd do a proper review of this game because there are none, most are just an event description or part of someones playthrough with no information about the actual game. Or something lame like ""best game ever played. the end"" Thanks for the really helpful info guys.This is a grand strategy game similar to classics like Civilization. It's set during the Middle Ages to the High Middle Ages. You take control of (or create your own) dynasty/family and try to survive. How does it play? Slowly... very slowly.The game is essentially just a huge map with a few single soldiers dotted about representing armies. You have a few menu's with options such as changing laws (which you have to wait for 10 years to change) and there is your council who can do a few things on the map such as fabricate claims, train troops, plot etc.Conquest is not easy especially if you're catholic, as its full of realistic mechanics such as the pope in his pointy hat telling you ya can't invade good christians willy nilly. But these mechanics and the random events that pop up are what make the game shine, it makes it a much more realistic and satisfying experience and some are just plain funny but they do need to be made more flexible to make the game more playable. In order to conquer someone you need to justify it, so for example you could have your son marry a local lords daughter and when they have children they will have a claim to the lords land, that's the 3rd generation! So you spend a lot of time waiting around for events to pop up and people to do the things you assign them to, building up armies, waiting to get pregnant, waiting for the children to grow up, waiting for someone to kill the other heir ect.It's like a song of ice and fire or game of thrones the game (and not that telltale♥♥♥♥♥♥ this has real freedom to create the imbred zealot dwarf family of your dreams, pushing kids out of windows and capturing concubines, smothering babies and that classic poisoned wine, each playthrough tells a unique story (if the events randomly pop up) but its in a realistic medieval setting (no targaryens but theres a good mod out there), history buffs should enjoy this game, especially if you're into that particular part of history. But like I warned you everything takes a VERY long time to do and most of the time you are sitting twiddling your thumbs which some will find boring.I've played this game for well over 300 hours on and offline and I do like it, in fact it can be addictive and the soundtrack is great too but unfortunately Paradox are well aware of how much of a gem this game is and do an EA - The Sims franchise style dlc system where they sell you the game in chunks and each time they bring out a new DLC they update the base game to balance it out so if you don't have the DLC I would imagine this would alter gameplay in a negative way. But at least with those sims games you get actual content. But what is the DLC in this? Not much really, they just add new functionality to the game which affects game play a bit and they can be fun but you don't really get a lot for your money. The game is just a huge map with a few crude single soldiers representing an army, all adding functionality does is create a new sub menu or events which are just text, so really you shouldn't have to pay for them and they should be in a free update as they are just a few lines of code or maybe Paradox should finish the game with the holes filled... I mean with the DLC options included in the base game instead of behaving like subscribed early access but everything is about money so what do you expect, this is why I don't recommend this game. Sorry fanboys the truth hurts and not all of us have loads of money. Wait for a sale or until Paradox have bled it dry and everyones bored of it and pick it up at a more realistic price, this game is definitely NOT worth £122.99 (14/02/2017). If you cannot wait until then this game is not for you, it's all about waiting.			"

It is a pure character role play orientated game where you play generation from generation of your family throughout the dark ages with everything revolving around how YOU as the player mould your character and his/her successors. This does mean that a single playthrough from just 1066 to 1453 can take in the excess of sevral days.Have you ever wanted to play as a Spaniard with Russian culture who is a staunch believer of the Zoroastrian faith and conquer Germany? In this game, you can! That is just the tip off the iceberg of insanity. I have had a succession war with my 1st born son who was also the SPAWN OF SATAN, literally a hell baby.Now understand this game can be daunting to new players especially because there are no real good tutorials provided by the game. That is definitely a shortfall and has to be made up with Youtube tutorials or experienced friends who play the game. The other problem is how random some events can be which can royally screw over a fresh game. I wont go into details but I am sure many of my fellow players can recount situations the destroyed their games. Also It pretty much a requirement to get game mechanic DLC such as Old Gods and the Republic to get the most out of the game. That is the only real problems I can think of with the game. Otherwise its an excellent game with challenges and character driven role play. Fantastic modding community always re-inventing the game and extending the hours of life this game has. I don’t think this game can be adequately compared to any other just because how unique it is.I rate this game 11/10			"

												Hello, thanks for buying this game. Would you like to start as a ruler you enjoy? Buy this DLC... Would you like to start in an earlier time period? Buy this DLC... Would you like to have a feature that should be included in this game? Buy this DLC... Want to be able to accomplish some of the achievements in the game? You must buy DLC... That's right, you can't even get 100% achievements without paying more!I just hate DLC driven games, it is criminal, I bought a shell of a game and now must pay more to make it more immersive.			"

												The best way to describe CK2 is with the stories you create. So here's a tale that happened a long time ago in the far away land of the domains of the Wendish Empire. Once upon a time, there was this Emperor of the Slavs, called Grozscon, who was a magnanimous person, a true born leader and a great military strategist. He arose to power in the age of 22, after his father and elder brother died in a battle against rebels.  At the age of 30, he already had conquered most part of the Holy Roman Empire, the Balkans, Scandinavia and most part of Russia. When he completed his 55, he started a great campaign to conquer England. In one of the battles, his youngest son, Dobieslaw, died. But that did not distracted the old emperor and finally the war was won.  As we grow old, our health start to fail us, and this was no different with Grozscon. He was diagnosed with leprosy, the purgatory in earth, so they say. And at the age of 81, the old emperor passed away, leaving 4 sons and 3 daughters.  Hir heir, Boleslaw, also had leprosy and was at the final stage of the disease and died with only 4 months of ruling. The Empire was in the hands of the grandson of the great emperor Grozscon, who was called Mieszko, The Effeminate, Duke of Silesia.   Mieszko was a poor ruler, a cruel and sloth person, which made him very unpopular with his vassals. Therefore, rebellions started to appear in every corner of the Wendish Empire, leading to great civil wars between Mieszko and his uncles. While the empire was in great chaos, the marvelous Empire of the Greeks flourished and grew strong and eventually took many provinces from the Wendish Empire. The Holy Roman Emperor, ever the opportunist, also invaded and at the last the Pope in Rome called for a Crusade against the Wendish Empire.    Mieszko now finds himself deposed, with only a count title in a god forsaken province and watches in despair as the Empire is thorn apart by endless wars and new rumours comes from the east, were a man controls many riders and conquers everything his set his eyes. 10/10 Would play again and kill all the sons except the perfect heir "

												I painstakingly micromanaged my first born son's education, choosing his educators and rotating them to ensure he got a well-rounded education.When he turned 16, his attributes were solid, particularly in martial. My warrior son will lead my empire into the next generation!Then, I saw that he was gay.Not a big deal. My gay warrior son will lead my empire into the next generation! So, I got him a wife, hopefully to make him forget men.It seemed to work. Just a while later he asked to join the Varingian Guard. I gave him my blessing. My gay warrior son will fight heathens and in killing them forget about men.Two years later he returned to me. He was blinded and castrated. My gay warrior son was now mutilated and a eunech. I ordered him to take his vows and he quietly lived out his years in a monastery without eyes or gonads.My second born son will lead my empire into the next generation!			"

												This game is realy good. And, if you want, you can makes stories out of it. Like my 200 year gameplay as house Breizh (Kingdom of Brittany) A nice story, but i cant remember it good enough to tell it :(But you can make better stories, or create big country... or a little one. You can start big, you can start small. Maybe you are a vassal? or maybe you want to play in Westheros (GoT mod)? You can do it in this game. Just buy it... but be carefull.This game have one problem (besides occasional bugs) many DLC´s. You want to play as pagan? DLC! You want to play as a horde? DLC! You want to start game in earlier? DLC! You want to play as muslim? DLC! Republic? India? DLC!But not only big ones, i can understand those big ones. But things like, make african... their color (hope it sounds ok), or indians, arabs, franks, germans, norse, finns, russians, and so on and so on. Or MANY other things, as a DLC. But if you can buy it, or live without it, you gonna have a GOOD time.			"

												I learned a lot of geography from this game and EU IV.Seriously, come trivia night, my geography is really on point. Capitals, country locations, rivers, I know that stuff.Which is nice.This may be the most complete and well rounded historical simulator available, and its mechanics are unique without being gimmicky. You see CK2 is about forging a dynasty, which is a fancy way of saying a rules heavy family. It's technically sandbox and you can have quite a bit of fun with it. You can roleplay as the traits that you have, or just try to make every character into Julius Caesar, or just keep assasinating popes, forever and ever. When your character dies, whether it be at 4 or 88, the play goes to the direct heir, whether he or she be 4 or 88, and you are given control over their decision making process. As long as your dynasty has not died out in terms of inheritance laws, and someone in your dynasty has a sufficient title the game will continue until it stops after maybe dozens or a hundred hours of game play. You manage titles under your realm. Count is the lowest, than Duchy, than King, than Emperor, with some variety on the names depending on your culture. The key here is feudalism, that is vassalage. The standard is to pledge fealty to someone of the next higher title, who then pledges fealty to the title above them. This standard is never reached unless you conquer the world and make it be reached. In general, there will be sovereign Dukes, Counts pledged directly to Kings, and Emperors often forgo vassal kings. You have advisers which are assigned from your court,  which is a pool of loyal or disloyal followers whom you can consider for various roles, and to accomplish various tasks. These advisers assist you in running the operations of your feifdom, and allow religious, educational, espionage, stewardship, and martial decisions. Each character has an RPG style stat for each of these, and these along with a portion of your wife's stats and your advisers stats creates the stats used in game for you.Key decisions in this game are marriage, and war. Marriage is the influence you have over your dynasty, and you can get good traits, titles, claims on titles, or political alliances in exchange for the matrimony. Wars allow you to cement alliances and shape the geopolitical landscape. There is much more to the game, as it has surprising complexity, but this is not to be a guide.The game is visually very appealing, despite largely being a giant map. The music is nice, and even after several hours you may not be bored. There is also a ton of DLC for this, for better or worse. These are largely all expansive on the game, and most will be on for most games. Some like the Sunset Invasion are cheesy alternative history which you likely will not want on at all times. There are an absurd number of starting rulers at any of a number of initial scenarios, and a bit of imagination makes all interactions fun as you write your own story of world history amongst the players who have interesting personalities derived from their traits. This game remains an absolute treasure, and is still updated from time to time.			"

												As I'm coming closer to the 300 hour mark I think it's my obligation to honor this game with a short review.Crusader Kings 2 is one of those games that just provide you with everything you personally ever wanted in a strategy game, though you never knew that you wanted that before you tried it out. How could I have known my weakness for arresting and torturing christian priests wandering the plains of Russia?Sure, getting started can be rough and frustrating, as the tutorial barely scratches the surface of the ocean of possibilities that is CK2. And even now, after burning more than an entire week of my precious life time with this game I still learn new mechanics and features every time.But once you understand the main aspects it's pretty easy getting completely absorbed in this medieval reality show where you are both director and protagonist.And after I fought the emperor in an open revolt, trapped him in the Alpes where his great army died of starvation, and then duelled him in personal combat on the highest mountain surrounded by thousands of frozen corpses, stroke him down with my Damascus Steel sword, spilled his blood on the snowy plains, and then took the emperor's crown from his dead, cold hands, while ... simultaneously seducing his wife - I knew I would love this game. If you also want to spend your nights creating your own historical BBC documentary I'm the last person to stop you.All you need is a strong imagination to fill the ugly text boxes with life and perhaps a full wallet if you intend to participate in their crazy DLC policy. Which I would only adivice you to do if you already know that you're addicted anyway.			"

												While truly there are lots of things to enjoy about CK2, and everyone finds his own most favourite part in this game, I personally find the stories it creates the most exciting part about it. For example, this story happened just yesterday.One day my character was chilling in a carriage in his old family lands in Hungary when suddenly he was ambushed and taken prisoner by some weirdo in Brittany. The freak tortured my character with rats. What is worse, I had no money to buy my way out of the prison. At the same time, my lovely new wife became pregnant, and, for obvious reasons, this could not be my character's child. After the first daughter came the second and only then my unwitty spymaster uncovered that the weird guy and my unfaithful wife had an affair! Sadly, due to my liege's incompetency in managing the realm, my lands were constantly pillaged by vicious pagan tribes, leaving me with almost no income. Moreover, the regent that was installed to rule in my character's place was a nice and a charitable guy. He shared all of my petty income with the starving and underprivileged. He did not like my character either and never agreed to anything I have asked him to do. My poor character ended up in a dark and cold oubliette after his friend tried to rescue him and failed. He soon passed away, betrayed by everyone. He only needed 20 more gold coins to buy his way out...Soon after the news reached Hungary, king's brother was selected as the new king. Being an envious, lustful and ambitious fellow, he always found his brother's wife to be prettier and more attractive than his own. He immediately divorced and married the unfaithful widow. A few months later, the new king decided to relieve his stress by embarking on a carriage trip to his old family's lands, when suddenly they were stopped on a road by a group of french-speaking hoodlums...

												This is essentially Game Of Thrones: the game.In my first game, I played as an Irish ruler, and got him married to an English lady to cement an alliance, allowing me to begin a conquest of Ireland. My wife proceeded to bear me daughter after daughter, which due to the country's male inheritance laws left my vassals unhappy.Then, her father dies and she is left as his heir - she returns to her home county in England. Whilst there she bears two more daughters (seven in total now!), which seemed a bit off with me as how can she have my children when in another country?It emerges that she was sleeping with a local Bishop. I realise I need a new wife if I'm to ever have a male heir, yet I can't divorce her or I'll end up making enemies of the English. So, I start a plot to assassinate her.The very first person who offers their help with killing her? The bishop she was sleeping with! And he'll be most valuable, having lots of ""access"" to her! My plot is in motion!And then, said Bishop gets royally drunk and blabs about the entire thing to everyone, my wife is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ everyone thinks I'm scum, and I have a troop of daughters at my ankles.Damn fun game, the emergent gameplay is outstanding.

												If you are buying this game, remember that you are not buying a complete product. You are buying a platform for DLCs which are the vast majority of the game. Paradox restricts you very tightly as to whom you can play, and when you can play, and what you can do if you do not buy hundreds of dollars of DLC. I personally think Paradox's DLC model on this is very unethical and would not reccomend this game to anybody who wanted a full game for a reasonable price. You can only play as western christian rulers from a relatively narrow timespan if you do not have dlc. Paradox seems to have gotten better with this, as EUIV has a DLC model that allows a full gameplay experience without DLC, but the DLC enhance it, but this is just a demo to make you want to buy dlc.

About half the world is left unplayable due to the inability to play as Muslim and Pagan characters. I'd be completely alright with this if they weren't in the game to begin with, but it's not. It doesn't feel like an expansion pack, it feels like unlocking bits of the game.I'm honestly surprised EA didn't make it. I'd be completely convinced if it was broken and buggy.

												This game down to it's core is politics at its basest form.♥♥♥♥♥kissing the powerful and the many while plotting to become the powerful. It's also  a very archaic form of politics since current politics only♥♥♥♥♥kisses the powerful.This game is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to get used to, I personally had a lot trouble getting into it. But give it enough time and you'll find it quite simple and even 150+ hours in I'm still learning a few extra tricks to give me more advantages. Another thing you might find daunting is all the DLC and there is a LOT of DLC, it will give you a lot more hours and I mean a LOT more hours of gametime as you play the different types of religions/governments.It also remains quite true to how large kingdoms and empires were run. The bigger they got the weaker the ruler at the top got, since you have to appease all your vassals and pray they start a revolt that you can put down.If you're not sure if you want to play this game there is a demo available, so you don't have to take a gamble with this game.Now I shall get back to kissing the asses of all my vassals!

												This game basically runs like a diplomacy simulator, enabling the player to build their own dynasty the way they want it to be. With an array of different options at your disposal, and a citizenry to keep happy, Crusader Kings can present a challenge. Using Historical time periods and even historical heads of state, The appeal of Crusader Kings 2 moves beyond lovers of Diplomacy games. Dealing with Heir's, Vassals, and underhanded siblings, Crusader Kings allows you to micromanage your dynasty, enabling a player to give their line a personal touch. I don't typically go for these types of games, but in fairness, it is fairly well done and offers a lot of playability options so I have to recommend it if that is the kind of game you enjoy.			"

												I used to ship this game and with over 800 hours (I have a lot of offline time, trust me) I believe I can say that I’ve played through the majority of what this game has to offer. I won’t even lie, I have enjoyed this game immensely throughout most of my hours played and I think it is a good game everyone should experience at some point during a sale. However, that all changed when the updates attacked.*proceeds to stare at the DLC using peripherals* He whispers solemnly, “I’ll be seeing you in a minute”. I have played this game for the better part of two years and I have to say that I absolutely hate the direction of the updates placed upon this game. Even though you can opt for old versions of the game in beta, I feel as though the game has moved backwards at times. 	My most recent issue with the game stems from some bull crap I got during a war I started with Norway in Scandinavia. I attack and completely decimated their army, I also managed to take their capital and 80% of their fiefs (got like 1/100 percent for it). Even so, the war percent dropped form 80% to 30% in a second for no reason, I wasn’t even attacked. Long story short, other countries attacked me after like 30 years of holding all their counties and I lost. The game has some serious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to work out and I’m tired of sitting in a game for hours on end strategizing for it to all crumble away due to unexplainable ♥♥♥♥ery. I’ve seen a lot of crap in my days playing this game (Believe it) but boy does this♥♥♥♥♥♥takes the cake. Nothing close has ever happened to me like this before the recent updates (At least not at this scale). I even summoned 7500 troops using my massive prestige and I was still defeated out of some form of broken attrition.	Now for my biggest gripe about the game *Walks over to DLC and whispers in its ear* “Its’ time”. Holy crap this game has more DLC then fricking Total war games. I bought the vanilla version of this game on sale for what I though was a reasonable price. However, shortly after I bought it, they released a “complete” edition of the game which I thought was all of the DLC. WRONG! I’ve never been angrier about making a video game purchase in my entire life. I would rather rebuy No Mans Sky than rebuy the entire game I had with DLC for another 40$ (which was cheaper than just buying all of the DLC). You would think they would at least give all of the DLC to me (you know... since it’s “complete”). Seriously this game makes EA look generous. I appreciate buying DLC if it adds flavorful content and improves on the game, I’m all for it! But when your game pushes out tons of DLC and about 50% of it is complete garbage, usually priced at 15$, it makes me question my sanity. Ps. Despite all my rage *rock music intensifies* I still recognize that I can raid Rome to the ground, kidnap the pope and sacrifice his corpse to Thor. If it wasent for all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t DLC scamming and crappy update direction that somewhat makes you feel as though you need to buy certain DLC, this game would be perfect. Really tired of being treaed as a wallet by developers I put my faith in. TLDR: Don’t get shafted by this game by buying it with a bundle. I recommend buying it for like 10$ when it goes on sale again for the vanilla game. There are some good DLC like Viking Conquest etc. but make sure you read all the additional DLC reviews before purchasing. Yes I am mad.			"

												It all began in one small kingdom. I was a wise king, who married Hungarian princess. We had 2 children, one daughter and one son, my heir. My wise uncle taught my son everything he knew. I had one very trusting vassal, who had stronger military than me. Luckily, he was my close friend, and he wasn't greedy, so I didn't have to assassinate him. I appointed my cousin to be a regent in case of my death, just until my son grew up old enough to rule. Everything was perfect, peace and prosperity ruled over my kingdom. But suddenly, I fewer hit me. I fell into bed and never recovered.My regent took over. His wife was an arabian princess, who was a bit greedy. She plotted to assassinate my son who was soon to become the king. Regent knew this, but decided not to imprison his wife, instead he waited. Her plot was a success, the heir was dead and her son became new heir. Feeling pressured by his council, new king, my cousin, imprisoned his wife for murdering my son. She was prisoner for 2 years, then he decided to execute her so he could get married again. He married a Hungarian princess (I guess it was in our blood to love Hungarian girls :P) and he also married his son to the princess of Aragon.My vassal didn't mind the change, he respected the new king, but hated his son. Finally, our army had become stronger than our rival's and we attacked. We crushed them and made their old ruler our vassal. Alas, not all was fine. The king was injured in a battle and became incapable of leading the country. Soon after he died. His son took over the title. But now, he had a problem, his father's most faithfull vassal hated him and became his rival. He tried to bribe him and award him honorary titles, but that hardly worked. He had even sent official diplomatic envoys few times to try to sweet talk the vassal, but that didn't work either. That had a great impact on army size of the entire kingdom since almost half of that army came from that vassal.The old vassal, whose kingdom we conquered saw an opportunity. He plotted to kill the new king. Other vassal supported him. The new king found out about it and decided to act. He had tried to imprison the old bugger, but he failed and there was full scale war again. Except now, their army crushed ours. The king was captured and assassinated, his wife was banished and his child was made a puppet king. The old bugger was a regent and controlled everything. One day, petty little king was playing on the balcony and suddeny, the edge of it collapsed, the child fell over and died on the spot. The old bugger became the new king, he betrayed and assassinated the other vassal so he couldn't betray him. He hunted down and killed or banished every member of my dinasty. And that was the end of my royal family.If you have read all of this, I can go on with the actual review. As you can see, this is just one of the many stories you can create in this game. It gives you a lot of possibility for replayability. Also there is a Game of Thrones mod, which is awesome.BUT, I will not recommend this game because of it's awfull DLC policy, which shows no respect for the new players. Sure, the game is regularly on the sale, but that doesn't justify that price. So, just like in my EU4 review, I will join the protesters against this kind of DLC policy and will NOT recommend this game. Paradox should learn about DLC policy from CD Projekt Red.			"

												Crusader Kings II is a Grand Strategy game based around familiy dynasties, political power mongering and in short - trying to make sure you have the biggest wealthest family in the world. The game spans ~400 years of historical time between 1066 to 1453 and offers historical events and references that you can either choose to follow or create a new alternantive timeline from. Do you start a 'War of the Roses' battle? Does YOUR family takeover the Papal? Building relationships, marriages, alliances and faking claims is the key. If this sounds all very Game of Thrones then you're right - it is. Crusader Kings II is the best GoT game on the market at the moment, and that's all thanks to engine being used.Crusader Kings II is the end result of many years of creating and improving on Paradox's Clausewitz Engine (the engine responsible for Cruaders Kings, Europa Universalis, Hearts of Iron franchises). If you're familiar with those games, you might feel familiar with CK2, but the truth is this game goes beyond what the engine has produced before hand. The Clausewitz Engine is in sense the major selling point behind CK2, so while the graphics aren't anything special (and are little more than 3D Marker Pieces) the true beauty unfolds as you play.I can't think of many greater feelings than the moment you're 50 year plotting to get your Grandson into place of power from his lowly Duke title to Lord pays off. Sending your Master of Whispers into a neighbouring region to spread lies and cause dissent amongst the vassals, while you forge a plot to fabricate claims to the title and ursurp the Lordship. So good.Paradox have managed to support the game well since release in the form of DLC Expansions, which have opened the game world up and expanded the 'fringe' empires to be just as complex as the 'key' European ones. However they've also supported the game with post-release patching and balancing, so they're not ones to sitback and take your money.I'm honestly finding it hard to explain this game, the only advice I can give is; if you've ever wanted to play the Game of Thrones this is the closest you'll ever get. In fact, do yourself the pleasure of visiting: http://citadel.prophpbb.com/forum3.html and checking out the amazing Game of Thrones mod these guys have been making over the last year or so (WARNING: May contain spoilers for TV viewers).

												(I'm french, so sorry for my mistakes)This game is one of my favorite game ever so far. I got it a year ago and I'm never bored of this game. With each DLC that came out, the game became sometime harder, sometime easier, but I am not complaining about it. Each extensions gave something new to this already awesome game. However, some of those DLC shouldn't exist because they are quite basic, like the Old Gods or Sword of Islam. This game is always a suprise because there will always be something strange that happens, like a jihad for Denmark, or a crusade on France. If you like ahistorical game, this one is for you. Oh, and did I mention that you can lay in multiplayer? The multiplayer part of the game is awesome, even if the servers are unstable. You can so so much stuff stupid with your friends! For example, nearly half of my play time on this gamer is on multiplayer with only one friend!And for those who seek a challenge, try to do the achievements of the game, some are quite hard and will ask you a lot of time of practice! (Kingdom of David for example)As a conclusion, I do recommend this awesome game and if you ever buy it and like it, try the multiplayer with 5 or 6 friends, you'll never the world the same way, especially if you have the conclave DLC.PS. Again, I'm  sorry for my mistakes. "

												This game is fun and all but it gets repetitive quick. If I bought the DLC it would probably fix this problem but their is too much DLC and the DLC is too expensive for me to consider buying it even on sale. I can't recommend this game in good faith because of the exorbitant amount of DLCEDIT*******I managed to get my hands on most of the DLC for under 10 dollars canadian. I have concluded that  owning the DLC makes this game a genuinely great game. However I will still not be recommending this game based on how ridiculous the amount of DLC is. If anyone who is reading this review plans on just buying the base game with no DLC DON'T DO IT you will be bored out of your skull. I cannot overstate how boring the base game is.

This game however with the DLC can be amazing at best, but a lot of the time you are gonna need a lot of patience. Overall, the game is great but beware of the DLC and the fact that buying one of these games form Paradox will likley lead to many hours and possible purchases of other Games such as HOI IV and VIC II. A great game for a Grand Starategist!			"

($5.00)And that's only the DLCs that actually add new Mechanics to the game. There's another 50+ flaor packs that add skins and music that cost upward of $100 altogether. Seriously, this is an amazing game that I'd reccomend ONLY if you buy the dlc on sale.			"

												  (sorry for the length)  A constantly politically shifting and difficult Europe centric world where you can form your medieval kingdom the way you want it, if your many enemies alow it. The game itself is pretty amazing in scale and with the newest update pretty difficult. Your goal shouldn't be to build a sprawling empire, but to get your family to stand the test of time (that's not to say that controlling a centralized depositic empire is a bad thing) and Paradox is still updating the game and adding more expansions onto it, that's not even mentioning the amazing mod's for the game, if you are in to game of thrones or warhammer, post apocolyptic America, more historical accuracy, less historical accuracy, ect.  If you survive through the ages you can also convert the map file to Europe Univerails 4 and play in a new age, which is nice if you like EU4. (It hasn't grown on me)  The game can get pretty ridiculous too, hilarious at times like when your 8 month old daughter is friends with a 41 year old mercenary captain who is never around. Or when the king of Sweden and Finland inexplicably becomes sunni muslim, and is then promptly assasinated by all of his coutiers and vassals for their religous differences. Good times...  You'll need a powerfull rig though if you want to play all the way though, like with all paradox games it slows down over time, and that's a bummer, though there are probobly mods that remove detail from the map and such. The Price is also pretty steep when you look at it, but if you get it on a sale and don't buy the artsy dlc, it's... do-able. It makes sense considering the game needs a good computer to run it on.  If you are buying the game to play with friends, all players will play with the dlc of the host of the game lobby, so only one of you will need the dlc. When I've played multiplayer games I have played with mod's, and experianced a lot of desync's, which essentially end the game, which is upsetting, but that might just be me or the mods (Dragons in game of thrones mod)  Also if you click or press buttons duing the loading screen the game might just crash. It's because of the game engine from what i've been told. 10/10I bought the artsy stuff too, skins and such (but not the E-books) all the crazy, amazing, or just plain ridiculousness of the game is what earns it the description of ""Grand strategy""			"

												Not the most intuitive game, but if you invest the time and do some research it is one of the richest grand strategy games around. It's defiantly a niche title but if you like grand strategy, paradox games or the feudal system then you will love this. The game has major crashing issues and I had to roll it back to 2.0.4 to get it to run.			"

												There's some pretty ♥♥♥♥ed up♥♥♥♥♥♥going on in this game. I recently played as the glorius Sultan of Andalusia. At the young age of 9 I ♥♥♥♥ed my mother and got her pregnant, wasn't my proudest tumble, so I got rid of that child. Later on my disgusting mother slept with the heathenous Pope as a revenge for killing our son. I decided to let the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ live just to have someone to torture on a bad day. My mother on the other hand I caught plotting to kill me so I hanged her. During my reign I lost an eye, an arm, a leg and was severely injured multiple times, but my excellent military knowledge served me well throughout the years. It was a good reign, the Sultan died a natural death at the age of 74. Long live Andalusia!10/10			"

												I started in Ireland, and converted everyone to Catholicism, cutting down on alot of violence.Then my king was murdered by his wife because she was cheating on him with his brother. My King's son became king and all the bishops hated him and he had like 20 children, so I was confused.Then I found out he was a master seducer and had had children with literally EVERY SINGLE FEMALE (except for his mother) IN MY COURT. He sudenly fell off of a castle after almost every single lord in the kingdom (totally not started by me) plotted his death.Unfortunately, now the rest of the lords had become pagan and Ireland was conquered by a holy war from the final Catholic province. My only surviving descendant was gay, and cowardly. He didn't last long...10/10, would plot against Master Seducer again.			"

												As someone with both an interest in history and a 100% non sexually interest in incest, this game easily got my attention at release. Since then many things have happened. More hilarious bugs have come to live and Jews jewing Jews in Judea have come into play as well. The gameplay is, like in all Paradox games, bad. This, however, doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it. As with all Paradox games, you will eventually get to live with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ness of it and end up deriving a form of masochistic pleasure from the game. 10/10, Mikkels Games NetworkSigned, Mikkel the Great, Steam Explorer, Internet Celebrity, Cult Leader, spokesperson and lead developer of MekkilsSuperHaus.PS. The game is highly recommended to be played while hungover.			"

My First Proper Game- Start out as a single province in Ireland.- Set up my court and give out titles.- Get married. Make an heir.- Everything is going amazingly.- Declare War on the neighbouring province.- Win the war flawlessly.- Give province to my most trusted courtier.- Declare War on the another neighbouring province.- Win the war flawlessly, again.- Give province to my other trusted courtier.- Life is going incredibly well, soon Ireland will be mine!- SUDDENLY, one of my stupid vassals rebels for no reason!- Crush the rebels and go completely mad, imprisoning him and all of his family then executing them all! No mercy for traitors!- Everyone hates me including my wife!- People starting plotting against me left and right!- I get super paranoid and start executing everyone!- My other vassal rebels.- Some random place I've never heard of declares war on me.- My army is totally crushed.- Laugh like a mad man and lose EVERYTHING.- Game over.10/10 would go completely insane and lose everything again.

												Crusader Kings 2 is real time/paused strategy game developed by Paradox Interactive. Same developer who made other great games like Europa Universalis 4, Victoria 2, Hearts of Iron 3 and Stellaris. This game is based on Middle Ages to start of renaissance, where EU4 starts. Without DLC starts around 1066, but if you have dlc\'s like Old Gods and Charlemagne you can start it on 700\'s.However before saying this game is all about invading other lands like Civ and Total War, no. Because this game is unique. You rule your dynasty and lead it through the age. You have to control your family by marrying other people for example Holy Roman Empire\'s princesses. Then you extend your family and realm. Same time there is world map, where you can invade land, like in every strategy game. But only land available is Europe, North Africa and part of Asia. There are many events in this game. I\'ll explain hordes, rebellions and crusades in this review. There are many hordes. For example Mongols and Abbasids. If you have Sunset Invasion DLC, Aztecs are gonna invade Europe too. Hordes born quickly and rise by invading all neighbor realms. They are hard to defeat but they collapse easily with rebellions. Rebellions are events where claimer of duchy of puppet state declare war on country and try to switch government or get independece. That\'s why you see all rebellions threats on your intrique menu, so you can prepare at threats or plot to kill threats. And last, crusades. If you part of catholic or orthodox religion, pope or archbishop might declare crusade to invade Jerusalem, Anatolia or any lands where real life crusaders were. You don\'t have to join crusade but if you join and get most points you\'ll gain all lands that were invaded in crusade.Family relations are pretty important as your sons that have bad relation with you might try to kill you or start rebellion. And affairs are just gonna anger your wife and your children. However having family member in countries like Holy Roman Empire might help you make alliance with them, so that is useful. On my game, I just spammed my every daughter on big countries, HRE, England, France and Byzantium.Combat works really well, but units are pretty hard to make and army levies might rise too big.Overall this game is great and I had alot more fun with it than with Civ or EU4. I recommend it!			"

												Easily one of the most entertaining games Ive ever owned. I picked this game up for 10 dollars on sale, and for the first time ever I feel like I owe the company more money for what they provided me!Disclaimer: This game has the absolute steepest learning curve Ive ever overcome. The tutorials are pretty useless, some are broken, and dont explain features too well. Most everyone learns how to paly by watching youtube videos, of which there are many excellent series.Disclaimer Disclaimer: This is not for those who enjoy fastpaced gameplay. It is not like the Total War franchise where you take command of your armies. The entire game is played out on the map. That all being said with a little patience and little imagination this game offers literally endless fun. So many different ways to play, every single game will be different. And if any of you people out there are familiar with the phrase ""Its fun to loose!"", then this is for you.Youll get so many cool stories to tell, and the community is nothing short of wonderful. Everyone is helpful and polite (for the most part, much better than most other communities). Highly, highly recommend this game. 9/10.			"

												Crusader Kings 2 is probably the most reactionary game ever made. Imagine Game of Thrones without the fantasy stuff. This is a game about killing your kin to steal their lands, diplomatically marrying daughters off to sadistic freaks, crushing peasant revolts, and crusading against the Mohammadeans. Whether you chose to play as the Holy Roman Emperor or the count of a single back country province you’ll have plenty of court intrigue to keep you occupied. It is ½ grand strategy game, ½ dynastic RPG, and 100% awesome.With the various DLCs you can play as non Christian religions too. I highly recommend picking up at least the Sword of Islam and Old Gods DLCs so you can play Muslims and Pagans respectively. "

												You know, ive been playing paradox games ever since europa universalis rome and in that time iv e played at one point or another most major paradox titles espically their strategy titles.Now out of all those titles, crusader kings 2 overall  probably isnt any better than its counterparts europa 4, hearts of iron 4 and victoria 2..but it does have something that none of the others do..in fact while the aforementioned games are  similar to each other crusader kings 2 stands out..europa 4 attempts to combine various aspects from  all of these titles into one large jack of all trades that everyone can enjoy, victoria 2 embraced the economic side of paradox strategy with some hearts of iron style warfare..hearts of iron 4 while a massive improvment on the third entry in that series is still a war sim far far more than anything else.Crusader kings was intended to be grand strategy meets rpg, and it pulled that off wonderfully in the process however something uniqe and special in the gaming world was born..something that i have never been able to find a sutiable comparison for when looking at all aspects of a game..there just isnt another game that pulls of making you feel like you are that indivudal king or queen even though you arent because they are often actual historical charaters .so that every year of thier rule feels personalized to you despite the fact that the game isnt tryin gto say YOU are that ruler.At the same time your ruling for hundreds of years over dozens of rulers so how could each ruler feel individual, and to an extent that applies however..imagine the old idea of re incartaion, throughout the eons you are reborn essentialy the same sould but into different bodies and lives ((or as a tree)) adapt that slightly and you have what playing a ruler in crusader kings 2 feels like.Now i could elaborate further as i intended to cover the other points i wished to make but this review is getting a bit long so ill wrap it up...there would have been at least four blocks that size.The point is this game does something you will not find anywhere else, you may find individual aspects in other games or even a combination of a few but overall there simply isnt another comparison, at least not yet. So very simply put if you like the idea of roleplaying as a king or queen while running a country paradox style than this is the game for you.			"

												Crusader Kings II is the sequel to the by now fairly old Crusader Kings and in true Paradox tradition it improves heavily upon every single aspect of the game. In particular the move to the Clausewitz engine needs a mention because it allows a game like Crusader Kings II to fully achieve it's potential in a way the previous game never could.The game is a dynastic Grand Strategy game. This means that while you still take control of a single country like in other Paradox games are you not just some faceless entity behind the screens, you actually take control of that country's ruler and upon his or her death, take control of the legitimate heir to continue your reign. This makes controlling a country and leading it to greatness a much more personal experience as it's your family that's leading the charge, with the various offshoots that didn't manage to become King constantly plotting how to remove the current favorite.In general much of the game will be spent dealing with your family and their thirst for power. Through a number of laws you can select who is the heir and how he or she is chosen and you can fully expect that anyone who doesn't not currently top that list will be working diligently to remove the one that does. And it's not always the best outcome when your able and strong son suffers an untimely accident and your gluttonous greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who is surprisingly proficient at intrigue becomes the last heir standing.Like in most of Paradox's games warfare takes the front seat and it is the prime method for which to expand your lands, wealth and prestige. However Crusader Kings, through this dynastic system makes great strides towards making peacetime more interesting. The bigger your family, the more vassals you have, the more options will be available to you during peacetime and you will often have to work hard to keep your Kingdom stable. The option for marrying off unwanted sons to powerful widows is also a very effective way to increase your lands as you may one day some generations from now find yourself the heir to whole new territories. Quicker with a little creative assassination.The graphics of the Clausewitz engine are beautiful although that is never really a necessity or a priority of a Grand Strategy game, particularly not a Paradox one, but it is nice to see that there's improvement on this front as well. The music is heavily mood setting and wonderful as always and the many small music DLC's available helps improve the selection tremendously.All in all, Crusader Kings II does not disappoint as it proves itself a great sequel to a great game. Everything is simple better. A true must buy for any fans of Grand Strategy or Dynastic games. And for anyone that simply thinks incest is hilarious.Also, completely irrelevant to the game, I'd strongly recommend that you go watch the ""Seven Deadly Sins"" trailers on youtube that were released as promotional material before the game came out. They are definitely worth a watch whether you want to play the game or not.			"

												The best (it's clear that Paradox own the genre, but this is their best one) Grand Strategy game. Whilst fans of strategy games may miss the interactive combat, this game makes up for it by being more interactive in other aspects such as diplomacy. Take your house and make it last throughout the ages! Who doesnt want to conquer the world? It is one of the most complex games I have ever played and the learning curve is extremely steep, yet through playing the game it is easy to overcome (tutorials are provided, but they arent the most in depth). The game has multiple DLC packs (which arent required, but they do make it more fun) and is being updated regularly. Be prepared to become frustrated; I built my custom house (DLC) and it lasted throughout many centuries and when it came to  the 6 Generation, I was emperor of The Byzantine Empire, Britannia, Francia, The Holy Roman empire. The person I played, was infertile, and all other relatives had been killed off or were women (the game is against women, the populace hate you if youre a female ruler), my character died and with it my House. 100 hours I put in, to lose.But remember, losing is fun!9.8/10 losing the .2 for castration being available to only greeks.

												Crusader Kings 2 is the campaign of Total War, set to focus not on a nation, but on a family.  Your house must become as powerful as possible, this involves a lot of political manipulation and throwing money around.  As I say, the game is the campaign - there is no real control over your battles like in Total War, what you enter the fight with is all that contributes to your victory.  That is a shame, hopefully by the time Paradox decides to do Crusader Kings 3, they'll have worked up the nerve to go for it.While I cannot recommend the game to every type of strategy game fan, this one has been a lot of fun for me, and has presented me with a lot of challenges.

												After a dozen games that ended misrably for my character and his dynasty within only a few years after starting the game, I have finally started a game that lasted for more then twenty minutes.I started out as Leon, and all was well. Nothing happened, all my vassals were cool with me. Then I realized my kin in Aragon started to invade the moslems below us. Not wanting to be overpowered by Aragon a century later, I proceeded to take a small coastal province. I then promptly forgot what I was doing and spammed summer fairs and feasts for a decade or two.When my first character died(Alfonso), he had quite the sum of prestige(around 500 or so). And, with the game engine doin' its thing, Alfonso's succesor(his son Alfonso) got around 200 prestige. Following his dear father's footsteps, Alfonso Jr. spammed the ever-loving crap out of feasts and festivals. But, not more then five years into his reign the pope rang him and asked him to join in a crusade against the moslems. Coincedentially, the targets for Christiandom's righteous wrath happened to be the nation directly below me.So, of course, Deus Vult and all that. I invaded two small provinces in the first part of the crusade. After conquering these two places, I sat on my bum and waited the crusade out, jealously guarding my newly acquired lands.Then, suddenly, as though the Heavenly Father himself thanked me for my participation in the crusade, I acquired half of Spain.Not really sure how.But, Now my prestige started to sky rocket. First, it was 300. Then it was 400. Then, 500. 600. 700. And on, and on and on it went until I had nearly 900 prestige by the time I was thirteen. Que another decade or so of me stealing tiny chunks of realms from the muslims that remained in Spain. Not only was I the terror of the muslims, I had backed the nation of Aragon into a corner, with only two land-locked provinces and a handful of coastal lands.I then married the Queen of France.And, by the time I reached my mid twenties, I was the stuff of legend. Having already held my Grand Tournament and accumulated nearly 2000 prestige, I was on top of the world. Loving wife how owns the entirety of France, promising sons, total alegience of all my vassals.Then I became a homosexual.Nothing wrong with that, not even my vassals batted an eye at it.But they started to get worried when I went insane. Barking at people, wearing shoes as hats, the usual crazyness.I also happened to be fighting a war with Britain in defense of France at the time, all while manipulating the law to make my son's kingship more secure.Then I ♥♥♥♥ed up. I failed to see that choosing Senoirity as my inheritance guideline, I completely removed all of my children from the line of inheritence. Instead, It was my cousin.But, you know what they say, practice makes perfect.TL;DRBecame one of the most legendary kings by the age of thirteen, married the queen of France, went insane screwed over my family. This game is a must buy.			"

												TL;DR: 9.9/10 (nearly perfect). Pros: too many to quickly list, see paragraph below.Cons: steep learning curve, and potential expense of the full (& extremely important) game in the form of tons of DLC.CK2 has quickly become one of my favourite games of all time. This game is such a fun mix of history/alternate history, intrigue, state/empire building, and ruler simulator. The possibilities available (with all the DLC) are so numerous that during the 400+ hours I’ve played I’ve barely scratched the surface. Wonder what would happen if the Vikings had conquered, held, and integrated Italy into the Swedish or Norwegian kingdoms? DO IT. Getting tired of the Catholics attacking you when you play as the Umayyads (muslim rulers of the Iberian peninsula)? Holy war all the Catholic countries, take their territory and convert their populations to Islam; Rome the center of Catholicism? Not any more! take it from the Infidels and make it Sunni (or Shi'a), or if you're not muslim then convert it to Norse or any of the multitude of diverse and historically accurate religions .  The possibilities for epic, ""world"" conquering and non-historically accurate shenanigans are nearly infinite.  Let your inner history nerd free, and mess with the world in a fun, engaging, and often very personal way. Another important aspect of this game besides the world conquering/state building is the character aspect.  Instead of just playing a country you are actually an individual (a count, duke, king, or emperor).  Individuals have traits which affect (positively or negatively) their stats which in turn affect the functionality of your state.  There are thousands of unique events for your character to “interact” with, adding an aspect of role playing that is not merely a side thing but a full fledged and fleshed out mechanic.  All the possibilities and outcomes an individual character can experience keeps the game from being just another conquer the enemies territory and “take over the world” (brain) game and elevates it into a unique class of it’s own. There are only two negatives to this game, both of which ultimately don’t affect it's enjoyability. First problem is the price of the game and all it’s DLC. To get the best (and “real”) CK2 experience you really do need all the DLC and when it’s not on sale this game can cost $150+. Lucky the game goes on sale frequently and I’ve been able to (over some time) acquire all the DLC for much, MUCH less than $150. I don’t know exactly how much but it’s probably only like $40/50. Buying the ""complete package"" at the start when on sale costs $40 and is definitly a perfect deal.  Le'ts just say that despite not paying $150+ for the game I've definitly gotten WAY more than $150 worth of fun from it. I'm glad I didn't pay that much but now that I know how good the game is and if I had to go back & pay the full price I wouldn't hesitate.  The second problem is the learning curve. Being a grand strategy game there is a MASSIVE amount of stuff to learn.  I’m not the sharpest tool in the shed so it took me a good 50+ hours before I was confident enough to say I fully knew how to play.  The 50ish hours I spent learning were fun but I didn’t realize how amazing this game is until I actually got fluent in the game (around 100+ hours in).  Now though that i’ve “mastered” how the game is played I struggle to name a game I’ve enjoyed playing more (ok I know: The Binding of Isaac/Rebirth).  One way to help speed up learning the ins & outs is to watch tutorial/let’s play videos. There is a youtuber named Arumba who is not only extremely entertaining but is also a CK2 master.  Watching his CK2 content really helped accelerate my enjoyment and understanding of the game. I fully recommend watching some tutorial/let’s play videos while/before playing the game, it’ll help alleviate some of the frustration/insurmountability and intimidation the first time you boot CK2 up.  I can’t recommend this game strongly enough, it is gigatons of fun. I also recommend Arumba if you like LP’s and funny/entertaining yet not idiotic/spas-tic presenters then Arumba should be topping your list of ppl to watch. (FYI: I have no affiliation w/ Arumba nor do I know him, I’m just a fan making a recommendation)			"

												Just... if you have a life, stay away from this game.Imagine taking the Sims. Now, make every character in the Sims religious and despising every one else that's not their religion. Then make them ten times more evil. Now, give them an inordinate amount of power and make them kings of lands stretching from Iceland to Bengal. Add a sprinkle of chaos and human interference, and you have Crusader Kings II.You control a king or doge and guide his actions and rulership. Be a tyrant, be a ruler of a docile disposition. Just keep a hold of your vassals, win the elections, and make sure to kill that kid that has a claim on your title.Often events pop up that give you options. However, the effects of your decision are neatly laid out for you, meaning there is little sense of randomness of what happens. You pick the thing with the best effect. The events are sometimes repetitive, and you always usually end up choosing one option throughout all your playthroughs.Although there are characters with traits and personalities, you as a player will, unless you diliberately keep your character's traits in mind, play to your own wants and needs of the game, not what the character you are controlling will want. The game's overall very fun, but lacking in documentation, and for a Strategy/RPG, does little to encourage the RPG side of things. The game's tone is usually serious and historical, but occasionally tongue-in-cheek. (especially if you get the lunatic trait) Sometimes, especially with DLC, the game can become fantasy or simply ridiculous (e.g., in Sunset Invasion the New World, more specifically the Aztecs, can colonize the old world, instead of the other way around. In The Sons of Abraham you can father or mother the spawn of Satan unknowingly. Unknowingly, that is, until he kills your entire family, leaving him as the only heir, then killing you and taking your throne.)In some ways this game is ""How to be an evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 101"". It has a freaking ""evil plan"" mechanic for crying out loud! In others it's also ""How to be a Radical 101"". Christians can go on Crusades, Muslims on Jihads and everyone else on Genericly named ""Great Holy Wars"".This game is also great if you like Game of Thrones. Murder? Check! Incest? Check! Anyone can die, no matter how important? Double-check.I'd recommend this game to the following people:Evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥sReligious RadicalsStrategy FansParadox Interactive FansGame-of-Thrones FansPoliticians			"

												You know you’ve been playing too much Crusader Kings II when you start arranging betrothals between your and your friend’s children and spend the rest of your time musing on heraldry. Crusader Kings II is an ambitious strategy masterpiece full of intrigue, diplomacy, and war. The player controls a single noble dynasty through the European middle ages in a world as changeable as it is engaging.One word I would definitely not use to describe Crusader Kings II is ‘accessible’. When I first started the game, I had to sort through dozens of menu screens and tabs trying to figure out to do. I can’t be sure, but at one point I think I accidentally attempted to abdicate the Duchy of Kent in favor of my Norwegian half-brother. There certainly were helpful messages and tips in great abundance, but if I really wanted to spend an hour reading, I would be downloading O. Henry short stories, not starting up a new game.Once you do get the hang of the controls, though, Crusader Kings II opens up to almost endless possibilities. You can expand your dynasty by clever power play, strategic marriages, or through military force alone. If you work hard as an impoverished count, your grandchildren could be kings and queens. In a game revolving around diplomacy, however, the AI can be a little off-putting in its lack of complexity. While computer players are reasonably clever, they always make the most rational choice, which makes you feel a bit out of place as you attempt to coerce an Arabian sheikh to help you to invade Sweden.The graphics are nothing to write home about, unless you wanted to let your folks know that games can be released in 2012 and still run on any computer more advanced than an abacus. The Crusader Kings II interface is basically a detailed map surrounded by different menus. If you weren’t wearing your glasses, it would look a lot like Total War, only you can’t zoom in for battles- all physical conflict is resolved off-screen as you watch the number of troops still alive decrease. The constant music definitely helps to distract from the less-than-interesting graphics. The same tracks are played over and over, but they’re epic enough to make it worth it.The beautiful thing about Crusader Kings II is the way it generates stories through emergent gameplay. Take King Tudwal the Great, who loved gardening but would occasionally fly off the handle and kill his own family members, or Count Oberto, who despairingly turned to a scholarly life after failing to find a bride for his homosexual nephew. These aren’t characters you find in most Triple-A games.If you only want to relax for a few minutes, you would probably be best served playing Plants vs Zombies, but if you want to spend a challenging 400 years taking over medieval Europe through vilest treachery, Crusader Kings II is without rival. Now if you’ll excuse me, my uncle just raised the banners of Scotland in rebellion against his Welsh overlords.			"

												I always review the games I buy, and I usually do it after having owned and played them for around a week. CK2 is different, and in order to review such a game I had to play it more. And more, and more, and more, until finally, I believe that I have played this game enough to say that this is the best game that has ever been made! A game with both such depth and width has never been made before in my opinion.Here you can murder your son simply because you want to marry his wife, or you can seduce your sister if you want to go a little bit game of thrones. Speaking of game of thrones, if you get your hands on someone you don't like, you can torture, mutilate or murder anyone! In times of need you can even become a cannibal. Want to discreetly get rid of an annoying uncle? Put him in the vanguard of your armies, or fabricate false stories allowing you to imprison him without opinion-penalties from your subjects. But who cares about their subjects? Just imprison him and execute him publicly without reason, beacause you are the lord!I approve this message.			"

												The armored Cataphract regiments from the Komnenian household guard led my Anatolian armies in the east while a smaller force of Varangians led a simultaneous invasion of muslim-held Sicily in the west. Infidel armies were crushed underfoot, provinces fell one by one, and the petty emir's begged for peace as the Byzantine Restoration swept to all shores of the Mediterranean. ""Good!,"" I said, ""this was getting too easy!"" when the Sunni's finally declared a jihad. My forces took the initiative and several large mercenary companies and 20,000 Byzantines landed near the Nile before the first infidel armies even reached my borders. Small muslim armies were swatted away as they attempted to repel my invasion, but they were no match for my men as we ravaged the Egyptian delta. The Shiites declared their own jihad against the recently ""liberated"" sicilian holdings a few months after we landed in Egypt. ""Whatever,"" I chuckled, ""the mighty sons of Rome do not fear a these desert men!"" I recruited more mercenaries and landed in Sicily just as the first Shiite armies began to trickle in by boat. Each month brought a fresh wave of infidels and we crushed each attack and pressed on with the sieges.But months turned in to years, and the trickle of muslim armies became a steady stream of larger and larger enemy armies. My fleets began to frantically criss-cross the Mediterranean, ferrying whatever regiments I could spare from theatre to theatre to counter each wave. My men were winning every battle, but we were losing soldiers faster than they could be replaced. I watched in disbelief as my army and Varangian core in Sicily was overrun, trapped, and annihilated, and the Shiites crossed the strait to capture my holdings in Italy. Then my armies holding eastern Anatolia were forced to pull back to a defensive line near the Bosphorus as large muslim hosts pressed towards my capital. My Egyptian invasion force had been significantly weakened by endless waves of Sunni's, and the desert sun was killing even more. I evacuated Egypt and pulled back the remaining armies to regroup in Greece.My war chest was also running out, which forced me to disband the remaining mercenary companies to keep them from rebelling, and scrapped large portions of my fleet. My disbelief turned to horror as the Shiites landed in Greece and the Sunni's crossed the Bosporus and laid siege to Constantinople. I gathered what remained of my fragmented forces, nearly 20k men, around Athens and won a close battle over a large Shiite force that had crossed into western Greece, and finally convinced the desert men to agree to peace in exchange for the Sicilian duchy I had won years earlier. My men then charged north, defeating a small muslim host that surrounded Constantinople and relieving the city for a few months. But another Sunni host of some 50k crossed the strait soon after, forcing my army to retreat and threatening to destroy my last hopes for the Restoration. The situation had gone from dire to impossible.And that is when they appeared- A force of 50k imperials arrived on a fleet outside my capital, led by the Kaiser himself. A few years into the war, I had arranged for my son to marry the daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor in the west, and although he had officially joined the war in my defense, up to this point, I had only seen a few small inneffective armies in Italy. I marched the last sons of Rome north-east, and joined battle just as the Kaiser landed at the head of his great army. Together we overpowered and crushed the muslim forces, and the Kaiser's fleet prevented a muslim escape into Anatolia. The infidels were completely destroyed. Soon after, the Sunni's finally agreed to a white peace that left my Eastern empire intact. I never forgot that the true sons of Rome had been saved by the pretenders in the west, and our alliance lasted for generations until the new Roman Empire and the title of Augustus was finally restored.For those of you wondering, this did actually happen during my play through way back in 2013 and it was the reason I became hooked on CKII until I eventually graduated to Europa Universalis 4. This game is unique in the strategy genre and I would recommend it to people that enjoy the Total War series, but always wanted more depth in the character aspect of the game (e.g. Kings, Princes, and Generals). If you are on the fence about this game, then check out a few of the Game of Thrones mod videos on youtube- I never played the mod, but watching the LP's sold me. Enjoy!			"

												I'm embarrassed about how much of my life this game has taken.  Can we petition steam to just turn the counter off after 150?  literally the only thing stopping me from playing more is that I don't know if I can look myself in the mirror if I pass 800hrs, I mean who does this ? (797.1 hrs on record at time of review)  That much time would firmly establish someone in a new career.  does this make plotting and Holy Wars my career of choice? I'm really ok with that now that I think about it.Really an excellent game though I can't recommend it highly enough to those who are drawn to this genre			"

												I was just walking on the beach and then suttenly i hear some strange noises from the forest and i walk over there and see that it is some cult doing a ritual of some sort, then they ask me to join them and i say yes and they gave a black rope and a wizard hat. Then they show me there holy book and i start studying it and i find out that there is some god there is older than all the other gods which is sleeping under the sea. So im like ""Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥"" but i can't walk away becuse i have already clicked yes, so we go out to the sea and the people start saying strang words like ""oug hhsjc xbao"" and then i see some big shadow coming out of the water. Then a popup comes up and give me the decision to either scream He comes!HE COMES or try to stop it, so i try to stop it by getting a longboat and sailing to the monster. A popup says that the monster have a human-like body and tentacels on its face that loks like a sguid. I ram the boat into the monster and syddenly i woke up in my bed covered in sweat, the guards say they found me laying on the beach and i asked if they saw the monster but they dident know what i was talking about.I got the trophy called ""Godslayer""Then i relysed...I KILLED CTHULHU, HELL YA!Best game ever 10/10 will always play again.

												This is a great medieval simulator. The combat aspects are extremely downplayed leaving you to focus on your court polotics and intrugue. You play as a medieval lord ranging from count to duke to king. You journey through time making plays for power within your kingdom you will advance through lines of succesion to the next generation. Go on crusades to claim the holy land from infedels, and wage holy war against the pagan heathens, all the while staving off rebellion and rogue lords attempting to usurp your domain. This game features rts sandbox and rpg aspects and it well worth the  sale price of $10 for the vanilla client. IMO the republic dlc, the old gods dlc, and legacy of rome are the most worthwhile and neccesary dlc. The rest mostly just come down to personal preferance and what you think you will play.You can find plenty of mods on the paradox forum including a game of thrones westeros mod (the whole time i was playing vanilla i was wishing there was a game like that and when i found it on the forums i was ecstatic). The middle earth mod and tamriel mods are in development as of yet.If you are unsure about buying this game give the demo a try or maybe check out some lets play videos on u tube. Overall this game is wonderful and deserves your attention if not only briefly to experience the greatness that is ck2.			"

Run AWAY!BUT if you do give into temptation:As the King of Castille I once went very much insane.  I was convinced I was possessed by the devil and whenever we had fish for dinner it would talk to me while it was on the plate.  Jesus whispered military advice into my ear and I became an unpredictable brilliant tactician who no one could withstand on the battle field (probably because I was so insane).  10/10 would be possessed, talk to fish & Jesus again.

Crusader Kings II is a medieval politics grand strategy game. Maneuver nobility relations as you seek to expand the power and prestige of your dynasty, generations after generations.Pros: Where to begin? There are countless characters (thousands): barons, counts, dukes, kings, courtiers, family members and everything in between for every city, barony, county, tribe, sheikdom or other political region denominator. Relationship behaviors are based off a multitude of character and personality traits. You manage a character, and upon death his heir, then his heir, through centuries of history as kingdoms and empires rise and fall, acquiring lordship over titles through conquering armies, political weddings, intrigue and backstabbing. The base game is set specifically for Europeans during the crusades, while expansions add Northern Africa, Middle East, Scandinavia, Western Asia and India, with each distinct culture and religion having its own tribal, feudal and monarchic mechanics. Many random events allow you to determine what type of person your current character becomes, engrossing you in the story of each of them, influencing and determining the fate of any trivial or world changing event. The game is regularly and constantly being updated: I'm not only referring to the multitude of DLCs that add historically accurate ethical portraits and cultural armory, but actual core mechanics are regularly revised, enhanced and added to by the developers. The game is fully open-ended, and leaves you to determine your political goal. Do you wish to rebuild the Roman Empire? Unite Great Britain? Overcome enemies in a world-wide crusade? Overthrow the Pope? Found Ukraine? Survive the Mongol onslaught? Endless possibilities!Cons: The game has a high learning curve, and new comers must be willing to put in hours of learning, trial and error, and tutorial reading to understand how every mechanic works. Graphics are passable, barely enough to serve the game's purpose. Even at easier levels, difficulty remains high and players must be willing to go through constant frustrations as you are limited to decisions your character makes as a single person, which means there is no direct control over the outcome of battles, plots and events. The game can be slow at times, sometimes requiring months, years, decades and even generations of in-game time to bring any plan to fruition.Verdict: ★★★★★ - Play this. Now.This game isn't meant for everyone. It requires a lot of patience and dedication. But the game can also be immensely rewarding when you successfully achieve your goals. This game left me retelling the tales of how, as a count, I married my firstborn son to a duchess so that my grandson would inherit the king's throne (and expected to play that character two generations later), just to have my second son get branded as a kinslayer for killing his eldest brother, becoming my new heir and throw my entire plan to smithereens! The game is addictive, so if you have the patience to play through Cruisader Kings II's demo tutorial, you just have to get the entire game!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												After 1800+ hours playing Crusader Kings II, the most recent DLC and free content expansion, Conclave, has forced me to withdraw my formerly enthusiastic approval.  CKII used to be one of the premiere Grand Strategy titles available.  Sadly, over the course of several expansion/DLC releases the game has lost its way, becoming increasingly tedious and straying far from the original wonderful gameplay.  The Conclave DLC and the accompanying free content patch was released completely unbalanced and apparently largely untested.  It caused a widespread negative reaction which forced Paradox to immediately begin work on a fix patch.  That patch, now in open beta testing, goes a long way toward fixing the worst of the problems.  Unfortunately, it doesn't go far enough.  The root of the problem is that the entire concept of Conclave makes councils far too powerful.  The intent of Paradox seems to be to make the game more difficult and thus hinder the ability of players to ""paint"" the map all in the color of their empire.  The intended result was achieved.  And now the game is a mess of micromanaging council votes and council favor which detracts from the initial design concept of a fun game focused on dynasties and war in the medieval period.  Paradox might as well change the name of the game to Crusader Kings II: The Council -Hindered, Blocked and Trolled.  The game is no longer focused on dynasty and conquest and religious fervor in the medieval milieu.  Now it is just a grumpy, greedy pseudo-democracy council simulator set in a medieval era with the player forced into spending inordinate amounts of time dealing with fractious, constant council problems almost to the exclusion of everything that once made this a great game.   Congratulations, Paradox.  The greed pushing a need to continually release more DLC to line corporate pockets has finally sent the core game into oblivion. You succeeded in satisfying a vocal minority who wanted the game to be more difficult (with no proof that many of those who complained had even played the game beyond the Easy setting).  In return, you've so drastically altered the basic gameplay that Crusader Kings II is no longer really about Crusader Kings.  You've turned a fine Grand Strategy game set in the medieval period into something entirely different. Short of removing the Conclave DLC and the free content expansion entirely, there is no fix for this.  The game has moved too far from its original design concept, which attracted many of us to the game in the first place.  There are other better democracy simulators available.  They aren't Grand Strategy games; but neither is Crusader Kings II since the changes of the last expansion.			"

												The CKII Experience:1. Create an awesome looking character with so-so traits.2. Marry a  princess from some far-flung kingdom.3. Sire some children (and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s)4. Use your so-so council to spread your influence over nearby lands.5. Fabricate some claims, infuriate some nobles, and rise from a count to a duke.6. Your character becomes depressed, stressed, and possesed.7. You die in a Viking raid from some distant pagan chiefdom.8. Your heir, despite your efforts, becomes a tyrant.9. His councilors contstantly join plots to kill him and eventually his siblings rise up and, with the help of the freaking Holy Roman Empire, revoke your titles, imprison and execute you.			"

												An amazingly realized strategy game. Unlike other series in the genre of strategy concepts aren't as abstract. Allowing a level of immersion and even storytelling (your own, a true sandbox) to take place on a playthrough that just doesn't happen usually in the genre. It has an elegant and easy to use interface, the biggest learning curve is the terms used I think and sheer information to take in. Unified Ireland, usurped the Scottish throne, plunged the region into years of endless civil war. 10/10			"

												A complex game to get into, however a fantastic piece of strategy gameplay focusing on the people that run the areas, and the political intrigue and interactions. Where political machinations and plots are more important than raw military might.The DLC expansions are also excellent adding even more events and ways to play. I've personally played as the Irish, and the Norse ancestry Scots in the Old Gods expansion, and the game changes considerably between the cultures, which is interesting. And of course there is the Game of Thrones mod, which is just icing on the cake.			"

												This is my most played game. What can I say?  I just killed 2 of my grandson's and my son, so that my second eldest son would inherit the thrones of Absynnia and Nubia.  My selected heir has taken the throne and I've decided to try and declare a holy war against my Sunni neighbors to the north who are involved in a huge civil war.  A big mistake, I've miscalculated.  My levies, along with my Vassal's and a regiment of mercenaries are overun by superior numbers as we tried to siege their stronghold.  We're forced to retreat. I sue for a white peace.  Luckily, thier own civil war pushes them to accept.  It is costly, my prestige takes a hit with the added insult of losing half my coffers in the treaty.  My armies now lay in tatters.  Time to lick my wounds and take lesson from my hastily planned attack. Next time I will be properly prepared.  Next time, victory will be mine.			"

												Crusader Kings II is a game from those masters of ""grand strategy"", Paradox Interactive. I never played the original Crusader Kings, but Crusader Kings II has been one of the most consistantly enjoyable experiences I've ever had with a strategy game. Even with 150 hours under my belt, I'm still gaining skill, and with every DLC, I'm encountering new events and new ways to play. Even the base game is a delight to play, but unlike many other games, the DLC is actually worth having, and every major DLC expansion adds a new dimension to the gameplay. When I first started playing, even with just a couple of hours of experience, I knew enough to be competitive. If you're new to Paradox Titles, I'd suggest checking out a ""Let's Play"" on YouTube, or reading T.J. Hafer's wonderful ""Crusader Kings Chronicles"" on the PC Gamer web site. The game is a sandbox, so your goals are your own. You can try to create an Empire, or you can just try to hold on to what you have at the start of the game. You can use military conquest to expand your holdings, or you can strategically marry and assassinate your way into greater power. Your options are limited only by your cunning and imagination.But it's so much more than just a strategy game. It's also got roleplaying elements. Every character has a set of five stats that range from 0 (totally incompetent) to 20 or higher (genius) that determine how he or she runs their County, Duchy, Kingdom, or Empire. Diplomacy makes your vassals and your neighbors like you more. Marshal determines how well you command your armies. Administrative determines how well you manage your finances, and how large a territory you can hold personally. Intrigue determines both your ability at plotting against your enemies and discovering plots your enemies are making against you. Learning has an effect on the rate of technological advancement, and several other factors.In addition to these five stats, each character has traits, both positive, like ""Brave"", ""Diligent"", or ""Just"", or negative like ""Craven"", ""Slothful"", or ""Arbitrary"". There are also numerous ""neutral"" modifiers, like ""Honest"" that increases your Diplomacy, but decreases your Intrigue. There are also genetic traits that can come into play, both good and bad. The first time you have a ""genius"" child, you'll be jumping for joy, and the first time you have an ""inbecille"", you'll be wondering how hard it would be to ""dispose"" of him. But be wary. That imbecille might be the only hope of continuing your line.Because that is what the game is about. It's not about your country. It's about your dynasty, your family line. Even if you start as the Emperor of the Holy Roman Emperor, and wind up as the Count of some random backwater in Eastern Europe, so long as your family line continues, your game continues. But even if you are the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, if you have no remaining members of your Dynasty, then it's game over.It's a complex, but not complicated, game. Make no mistake. There is a learning curve to this game, but once you've learned the basics, you will find yourself coming back to it again and again.			"

SummaryAn amazingly complex and engrossing game that can make the hours fly by.ReviewCrusader Kings II is difficult to classify. It’s a grand strategy game, a sandbox game, and in some ways a political simulator. It also happens to be one of the best role-playing games I've ever played.  I’m not even sure where to begin describing it, but what I can say without reservation is that it’s extremely immersive and fun, which is quite a trick that developer Paradox Interactive pulled off when you consider that the vast majority of the gameplay takes place in menus.The premise is deceptively simple: you play as a king (hardly a surprise given the game's title), and your number one goal above all else is to have an heir in place who will claim your throne upon your death.  When your character dies, you assume the role of his heir, and so on down the line of succession.  Die without an heir and it's game over.But of course it’s not quite as simple as that.  As a king, you’re naturally going to want to expand your realm and accumulate wealth and prestige, and this is where you find the meat of the game.  When you start, you can choose to play as anything from a lowly vassal like a duke or a petty king ruling a single province to a monarch of an entire country.  This also serves as a secondary way to adjust the game’s difficulty since a duke or petty king is going to have a harder time of it than the ruler of an entire nation.And this is where things get interesting.  I call Crusader Kings II a role-playing game because it’s all about navigating the treacherous path of court intrigue and maintaining relationships with the other characters in the game.  Sometimes you might want to have a good relationship with someone, or sometimes you may want them to think very poorly of you, and there are numerous means for doing both, from performing favors, or handing out honorary titles (including Court Jester, which never makes the recipient happy), or even straight-up bribery.  If you have a troublesome vassal, you can try and woo him back into your good graces, throw him in jail, or plot to have him killed.  Any action you choose will always have long-term consequences, for good or ill.  For instance, if you arbitrarily throw someone in jail, or attempt to have them murdered and it’s discovered, you’ll take a relationship hit with other characters almost across the board, and this could be a problem if allies refuse to come to your aid during war, or you end up with a revolt on your hands, or other characters hatch their own plans to kill you or your heir!  It all becomes a delicate balancing act as you try to keep your friends (and enemies) happy while scheming to steal land and titles out from under their noses.In addition to good old fashioned political intrigue, you will also encounter a number of random story vignettes that present your character with various choices that create a short, branching narrative, the ultimate consequences of which could be positive or negative, depending on your decisions.When things come to blows, and they inevitably will, it’s time to raise an army and clash steel.  Unfortunately, this is not the most engrossing part of the game.  Your armies march around in multi-unit “blobs” represented by a single soldier sprite with a number indicating the size of the army and a small line representing its morale.  Essentially, if your numbers are higher than an enemy army’s numbers then you’ll (most likely) win the battle.  And that’s pretty much all there is to it: march your “blob” around, defeat other blobs, and lay siege to enemy provinces until your war score reaches 100% and you can force your foe to concede to your demands.  I’m not saying this is necessarily easy, and wars are extremely costly, and sometimes you’ll be thrown an unexpected wrinkle that will turn what you thought was an easy victory into a crushing defeat, but you’re not going to find detailed tactical gameplay here (although full disclosure compels me to mention that I’m not an expert in this game by any stretch, so there may be some nuance here that I’m missing).  At any rate, the simple combat mechanics are adequate because war really isn’t the focus of Crusader Kings II even if it is an important aspect given the setting.Crusader Kings II plays in real-time, but you can pause at any point if you need breathing room to untangle a particularly difficult political conflict.  You can still interact with the game when it’s paused, but your orders won’t take affect until you start the clock again.  This prevents the game from becoming overwhelming even when things get complicated, which can happen very quickly and often without warning.  Thankfully the interface is very well laid out and places the copious amounts of information you need to manage your empire within easy reach, usually no more than one or two mouse-clicks away.  However, it is a very complex game, and even with over 80-hours under my belt to date, I feel like I’ve still barely scratched the surface.  In order to understand Crusader Kings II, you need to have a basic understanding of Medieval politics and laws, and this isn’t something that most people possess.  For instance, a pop-up will inform you that you have a “Wrong type of holding in demesne”.  What does that even mean, and more importantly, how do you fix it?  Or you might discover that your kingdom is at risk of fragmenting into the hands of multiple petty rulers when your character dies because of a potential succession crisis.  Why is this happening, and what can you do about it?  The game’s manual and tutorial missions do a rather poor job preparing you for your career as a crusader king, so you’ll probably want to find some “Let’s play” videos or a strategy guide or two.  I also suggest keeping a web browser handy while you play because you’ll inevitably have questions throughout the course of the game.Graphically, Crusader Kings II is probably about as attractive as a game like this can be with the majority of the display occupied by a vast interactive 3D map.  Details are added and subtracted depending on your zoom level, so it’s easy to pull out for a quick overview and then zoom in close enough to see individual cities and holdings dotted across the landscape.  It also runs beautifully in Linux, which always scores extra points in my book.  Sound effects are pretty basic for the most part, but you’ll mostly be listening to the music anyway which is period appropriate orchestral selections.  It can get a little bit repetitive, but there are several music packs available as DLC to expand the score.Speaking of DLC, if you’re contemplating a purchase of Crusader Kings II, you might be staggered by the fact that there is, at the time of this writing, nearly $250 worth of full-priced DLC currently available, and you may find this off-putting, but consider this: the vanilla game offers a complete experience in and of itself and can give you hours of entertainment.  In fact, I would recommend you play it sans DLC at first to get a feel for the game and to decide which DLC actually appeals to you, because not all of it will (and you should probably wait until it’s on sale anyway to get the most bang for your bucks).  I personally only have around half of the available DLC including several expansions and some of the unit and music packs, but I don’t feel like I’m missing out simply because the other content doesn’t interest me.  I should also note that when Paradox does release a major expansion, it's always accompanied by a patch that adds new features and content to the base game for free.This review could easily be three times as long, and I still wouldn’t feel like I had given a comprehensive description of Crusader Kings II.  So let’s make this simple: It’s a great game.  Buy it.			"

The freedom of strategy long term and short term is impeccable. The realism in politics and human interaction is unmatched for a strategy game.70 hours and I haven't scratched the surface of possibilites. Do not worry about the supposedly high entry level, the new tutorial system as King of Leon is superb.			"

												An excellent game, thourghly immersive in its environment. With the couple of DLC i have, it is immensly enjoyable, with many playble factions, and Factions-within-Factions(playing as a count or Duke under a King/Emperor). Combat simulation is relativly simple, just move your army to the same region as the enemy, and it will auto-engage, not much micro-managing as far as i've found.  Political and governmental simulation is also a fairly easy thing to learn, but there is an ever deepening filed to play, with all the ins and outs constantly being learned about and balanced. Further adding to this is the constantly changing world, making alliances and ties to other nations very diverse. To what i can tell, the Development team went all out to bring a great game forth, highly recommend this, definetly worth the buy, as are many of the DLCs.10/10 for me, easily will take hours of my day away.[6/25/15 Edit]: In my Croatia campaign, successfully got my son killed in a war, then died from a wound in that same war, then beat it as my grandson.10/10, best war yet.

												If you are a fan of strategy games, and more specifically, grand strategy ganes (ig. Civ) crusader kings 2 is a must have game. The game begins in the year 867, or 1066 depending on if you own the ""The Old Gods"" expansion or not, and you must guide a noble family through the medievel era. This may seem bland to someone without experience with paradox interactive grand strategies, but it is certainly not. This game is very similar  to Game of Thrones(there is a Game of Thrones mod also) imagine playing as the lannisters, starks or any family in westeros of signifigance. As in Game of Thrones, intrigue is paramount. I have countless times murdered my children and siblings in the name of preserving my realm and i have been assassinated by my siblings and brothers countless times also. Intrigue however is not the only component of CKII, military, religious, and economic gameplay is as rewarding as Intrigue. When all of these elements work together, the Game is damn good. Imagine you are the king of Sweden. Your younger brother is the King of Norway and your uncle is your vassel, duke of Lappland with a measly 4 holdings(counties, castles, cities, and temples/churches/mosques). Your spymaster is unskilled and your uncles plot to claim your kingdom for himself has gone unnoticed. Even if the kingdom of Sweden is the most powerful of nations, you can still lose a war to revolting vassles. Especially if a foreign king like your afformentioned brother helps the rebels. It is gameplay like this that you experience in crusader kings but so much more dynamic than i could ever hope to explain on paper. In my opinion Crusader Kings II is the best grand strategy game ever, fans of the genre and newcomers alike can appreciate it: 9.5/10			"

												It feels like this game was made for me. It's a highly detailed and story-driven Feudal Sim, and I love it. I chose it over the other paradox games because of the prospect of having to struggle within my own lands to get anything done. The DLC offer very different ways to play the different cultures, while still uniting it all in one map. Highly recommended if you are into this kind of thing, and it's especially good to start with a YouTube tutorial of some kind, especially reading the wiki. Has lots of depth.			"

												This is one of the best Strategy games ever! I am a HUGE fan of Medieval History and this game allows you to turn history on its head. Only in Crusader Kings 2 can your youngest child simultaneously be the Uncle and Half-Brother to his elder sister.   "

												It's a Total War game without the 3D battles. To be honest, I used to skip those battles anyway so Crusader Kings 2 is a far deeper game to play. It's not easy to get into and initially I found the amount of things I had to remember daunting. But the music and game play draw you in. Hours are soon gone and lessons learned. Superb.			"

												You know, I feel like ,compared to some of the great players (e.g. those mad tings' with 2000+ hours invested into the game) I really haven't experienced that much. In fact, I haven't even managed to run through a full game yet, that is both from the DLC-given 769 Charlemagne starting date and the vanilla 1066 date, and I like to consider myself a competent player - atleast I would hope so by this point... BUT, by my sweet black baby jesus' grace, it was when all of this hit me that I decided to write this review.That is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.400+ hours of gameplay, nearing 500, and I still haven't managed to finish a game? CK2 is the ultimate strategy out there. It doesn't recquire particularly acute battle-planning however, that is all done by a simple combat simulator and AI Martial Ability, no. This sort of strategy is that of court intrigue, seducing the Queen of Lombardy and marrying her so your heir becomes King of Italy whilst also coming from a family of barbaric Norse pagans?What? The predominantly Catholic Italians don't like the idea of having a Pagan King and try revolt against you? Beat them down then, that's what your well groomed retinues are for.But still your Council might find themselves growning a tad bit agitated with your ritual sacrifice of their fellow Christians and might attempt to, instead of overthrowing you competely, limit your power with diplomacy and the use of a strange concept. Democracy. Well, ♥♥♥♥ them, send your spymaster with his seditious intent to capture or kill them.All this in the meagre period of twenty years.Who knows what other trials, tribulations and resounding triumphs, await you upon your purchase of this game? Well to answer that. No-one. Because the possibilities are, literally, absolutely infinite.Oh and I also suggest shelling out, legit, everything in your wallet on the main DLCs, which are everything exluding Aztec Invasion.			"

												The last 2 DLCs and the recent few updates have kind of wrecked it. New mechanics like disease are tedious. The policy of adding new mechanics every 4 months to all paradox games, in the form of a DLC is wrecking the games that made them popular. If you really want to play you have to revert to before the Council Update, but they you cant earn the achievements added since then :(			"

												A solid example of a once great game ruined through pointless revisions and unnecessary changes to the core mechanics. After patch 2.5 the gameplay is more tedium and frustration than it is fun or interesting, and CKII has become so buggy that it's borderline unplayable as certain government types.This game has been progressively worsening for a quite a while now, but conclave has absolutely broken the experience.Why?-The council exists only as a gameplay obstruction as opposed to an interesting feature on it's own.-Managing anything larger than a small kingdom will now result in endless revolts to increase council power, with very little the player can do to avoid it.-Defensive pacts are an interesting idea, but ultimately don't play nice with the game mechanics and aren't very historically accurate. (For an excellent example I played as Carloman Karling and I had the invasion of Saxony event fire, due to my previous war to press my claim on West Francia almost every independent slavic pagan declared war on me to defend the Saxons. Which by the way, makes absolutely no sense and results in an almost unwinnable conflict.)-Shattered retreat suffers from a similar problem mechanically while being a good idea in theory, it simply doesn't work well in game and makes some conflicts ridiculously difficult or just pointless.(holy wars and prepared invasions are the best examples of this)-The new education system makes creating a decent heir mostly reliant on rng as opposed to a chosen guardian's existing traits.Despite all this I would still say this is a decent game, but I can't honestly recommend it anymore. If you're going to buy CKII, get it on sale and avoid some of the dlc. Also roll back to a patch prior to conclave for a better experience.			"

												I played CK2 using ireland from the year 887( Or near enough to it). I managed to conqure the rest of Ireland, Take most of the UK from the lords and kings over there. My first king managed to live to 100yr, but once he got to like 50yr things started to go a bit downhill (Madness). My younger wife was very bitter after finding out i been having an affair for a number of years with another woman. So to take revenge she decided once she became my regent that she was going to claim more and more of my land as her own (For the good of the kingdom in her words..yeah right).This on my death and all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s i bread meant my hair didnt get to be king for very long before getting killed by one of his half brothers...This half brother then decided to mary into a muslim fraction. This wasnt much of a problem until his hair decided he wanted to follow his mothers religion and then went on to change the religion of Ireland and most of the UK that i claimed. Its now the year 1024, it seems everyone hates me. No one seems to want to marry my children, A number of different fractions are coming for my head and my gold is running low.10 out of 10: Would become most wanted death man in the world again.			"

												Hello Gamers! PET here with my Crusader Kings II review!First of all this is a hard game to pick up but once you do it will create one of the best and unique experiences you ever encounter (in video games lol).If you follow my video at the end of the review I guarantee you will be able to pick up the game. If not...CK2 is a Grand Strategy Game. You will start around year 1100 and play until around 1300 (don't remember the exact dates. You can change the start year but the end year will be the same).CK2 is a game about your dynasty, about politics, about your vassals and about surviving your dynasty. One of the reasons why this game is hard is that it does not give you a purpose. You can do whatever you want and this might be confusing to some people. You will get that ""now what?"" experience. Not only that but you will be able to play with any king/duke/count in Europe. As you see I wrote a person title and not a country. Why? Because in CK2 you play with a person from a dynasty. Your purpose is to expand your dynasty, marry your sons so they can create children, marry your daughters to other powerful rulers so you will have a claim on that territory... oh yes yes...CK2 follows the feudal system and that's one of the reasons why people find this game hard. For example you can not declare war on another person without having a De Jure claim. What does that mean? Well it means that you are entitle to that territory because you might have a title that contains that territory. Oh yes, you have titles.Really, I think it's much easier to just watch my review & tutorial here:

												By far, one of the best games I've played in my lifeIn Paradox's game progression this one is the first, and it occupies middle ages from 1066 to 1452 (or from 867 if you get the DLC for it). In game you basically have to choose dynasty and play till you die or till the game itself ends. And it's really ♥♥♥♥ing difficult. You might get kicked out of your throne and die poor with no heirs or you can survive and be emperor of whole Europe.This game is great fun because:1) It is really hardcore2) The map is quite big, so variety of dynasties to play is really decent3) Things go quite different every time you play, so it doesn't become repetitive4) There are some quite competitive achievements in game, for example restoring Roman Empire or sample5) It is quite historically interesting, you can watch how things changed around 1000 years ago6) Nice graphically made landscape7) It's not just about having wars. It's about being a ruler. You will have to do a lot of things there, from starting and ending wars to marrying your offspringsWhy this game isn't flawless:1) Some really stupid and unrealistic things might happen. For example, Russian kingdom turning to catholic religion or black-skinned king of Britain (This is what I had only, most noticeable things)2) There are really many DLCs and getting them can sometimes be worthy, the most significant ones are like 8$3) Some DLCs are really stupid, for example the one with Aztec invasion. It's just plain idiotic.4) This game might be sometimes TOO hardcore. You won't be able to play it normally before you complete tutorial, so bother yourself with that. And it's gonna take you a lot of time to start playing good. I actually started becoming good at this game after 100h only and still would sometimes get ♥♥♥♥ed.Overall, this game is a great fun if you want some good time-spender, if you want some historical interesting events, if you're tired of real-time strategy games or if you just crave some difficult gameplay and not-so-stupid games. This is what you have to get then.9.8/10, would play again and again			"

The ultimate border and treaty simulator is here to satisfy your every need. Ever wished you could have a wife and just divorce her and kill her for bearing no sons? Done! Ever wished you could just ruin everyone elses day because of their religion, like a kid kicking over someone's sand castle because ""Mine is better""? Look no further. Crusader Kings II is here to satisfy all your medieval fantisies (So long as though fantasies involve looking at political issues instead of any of the knighthood or battle aspects).

												So I started off as a lowly Welsh Count, a vassal of the King of Wales.  After a generations-long struggle to successfully build up enough strength to rise up against my king, the only son of my previous character was born.  A just, gregarious and well-loved leader saw a sudden surge of support from other Welsh Counts and even an Irish Duke across the Irish Sea.  After forming alliances and taking enough in taxes to bolster my growing army with another 3,000 men in the form of some European mercenaries, I challenged the Petty King of Wales and laid claim to each of his counties one by one.  The Kingdom of Brethonniad was born!150 years into the game, a complex web of marriage and strategic sowing of dynastic seeds in Irish wombs led to my eldest nephew, the Prince of Brethonniad and the heir to everything that I had fought for, not just lining up to inherit my crown but also preparing his own eldest son and heir to inherit not just the crown of Brethonniad but two Irish counties from his noble mother and, on top of that, a strong claim to the Isle of Man.This is the heir that the dynasty had been preparing the kingdom for all of this time.  Another kind and just character with military expertise and noble blood was coming, expected to unite Wales and Ireland against the English and begin to assert control over the whole of the British Isles.However, the elderly King of Brethonniad was not finished.In his dying years, he found a new lease of life following the death of his respected Norwegian wife and queen.  In his late fifties and of ill-health, the King sought a new wife with whom he could enjoy his dying days.  To the surprise of all involved, a child was conceived.  There was a new heir.      The previous heir was no longer next in line and his prodigal son, set to challenge the English, took a giant slip on his climb.Out of the frustration of those around him, the new king grew up to be a tyrant.  Imprisoning family members and mercilessly excecuting them at will left him with a rebellion on his hands.  Who was in charge of the rebellion? The previous heir, father of the prodigal son.  With little or no support from his vassals, the king was unable to recruit a strong enough army to quash the rebellion and lost his title to the usurper.  With only a female heir, not yet in her teens, he worried that she would not be strong enough to undo his destructive ways and recover the prestige of their lineage.  Little did that matter as he later remembered that he had changed the succession laws to absolute agnatic primogeniture in his proud idiocy and the titles passed on to a distant, obscure male relative married to the count of Fife.Wonderful game.  Would play again.			"

												This game was awesome. Key word 'was.' Poured a lot of time and effort into my Empire only to have an update absolutely ruin the ability to play any further. Apparently updates to this game have been doing this for awhile (making previous saves unplayable) the community would have you believe that plenty of warning is given on the forums. Whilst this may be true, purchase/playing of the game is in no way a binding agreement that a player must stay active on the forums and actively be a part of the community. Something you'll need to be (apparently) unless you don't want to be pre-warned about getting your save-games dicked. Of course there is plenty of warning about the available DLC in-game, but that takes precedence over anything else I guess... Great game, terrible update model. Extremely upset. Removed from my heart and /common file. :(EDIT: I gave the game a second chance and progressed well until receiving a sudden and inexplicable error message forced that game to a close too. I could not find any information online about what was happening so I signed up to the Paradox forums themselves and left a post in the relevant location asking for tech support. It has been viewed but gone unreplied to for the past two days. I guess you're scrwed whether you join the forums or not. In conclusion: don't purchase the game and don't support the developers. All in all a very frustrating experience playing (?) and dealing with their half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥performance in the gaming industry. Not good enough.			"

												CK2: Used to be good, ruined by ahistorical, impractical, overpriced, and game-breaking DLC. Probably one of the few games left that charges you for cosmetics & add-ons in addition to the base price. Don't buy the DLC even on sale, best not support this business practice. Charging for cosmetics and add-ons are acceptable only when a game is F2P, and this mentality is spreading thoughout the gaming industry. Paradox used to release fewer but more complete DLC in the past, but they are regressing.Paradox: Godd*mit Johan, fix games instead of milking them. Fix AI instead of being lazy and putting a land passage across Otranto. For once in your life, read feedback outside of the Paradox forums. The reviews are negative for all your recent DLC. Stop acting like a butthurt kid when you see the slightest form of even constructive criticism.EDIT: Oh great, they released yet another DLC to fix the problems of the old one...EDIT2: Everyone seems to suddenly love the game again. Well I will not be fooled.			"

												Deep and powerful trip into Western feudalism, not only as a historical period, but as a mindset. Should be brought into history classes to make people understand this way of thinking, which is not as medieval as one might assume. Wrapping your mind around it is highly rewarding, provided you don't mind somewhat steep learning curve, are creative enough to set up your own goals, and you like to see  all your plans screwed in alternative history turmoils.

So long as you are a kind, merciful ruler nothing bad should ever happen to you. But what is the fun in being nice?			"

												I don't write many reviews but, I think I've sunk enough time into this game to give my thoughts. And my thoughts are- Pretty darn good. Sure, when I first got the game I had the same problems most have, I looked at itm the tutorial and repeated a hundred times. ""What the %$# do I do?"" But when things start to fall into place and you know what's going on and how to control things. It's wonderful.I love history, and this game is reliving, and rewriting history all in one go. Ever curious to what would have happened in 800ad if Ireland united and took over all of Britannia and became a medieval superpower? Try it out! It won't be easy, starting as a lone Irish count working your way up to unite ireland while staving off the vikings, scots, welsh and english (sometimes others!) But it's rewarding to look at your family tree, see your starting count ""Count Bob of Connacht"" and look down to his current living great gandson ""Emperor Bob III of Britannia."" And relive all the intrigue, war and crazy things in your head that happened from A to B for your dynasty.It doesn't end there. The ""Irish Empire"" is born- You really think the Frensh, or the Holy Roman Empire is going to let you have all the power untested? You think  aJealous half brother count is not going to start a revolution. Should you make them fear you, love you, respect you? Combinations of all? Go completely crazy? The choices are endless, victories and defeats.Ireland aint yer thing? Well with all the DLC you can really be anyone, Original game gives you access to most of the European nations of Catholic and Orthodox beliefs. Old gods lets you start form a earlier time period and play any Pagan religion. Sword of Islam allows any Islamic nation and so on!Mods are also great, giving more and more gameplay. Ever wanted to play ""Game of Thrones"" on CK2? There's a mod for that. Want to start in ""The old gods"" time period and make every nation no larger than one territory and see what empires arise where? There's a mod for that.Endless game, endless fun.9.5/10			"

Start small as a Duke and get to the throne by scheming, bribing, sowing dissent or simply doing a really good job, marrying into the royal family or supporting them in conflicts. There are a million and one ways of playing Crusader Kings. Each of which takes the political intrigue of the Medieval era and brings it to life in a complex and fun way.			"

												For the first two weeks of playing Crusader Kings 2 I sucked so bad at managing my dynasty that game sessions usually lasted for about an hour or so before they descended into chaos, civil wars and invasions, which inevitably lead to the complete annihilation of the great house of Insertnamehere and its disappearance from the pages of history.  And I didn't even mind.  Even when you fail at CS2, you fail so spectacularly and so interestingly that you can't help but enjoy yourself. Mayhap a long lost cousin emerged with an army and an ultimatum, seizing the throne and throwing you from high king to lowly duke? Mayhap that lovingly concocted poisonous wine you gave your spouse for you anniversary finally kicked in, but you were discovered and now his or her lover plots revenge? Or mayhap you managed to unite the Holy Roman Empire and Byzantium, ushering in an era of peace and prosperity under the watchful eye of a united Rome, only to have the Golden Horde drop by for tea and biscuits?Whatever happens you'll greet it with a grin 'cause, damn it, you won't be able to help yourself.

												If you like games with emergent story (That is, the story is created through your gameplay rather than pre-written), than this is an excellent game for you.  I'm on about my 4th or so dynasty, and I love the drama that comes out of pulling off some clever tricks of politics or military strategy.  For example: In my most recent game, I started as the to-be-King of Sweden.  I united Sweden before the end of my first character (when you die, you switch to playing your heir), and spent my second generation adding Norway and pieces of Ireland and Holland to the mix.  I was having some problems in the heir department though, even with 3 young concubines all I was producing was daughters (about 6 of them).   Worried about how the Norse would react to a female ruler, I sighed with relief when I finally got a son... only to have him murdered in his crib by his eldest sister.  I banished her from my kingdom and then fortunately had another son... and then a third.   This was a problem, because as the King of Norway and of Sweden, my sons would each inherit a different country, dividing my empire in half right as I prepared to go to war with Denmark to unite Scandanavia.  Unfortunately, I died of old age before I could come up with a solution (like murdering one of the sons, or finding some other way to disinherit them).   So now I was the 5 year old king of Sweden, and my 4 year old brother was king of Norway.  Within a week, both kingdoms were in open rebellion.   I was able to help my little brother keep his throne initially, but when a section of the Sumonesko to the north declared their independence, I wasn't able to hold off the wars and I had to surrender the Throne.  Deciding the best solution would be to get myself killed and pass my titles to my little brother, I placed myself under the mentor ship of a 21 Intrigue vassal who hated me.  This surprisingly did not result in my death, but instead I hit 16 with a 21 in Intrigue myself.  I murdered the king who had overthrown me, and then his oldest daughter, mostly out of spite (but also to keep the realm in chaos while I finished the war with the Sumonesko).  Finally, I was ready, and declared war on the child-Queen-usurper and found about 3/4ths of the nation willing to join me (the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who threw me off the throne 15 years ago, mostly).  I retook the throne and I'm recovering Norway and the north from the barbarians who moved in, and preparing once more to move on Denmark.  Long live Sweden!			"

												Game Play 10/10  (With all DLCs)   Standalone 9/10 (Without DLCs)     Interface 8/10This is a game of empire building/running.  Paradox chooses to focus on the Dynasty, which gives a very interesting twist to the whole genre.  You now not only have to focus on building up your ""states"", expanding your empire, and diplomacy, but also ensuring your line has the right traits to succeed for decades to come.   There are so many different ways to play and things to focus on, the replay value is huge.  I have replayed this game 4 or 5 times so far, and everytime found something new to focus on....   There are also different mods you can get that add either more realism or go so far as to change the game into a Game of Thrones sim!  Be warned though, this is NOT for the light of heart, if you just want a game you can waste 30 minutes on, this won't be for you.  This is a hardcore sim, one that you will spend hours and hours on.  Yes, you can spened a 30 minute session on, but plan on spending 100s of 30 minute sessions before completing a game!   The only negative I can really say about this game is the interface at times makes it challanging to give you what you need.   If you are searching for a wife for your heir, for instance, and you want to filter for certain traits, there is not an easy way to do this.  There is also not an easy way to go back and forth between screens so you'll find yourself having to do multiple clicks when you do your yearly ""who isn't married right now"" type checks.   Maybe there are easier ways of doing these types of things, but I haven't found them yet.  Other than this, this game is great and they keep adding great features through the DLC content (Usually 15.99 instead of the cost of the game, and if you wait for specials, even cheaper!).			"

												Probably the best game Paradox has ever made. The game is a complex sandbox where you play as nobility in the real world, trying to forge your dynasty into every corner of Europe, Arabia or India. You can play anyone from a lowly count, up to the emperor of the medieval roman empires.It has happened that I've devilishly laughed with great geniune delight as I expanded my kingdom of Burgundy deep into the HRE, wondering for just a moment why I don't have any friends. However that was instantly replaced by rage and confusion as soon as I realized that my character had died ""under suspiscious circumstances"", and that I now had to deal with an astronomically awkward inheiritance.There are also many ways to challenge yourself though the game as you can choose to play either as a christian, muslim, viking or slavic nomad ruler - most often carving out a place in the world for yourself and your dynasty through conquest, murder and marriages. Every gameplay feels meaningful depending on who you choose to play as because every place and every situation your happen to find yourself in present new obstacles to overcome. It's only in the later part of the game when you tend to snowball that the game slows down.I recommend this game.			"

Instead of bad factions. And I wish there were more things to fighting wise. Like This guys a good fighter and this guy sucks. I really like the idea of the duel system on A Game of Thrones mod.

Worried about how the Norse would react to a female ruler, I sighed with relief when I finally got a son... only to have him murdered in his crib by his eldest sister.  I banished her from my kingdom and then fortunately had another son... and then a third.   This was a problem, because as the King of Norway and of Sweden, my sons would each inherit a different country, dividing my empire in half right as I prepared to go to war with Denmark to unite Scandanavia.  Unfortunately, I died of old age before I could come up with a solution (like murdering one of the sons, or finding some other way to disinherit them).   So now I was the 5 year old king of Sweden, and my 4 year old brother was king of Norway.  Within a week, both kingdoms were in open rebellion.   I was able to help my little brother keep his throne initially, but when a section of the Sumonesko to the north declared their independence, I wasn't able to hold off the wars and I had to surrender the Throne.  Deciding the best solution would be to get myself killed and pass my titles to my little brother, I placed myself under the mentor ship of a 21 Intrigue vassal who hated me.  This surprisingly did not result in my death, but instead I hit 16 with a 21 in Intrigue myself.  I murdered the king who had overthrown me, and then his oldest daughter, mostly out of spite (but also to keep the realm in chaos while I finished the war with the Sumonesko).  Finally, I was ready, and declared war on the child-Queen-usurper and found about 3/4ths of the nation willing to join me (the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who threw me off the throne 15 years ago, mostly).  I retook the throne and I'm recovering Norway and the north from the barbarians who moved in, and preparing once more to move on Denmark.  Long live Sweden!			"

												A very good game where you can play, depending on what DLC you get, nobles from different periods of time in Europe, Europa-Asia, and North Africa. There are only a few like it where you play families, and the charters in between. If you like historical, A historical, dynasty, faction building, empire building, strategy, Medevil simmulation get this game.			"

												While the interface for CKII and other Paradox games is a bit of a hurdle to overcome (to say the least) for the new player, CKII is a really rich outlet for your Machiavellian inclinations. Plotting the continued relevance of your family dynasty in the face of its sprawling list of competitors is utterly engaging once you get the hang of it, so please read up on a few tutorials or guides online to assist in overcoming the initial learning curve the game presents.

												After a whole lot of hours on this game, I feel I owe it a more detailed review.Crusader Kings 2, ultimately, is an experience. This is a good thing and it's most active selling point - It's not a game you win or lose, it's a game you craft stories from - as all the other reviews will likely show!It is a game that appeals to multiple playstyles. If you want to be the grand overseer, some sort of mini-god surveying all that you have and making incredibly far-sighted decisions about where to conquer, who to ally with and what wars to start, looking at it as a gamer rather than a character? You can.If you want to look at it as the character you are, say King Eucedis ""The Fat"" Salian of England, roleplaying as a man obsessed by excess, greed and pride, while simultaneously ruining future generations of your family tree by seducing all the courtier's wives and having a large pool of illegitemate children? You canIf you want to play it as a complete and total joviality, name your family the ""Megatrons"" and rename every single English city after each Sonic the Hedgehog level, because why not? You can.All of these and many more are games I've had. Sometimes the game hates you and wants you to suffer, such as letting your 25 year old genius, attractive king who has all the claims in the world die from a cough, leaving you to inherit as your 1 year old, dumb, hairlipped son, who immediately gets rebelled on by his better brother, leaving you a peniless and landless wreck. At other times, the game loves you and even though you played as a merciless, heartless father who had a child with his eldest son's wife (who also never had any more children) and then he immediately dies and because of your inheritance said child inherits, but the brother ends up staying loyal and true, which gives you more than enough forces to make the others kow-tow.All of the above scenarios have happened. More have too. More still will. If you enjoy having fun stories to tell people, or even fun stories to look back on, this game is for you.The only two downsides - The game has a lot of DLC, which all add a lot to the game. This is somewhat mitigated by them regularly being on sale, but the cost still adds up. I must admit though that even having that, I mostly still play as the Christian rulers that start off accessible, alongside the Norse - The key is to experiment after purchase of the base product with it online, as if the host has the DLC you can use it in an online match. That way you can get a feel for what you want. The second downside is the game layout. The game is not massive on visuals, aside from the pretty map and such, so most of it is small character portraits and menus. This has the side of making the game complicated because it's not initially easy to understand where you go wrong.But I promise you - if you put the time into the game, it pays off.			"

												Crusader Kings II is a very good game. I think it's fun to play as a ruler and that you meet resistance along the way. You can pick ambitions, fulfill others ambitions so that they like you more. You can throw someone in prison, assassinate or excommunicate him/her but it might backfire on you. That CKII support mods is awesome, although I've only downloaded one so far.One of the best DLC:s I've bought is the Ruler Designer. With it you can change appearance, make the shield design as you want it and add traits. When I started playing this game I didn't have that many DLC:s and I felt that the base-game as it is was kind of boring. Luckily they sell the DLC:s cheaper from time to time. Now that I have played it for some time with the extra content I must say that it is much more fun. It's a shame that you have to pay extra money for DLC:s to be able to truly enjoy the gameplay. That's how it was for me anyway. The reward-system in this game could be better. Maybe some more in-game rewards in form of likes, money, prestige. To be able to get achievements on Steam, I have to play in Iron Mode. I have not dared to do that yet. It would be very nice if I could get some by just playing the game in any mode. CKII already has a lot of traits but I wouldn't mind to be able too choose among even more.I would absolutely recommend this game. If you like strategy then I think you would like CKII. It is not the easiest game. The longest rule I've achieved is until my Kings son took over after his fathers death. It was chaos from the start of the sons rule because he had some bad traits. The shortest rule I've experienced is one I've played recently. The man got sick and died shortly after. So many things can happen along the way and it's interesting to follow the rulers development. To try again with a new ruler after the last one failed. Something makes me keep playing it. Maybe it's the pace, the challenge or that you can customize so much. Or perhaps it's the freedom and choices. Doesn't really matter. I enjoy playing this and will keep doing just that. Maybe my new ruler will succeed where others failed. Maybe...			"

												Crusader Kings II is without a doubt one of the funnest most addictive games I have ever played. This game has a steep learning curve, and honestly I hated it to begin with, but after I started to figure out how to play the game it became extremely fun.  After playing this game I have found it almost impossible to go back to playing the Civilization series, a series which I loved, because this game to me is a lot deeper and more interesting  than Civ. The multiplayer in this game is also very fun, if occasionally a little buggy. I highly recommend this game, just try not to give up right away if you get frustrated with it.			"

Pretty decent strategy game.Pros:- Decent learning curve; not too hard, not too easy.- Variety of character customization makes for a good amount of different playthroughs.- Good Workshop content.- Vikings... 'nough said.Cons:- Some of the DLC doesn't seem worth the effort.- Occasionally slow gameplays (little to no events at all).Overall, I found it worth the money (bought collector's on sale). Only had 1 or 2 crashes, but it was mainly after an update. Would definitely recommend it.			"

												This game without its DLC is very limited for example you can't play another country/county/state etc... unless their Christian and a Monarchy type goverment.The reason why i don't recommend it is because unless you'r willing to cough up the full 130 something euro for the game and all or the majority of its DLC it will feel like a fracition of what you thought it would be,but i suppose even then with it's limitations (in the Vanilla game,not with dlc) there is undoubtly great time to be in CK2 but no game should be able to get away with a price tag of 130 unless their gonna give something more then what i was supposed to have when i purchased the game.

												So, having played this game for 1000 + hours, i can honestly say, it is arguably the funest game i have ever played. With the deep modding support, And no one time being the same, this game is the ultimate Grand Strategy game.It does have a rather steep learning curve, but, if you stick with it you will be surprised how much fun you can have.Yes, there is a massive amount of DLC, but several are really optional that you don't NEED to have, some are fantasy (Sunset Invasion) And of course there are others that (in my opinion) are must haves:-Sword of Islam-The Old Gods-The Republic-Charlemagne (sorta)-Way of Life (again, sorta)-Horse Lords-Conclave (Slightly Annoying but still fun)-Monk's and Mystics-Raja's of India-Sunset Invasion (arguably the worst DLC relased, but, eh)-Legacy of Rome-The Reaper's Due-Son's of AbrahamThe list isn't in any order, just to show the primary content mods apart from everything else.So, in short, in my opinion this game is a must have for those whom love strategy games, and those looking for a new kind of experience.9.5/10			"

												Crusader Kings II is my favorite game of all time. Its depth, complexity, and staying power are unmatched by any other game I've played.That said... ♥♥♥♥ you, Paradox. The amount of DLC they've♥♥♥♥♥♥out for this game is absolutely shameful. Discounting all the cosmetic stuff, most of the big content expansions are things that should have been in the game from the beginning, and frankly the game is nearly unplayable without at least a couple of them.Play it, it's great. But the gnawing feeling of guilt you get when you realize you bought into the DLC scam they're running here lessens the experience a bit.			"

												To start off this game has been an amazing journey, I bought this because it was in my queue long ago. I am just a person who is interested in one strategy games and two historical games. This one fit the bill perfectly and when I purchased it I was extremely impressed. Before playing this I had never heard of Paradox nor played any of their games, after this game however, I love to play all of their games. This game is exciting and allows you to rule as your own medieval ruler after that you can do just about anything you want. The community for mods is also great and makes excellent improvements to the game the devs also have made excellent expansion packs. Many reviews will talk about the devs failures and how DLC is over priced. I do not agree with that in any way, I have slowly purchased most of the dlc and have loved every bit of it. The DLC add great content to the game and bring in new and interesting features. Yes the game is a lot of money if you purchase the game and then all the DLC however, how I like to see it as this you are getting multiple games out of one game. You want to play as a Viking you can do that, you want to play as a Muslim Caliph you can do that, you want to be a Catholic King you can do that, you want to be a Byzantine count you can do that. My point out of that is you can be anything in this game you get the chance to make your own story over and over and over again. Sure the game is not perfect however, no game is the game is special however, and this game will allow you to have a great time on it. The learning curve is steep and at some points extremely hard, thats okay though thats the fun of the game the harder you have to work the more spectacular the experience will be. I hope you enjoyed this review and I would recommend you begin playing this game.			"

												It was a tepid summer night and a fresh but soothing breeze flew over the landscape of the county. It wasn't just some county, it was the one county where Lady Justicia ruled fair and just. A county where no rules would be broken, no secessions could happen, where no farmer or subject would stand up against their beloved duke.This is the story of your county. After investing gold into the possibility of renaming the ancient old and unfitting county name, your county ""Anal for free"" felt renewed. Reforms flushed through your political system and your subjects were simply happy with what they had and felt treated fair in your feudal government.The pope tried to gain influence of your county once again, so you decided to do what the gods actually wanted from you and you moved back in time to relive the old roman religions, pray to Jupiter and from there you can achieve something even greater:  Restore the Imperium Romanum in its greatest fashion. Bring back peace, power and prosperity to every subject in the known world with you as their Caesar and with the hellenistic gods at your side.Your dream of restoring the Imperium was brought down to reality when someone knocked on the door behind the balcony you stood one.""My lord, you have to come out and do something! Quickly!!""You sighed. Once again, some vasall who doesn't like your new traditions tries to make himself and his fiefdom independant or join another county - obviously illegally, since you are their de jure feudal lord for hunderds of years already.You turn around and look into the blue eyes of your servant. She was a young girl, merely 20 and already mother of 16 children of which 12 were mongrels. However, when she was walking through your capital, trying to climb over the piles of garbage and excrements that once again piled up in the middle of the main market, you couldn't resist to stop your palanquin and have her join you.It was the best sex you had in your long 50 year old life. Your other twentyfour wives didn't really like the new girl, but you had all right to rule both over your god given county as well as over your women, so none of them actually had a choice and those who disagreed with that simply died in a tragic carriage accident.You slowly walked over to her and touched her face. She cringed for a moment and looked at you with her begging, big eyes. You ignored your empathy and pushed her back inside, onto your bed. Quickly you tore down her dirty dress and without even really noticing, you slapped her eleven times because she started to scream and begged you to not do what you decided to do seconds ago.""P-p-p-please my lord, not again, I'm already pregnant again!"", she begged. Without even thinking about stopping for a second, you simply whispered: ""No worries, I'll clear that pipe and make room for a new one.""You felt the feeling of pure power when you sensed the warm, moist sensation on what you called the Small Lord. What an excellent feeling that was. This was the reason you beheaded twelve of your former wives and it was the reason you got the county in the first place, because who could have thought that the former duke died only two days after you married her daughter in an orderly way (because you bribed him before of course), so that you became the next one to herit the county.It was the sensation that made the world true and it should be the one that would keep humanity alive for another 1000 years at least.Your servant screamed again and you simply pressed your sweating hands on her mouth, pressing so hard that you wondered if you would break her petite chaw if you pushed just a little more.Slowly you moved the Small Duke back and forth, increasing the great sensation that made you feel comfortable and it wouldn't be long until you felt the power of a thousand suns pressing inside your duke. The power that empowered mills to crush wheat, the power that made it possible for a ox to plow your land for the farmer that was working on it. You moaned as your speed increased even further and your pressure became unsustainably high. All of the sudden, your inner steam was released through the valve that the gods gifted to you inside of the greatest of all limbs. You kept laying for a moment longer, then got up and went back to the balcony. Your glance moved slowly over the peaceful fields that your workers had worked on over the day to capture as much of the sun's power as possible to keep your war machines running and fill your treasury.The moon watched over what the gods gifted to you and you were happy. After turning around, you realized that, once again, another servant could not keep up with your power and had to concede at your might. ""Oh well"", you thought, ""I'm sure she got enough money to pay Charon for her last trip.""Quickly you grabbed her leg and threw it out of your now blood filled bed, so that she landed on the other two corpses that you forgot to throw out last morning. You called for your only male servant that you employed only for the reason of reliability and had him move them all out of your chamber.You went back on the balcony and took a last glance at the farms - your farms - that were burning. You ignored the sounds of dying farmers and screaming children, while the troops of the neighbor county moved their trebuchet in position to hit your castle below you. Thousands of armed soldiers who tried to take away what you alone owned to enslave your people and make them part of another empire.The smell of burning wood and blood filled your nose. It was a good night.And it was good to be the king.			"

												Amazing game. You must LOVE Grand Strategy games for enjoying it, since here you have to take next to everything into account: Not only making sure that your territory is prosperous and that you have a nice economy, but also taking real care of diplomatic relations, religiosity, lineage (you don't want to lose because you had no children), vassals and liege...But, how is it that I vote it negative? The DLC.There are a lot of DLC that are way too expensive for what they bring. It really is annoying to see such prices for things that should be in the original game, such as new textures for armies or new portraits.			"

												Crusader Kings II is one of those glorious sandbox/emergent game play titles where success and failure are two sides of the same coin.  Start with just a county and build a legacy to staggering heights - then watch it come crashing down!  Conquer medieval Europe!  Unite Ireland!  Take back Spain!  Defend Rus from the Golden Horde!Be warned: like Dwarf Fortress, event details take place in your mind's eye.  There are no fancy graphics - just a lovingly detailed map, and units marching across it.  There are no cut scenes - just pop-ups containing a nice bit of art, event details, and your potential responses.It's like The Sims meets Civilization, and it's glorious.			"

												Crusader Kings 2, the inbreeding & murdering simulator where you control over your independent ( or not ) state and either horribly die to muslims, pagans or the Holy Roman Empire. Also your dynasty has other independent kingdoms under their rule and you're their heir, so have fun plotting to kill ONE of them for 10 years only to have them get a child, another child and another after that. Then you realise you're a pagan as well and you could have just gone for the subjugation of Norway + Denmark. Suddenly you're in Spain and the muslims kick your♥♥♥♥♥until your daughter marries the 9th princess of the HRE and suddenly you own Jerusalem. Also it's been two days since you started playing.			"

												A game like no other. Yes, it is mostly watching the map and sometimes giving orders (which means clicking 2 or 3 buttons). But if you want a medival simulation as realistic as possible, then this is the game for you. Just do not expect a lot of action going on. Also do not expect a real-time or turn-based strategy game. This game is not about conquering the world (Europa Universalis IV might be more your game then...), it is about simulating the feudal system. Therefore, there are mechanisms in the game, such as inefficient taxation when you own too many provinces or the gavelkind succession laws that splits your realm between your children when you die. While these might look like huge fun-blockers for an average gamer, they perfectly make sense in this game. Again, this is a feudal simulation and it excels at this.Recommended DLCs: The Old Gods, Sons of Abraham, Sword of Islam, Legacy of Rome.For long-term playability: there is a huge amount of mods, including some total conversion mods that put you in the world of Middle-Earth (Lord of the Rings) or Westeros (""Song of Ice and Fire"" aka ""Game of Thrones"").

												This is a sandbox game where you given direct control of a single individual with the goal of preserving your family legacy. Gameplay is strategic and chaotic. It's one of the most fun things I've done in quite some time and I did start to really get into my character and their families.For example,  One of the Nordic Kings sieged my castle in Dorset while my army was away helping an allied king, imprisoned my pregnant wife and then after she gave birth to my first son (while I had Agnatic Primogeniture Succession laws), held HIM hostage, took my wife as his concubine - and then continued to siege my lands.When my army finally returned to the de jure Kingdom of England to take revenge, I was faced with 10 to 1 odds and no allies strong enough to make a difference.  So I decided I would have the Nordic wife-stealer killed in his sleep. My (now technically) ex-wife was MORE than happy to contribute to the plot and he was killed in a carriage while travelling. My involvement was discovered and the Nordic King's son was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and I could not diplomatically persuade him to free her.So I tried a DIFFERENT plot against the son, except now I couldn't get anyone to back the plot. Even my ex-wife had moral qualms - she was free of her concubinage and had nothing personal against the 12 kid who we had thrust onto the throne. But I wanted my son and wife back.I couldn't use brute force, I lacked the numbers.I couldn't use diplomacy, I had♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the Nords too much.I couldn't use Intrigue, no one shared my vision.I couldn't use Religion, I wasn't pious enough.Sure enough, the 12-year old Nordic kid grew up to be a more terrifing fighter than his dad and decided to take his revenge by once again sieging Dorset.I was eventually thrust right back into the familiar postion of Elodie - except instead of a dead lumen mother, I had a dead duke dad. A young girl with no allies or experience needed to fight her enemies.Except where Elodie had magic powers and a kingdom's resouces, I was a poor muggle countess. It didn't end well.So I started a NEW game where I took particular note of the original Nordic King I was fighting and what he did and I have managed not to draw any attention to myself thus far.I am LOVING this game, but it was incredibly expensive even during the Summer Sale where everything was 75% off or more. That is perhaps the main problem with this game, although it has not deterred me.			"

												One of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. The amount of depth is amazing, and the text based build allows for very easy modding. Although some parts of the game may be ahistorical, owing the limitations of the game engine (Namely, the portrayal of Byzantium and the Islamic caliphates as decentralised, essentially feudal realms), there's still much fun to be had. With two years of DLC and patches under it's belt, and a further year (At least) to go, I can only see it getting better.			"

												If you're into medeval-themed games and enjoy strategy, boy is this the game for you.TL;DR Steep learning curve, have a friend / youtuber teach you, wait for the game to be on sale to get all the DLCThis game is incredibly fun, but the steep learning curve turns many people off though. Once you get a used to how the game works though, the possibilites are endless. I strongly recommend having a friend/family member teach you the basics of this game. What's that? You don't have any friends? Well lucky for you, there's a plethera of youtube videos that you can learn from, but it will take more time than being taught by someone in person. One of my favorites is ArumbaAnother thing that may seem ridiculous is the amount of DLC this game has, and that is not entirely incorrect. A lot of DLC is not essential, like the portiat DLC, but it does help with immersion. The essential DLC is just if you want to stay in Europe, but this game does offer playable characters from Iceland to India to the Asian Steppe. If the game is on sale, and you have $50 to spare, buy the complete edition of the game with all the DLCBEFORE BUYING DLC, MAKE SURE YOU READ THEIR DESCRIPTIONEssential DLC:CharlemagneOld GodsWay of LifeRecommended DLC:Merchant RepublicLegacy of RomeRuler DesignerSons of Abraham			"

												Rating 8.5/10Make sure you buy the CK2 Complete Pack on sale(GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY)This is a must have for any grand strategy fan.  (BEWARE STEEP LEARNING CURVE)<by this i mean a good 6 hours or so to get the basics. Even after this you are always learning something. would recommend Arumba's CK2 Tutorial Series on youtube. Also great to watch to get an idea of the features in the game and the level of depth involved.Features.Manage your dynasty.Plot to kill other characters in the game. Amusing events and decision based on your characters traits and ambitions(Of which you can manage once you learn the game).Conquer lands for your county/duchy/kingdom/empire.Manage your council and court.And many many moreIf you are still reading now for my reviewI enjoyed 90% of this game, although there are thing's that paradox could have done better such as the warfare,Building management, religion and the whole pope minigame, But this is still a great title and i was very happy with my purchase. I spent hours on hours managing my dynasty,Court and my council. While this was happening i was also plotting against my enemies and even my own subjects in my kingdom/empire who were a troublesome sight to my reign. Also had to help my allies and keep an eye on my dynasty members(sisters/daughters) in particular, who i married off to people in larger empires outside my lands who i had high plans for. Overall this game is outstanding if you enjoy a nice in depth/complex empire and dynsaty management system.			"

												Without a doubt, the best buy I have ever made on Steam. It has never been so pleasureable to kill your kinsmen because they disagree with you, or because of dynastic politics, or maybe you just didn't like their company. You will find yourself buying portraits of characters of a different culture and you will shed lonely tears from your face out of joy. 8/8 m8			"

												Strategy game, where you might actually care when a piece on your board dies. (Short version)Pros: it's a Great strategy game. Complex, and we'll thought out. It's the kinda game you would want to put down roots with you current territory, before foolishly beginning your quest for world domination.Cons: incomplete without these 30 other dlc. It really feels that way, like your missing out on half the game. I get what companies do that for, buy buyer beware, they aren't cheap.			"

Once you get past the little learning curve on the game, you won't be able to stop. Trust me, I've tried. I mean... I can stop anytime I want to; I just CHOOSE not to. I'm not addicted, truly.			"

												I've never found a strategy game better than Crusader Kings II. I've owned it for nearly two years (ignore my playing hours, I actually have two copies of CK II; one from gamersgate, and one on Steam I picked up off the humble bundle), and I LOVE it. It's stunning in depth and complex like few other games, yet I found it easy to pick up and learn. Anyone who likes royalty, strategy, or family politics will love this game. Graphics are great; beautiful even. Very few strategy games I've played have such beautiful graphics in every area - character portraits, interface art, maps - normally something out of those lets you down. To mention it comes with its own, original music - beautiful, fitting classical pieces.I've found it to have infinite replay-ability. Not only because there are so many different characters you can try out (nearly anyone in mainland europe, and with DLCs all of India and the middle east), but because it has a great AI that always makes the world different each time. In the footsteps of real medieval europe, inheritance can change the map fundamentally. Play historically and rebuild the empires of a dynasty, or just conquer a whim - both are fun.This game is also constantly updated. Paradox has a great DLC policy where you get nearly every bit of content without the DLC just in the updates - all the DLCs do are to make characters playable, introduce new starts and new interface themes. So if you don't want to pay, you don't have to; you still get most of the experience, and you won't be left behind if you want to play multiplayer with others. There is no DLC wall. Not to mention DLCs can be easily turned on and off via the launcher.So much content has been added since I began playing, and the game is always getting better - just recently they doubled the map size, an enormous amount of work for Paradox, nearly 2 year after the game came out. My ratings?Music - 9/10Graphics - 8/10. Only thing that could be improved is player portraits might be higher-res.Gameplay - 10/10Replayability - 10/10Updates - 10/10Support - 9/10Overall - 9/10.

												If you know of this game you've probably heard it refered to as a ""sibling murder, incest, warmonger, and religious intolerance map simulator"" or something of the like. While this is a humurous synopsis of the experience - and mostly true - it's not very helpful if you're trying to decide whether or not to dump copious amounts of cash into this thing. I mean, just look at all the DLC. It's at least 160 something odd dollars for all of it. So, is it worth it?The short answer: maybe. I know that's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ short answer, but hear me out. This game is niche. Very, very niche. It's unique certainly, but that does not change the fact that you could very well absolutely hate it. For starters, if you're thinking of making this purchase and have not played other games like this one (Europa Universalis etc.) then go watch Arumba's guide on how to play it. Also, pay attention to the fact that it's 22 videos long of about 18 minutes each. Granted, they are very in-depth, but this does not change the fact that understanding how this game works is not easy. It's an experience, and you will have to put time and effort into this game to get any sort of rewarding feeling for playing it. However, once you reach that point it becomes something very fun. Suddenly your son dieing of small pox leaving your daughter the only one to inherit becomes a challenge, rather than a guaranteed game over. Your neighbor converting to a different religion becomes an opperunity, not a reason to cower hoping that they won't declare war. The Pope becomes your ""friend"" rather than the guy that excommunicates you so your neighbor can steal your♥♥♥♥♥♥ It goes on and on.Now, I like this game. I want that to be clear. However, this is not a game for everyone. It's not a game made for everyone either, hence the price point. This game in itself is a bit of a hobby, and while the price is stupidly high, it's about 6 or 7 expansions of decent content and a butt load of not so decent penny grabs. However, playing without all the dlc is very different from playing with all the dlc, and the game with dlc is objectively better most of the time. It's got more content, a bigger map, more events, religions, etc. As such, if your on the fence about this game, I'd suggest waiting until it goes on sale - as it does usually every so often - and pick up the whole thing for about 25~30ish dollars. At that price I'd hands down suggest this game to anyone with even a remote interest, but whether or not it's worth the full 160 is your decision, and you might regret it.Onto what this game actually is. In essence, you play as a family, not a single character. You do play as one person at a time, but you are survived by your children or relatives. You build power through war - which is not as exciting as it sounds - and intrique - which is. This game is not about the combat. It matters, yes, but playing a warmonger is only fun for about the first 80 hours put into a dynisty before you own all of Europe and are expanding into uncivilized lands. It is - above all - a game about the sibling murder, the incest, the bribing, the corruption, the intrigue, the homosexuals, the lovers, the concubines, the children, the murdering of the children, the arranged marriages, the raiding, the power struggles, the underlings -  the dirty, dirty unloyal underlings - the castle building, the character improvement, the ruling, and - above all - the characters. This game has no story, and yet the best story of any game I've ever played. Everything that happens is your legacy. You murdered the duke and stole his titles, well that's now part of your family legacy. Married into Royalty. That's there too. The whole game is about building your own alternative histories where the Scottish get invaded by the Moors and become Muslims, where Russia is formed early and fends off the mongols, where the Viking Pagan Empire stretches from Iceland to India. It's about doing whatever the hell you want, and it's glorious.This game is fun, and half of the fun is figuring out why it's fun. But for the love of all that is watched over by Zun, don't spend 160 bucks on the thing if you're unsure it's your cup of tea. It might be the best tea you've ever had, but wait until it's on sale.

												This as you may noticed from my play time on it that I love this game. This game is awesome, I wish though that the battles were more designed along the lines of the Total War series. The length of the game is awesome though. Same with the in-depth in the role you can play in a county, dukedom, kingdom and even empires if you are able to create one. The one thing that I do not enjoy is the fact that you can't have a good multiplayer session due to the fact that the games always desync from the host and its players. I have only finished one game as the Duke of Sjaelland, where i neglected to fight the Mongol horde and ended up losing my seat as the Duke of their and moved on to become a vassal of the Aztec Empire. Definately a thumbs up and sure buy if you are into Grand Strategy.Graphics: 8 - Not much to look at since your normally in map view.Sound: 9 - Great soundtrackGameplay: 9 - Great game, tends to be hard in certain areas and demense sizesStory: 8 - Make your own historical household.

												Do you remember the primitive empire building mechanics in Mount and Blade? Ever feel like they weren't able to cover the real breadth of possible political intrigue? Did you ever think you could have solved a standoff by quietly assassinating a regent, marrying off your sister to a mongolian despot, keeping a rival monarchs heir under lock and key by offering to ""educate"" them before declaring a surprise war or carefully replacing all your precursors council members with men fiercely loyal to yourself? Then step right this way my friend, as Crusader Kings 2 is essentially ALL that and a metric tonne more.On the positive side Crusader Kings 2 is one of those games that benefits from a level of detail that should impress even the most brick-chewing and hardened history buff as the majority of its campaigns are based around the monarchs and clergy of the real middle ages. Paradox has done a laudible job in recreating the insane game of political backsies that these historical figures found themselves living through or dieing in. The fact that it also gives you a quick and easy way to look up more information on particularly interesting characters is a great example of tangential learning used in gaming. Further to this there's a truly dizzying amount of depth to the games mechanics that gives you an idea of just why every ruler had to have a retinue of advisors and counsels to help them manage information and make decisions. The lack of a strong structured narrative also gives the player a lot of freedom in how they tackle problems or exploit oppurtunities. It leads to some rather interesting emergent gameplay scenarios that I suspect people who enjoy the game while love swapping with other players just to compare how they each dealt with unexpected problems.It all adds together to give CS2 a real sense of atmosphere, refreshingly not in the usual ""dark, rainy and miserable"" sense that highly atmospheric games often default to. You end up feeling like a man (or woman) with a bit of power under their belt but an order of magnitude more responsibility than you could possibly have been prepared for.On the other hand...the user interface and tutorial could use a hell of a lot of work. Yes this is fairly par for the course in a Paradox game but it becomes more of a bugbear than usual in CS2 due to the sheer magnitude of information the game is required to communicate to the player.  You open a single figure's profile and you're given their nationality, general skills, specific strengths and weaknesses, religion, marriage/betrothal status, claims to land and title, demense makeup, alliances, honourary titles, family tree, dynastic tree, vassals, retainers, your opinion of them, their opinions of you, their hopes and dreams...AGH! STOP! Look I just want to know who his heirs are so I can kidnap one of them!Compounding this problem is that the number of possible avenues of play is quite large and, while the tutorial does it's level best to introduce us to all of them, it felt like trying to teach the specifics of circuit design to a confused panda: More difficult than nessecary and ultimately kind of pointless. When I sat down to go through the tutorial myself I had already initiated and succesfully resolved two murder plots by the time the game actually introduced me to the plotting and conspiracy system. Yet by the time my neighbours were marching over my home territory and I was running about in a flap trying to route them the game decided that now, after the invasion of my home had already begun, would be a good time to teach me about building static defences...on my island colony several thousand kilometeres away. Thanks CS2, you couldn't have mentioned this whole ""developing technology"" thing a little earlier? Perhaps back before my paper thin walls had been breached by a ballistae?Ultimately though once a player works out the ins and outs of the system, and yes that might take several decades of PHD level research and a small team of interns working around the clock, they'll find themselves immersed in a mechanically deep and highly immersive world that will reward them with... well probbably a poisoned cup of wine carried by your heir apparent but a historically accurate one nonetheless.

												This is a sandbox game where you given direct control of a single individual with the goal of preserving your family legacy. Gameplay is strategic and chaotic. It's one of the most fun things I've done in quite some time and I did start to really get into my character and their families.For example,  One of the Nordic Kings sieged my castle in Dorset while my army was away helping an allied king, imprisoned my pregnant wife and then after she gave birth to my first son (while I had Agnatic Primogeniture Succession laws), held HIM hostage, took my wife as his concubine - and then continued to siege my lands.When my army finally returned to the de jure Kingdom of England to take revenge, I was faced with 10 to 1 odds and no allies strong enough to make a difference.  So I decided I would have the Nordic wife-stealer killed in his sleep. My (now technically) ex-wife was MORE than happy to contribute to the plot and he was killed in a carriage while travelling. My involvement was discovered and the Nordic King's son was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and I could not diplomatically persuade him to free her.So I tried a DIFFERENT plot against the son, except now I couldn't get anyone to back the plot. Even my ex-wife had moral qualms - she was free of her concubinage and had nothing personal against the 12 kid who we had thrust onto the throne. But I wanted my son and wife back.I couldn't use brute force, I lacked the numbers.I couldn't use diplomacy, I had♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the Nords too much.I couldn't use Intrigue, no one shared my vision.I couldn't use Religion, I wasn't pious enough.Sure enough, the 12-year old Nordic kid grew up to be a more terrifing fighter than his dad and decided to take his revenge by once again sieging Dorset.I was eventually thrust right back into the familiar postion of Elodie - except instead of a dead lumen mother, I had a dead duke dad. A young girl with no allies or experience needed to fight her enemies.Except where Elodie had magic powers and a kingdom's resouces, I was a poor muggle countess. It didn't end well.So I started a NEW game where I took particular note of the original Nordic King I was fighting and what he did and I have managed not to draw any attention to myself thus far.I am LOVING this game, but it was incredibly expensive even during the Summer Sale where everything was 75% off or more. That is perhaps the main problem with this game, although it has not deterred me.			"

												So good. Marry your children off, then watch as they kill each other, and soon, you. Build up a dynasty to rival the greatest, only to have it come crashing down in the blink of an eye. It's AGoT in Europe, or if you get the awesome full conversion mod, in GRRM's world!			"

												Rating 8.5/10Make sure you buy the CK2 Complete Pack on sale(GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY)This is a must have for any grand strategy fan.  (BEWARE STEEP LEARNING CURVE)<by this i mean a good 6 hours or so to get the basics. Even after this you are always learning something. would recommend Arumba's CK2 Tutorial Series on youtube. Also great to watch to get an idea of the features in the game and the level of depth involved.Features.Manage your dynasty.Plot to kill other characters in the game. Amusing events and decision based on your characters traits and ambitions(Of which you can manage once you learn the game).Conquer lands for your county/duchy/kingdom/empire.Manage your council and court.And many many moreIf you are still reading now for my reviewI enjoyed 90% of this game, although there are thing's that paradox could have done better such as the warfare,Building management, religion and the whole pope minigame, But this is still a great title and i was very happy with my purchase. I spent hours on hours managing my dynasty,Court and my council. While this was happening i was also plotting against my enemies and even my own subjects in my kingdom/empire who were a troublesome sight to my reign. Also had to help my allies and keep an eye on my dynasty members(sisters/daughters) in particular, who i married off to people in larger empires outside my lands who i had high plans for. Overall this game is outstanding if you enjoy a nice in depth/complex empire and dynsaty management system.			"

												I have enjoyed this game much more than I anticipated. My favorite aspect is the length of time in which to create a lasting ""family dynasty."" Paradox (the game studio) has offered, for better or worse depending, several downloadable content (""DLC""s), not all of which are crucial, but offer different enhancements. ""The Old Gods"", my reason for purchasing this particular DLC, allows the player to begin the game in AD867, instead of AD1066. Crusader Kings II, affectionately knowns as ""CK2"" which ends with the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in AD1435 (I think), has a DLC with allows a ""saved game"" to be exported to another Paradox game, Europa Univeralis IV, or ""EU4."" EU4, which is quite different, allows the CK2 game to continue on past 1435. CK2, has more detail when it comes to creating a family dynasty that lasts through hundreds of years and allows a player to play in a dynastic succession. If you have more questions, please ask!			"

												A Grand piece of work in the Grand Strategy Genre of Grand Strategy games...Humor aside, the game has a strong focus on managing relationships (especially amongst your vassals) and guiding your dynasty from the Dark Ages to the High Middle Ages. The ""Sandbox"" effect and replayability of Crusader Kings II is by far it's most prominent feature, no two play-throughs will ever be similar. The Scope and scale of the game, and it's gameplay depth have been greatly increased since it's launch by many well-priced ""core expansions"" (Sword of Islam, Old Gods, The Republic, Way of Life, and Horse Lords). Offering countless hours of replayability, a good level of gameplay depth, and a vibrant modding community, Crusader Kings II is probably (in my opinion) one of the best Strategy Games of all time.

												Crusader Kings II (CKII) is the most tactical strategy game of all time. From the producers at Paradox, it incorporates a number of features missing from most strategy games, and provides a robust modding experience allowing players to rewrite history on their own terms. As a person who detested Paradox games, I went into CKII expecting to be turned away, but instead, I was sucked in to an intricately unique character development system.Unlike most strategy games focusing on war and city-management, CKII's character development system sets the bar for future grand strategy games. Literally every character in the game has traits. These traits culminate into a character's statistics, and their behavioural A.I. For example, characters with the ambitious trait are aggressive in pursuing actions to further their own personal agenda; however, characters with the content trait tend to be passive. Characters who are lustful pursue multiple relationships, deceitful characters are more driven to betray others.As your nation's leader, you must juggle between these behaviour types, and more, to create a peaceful and large country amongst threats from various warring fronts. You have rebels, political strife, assassinations, the Mongols, the Pope, and simply ill-fated events, such as the plague. Age is also a factor, and as you and your council grow older, your favorite characters are more suspectible to illness, and negative traits, such as being infirm. One day, my talented leader died because his heart wasn't healthy enough for sex. The game is profoundly deep, and you'll feel like it accounts for everything.Speaking of sex, the game dives into very controversial taboos that would make some developers squeamish. There is imprisonment, torture, concubines, bi-sexual relationships, pagan religions, cruelty to children, making someone eunich, and that's just the original CKII content! Intrepid modders have already added slavery, assassinating your own children, and fantasy content, such as Succubi, werewolves, and vampires. The game is what you make of it! CKII also has an ambitious Game of Thrones mod. It includes a customized map, and all the characters from the show with their corresponding behavioural traits, events, and more.CKII is a ground-breaking ambitious title setting the bar for future strategy games. It's character-driven concept is fresh and innovative, and I hope Sega's Total War series embraces some of its ideas.			"

It is a extremely strategically based game and requires your full attention during every moment. It is overwhelming at first, but you get the hang of it really fast. Mastering however takes time and patience. If you like Civilization V, then think of this as a really really in-depth medieval era type game play, with a little less unit building and more economy based.			"

												I've spent waaaaay too much time in this game whether modding or playing it.This game certaintly has a hard learning curve but once you understand it the game is incredible.  I recommend choosing the Canary islands and speeding up the game for around 30 years and then saving and reentering as a random person in the world.  It is incredibly satisfying seeing the insanity that is possible and slowly working your way up the ranks.Even aside from the world the game brings, if you don't like medieval Europe then get a mod that is a post-apocalyptic North America or Skyrim or Game of Thrones.  You can add magic, werewolves, and many other assortment of Fantasy beings.  There's a mod that completely transforms the game into the space age.  Counties are now worlds and it adds a ton more content with all new cultures and religions.Even better than all that, if you don't like a small part of the game, even part of a mod, you can just take it out.  The coding language is incredibly easy to grasp and you can remove or change pretty much everything in the game.  The only real downside of the coding side of things is the fact that there aren't really many guides out there and the ones that are out there are kind of lame and lack support.  That is all forgiven by me though as you can easily reference other mods and the game code itself to see how they do things.To add even onto that the console in the game is well done with numerous commands.  If you want to cheat you can cheat and if you want to play legit you can play legit.I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who has some time and the small commitment to learn the game.			"

												Easily one of the best games I have ever played. I'm going to be honest, if you want your game to be action packed, this is probably not a game for you, as it is a 100% strategic game, especially in Ironman (not cheating, only autosave) mode.I've tried explaining this game to a couple of people and it's just not possible, 'cause there is just so much to it.Not only can you roleplay perfectly in this game, you can raise your Dynasty from the Count of Paris to the King of France, it's all in your hands.It might not be action packed, but trust me, if you are playing as a Count with a 45 year old wife, 0 intrigue (trait for killing people etc.) no children, and thus no heir, you are going to be Game Over.I can't say enough how much enjoyment and pleasure this game will give you if you love medieval, strategic games.There is, however one downside to it, if you buy the game without DLC's you are going to have to pay A LOT of money to really enjoy the game (have the ability to play as Muslims, Jews etc.) There are ofcourse Game + DLC packs available on the internet which will give you enough DLC's to play the game properly. Game is NOT recommend without the mayor DLC's.  "

You can add magic, werewolves, and many other assortment of Fantasy beings.  There's a mod that completely transforms the game into the space age.  Counties are now worlds and it adds a ton more content with all new cultures and religions.Even better than all that, if you don't like a small part of the game, even part of a mod, you can just take it out.  The coding language is incredibly easy to grasp and you can remove or change pretty much everything in the game.  The only real downside of the coding side of things is the fact that there aren't really many guides out there and the ones that are out there are kind of lame and lack support.  That is all forgiven by me though as you can easily reference other mods and the game code itself to see how they do things.To add even onto that the console in the game is well done with numerous commands.  If you want to cheat you can cheat and if you want to play legit you can play legit.I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who has some time and the small commitment to learn the game.			"

												I played as Galicia, I didn't want to assassinate my dear brother, King of Leon, he asked for assistant on his holy war for Toledo.I obliged to his request, a faction popped out within my kingdom wanting King of Leon to take over. My vassal wanted him, they kicked me out. I'm left with my two provinces. He won the war, got 5 new lands. I tried to revolt and take back my provinces, he attacked me, I lost.He imprisoned me. I asked for a better prison. He threw me into the worst of the worst. I watched his empire crumble as the muslim attack his kingdom. Castille and Navarra won't help Leon. Leon gets his♥♥♥♥♥kicked, I tried to get the Muslim to help me. They invaded my last remaining province.End GameLife Simulator 10/10			"

												I may have only played this during the free week, but once I did, after the week was over I put it on my wishlist. It is a extremely strategically based game and requires your full attention during every moment. It is overwhelming at first, but you get the hang of it really fast. Mastering however takes time and patience. If you like Civilization V, then think of this as a really really in-depth medieval era type game play, with a little less unit building and more economy based.			"

												Probably my favourite strategy game of all time. It is a very in-depth game which looks at the complex relations a ruler or lowly count must maintain to stay in control of your vast or small empire. You can play as anyone you want in Europe and beyond.The A Game of Thrones Mod is also amazing as it has totally converted the entire world, added events, traits and people to the vast world inspired by GRRM's A Song of Ice and Fire.This game is regularly on sale so it is a good buy for those who like other games such as CIV 5, Total War or other Paradox Games such as Hearts of Iron 3 or Europa Universalis 4.EDIT: A few years on and this is still my favourite strategy game of all time, with each free patch and DLC release the game just gets better and better. Whilst the game may be daunting to learn in the beginning it is certainly worthwhile. The huge DLC list may be off putting but only a handful are what are considered the core DLC (ones that add major features to the game past visual packs like portraits or songs packs etc) and there are plenty of lists you can quickly find with a Google search of which are the most recommended.

												It has a VERY steep learning curve, but for strategy fans, I can't recommend it enough, its a very unique game. Basically, the goal is to last as long as you can, its over when ether you lose your last piece of land, or if your ruler dies without a heir. Its very complex, but so worth it once you get the hang of it. I mean really, how many games come along where you can say you had the Pope assassinated? Unlike a lot of strategy games, its not so much about build this and conqure everyone, its more about surviving and the political intrigue of the times. People will try to fabricate claims on your land, your second wife may try to have a son you had with your first wife assassinated so that her child will become the rightfull heir. You can start in Ireland and work your way up from count, to king, then conqure Scotland and England to form the Empire of Britannia. You can stratigically marry off your daughters to prestigous people of other countrys, then their sons will have claim to those lands. Theres different rules too, which you can change so that daughters can inherit, or that women can even inheret on the same grounds men do. There is a LOT to the game. The DLCs add even more, such as being able to play as pagens and sacrificeing your prisioners, if thats more your thing.			"

												This game is only worth it if you've played other strategy games and gotten bored because there isn't enough detail.You can plot to kill a member of your court, join a war, start a war, arrange marriages, imprison people, execute those people and quell some rebellious villagers while you're at it.In my game I helped my uncle take over Norway and once he had won using his wealth and considerable armies I had him assassinated and inherited it all at almost no cost to myself. Felt very game of thrones-esque.The one thing to be warned of is that since I bought this game a couple years ago the developer has removed things from the game and resold them as DLC, they've also added a bunch with DLC and continue to do so but my advice is to be careful with your money because you can easily overspend on this game to have a more ""complete"" experience.*EDIT* I should add that this game is very poorly optimized so even though it's a very fancy 2D game you can easily encounter very significant FPS problems given that the game seems to only utilize one CPU core. It starts off strong but the longer the game the more Ai characters your computer has to manage and that slows it down considerably.			"

												The sheer brutality of ruling Medieval Europe made available to you on your computer. I doubt I will ever have the ""Paragon of Virtue"" trait in any of my games. In order to be a strong leader you have to be smart, keep your vassals happy, forge alliances, make sure your heir is strong and that he inherits all of your holdings. I bought the Charlemagne expansion pack, and I am currently playing Charlemagne.Crusader Kings 2 is an awesome alternate history generator- I was able to marry Gisela into the Byzantine Imperial family (historically the attempt to marry her to Leo, Constantine V's son, did not happen since the contract was broken. In real life she became a nun, and ultimately was the abess of Chelles Abbey), which provided the foundation for a formal alliance with the Byzantium in the game I am playing now. I can't wait to see how history unfolds based on this, and all of the other choices I have made up to now. The only drawback to the game is that it's really hard to play the game ""out of the box"". The tutorial modes are not that great. I had to watch a few videos of gameplay on Youtube, enough to get a basic grasp of the game. I watched these two and went on with my own designs for ruling. This is the better of the two gameplay vids that I watched:

												I do think I could write rivers of ink about this game but, mostly, that would be missing the point of a good review, in particular a review that should be good for new player.So let's start with basics and the game's feeling: you control a dinasty, you get to decide things about your realm, your subjects and your family members... and then your ruler dies horribly and then you get a new character and everything can change (usually for the worse, true GOT style).There is little logic in Crusader Kings II mechanics, and most of time this happens because it actually reflects historical Feudalism. If you like logical strategy games you are mostly in the wrong place.That does not mean that you cannot find your logic trail here and there bust most of the time you just need to KNOW what triggers what. It is mostly about knowledge and less about strategy.That said the best part is the narrative side. The mix of events, character personalities and objectives can create funny stories.It is, and it has been for a while, my ""just 5 more minutes"" game, replacing Civilization, and I am quite confident it will stay like that for a while.If you like this mix but also more coherent and hardcore strategy experience move toward Europa Universalis IV.

												This game... ahh this game. I was introduced to the world of Paradox games via EU3, and it was during the wait for EU4, it's acclaimed successor, that I fell into the world of Crusader Kings 2. Before anything else I will tell you this, Crusader Kings 2 is one of my favorite games of all time. I have spent countless hours having absurd amounts of fun staring at little marching sprites and glorified statistics pages on my computer screen. I have put more planning into securing lands, titles, marriages, etc in this game than I have on probably most anything in real life. I wouldn't have it any other way. The sheer amount of DLC is abusive and must be bought at massive steam discount. Much of it is purely aesthetic and need not actually be bought at all. But this is made up for with the sheer number of quality mods, including huge overhauls like my personal favorite Game of Thrones one. CK2 is basically the gaming embodiment of Game of Thrones whether the blades my little commanders are wielding are Valyrian or Damascus Steel.The point is you should buy this game. If you like strategy, if you like grand strategy, hell if you like court intrigue on TV, you will like this game. The learning curve can be a little steep. But a little effort to learn the game is paid back tenfold with endless story forging opportunity. Because that's what this game is, the most incredible merger of sandbox strategy and deep plot there ever was. Hopefully the people in your life will be at peace with seeing you less often. "

I highly recommend dumping the time required into so that you can get immersed in one of the best strategy games ever. On top of that, the developers, Paradox Interactive, regularly update the game along with the DLC that comes out. Crusader Kings II also stands as a reasonable example of good DLC. All of the DLC packs were made post launch and some of them are incredibly high quality. 8/10, would buy again.			"

												If you are looking for a grand strategy game, this is it. I came to this game as a fan of the Total War series, and initially looked upon Crusader Kings II with trepidation. However, I can honestly say that this game more fully scratches the grand strategy itch than any other. A word of warning, however. The learning curve is extremely steep. If you try to jump right in, you will surely drown! That being said, if you can devote the time to learn this game's expansive intracacies (every time I play, I learn more), you will not be disappointed. Who I would recommend this game to: Any strategy gamer that is not satisfied with calling ""Clash of Clans"" or ""DoTa"" a strategy game. If you wish the Civilization series had more depth, or the Total War series more historicity, this game is hands down for you.Who I would NOT recomment this game to: people with low attention spans.For me, hands down the best strategy game I've played in years.

It has excellent modability and replayability, deep and complex mechanic, constant support (at least until they release new game), good visuals and music, and It gets even better with mods like AGOT (game of thrones) or CKII+ and VIET.There are however few issues with game engine - the longer you play one character/dynasty the slower the game gets, bugs start to appear, family trees keep getting messed up, crashes occur, AI gets worse. This hasn't been fixed with patches.I also disapprove of the excessive amount of addons and dlc's, and would've preferred if they bundled them together or kept some of them on sale constantly.			"

												Crusader kings II is the holy grail of grand strategy games. On the grand scale you control a king and his realm (Or a duke or count if you'd like) and make various decisions to benefit it. On the smaller scale of things, you become entwined in a web of international politics and plots, domestic politics and plots, feudal succession laws and many other things. It's a game where everything in the world actively affects everything else in the world. DLC is not required at all, but it does double up the game size with each DLC, each adding even more replay value to a great game.			"

												This is probably the best strategy game paradox has ever made. It has excellent modability and replayability, deep and complex mechanic, constant support (at least until they release new game), good visuals and music, and It gets even better with mods like AGOT (game of thrones) or CKII+ and VIET.There are however few issues with game engine - the longer you play one character/dynasty the slower the game gets, bugs start to appear, family trees keep getting messed up, crashes occur, AI gets worse. This hasn't been fixed with patches.I also disapprove of the excessive amount of addons and dlc's, and would've preferred if they bundled them together or kept some of them on sale constantly.			"

Became a lunatic and would strip naked and howl at the moon like a wolf. My face fell off. I have leprosy.

Posted: June 12, 2015
												If you have the patience or a friend to teach you how this game works, it´s a game you can easily spend hundreds of hours in. If you are into strategy games I can definately recommend this one. It´s not the easiest to learn, in fact, after fifty games you will still learn more about this game, and with the continuous supply of DLC you will not get bored of this game quickly.Now, why is this game so great?+ A big map that gets expanded occasionally. You can start of as a viking king in Norway and eventually rule India, or start as a Russian Slavic pagan and become emperor of Europe. And who knows what Paradox is preparing to add next?+ A hundred of options with a thousand of choices. Whether you start off as a viking or a muslim, you will encounter similar problems. However, every religion, culture and country has it's own way of solving those. And as your character develops he will unlock (or block) other options. You'll never stop exploring these options.+ Easier and harder gameplay is possible, so whether you are new or experienced you will always find your challenge+ Great multiplayer, especially with friends. Whether you like PvPing or play versus the computer, a good multiplayer match will always keep you interested. Connecting to other players has been made easier (compared to how it was in the past), and is easily done via steam.+ Events and results are random. You'll never know what happens, for you could be killed by bandits during your hajj to Mecca, or you could suddenly get an extra 100 gold.This can be very frustrating, or very interesting.+ You can create your starting king with the ruler creater DLC+ Loads of DLC that add new and interesting things to the game. When playing multiplayer, only the DLCs owned (and activated) by the host are available. If you play with friends, have the person who hosts most often get some DLCs, so the others won't need them.+ Starting date can vary from 769 to 1337 (there currently are six bookmarks, respectively the Early Middle Ages (769), the Viking Age (867), the High Middle Ages (1066) , the Alexiad (1081) the Age of the Mongols (1241) and the Late Middle Ages (1337).+ No game will every be the same. After a hundred years into the game, you will notice considerable differences in each game. A game would not be realistic if not without flaws, so here are some of the downsides- Event and results are random. You'll never know what happens, for you could be killed by bandits during your hajj to Mecca, or you could suddenly get an extra 100 gold. This can be very frustrating, or very interesting.- Multiplayer can sometimes be unstable, especially if you play with more than 5 people. Desyncs will happen every now and then (usually you can play for an hour or two), and you have to restart your game to properly solve it. This is less common if you play with less player and if the internet connections are good. (If you have good internet, and so do your friends, this is MUCH less likely to happen.)- At first, this game might be very complicated and confusing. I recommend playing with someone with experience, if possible. - Once you get to a certain size, you will become quite unstoppable (although there are a few big armies coming to Europe, like the mongols, that might make you lose lands again). Overall I would easily recommend this game. Once you grasp how this game works, you will be able to spend hours and hours of your time into this, exploring the near unlimited amount of options, and seeing how every game is available. If you play with friends, get a co-op game going. 9/10			"

												This is a premiere strategy game. It is NOT tactical. Let me repeat that. Tactics are NOT NOT NOT involved. I see too many people try this game expecting something akin to Total War only to get turned off by the lack of tactical decisions. ""Strategy"" games are more akin to simulation games in essence. You plan your course of action through dangerous circumstances to achieve the best victory possible. Strategy is knowing when to fight, where to fight, how to take advantage of your situation for long-term benefits, and other similar questions. Tactics is ""how to fight"" and this game does not cover that. It is a question of logistics rather than tactics. Do you have enough troops, rather than are your troops fighting at optimal efficieny. Do you have the defensive high ground, rather than whether or not this unit happens to be in good terrain at any given time. Do you catch the enemy army off guard, rather than using flanking to decimate part of the army. If you expect a Civilization-esque game, or something like Total War. Check your expectations. Go online, and watch gameplay before buying. You are probably in for a surprise.			"

A breath of fresh air with a unique perspective. If your an adult gamer this is an absolute must buy. If you are an intelligent teenager you may like this as well. Anyone younger should not apply, THANKFULLY. Paradox has always been great about making wonderful games that are art and art is not a democracy. If you focus grouped your game to see how wide of an audience you could mass market to then please, respectfully, go F yourself. Thankfully, this game is not made to cross platform appeal to everyone from 5 years old to grandmas. Long live Paradox, my favorite game developer.			"

												Ever loved games like medieval total war but couldn't bother to do the RTS parts of the game? then this is just for you.Crusader kings 2 puts you in the role of your leader king,baron,patriarch whatever you decide to start with, unlike similar games you can't choose what you want to construct or what kind of units you want to train , but you can choose who will educate your sons, who do you want to marry , who do you want to war on via diplomacy tricks in order to expand your empire and much more including setting a plot to kill your  brother so you can become the next king and have it all ruined because of one the people who joined your conspiracy got drunk and didn't keep his mouth shut , no two runs are ever the same aside historical events.The only downside i can see in this game is how most of the factions are dlc content ,if you want to experience being the leader of the turks and declare a jihad on half the christian empire then you need a dlc otherwise you can't play them same with a lot of really fun factions like venezian merchants.

												Grab Civ 5, Mount & Blade: Warband and the Sims series and you get this game. So far it beats every strategy name I ever laid my hands on and I only have 200 hours in it as of yet.The learning curve is long and painstaking, but it's definitely worth it.Many people complain about the immerse amount of DLC's that should be included in the vanilla, but once you grind your teeth and decide to buy some of them, (besides they are on sale rather frequently) you won't regret it as each one of them give something to the game that you otherwise would have missed. For instance (dlc's I have so far):- Legacy of Rome: Retinues and the Byzantine Empire- The Old Gods: the struggles of tribal people, conquering your way to feudalism/republics, also, raid europe to pieces- The Republic: start out slow and have huge armies, even as a single county ruler... or even just as a patrician vassal- Horse Lords: it's bloody hard, still just learning, but the hordes you can recruit are amazing- Charlemagne: another +100 years of (IRL) gameplay + tons of new tribal characters- Sword of Islam: another take on feudalism, plus roughly 1/3 of the map unlocked to play with- Way of Life: all the character focuses and the events they generate give the game so much more... the Seduction focus seems to be hated by the community, but it's fun, especially when you play with your friends. :P Also, don't be surprised if you die of syphilis. - Sons of Abraham: Jewish characters unlocked and some extra gold to be borrowed in times of need- Conclave: Your own council becomes your worst enemy, imo makes the game slightly harderAll in all, a great game, the only thing I could see it being better is if Paradox made multiplayer more stable, my friends often complain they've lost control over their troops and the game client needs rebooting, also whenever someone drops from the host, everyone has to reboot the client, as the multiplayer button is greyed out. Now this wouldn't bother me much, except sometimes you have to do it multiple times in a row until everyone can play again. So for me, single player 9/10, it's almost flawless, but for multiplayer it's only an 8/10, still a great experience (the other day we were laughing our♥♥♥♥♥♥off on a lunatic character's horse councillor, then I murdered it), but some fixes need to be done to make it perfect. I'd definitely recommend if: - you like sandbox strategy games- you like history and want to be part of it - you'd like to know more about medieval hierarchy- you'd rather lead a dynasty rather than a nation- you just want to watch the world burn			"

When i first got the game i decided i would play in ireland at the 867 start date.  i would eventually conquer all of ireland and scotland and wales. my king was king Eric V he was a badass as he had conquered wales for the glorius Irish empire. however his second son was lustful of the throne, his name was Bob (no joke) since i had the law that only the firstborn son of the ruler would succed, Bob killed his elder brother Aethulwulf and inherited the throne for himself, but thier was a crucial flaw in his plan. Aethulwulfs son Eric still lived, and the game let me play as Eric not bob. so i spent my entire reign as duke of connacht ploting to take back the throne that was rightfully mine. in the year 1024 me and my sons decided taht it was time to take my birthright. i demanded the throne but was rejected by uncle Bob and i started a civil war that would last 20 years. the irish and scottish lords on my side and the other lrish and welsh lords on bobs side. needless to say that war killed off 13 family members including Erics second and fourth son. by the end Eric had killed Bob and all his children, but was maimed. he died a year after taking the throne from his wound. i would later port this game into EU4 and conquer the world. when i was about to port my game to EU4 i looked at the history of my family, and Bobs name in history was ""Bob the bad"" 100/10			"

												Crusader Kings 2 is a very unique game. To date, I haven't played another strategy game like it, and it's likely there aren't any. This game can make somewhat similar games, like Civilization, feel quite disappointing.This game is all about your family, politics, your characters, your religion, your culture... there's a lot of depth. And after you've played for a few hours, you should have a story worth telling to someone. Stories that alter history. It easily beats out almost every other strategy game I've played in this way.This is one of the few games where it's okay to kill your wife, your brothers, and your uncle's 2-year-old child, all for the sole purpose of aspiring to be even greater than they were.Be warned, this game can be very frustrating: You learn more through your failure than your success, and sometimes there's something big you've overlooked for the last day (or month) you've been playing. I highly recommend you try the demo and watch some people play this game online (Youtube, for example) before you're determined to buy it.It also has some of the best modifications out there for any strategy game, including a Game of Thrones mod that's well acclaimed and probably the best Game of Thrones game out there. As a sandboxy medieval European story simulator, this game shines. You will giggle at the death of little boys and marrying their sisters as you inherit land and claims for war. Very rarely do I feel like I waste my time with this game. There's no grinding. And Paradox tries to improve it with patch after patch, which is nice.The only downside, in my opinion, is the way the DLC is released, with song packs, skin packs, etc. however, the higher priced DLC is worth buying for the most part - just read what it's about before you buy it and you should be good to go.This is, by far, the best game Paradox has to offer, and one of the most worthy games on Steam to buy.

Great Britian and France try to purge my little country of Brittany but we hold strong, we plan to take no quarter to these Catholic hippies.

												Great, unique game that any grand strategy enthusiast should purchase.Crusader Kings II fills an excellent niche of strategy where the goal is to control and survive internal struggles as it is to survive the machinations of your neighbors.  A full-blown character development and dynasty system gives incredible richness to the world and the player's attachment to character, family, and kingdom.This is fantastic game for single or co-op play.  It takes a long time to learn and master, but once you've got it the game becomes very fun and satisfying.My primary complaints lie in the underdeveloped economic side, underdeveloped religious system (especially for non-Catholics and non-Norse) slow casus-belli capture-one-county-at-a-time conquering system, and multiplayer instability.Note: The developers have consistently released new content for the game, which is incredible.  A lot of the key additions are also given for free for vanilla users.  That said, there are some DLC expansions that add important new systems or create additional depth to existing ones, which therefore should be purchased with vanilla.  If on a tight budget, I would definitely pick up Old Gods.  All other DLC at your discretion.			"

												Crusader kings 2 is a really fun game. It might look intimidating at first because of all the things you need to think about (especially if you take a big character for your first game). But the basic are pretty easy to learn. Playing this felt like an episode of GoT.This game has almost unlimited replay capacity and gives you a great sense of satisfaction when you defeat and conquerer enemy territory. Another plus is that now, the game has official servers so its much easier to play with friends. As for the DLCs, i'd say they're worth it (excepts for the one with the Aztec invading Europe, that makes absolutly no sense whatsoever). My favorite 2 are the old gods (you get to play as vikings) and the ruler designer (create your own dynasty).I've had my fair share of hours of play and i can say, if you're into history, you're going to like this game (hell if you're not you might start to like it now)			"

												Grab Civ 5, Mount & Blade: Warband and the Sims series and you get this game. So far it beats every strategy name I ever laid my hands on and I only have 200 hours in it as of yet.The learning curve is long and painstaking, but it's definitely worth it.Many people complain about the immerse amount of DLC's that should be included in the vanilla, but once you grind your teeth and decide to buy some of them, (besides they are on sale rather frequently) you won't regret it as each one of them give something to the game that you otherwise would have missed. For instance (dlc's I have so far):- Legacy of Rome: Retinues and the Byzantine Empire- The Old Gods: the struggles of tribal people, conquering your way to feudalism/republics, also, raid europe to pieces- The Republic: start out slow and have huge armies, even as a single county ruler... or even just as a patrician vassal- Horse Lords: it's bloody hard, still just learning, but the hordes you can recruit are amazing- Charlemagne: another +100 years of (IRL) gameplay + tons of new tribal characters- Sword of Islam: another take on feudalism, plus roughly 1/3 of the map unlocked to play with- Way of Life: all the character focuses and the events they generate give the game so much more... the Seduction focus seems to be hated by the community, but it's fun, especially when you play with your friends. :P Also, don't be surprised if you die of syphilis. - Sons of Abraham: Jewish characters unlocked and some extra gold to be borrowed in times of need- Conclave: Your own council becomes your worst enemy, imo makes the game slightly harderAll in all, a great game, the only thing I could see it being better is if Paradox made multiplayer more stable, my friends often complain they've lost control over their troops and the game client needs rebooting, also whenever someone drops from the host, everyone has to reboot the client, as the multiplayer button is greyed out. Now this wouldn't bother me much, except sometimes you have to do it multiple times in a row until everyone can play again. So for me, single player 9/10, it's almost flawless, but for multiplayer it's only an 8/10, still a great experience (the other day we were laughing our♥♥♥♥♥♥off on a lunatic character's horse councillor, then I murdered it), but some fixes need to be done to make it perfect. I'd definitely recommend if: - you like sandbox strategy games- you like history and want to be part of it - you'd like to know more about medieval hierarchy- you'd rather lead a dynasty rather than a nation- you just want to watch the world burn			"

												Two years ago, I got CKII on special offer just for the hell of it, and I played it for about 4 hours. Now, I've logged about 800(Make that 900) hours on it. Well, When I played it for 4 hours...I hated it. it was just so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ complicated, boring, I couldn't work out the systems, it was BORING. I only played it when I got bored, until one day, in september 2014, I was playing it out of boredom and I married someone. Her father died shortly after, and she inherited his duchy in norway. Then, my character died and his 15 year old son became head of one of the most powerfu, duchies in Norway. fast forward 100 years and We're kings of norway and england. fast forward 50 years anf we're counts of some rocks in Cornwall. then, we became kings in less than 25 years. And that's the magic of CKII. anything can happen. It's impossible to describe, do I'll split it into pros and cons.Cons: a learning curve of 90 degrees and an absolutely disgusting tutorial system that teaches nothingPros: when you learn the game, It becomes a vibrant, sprawling mass of politics, marriage, religion and warfare, trying to get on top and stay there while everyone else tries to kill you, and desperately surviving. The game tells a story of events, families, murders and warfare. Oh, and incest... It's gritty and down to earth, showing the reality of medieval history in the ways history class never could, whilst giving a delightful account of the bedroom antics of rednecks and showing that one kid, one wife who likes guys a bit too much, one bad trait, one guy with that ♥♥♥♥ing trusting trait can completely screw up a plan that has been in progress for 100 years, only for you to turn events around and become king of Spain, when you actually meant to be king of Scotland.In short, this game can be tlked about endlessly, but only understood and loved when it's bought, when you climb that pile of corpses that mainly consist of your brothers because ypu havent got Primogeniture succession/ Climbing the learning curve and play it. It's been my favourite game for the last two years and has won that title easily due to it's ability to be remarkably simple, yet so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ complex, you're always learning.			"

												This game will hate you. It will leap up and slap you in the face. And as a result, you will never want to leave its side. As a wise man once said: Life has no Ctrl 'Z'.A great many things are beyond your control, unusual in a strategy game but far more true to reality. Perhaps you will pause in your travels at a tavern, nurse a cool ale, and the tavern will explode, killing you instantly. Son of a... Is nothing sacred?Or maybe your favourite son will take over as regent when you grow old and decrepit, only to steal all your titles and imprison you. Bet you're regreting your refusal to aid your brother in killing the little sod now, aren't you?Perhaps you become just another in a long line to die from Medieval Europe's most dangerous plague - 'Suspicious circumstances'?It's never entirely clear how suspicious they are, or what you're supposed to do about it, but you know what they say - Life's a female dog. Or maybe, at the ripe old age of 84 you'll die from syphillis. Irritating it might be, but you'll be unable to fight the surge of pride that you were still getting it on at an age when most men's fading eyesight ensures they can't even see the appropriate body parts any more.And the list goes on: vassals tearing your Empires apart, mobs killing your tax collectors, rioting zealots, crusades, becoming blinded, castrated, imprisoned, diseased, incapable, having your son born the anti-christ, or, god forbid, losing your favourite hunting hound (why, why, oh cruel, wretched world?). CK2 will punish you, and you will love every second of it, because when you do manage to pull everything together, nothing in life will bring you more joy. Not since Firefly has anything been more deserving of the tagline 'Someone ever tries to kill you, you try to kill 'em right back.'			"

												This is indeed grand strategy. And it is excellent.Multiple aspects of this game elevate it to its status at the pinnacle of its genre. First of all, the deciding factor for me that makes it better than other Paradox games is the added RPG element. No longer are you simply commanding a country and desperately trying to stop inflation. Now you also feverishly work to impregnate your barren wife and secure an heir while assasinating your cousins left and right. If that doesn't sound like fun I don't know what does.There's also the great open-ended freedom of this game. Unlike Civ, which is simply a race to dominate, Crusader Kings allows you to do whatever the heck you want. Feel like taking on the Golden Horde as King Kazimierz of Poland? Give it a shot. Or just chill as Earl Murchard in Ireland where literally nothing happens.Did I mention that there's a 32 person multiplayer mode?TL;DR- You should totally get this game. "

												Eh. Crusader Kings 2 is embletic of Paradox's greatest virtues and flaws. On the one hand you have a truly immersive game worth hundreds if not thousands of hours of gameplay, but at the same time any attachement to the game itself erodes as they go for breadth instead of depth. In an year in the lifespan of one of their games, you can be sure that as much as six months will be unplayable for one reason or another due to the cycle of DLC - > Bugs -> Patch -> Bugs -> Patch - DLC that leave the base game a complete mess for new players and forces you to take on the whole of the DLC to get an actual cohesive experience. For me it's kind of telling that the most solid previous generation game they had was Victoria 2 which ceased recieving DLC a long time ago but was still a lot of fun and almost never had any bugs at end of focus period. When you add into that Paradox's tendency to decide how you can or can't play your game (closing off North Korea mode, multiple ""fixes"" to player-chosen game-styles and not allowed achievements in single-player), then it becomes a very love-hate relationship with a largely well-meanign company slightly too reliant on DLC to keep their franchises going. I'd give CK2 a thumbs up purely for appreciation for the hours of quality gameplay provided but given how burned out it's left me on Paradox as a whole I find myself unable to do that.			"

												Really not my sort of game, despite me trying my darndest to enjoy it, for I have friends who love it. Thirty hours in and it still only makes limited sense to me (and no, I'm not a complete and utter idiot). Far too much seems dependent on luck, for a start. Event pop-ups occur where you can make some rather limited decisions, and there will be cases of 'fourty-percent chance something you don't want happens, sixty-percent something you do want happens'. Quite a lot of cases of that, in fact. If that makes for enjoyable gameplay for some people, then have at it - I'm not stopping you. For me on the other hand, constantly saving so that I can reload if I get buggered over by RNG isn't what I'd consider to be fun (or I guess you could play ironman mode and let fate take its toll, though I rather play the slots at a casino than this all day, for they offer about the same level of entertainment and cost the same, what with this game's ludicrous amounts of DLC).Most of the game seems to consist of waiting. Wait for your piety and prestige stats, both of which are doing some very subtle things you probably won't realise at first due to the tutorial mode failing to teach you much of anything. You can speed things up, but then I suppose it's just a case of waiting for the things you want to happen but faster. Apparently there's strategy involved, but if you can make sense of it you're doing better than I did. Infantry units get combat bonuses when standing on certain terrain for example, but good luck telling what sort of terrain you're on as it's pretty damned hidden away - I only figured out how to tell about twenty-five hours in. If you do realise what's going on, good luck telling if that bonus is ACTUALLY having an effect and isn't bugged, like a lot of things in Crusader Kings 2 seemingly are.Then there's the fact you have no actual goal to achieve presented to you. Some people love that, apparently, take Minecraft's success for example (though even Mojang decided to add an 'end boss' to their game). I personally just sit there and wonder ""why did I pay for something that's telling me to make my own fun?"". If you have any hobbies, I'd go do those instead. You could say that you should aspire to take over the world - well, okay, but is it actually enjoyable? Only if you're a particular sort of person, it seems, as I'd be bored to death by the time I manage it; most of the game involves nothing but waiting. The game just isn't fun - I tried the multiplayer, and when it wasn't ""desyncing"" (which was a CONSTANT issue, desyncing being tantamount to a crash as you had to exit and restart the game when it happened to someone) for half the game I was tabbed out and talking to people on Skype, as the only convenient way to play multiplayer is on the slowest setting - after all, having people pause when they need to is impractical - and thus the only 'gameplay' I was experiencing was, yet again, waiting for stuff to happen.I'd like to try and deconstruct the individual mechanics of the game from my limited understanding of them, but really, there's no point. If you're not already playing Paradox's ""grand strategy"" (a genre I'm pretty certain they alone make games for) games, chances are you won't enjoy this. I'll end this on something objectively bad about the game - its DLCs, or more aptly put its micro-transactions. Multiple, tiny and worthless 'infantry packs' for soldier units you barely pay attention to and multiple 'portrait packs' for the already rather poorly rendered ruler images. Then there's the DLCs that actually add gameplay content - supposedly, they come with free patches that add content even without you purchasing the DLC when they're released. That sounds great and all, but then you hear that those patches have a tendency to come with a host of game breaking bugs and it apparently takes Paradox forever to fix anything. Great. Though I haven't actually purchased any of the DLCs, I have experienced them via my multiplayer escapades, and they seem extremely limited - essentially, think if you modded Super Mario Bros, for example, so that you're running around as Peach instead of Mario. That to me is what the DLCs appear to amount to, what with them consisting of apparently exciting new features like ""new start dates"" and new rulers to play as, or then you have the Way of Life DLC, where you pay for about five-hundred words or so packaged into event pop-ups that are just more of the same RNG nonsense as before. I suppose that's all great if you already enjoy the concept, but where the game's appeal originates from I cannot even fathom. I never felt like I was applying much strategy (though I suppose you do with extreme patience), I was never having much fun, and I think my friends enjoy the game more than they would otherwise because of their apparent interest in history (which this game pretends to have a lot of, that being historically accurate gameplay, which is also a complete lie as you'll never truly play the lives of infamous rulers, the game simply isn't even nearly sophisticated enough to achieve such an experience). If you want to learn history, great - but read a book, don't play this game.			"

												TL;DR: Time-intesive game+ Fragile save files = Recipe for disaster.Very frustrating.The game is fun enough, but runs on the concept that you invest a lot of time into one particular playthrough.Thats fine, especially if you like the sense of achievement it brings when you do finally rule the world starting from a humble tribal lord in the middle of nowhere. It gets annoying however when those save files become very easily corruptible, and you lose all your progress, or cannot earn steam achievements because it didnt load all the expensive dlc you forked over hard earned cash for...I have lost all my progress on a couple of occasions. Im always careful, but the games inherent structure is shaky: the save files are super fragile (sometimes loading a game before its finished doing its calculations is enough to corrupt a save file), and these are by their very nature save files you need to use often and for long periods of time.Its a recipe for disaster and I regret having spent my money on it, which I say about very few games if any (honestly, check if I have any other negative reviews for any games).

												Crusader Kings II is a vast pretty map with an enormous database of historical figures and all their relations, titles and whatnot, that plays out as a giant real time spreadsheet. I've enjoyed many abstract games with minimal graphics (Dominions, Conquest of Elysium, Tales of Maj'eyal etc), each with large inventories of foes, items, locations and so on. But I cannot say that I even began to enjoy Crusader Kings II.The learning curve is vertical, with tiny icons studding nearly every window. While there are tool tips to go with each view, because of the number of little buttons and icons, I had a difficult time figuring what each section of the tutorial window went with what controls. Even when I did digest what a tool tip might mean, I still had little idea what the described control did in the larger game.About six minutes in, I was asked by the tutorial to pick an ambition for my King. Since he was single and there was already an alert about only having my brother (who doesn't like me one bit) as my sole heir, taking care of that seemed like the natural first order of business.Forty-five minutes later I'd clicked on everything that I could find that had anything to do with anyone in the game getting married. Not only could I not marry my ruler to anyone, I had absolutely no idea WHY! While I noticed some contextual tooltips that listed out qualifiations required for a particular action, most of which were dense and had obtuse names, I couldn't find a anything that would tell me why my young King could marry no one.The kicker for me was the tutorial telling me that my choice of getting my King married was a wise and sensible first ambition. There even came a tutorial window directing me back to the marriage window that I'd already discovered on my own and could (as near as I could tell) in no way afffect.I could have perused the manual or searched for guides online, but spending nearly an hour on one step of a tutorial and getting nowhere made me feel decidedly unwelcome.I'm sure there is a deep, rich game under all the very specific terminology, the family trees, under the byzantine UI screens and between the insane number of tiny buttons and icons, just waiting for someone wonky enough to sort it out. Normally, I feel like I'm that wonky person; not so with Crusader Kings II.I found the game entirely unapproachable, so I've given it the thumbs down. I have no doubt that there are the patient few who have cracked the UI and are conversant in all the very specific terms for medieval succession and the associated ranks and whatnot. But if you're not willing to learn a whole set of antique jargon and navigate screens studded with damnable tiny buttons, and abstracted into meaninglessness icons, you're like me and this game isn't for you.

												Great game, even though a bit clunky and outdated, but the recent changes in Paradox developement policy make me strongly question whether any potential buyer should actually support this.Crusader Kings II is a highly-complex (to the degree where it easily becomes overwhelming to new players and can, literally cause a game over in less then one minute of play time) Grande Strategy, in which you take control of a dynasty of medieval rulers, trying to lead your family to power and glory.You can expand via forging claims or creating new titles, followed by your armies marching across the land. Or wed your sons and daughters to create alliance that may or may not last decades, or may even have your grandson on the neighbouring kingdoms throne, in time. Or you skip that 'in time' part and just go and murder everyone else who might lay claim to the throne to put said grandson there. Or, just murder that one too and inherit the throne yourself.Jep, this sounds a bit brutish, but that's the way Feudalism works. And after all it's not a onesided story... watch for ambitious sons, or you might find that your wine tastes a bit funny.In the end, CKII is an oustanding game for anyone interested in a mix of medieval dynastys, light RPG and deep Strategy. But be warned that the game is hard, unfair, sometimes utterly random and difficult to get into.As well, be advised that the Multiplayer mode is painfully unstable. With a lot of patience (and reloads) it's possible, but usually a better choice to play Singleplayer.However, this actually great game is sadly overshadowed by the publisher behind it.Paradox started out as a niche game producer with a lot of effort and heart. But across the years they have more and more developed into a mainstream game industrialist and more and more often it feels like they prefer to storm their supporter's wallets instead of hearts.Low-quality, bugged, patches are common among multiple games (most mentionable CKII and EUIV), the dev's behavior in the forum is... erratic and unprofessional at times and on top of that Paradox has started to build a history of dropping the support for games even whilst promised pre-purchase packet content wasn't ever delivered (namely, War of the Vikings).Result: 7.5/10 A bit clunky and without reasonable Multiplayer, but still a solid game.But still, avoid  purchasing this or any other Paradox title. Vote with your purses and hope they redeem their ways.			"

												If you've ever played Civilization and thought it would be great if the whole game were the middle ages and I actually got to oppress the peasants, then you will enjoy this game. Similarly, if your family reunions make you wish you could speed up time and exert exacting control over who everyone in your family marries, this game will really blow your hair back. And finally, if you like playing The Sims but wish you could invade your neighbor and burn their ugly house down, well, I count myself fortunate to not be your vassal.The gameplay really nails a humorous historical blend of strategy, simulation and role playing. The user interface is packed with information that can draw you in for hours, once you master the very steep learning cliff. The graphics are fairly minimal, but honestly just right for the game.Unfortunately, so many of the extras that you wish you had control over are fairly pricey DLC, for what they get you. Want to tell your uppity heir to shave his stupid moustache? $4.99. Tired of everyone looking the same, wearing the same 5 outfits or having historically inaccurate ethnicities? $1.99, $0.99 and more for each part of the globe.They have expanded the game several times, and the features continue to be added even if you don't by the expansion. From this standpoint, you can get many hours of new gaming experience out of it.However this makes for an unpredictable experience. I bought the game to enjoy multiplayer with my wife. While the added features are great, the stability of the game has its ups and downs. Recently, the Mac version of the game has been very difficult to enjoy. Crashes to desktop and out-of-sync errors become more and more common as our conquests abound and demense expands. Any more, we can't reliably go for more than hour without one of us suffering a setback and having to fully reload the game.Another common problem is that the game will protest that we have different versions when setting up the multiplayer server. This requires us to fully reload the game again.I love the game and wish I could play it more. I'm not opposed to paid or free expansions and feature additions, but given the choice between a rock solid, unchanging game and a buggy, evolving game, I'll choose the former every time.			"

												I've never posted a review of a game before, but after realizing I had well over 1000 hours of play time on Crusader Kings 2, I felt like I owed it to the game to review it. CK2 may possibly be the best RPG I've ever played. The sheer amount of diverse outcomes in any game puts the replayability through the roof with every monumental achievement and rage quit defeat motivating you to come back for more. On top of that, you can't help but actually learn about the medieval timeline and feudal government structure by playing. If you enjoy history and always wanted to be a part of it, CK2 was created with you in mind. An absolutely stellar game all-around in my opinion.			"

												I picked this game up on free weekend ""Can't be that hard,"" I said, ""Being king is easy!"" I said. I loaded up the tutorial, and all was going well. I had fought back agaisnt a rebellious vassel, had a proper heir and everything. That's when it all started. My own brother had asked the pope to declare me a demon or whatnot, something like that. Anyway, I had begun an assassination plot agaisnt him, and I tried to convince my nephew, his own son to join me in his assassination. He refused and went crying to his father, ""UNCLE LOOFA IS TRYING TO KILL YOU, PAPA!"" I soon declared war on the poor guys, before my vassel had rebelled agaisnt me because it turns out his daughter was married to my brother. He was soon publically executed, until all the kingdoms due south of mine were apparently all besties with my vassel, and oh dear, turns out they murdered my heir before the ragequit.Deus vult.Edit:While king of Leon, the black death swept over europe. Now, I, the king, didn't think I'd have to worry. I had to worry. First, my wife was infected. Then my children. Then me. What did I do? I offered to some muslim emirates down south to have my youngest son. Of course they'd accept, they'd want a hostage to keep control over me.Oh, how they were wrong.While they where considering the offer, I myself contracted the plague. That was fine, though. Even in death, my plans would work. As Pedro was shipped away to the south, a jihad was declared. Soldiers poured into Leon, but then Pedro arrived.Soldiers were taking and razing the land as they moved towards the capital, but in a coughing, painful fit of laughter, king Alfonso died in his throne, knowing that in the big picture, he had won.Pedro, you served Leon well. Thank you.			"

												Crusader Kings II doesn't have any plot or main story to go trough. Instead you have only one objective. Make sure your family never falls and try to make your dynasty as prosperous as possible.This might sound boring at first but in reality it´s extremely addictive. There are many ways to try and climb the ladder. While sometimes brute force is enough, often you need to be way more devious. While marrying your son to someones daughter might seem harmless at first, it gets way more profitable once her brothers have mysteriously fallen. Having good relations is always important unless you want to be cornered against multiple armies or just find your main charracter being stabbed to death leaving your young child on the throne unable to deal with the matters at hand. As changes can happen very quickly, Crusader Kings II makes you put in your A game or otherwise you will be swept back into nothing or to total extinction. While the suprises can be depressing at times, coping with these problesm is what makes the game so addictive. Prosperous moves aren't always the wise ones. Marry your daugher to the neighboring kingdom to fight your enemies and yes you won. Too bad they decided to invade you during the next generation as they had a rightfull claim to your throne. Expand carefully and make sure you will win both now and in the future.			"

												Crusader Kings II (2) Where do I even start with? A game where you play in Medival Europe, the Middle East, or Northern Africa. With this game you play as any family (dynasty) and expand your countries borders across the map. In this game you command armies, do intrigue, and almost just about anything you want. The Pros I would say is they are still working on the game, has history (as in Dynasties and borders), and basically says do want what ever you want in the game. The downside to this game which is a major problem with most games now days is DLC. Which this game is very heavy in it. However, each DLC adds something new to the game and of course are optional you don't have to buy them to play the game. Thank God for that.So there are pros and cons of the game. I would say this is my one of my top ten favorite Strategy games. I would give this game a solid 8/10. If you want to get the ""full game"" I would wait until the dlc pack goes on sale to save more money.			"

You can start a family, create a new kingdom, watch as your character passes away and his son, your son, takes the throne! The choice is yours!Only if you buy the game...BUY IT NOW!!!			"

												A game with an endless source of fun, though takes abit of practice.  Forge a scorched path through feudal Europe, screaming ""Deus Vult"" and carving out yourr very own empire.A game where sleeping with cousins, eugenics, misogyny and the slaughter of innocents are encouraged.Looking for a time sink; a unique strategy game where your morals and ethics aren't in question.9.5/10 Lover of strategy and bloodshed  its a must buy.(Don't forget to buy couple of the DLCs, 20 would do nicely)			"

												Fairly steep learning curve. Once you get into it and get the hang of it, the possibilities, and fun, are endless. I highly, highly recommend this game to fans of grand-strategy games. The lack of depth when it comes to combat may turn some off, as this game isn't similar to the Total War series in the slightest. Overall, I'd rate it a 9/10. There are still some minor things that could be fixed, some things fleshed out more, but overall the game is amazing and I'd recommend it to anyone who has the attention span to play it.			"

												Takes a really good game to make me play for 16 hours almost non-stop on my first session.Crusader Kings 2 is an RTS like many of Paradox's previous titles; highly complex (where your typical RTS is concerned) and providing a highly realistic simulation of empire-expansion. Every facet, save tactical involvement in battles, is explored with detail, and with much at the player's control.One of the key features in CK2 is it's dynastic political system. Not only must you secure your line of succession through heirs to continue in your quest for glory, but there are no formal alliances. Everyone you can count on is either directly in your sphere of influence and thus obligated to serve, or aligned through familial ties.Even though I bought it during the sale, as previously I was unsure, now that I've played Crusader Kings 2, I can definitely say I'd not have issue with paying full price for it. This is even one of the few games I wouldn't be opposed to paying full price for DLC.5/5			"

												This is the ultimate medieval dynasty simulator. You rule over realms in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and India and have many different cultures and all christian faiths at your disposal and yes, you can change both during the game.You play one character at a time, a person with skills, virtues and flaws which has inherited titles, prestige, money and also claims on titles from his parents. You can wage war, but only when you have a proper (medieval) reason to do so.Holy War, assassination plots, cheating on your spouse and inheritance of land just through succession will be part of your daily routine if you play this game. You can work your way up from a low Count title to becoming an Emperor, become a heretic, annihilate cultures and religions and make your dynasty the most powerful one in the world of CKII, dominating the world from Portugal to India and from Norway to Ethiopia for centuries.The expansions allow you to try different religions (Norse Pagans, Muslims, Buddhists, Jews...), different governmental systems (Eastern Rome, Trade Republics...) or expand the gameplay in other directions (deeper focus on roleplaying or certain religions, earlier start dates etc).Buy this game. But be warned, it's about characters, not about optimizing economy or developing technology. Another warning: It will eat up your time...			"

												Review: Crusader Kings 2 Pc gameCKII is my favourite stategy game and i play it a lot.Most of Paradox's games ar realy complex and hard to get into but CKII is actually relatively easy to pick up. But if you're willing to bust your butt a little in the beginning to pick it up, it will reward you with a very enjoyable game experience in the end.PresentationWhile the game can overwhelm you at first, Paradox gives you very easy and manageble menu's and the interface is overall very well done.SoundCrusader Kings II doesn't feature much in the way of sound effects or voice acting, but it does feature a lot of very high-quality soundtrack which is relevant to the game.GameplayThe gameplay is the best part of the game with all the features like religion, war and diplomacy. Part of what makes it so interesting is that you control not a country or an empire, but a family dynasty that transcends national boundaries.With all this in mind I give this game a 9 out of 10.

The most important is that, it's mostly fun. Every time you get a new event or you can destroy civilizations. But the worst thing on this game are DLCs, there are TONS of DLCs, so, if you want to play as a Sultan BOOM you have to buy a DLC, want to be a pagan chiefant BOOM DLC, Raja of India? BOOM DLC!But, as I said it's fun, thank you for reading this review and cya.			"

												The most accessible of Paradox's flagship 'Grand Strategy Titles' may as well be it's best. Crusader Kings 2 is a Dynastic simulator set in a turbulent medieval Europe. The player takes control of a character and is tasked with creating a dynasty that will endure the test of time, political intrigue and backstabbing family members. Not unlike other Paradox GS games, the systems are quiet hard to grasp but in due course, one begins to appreciate the complexities and the possibilities they entail. My personal GOTY for the year 2012 and favorite medieval mass murder simulator. Play it!Latest Update 2016:Game's changed so much since launch. Still spectacular though.			"

												This game is for everybody who thinks Civilization and Medieval Total War are casual games. You can micromanage everything in here. It just feels so rewarding when after 10h of planning you finally succeed with your plot to inherit a kingdom. Now excuse me while I have to backstab my wife in order to get the Kingdom of England!

												I have spent so much time playing this game! Infinitely replayable, every game is different. I don't know many games that give you the option of playing a Byzantine King as well as a Viking Jarl. In a lot of these types of grand strategy games, you make your own fun. This game just has so much going for it, that with a little imagination you can sink 100s of hours into it like I did. Scheme, poison, or just plain overpower, there are many ways to the top. Once you get there, rest assured everyone below you is trying to take your land. Paradox is great about adding new content too. The Old Gods was my favorite, making an earlier starting date and bringing Vikings into the mix. Do yourself a favor and give CK2 a try.10/10			"

												I juist finished my first game. It only took me 14 months. About 651 hours. I really recommend the game. I've just bought the 3 expansions that came out while I was playing.If you, as I, enjoy watching a map for hundreds of hours, thinking up one master plan to conquer the world after another, this is your game.Also, you can (and should) kill your wife because she's to old to produce an heir and doesn't have nice big stats like that new courtier, although you could also just ask the pope for a divorce, you'd probalably have to bribe him, unless he is your vassal of course... Anyway. You can also see Poland get ruled by a midget; have delusions that you are a werewolf and accidently kill your perfect trophy wife; ransom your prisoners; recreate the roman empire; focus on debouchery; accidently leave your heir in a city with typhoid fever; not so accidently have your sick heir lead a very small army in a very hostile place; and have 3 concubines if you're the right culture.With the last expansions you now have a council that makes ruling your realm an absolute nightmare, you can also get way more diseases, torture peope in detail, and join a cult of devil worshippers if you should so fancy. And when the Caliphate is proclaiming it's 8th jihad for Jerusalem and my council disagrees on absolutely everything I want to do, I do. I do fancy some devil worshipping and torture in the morning.			"

												I'm unsure why I'm doing this, seeing as there are no words fitting for the amazing powers of this game.As someone fond of strategy games myself, who has never played a Grand Strategy game, as CKII is known as, I found myself deep within the midieval politics, heading downriver to a waterfall of certain death, and I had no paddle. It took several plunges over the side before I actually figured out how to avert this crisis. That's just the nature of the game; hard to learn, a learning cliff, and great fun awaiting you once you  know what you're doing. Go! Change history! Watch Norway conquer England instead of William the Conquerer, see the Crusaders actually succeed in something (Most likely not gonna happen), dismantle the Byzantine Empire or the Holy Roman Empire, or just sit back on your throne in your unified Ireland, laughing as Europe stuggles against the Mongol Horde...But remember this: ""Losing is Fun!""

												Best kind of surprise package by Paradox Development Studio. A game which gives you the challenge of trying to keep your dynasty alive and in power whilst also tempting you with expansion and wealth. Take part in holy crusades to re-take holy catholic lands and earn prestige through wars. If war's not your game, use cunning and intrigue with strategic marriages and spies to help fabricate claims on land, call in allies and take the land without lifing a finger.If you get the DLC's you can play as the muslims in the east, become a caliphate and declare jihads and watch as your fellow believers sweep accross Europe in the name of Allah. Bring the Byzantine Empire their previous glory and reform the Roman Empire, gaining justifications on all her previous holdings.Watch in a twist of history as the Aztecs land on European shores bringing with them new and strange diseases. Watch as they cut down kingdoms and forge their own empire.Play as a Republic, forgeing a dynasty of wealth and power through trade, then use this new wealth and power to cut out your own empire. (Like the Romans did!)And soon you will be allowed to play as Pagans, like the vikings and plunder gold and wreak havoc in the name of Odin. Each Pagan will have its own unique taste.You can even create your own Dynasty and play as yourself and your family.I've got to say, the care they put into this game makes it 100% worth every (now extinct Canadian)penny I paid. Not to mention how open the game is to modding. There are mods that completely change the game. Play the Game of Thrones or Elder Scrolls! There are actually mods that allow it! Not to mention all the other mods out there, it's great.It's a must buy even if you don't like games like this, it might change your mind.			"

												Highly recommended game for anyone with even a passing interest in grand strategy games, particularly in an historical setting. Love the gameplay, even if the learning curve is a bit steep. It really feels great when you start to know your way around, it feels extremely rewarding.The game itself is a different twist on this genre, even having some RPG aspects in it. It depicts really well the struggles of maintaining a dynasty over generations, the court intrigue, the various (often conflicting) interests of the hundreds of relevant characters you'll come across during any given playthrough.I've already clocked in more than 200 hours of play (EDIT: now more than 500) and I can honestly say I'm not planning on stopping anytime soon. There's just too much to do, too much to try and accomplish. It is amazing being on the verge of conquering half the known world... and having it all come crashing down because of some idiotic family feud, or other circumstances.All in all, I'll be happy to play this game for a long time, as well as EU4, which everyone should also check out! Make sure you grab the main expansions for the game, they are a must-have.UPDATE: Still playing it! The latest DLC adds an extreme amount of content, variety.			"

												Crusader Kings 2, or CK2 for short, the game that introduced me to grand strategy games as a genre and Paradox games in general. For me the best feature of the game (this might be seen as a combination of different features of the game) is that it focuses on characters. By this I mean that I take the role of a character and my decisions influence me and others around me. The game plays a lot like a more traditional RPG (BioWare games comes to mind). While spending to much time deciding who I should marry, or if I should go hunting or just attempt to seduce my lieges wife you come to realize that this game also has some very interesting strategy elements to it. Managing your levies and planning the expantion of your realm is something that you can spend a lot of time on. The best part is that you don't really have to do anything unless you want to. If I don't want to go to war over a neighboring county I don't have to! The game can be played the way you want. I can go on and on about all the things you can do in CK2 but I will close this review by saying that CK2 is a wodnerfull game. The RPG elements is what makes me coming back time and time again. Some ending remakrs:- The game can be very overwelming in the begining. I still don't grasp all the systems in this game and the best thing is that I don't really have to. Take your time, watch some tutorials or use the in game scenarios to slowly learn the game, it is worth it.- Hover over most things to get more information, just something that might help early on and can help you learn the game a bit faster.- Have fun! Play the way you want to play. Don't be afraid of testing things out, you can always load the game if you want to or live with the qonsequneses.Hope you enjoy!			"

												I've played this for hundreds of hours (hard to believe, actually) and nearly all that has been spent in the Game of Thrones mod. I don't have huge interest in the period and have little knowledge of the various houses and dynasties. And, in CK2, that's where the interest is. You're not taking England, France, Spain, etc, somewhere by the end of the game, you're taking a dynasty. And that might not be very far. You might get imprisoned and die in jail, then must carry on as your infant son, who dies before reaching adulthood - game over (actually happened to me). Or you might reach the end of the game, having ups and downs, and only have 1-2 provinces more than you started with. The game is focused on characters and their relationships and all your greatest plans can come to nothing because an important person dies. And often people will die, or lose traits/abilities, randomly. You could die naturally in your 40's. Die of depression. Lead your armies in every battle and lose the 'brave' trait. Be a superior fighter and lose a duel to someone who can't fight (AGOT mod). And all seemingly, based on invisible random dice rolls. This can be incredibly frustrating, given how important characters are. It's something, if you're invested enough, you can fix with console commands and save edits. Or you can just grit and bear it. For me, I wasn't invested enough in medieval Europe to do so but I am in Westeros. But it's frustrating work that shouldn't be necessary.If you like the setting, or a setting provided by a mod, enough to live through the games frustrating randomness, there is great enjoyment in trying to build your dyntasty and watch the lives of your kin, your friends and your enemies, playout. If only Paradox could come up with a way (maybe in CK3) to tie your fate less to chance and more to your actions and those of the AI.			"

This is simultaneously one of the most addicting grand strategies and the funniest.

												An incredibly steep learning curve but once you understand how things work it becomes fairly easy. Pick a country/empire/duchy and see how far you can lead your dynasty. Instead of playing as a country you play as a dynasty. You are represented by 1 member at a time. When that member dies you take over their heir. Through diplomacy, bribery, arranged marriages and assassinations you gain position in the world. Position yourself to inherit entire kingdoms.There is no goals except the ones you make yourself. There are some goals laid out in the game but you don't have to follow them at all. If you want to take over Europe as the Byzantine Empire then go right ahead. My last playthrough as the Byzantine Empire I conquered Germany and was working on France. I stopped playing that because the expansion ""The Old Gods"" was released and I decided I wanted to see what was different. Overall a very satisfying game that doesn't hold your hand. It gives you this sandbox and says ""Go wild!"". "

												One day I was playing the Extended Timeline mod (great mod by the way) for Europa Universalis IV and I got the hankering to see what all the commotion the CK II peasants have been babbling about for so long was about. Considering most of the money from the DLC's is almost completely necessary (twice as long game lenth, twice as large map size, Muslims playable, Nords playable, Pagans playable, Republics playable, the Pope's hat customizable etc.) a $160 price tag for the collection is more than hefty and I would certainly have not bought nor would have reccomended this game had I not gotten it for just $40. However, this game is incredibly fun - it is about managing your dynasty through nearly 600 years of absolute mayhem, ensuring that out of all your plotting, traitorous subjects not one can murder your children: because you insta-lose if you don't. It's about seeing who gets what title and who gets to manage what provinces or what city, it's about religion, imperialism, feudalism - though far from a cakewalk and with a learning curve even for someone who wasted countless hours of their life playing EU IV, this game is sophisticated yet just simple enough to be remarakably enjoyable.Every type of nation in this game plays uniquely - sit back and do nothing as Irish peasants, viciously and ruthlessly sail around and pillage with an axe in your hand as a screaming Viking lord, attempt to gradually recoverr the innumerable lost territories for Byzantium/Rome, restore unity and stability so that the Islamic Golden Age can continue, or just simply invade all these fools as a crazed Mongol/Magyar/Cuman/Khazar horde. This game is just fun - I can't exactly name what it is, but something about this game is just extraordinary. Maybe it's the exceptional soundtrack...raisin/4 is good game			"

												Such a splendid story generator hasn't been made since King of Dragon Pass, except maybe Dwarf Fortress which this game has plenty in common with too. Mainly the ""Losing is fun"" attitude. The game is an endless cavalcade of royal families backstabbing and incest and plotting in courts, but there's no game over as long as you have still some heirs with which to continue the saga. Very much like Game of Thrones. Highly highly recommended.			"

												I bought this game and then for the next week barely managed to keep eating and sleeping. I was wary because Paradox's last title, while historically brilliant, had a bit too high a ratio of menus and info to meaningful decisions. This game on the other hand is not only a fantastic representation of the period but also perhaps the best alternative history engine ever created. If you like management games with omnipresent failure conditions (Tropico, for example) and you're okay with making up your own goals or playing for the sake of seeing what happens, then you have to get this.

												This game is quite possibly the easiest and most addicting of the Paradox grand strategy titles to get into.Audio - The base audio that comes with this game really captures the mood of the time, with additional themed soundtracks you can purchase for a small sum. Even the effects really add to the game with relevant sounds notifying you of births, tithes collected, war declarations, etc.Environment - You put yourself into the role of a ruler ranging from the 8th - 15th century AD with a map ranging from the Indian subcontinent to Iceland, Ghana to the Steppes of Asia. Though this range is smaller than with other Paradox titles, with unique mechanics like the tribal system, the Indian caste system, and such there is a great feeling of variation depending on where you start in the map.Replay Value - With thousands of characters to choose from (or you can choose to make your own), tens of religions, cultures, and various ruling styles the replayability in this game is endless.Shill factor - The list of DLC that comes with this game is daunting, however most of it is cosmetic. The refreshing thing with Crusader Kings 2 is that with each large patch (such as the one which introduced India) all players will benefit from free content regardless of whether they want to dole out more dosh for DLC.It's a fun game, especially if you enjoy a bit of roleplay. Go buy it and ♥♥♥♥ around as a duke, well worth the cost.			"

Don't mistake this for a replacement experience for a game like Europa Universalis or Total War, because while you certainly have the ability to run and expand your own country, this game is more about dealing with individual people and climbing your way up to a place of power (and then staying there!).

If you can manage to get past its substantial learning curve, you will find yourself deeply engrossed and always coming back for more.Frequent updates and an exceptional modding api give this game almost endless replayability. Whether you want to smooth out the rough edges and add some flavour (VIET) or create a twisted alternate reality of your favorite fantasy universe (A Game of Thrones and The Elder Kings), there is definitely a mod for you.

												This the my absolute favorite and easily most played game. I love the depth and the detail of making sure that my dynasty rises through the ranks from Count to Emperor over the course of many hundreds of years. I would also like to say that while this game's main disadvantages are limited they are present. Mainly the way war is run, it is accurate for the era which is cool however it does make it quite difficult. I also didn't like how slow many of the other nations were in becoming powerful and warmongering, as well as how stable many of them turned out to be. The MODS for this game, namely Game of Thrones and Elder Kings breathed hundreds of hours of life into this game for me each offering my dreams of being the occupant of the Iron Throne or the High King of Skyrim. My accolades for this game could go on and on, but hey just look at how many hours I have played... that says how wonderful this game truely can be!			"

												One of the best games I have played in years, CK2 is also, in a genre notorious for hard to learn games with absurd complexity, not quite as hard to learn as other grand strategy games. You play as a Lord/Lady in a medieval world and seek to... do whatever you please, really. More often than not, that means getting and maintaining power, by any means neccesary. Diplomacy, War, Intrigue, Assassination, and much more is available for you to make your heart's desire come true. In other words, this is the Game of Thrones: You win or you die. Speaking of which, there is a Game of Thrones mod for this game... and it is awesome. :D			"

												A brilliant game, which models accurately and immersively all of the political intrigues and dynamics of the era. The game, however, is rather lackluster if played completely bare of mods- it requires several of the main expansions to really become one of the best. Part of this is the fact that certain gameplay styles and religions are locked from being playable until you purchase DLC which can cost upwards of ten dollars.The game, beyond it's diplomatic and intrigue features, is actually rather bare. Combat is incredibly simplistic, and often numbers will win a battle regardless of the skill or quality of the opposition's troops. The economy must be taken at face value- the different types of settlements provide nothing but a choice between high tax and low levies or vice versa. Churches are something you will probably never build outside of roleplay, as your player character cannot use them (theocracies are locked from being playable) and they provide both medocre taxes and levies.Some mechanics still need tweaking, often successions between dynasties and rapid succession between characters is a little too seamless, as the strength of one's claim after a title has been usurped is irrelevant, as is the legitimacy of one's dynasty- if there is no eligible heir within the dynasty, the title will succeed to the character with the strongest claim in the game, and if that is not an option, it goes to the most powerful vassal in the realm. Often this will happen with little disruption to the operation of the realm, even whilst wars are being waged. History demonstrates that there would be significant upheaval if 5 kings succeeded to the throne within the space of a month. In the game, however, this is not the case.All in all, however, these things can be overlooked, in favour of acknowledging the massive amount of effort that has been put into the game to make it immersive, easy to learn and fun to play. It is quite accessible, however there is still much to learn if you wish to master the game of thrones.			"

												Put it this way, I've played plenty of games where you can beat your enemies into submission, but never one where you can shag their sisters afterwards. Politics, Intrigue, War, Diplomacy, everything. This game has it all. No tactics to speak of but that only adds to the depth in its own way. On a different game you might say, ""hmm, his army is twice the size of mine, but hey, I can probably beat him, I'm a good general'. On this game, you are more likely to think, 'If I go up against him I'm going to get my♥♥♥♥♥♥handed to me on a plate. I'd better stay on his good side until I'm strong enough.' This is a great strength of the game, and you have to set long term aims and goals if you want to win. For example, at the start of my most successful game, which was as Duke Ethelred of Wessex on the Old Gods campaign, I ruled a small Duchy in the South of England, with a massive Norse army making its way south to burn and kill everything. Through a hefty bit of luck involving several strategic alliances, I was able to secure control of England. By putting a woman on the throne of West Francia, who my heir then married, I was able to begin a process of conquering all of France. When the crusading era arrived, holy wars brought me muslim spain and the Holy Land. In 1140, The House of Wessex now rules as Emperors of Britannia, the masters of Western Europe and the Levant. It won't be enormous military might alone that brings you success, you need to utilise every ounce of political acumen you posses, taking advantage of every opportunity that comes your way, praying that you don't make the wrong choice. ""My Lord, the Duke of so-and-so is rallying your vassals against you"". ""Oh I'll be fine, I've never been more popular."" Next thing you know, ten thousand men are kicking down your door. In my view, the perfect strategy game.11/10			"

												Played as a Germanic Frisia and raided the shorelines of England. After the king the great died and left the kingdom to his 14 year old son I decided to take the seduction focus and I made the Christian mother to the king a lover. I then decided to burn England again, sacrifice the mother to the Allfather and leave the kingdom filled with B A S T A R D S, my B A S T A R D S.Crusader Kings 2 is by my opinion the best game from Paradox. If you really love to play games that makes you think or you love conquering land then there is no better choice than this.What makes this game so good?: The fact that you take your own choices that will effect the future so much. You can start as the Holy Romans and form Prussia, or you can lose all and have to play as a small kingdom far east. The basic game is simulated to act the historical events, but you can change them and make your own history.This strategic simulator will conquer more of your time than it will of Europe.There are problems of course, handling your vassals, defending your kingdom and keeping your dynasty alive. But the worst thing is that you have to buy expansion moduels to play as other charakters or different religions. So buy the expansions, but only when it is sale on them.If you are still holding back from buying it, then ask yourself. Do I love independence, difficulties and history?			"

												Crusader Kings in an incredibly indepth sandbox medieval grand strategy game. Simply put you are given a map and a dynasty and your task is to do what ever you want with them! Take a lowly Count and raise him (or his heirs) to Emperor. Eliminate your rivals at court through intrigue. Conquer Europe and Asia in the name of a restored Empire! You choose an objective to achieve and use the games carefully designed features to achieve it.Things to note: There is no real time battles; numbers, terrain and generals dictate win/losses.It's not a graphically interesting game; don't expect the spectacle of the Total War series here.It can be tough to get into; initially the game can be overwhelming but if you stick with it you won't be disappointed.In my opinion this game is a must have for any strategy fan; push through the learning phases and you will loose hundreds of hours to this game.More info in the video bellow for those interested.[url=https://youtu.be/QHbOkqzLrCc/url} "

												This is a pretty nice game to be honest, although, really, I enjoy it a lot more since I got a fair amount of the DLC.Been on and off this for some time, but the more I play it, the more I love it. It's not like the Total War series (which I originally thought it would be like) at all, it's so much more gritty and, in some ways, devilish. It gets to the point where you manage to get past the learning curve which, thankfully, isn't too steep, and you're able to build a nice kingdom that has secure borders and is the ire of many. Pretty soon you'll have people bowing to you and wishing your might didn't come crashing down on you!The intrigue system is, for all intents and purposes, your home at some point or another. You'll be using this to stage either Grand Feasts or Mass Conversion to a religion or culture, but it's more fun after a point to be the WRONG religion in relation to your neighbours. Makes things  very  interesting. There is a little bit of micro-managing, especially when it comes to trying to get claims and manipulating other powers, but once you get this down, you'll be living in a spinster's paradise.			"

												Hours played is conservative because I generally play offline. I like to try out a lot of different games and genres, but I always come back to CK2 (and I lose entire weekends to it when I'm supposed to be working). My favourite strategy game by far.It wasn't easy for me to learn (to be honest, I'm still absolutely terrible at it) - I had to look up things online frequently at the beginning - but even screwing everything up can be fun. I love the dynastic aspect of it (think Rome TW's dynasties but better). I get a kick out of marrying people off and stealing heirs. I don't often play an aggressive game - you can war and pillage if you feel like it, but you don't have to, which makes the game ridiculously replayable for me because eventually I get bored of raising armies and chasing idiots across the sea.My favourite part is earning kingdoms through a couple of generations of sneaky, well-placed betrothals. Which always inevitably backfires. You start doting on your little bloodline, get cocky because the wives start popping out geniuses all day erry day, and then bam, your only son gets landed by inheriting some obscure dead relative's puny county, marries an inbred forty year old, and screws up all of the beautiful perfection. I fangirl this game so hard...The game is frequently updated, and for me, stability is rarely an issue. I love the DLCs (yes, even Conclave). I want more events, and traitors, and faces... as I said, fangirl. But I've played this so much, and I still find new stuff in every playthrough. Well worth the steep learning curve.			"

												Went from TotalWar and Creative Assembly to Paradox games and the difference is mind-blowing. Never had this much fun with a strategygame. Really challenging and fun. The depth and complexity with everything from politics and family is so, so far away from totalwars simple game it can't even be compared. I love this game from the bottom of my hearth.			"

												I bought the game 3 days ago and I have 45 hours in it so far.. This game is so addictive. I much prefer this game to similar games such as Europa Universalis IV, especially when you bundle it up with all of the DLC.I can't recommend this game enough, it is so complex and intricate while being exceptionally rewarding. Don't expect a military strategy in the vein of Total War, as Crusader Kings 2 goes beyond the scope of any Total War game. some people may find the combat lacking compared to games like Total War etc. However these are completely different types of games, which some people just don't get. Combat comes down to size of force, composition of units, commander abilities, terrain and other modifiers. You don't get direct control like you would in Total War etc.There are so many different mechanics at play all at once. You have the Feudal system, where you're trying to please your vassals and build relationships with them, while you're trying to protect and enhance your dynasty, all the while stopping plots on you or your family, you're trying build claims on land to justify an invasion and you're setting up an Anti-Pope because the Pope excommunicated your uncle... Seriously when it all comes together it is both mind-boggling and fantastic.If you've always wanted to Marry your mother and imprison your father while waging war on your illegitmate half-brother.. well now you can. And it's brilliant.			"

												I'm unsure why I'm doing this, seeing as there are no words fitting for the amazing powers of this game.As someone fond of strategy games myself, who has never played a Grand Strategy game, as CKII is known as, I found myself deep within the midieval politics, heading downriver to a waterfall of certain death, and I had no paddle. It took several plunges over the side before I actually figured out how to avert this crisis. That's just the nature of the game; hard to learn, a learning cliff, and great fun awaiting you once you  know what you're doing. Go! Change history! Watch Norway conquer England instead of William the Conquerer, see the Crusaders actually succeed in something (Most likely not gonna happen), dismantle the Byzantine Empire or the Holy Roman Empire, or just sit back on your throne in your unified Ireland, laughing as Europe stuggles against the Mongol Horde...But remember this: ""Losing is Fun!""

												This is the ultimate medieval dynasty simulator. You rule over realms in Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and India and have many different cultures and all christian faiths at your disposal and yes, you can change both during the game.You play one character at a time, a person with skills, virtues and flaws which has inherited titles, prestige, money and also claims on titles from his parents. You can wage war, but only when you have a proper (medieval) reason to do so.Holy War, assassination plots, cheating on your spouse and inheritance of land just through succession will be part of your daily routine if you play this game. You can work your way up from a low Count title to becoming an Emperor, become a heretic, annihilate cultures and religions and make your dynasty the most powerful one in the world of CKII, dominating the world from Portugal to India and from Norway to Ethiopia for centuries.The expansions allow you to try different religions (Norse Pagans, Muslims, Buddhists, Jews...), different governmental systems (Eastern Rome, Trade Republics...) or expand the gameplay in other directions (deeper focus on roleplaying or certain religions, earlier start dates etc).Buy this game. But be warned, it's about characters, not about optimizing economy or developing technology. Another warning: It will eat up your time...			"

												Over the years I've logged over 1250 hours in this game. To say that it is one of my favorites would be an obvious given. What i like the most about it is that it focuses on the lives of a dynasty that I can create and develop over the annals of medieval European history. With all of the expansions this can also be extended to the mid east and Indian subcontenant.  The game continues to evolve with each successive addition to add more and more variety between governing types, religions, cultures, and even lifestyles. I would not call it high action, though it has its moments, but a game that can be paced and simply enjoyed in terms of strategy. If you love strategy and the intrigue of dynasty building this game is for you.As a bonus; if you're a fan of game of thrones.. the game of thrones mod is amazing.			"

												Crusader Kings II (2) Where do I even start with? A game where you play in Medival Europe, the Middle East, or Northern Africa. With this game you play as any family (dynasty) and expand your countries borders across the map. In this game you command armies, do intrigue, and almost just about anything you want. The Pros I would say is they are still working on the game, has history (as in Dynasties and borders), and basically says do want what ever you want in the game. The downside to this game which is a major problem with most games now days is DLC. Which this game is very heavy in it. However, each DLC adds something new to the game and of course are optional you don't have to buy them to play the game. Thank God for that.So there are pros and cons of the game. I would say this is my one of my top ten favorite Strategy games. I would give this game a solid 8/10. If you want to get the ""full game"" I would wait until the dlc pack goes on sale to save more money.			"

												Not bad. Not bad at all.When you first start playing, you'll get an ""information overload."" This comes from several factors, mostly being how complex the game is, and how many things are popping up on your screen at once. I strongly suggest playing all the tutorials to try and accomadate yourself to this game as best you can before you start playing seriously.Even after you get used to the game, you will continue to discover new and different things about the game. On top of this, Paradox Interactive is still creating new content. Crusader Kings II is one of the most complex, and intense strategy games I've ever played. It's also the only game that allows me to murder other heirs so that I may take over the kingdom, work my way from Earl to Emperor, declare Crusades on Infidels only so I may gain new land, create a trade Empire across the mediterranean, and much more. All these things make this game one of the most enticing and entertanining games I've ever played.I strongly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys large scale strategy games - especially ones such as Civilization, Total War, and Sins of a Solar Empire.On a side note, there are a few tips for your first times playing:1.) Start as an Count/Earl/Jarl/Sheikh/Equivelant. You will only have to manage one county, as well as only two vassals rather than a whole kingdom. Then work your way up.2.) Play as a Pagan or Muslim, if you have the DLC. Most other religions make it harder to conquer through warfare. However, Pagans use subjugation which allows the conquest of one whole Pagan country, and Muslims may wage war against other Muslims at a cost of piety.3.) De Jure systems are important. They allow you to progress in rank without any else's help. Go to the De Jure view for any type of holding. If you capture all those counties, or have at least 51% of them, you can gain the rank associated with it.			"

												As a fan of the total war and civilization frachises I went into this game with some apprehension, but I can say now that ive gotten past this games completly vertical learing curve that youll never want to go back to a differnt strategy game. The reasons are as follows:1)Most importantly characters and dynasties feel alive to a extent and not lifeless like most other strategy games.2)You cant just sweep the map you actually need a reason to go to war with people instead of OMG he looked at me sideways prepare to die.3)The peace treaties are awsome, they make you go after limited objectives so you need to pick the ones that you want immediatly and prioritize the rest.4)The dynasty and character interactions are top notch. After all who doesnt want to marry there son to the princess of france and then kill off all her brothers so her and by extentsion your grandkid get the throne?All in all a great game that I would recomend to anyone with the capability to think and breath at the same time. If you dont like thinking about what you need to do next, and instead like yelling 420 noscope blaze it every 30 seconds when you play video games this IS NOT THE GAME FOR YOU			"

												Amazing game proving combat was not the only battlefield in feudal Europe, north-Africa and ArabiaYou will be faced with an initial difficulty and complexity but after 15 hours of dedication you will understand the basics and after a 100 hours you will still new learn tricks to use.Good for both roleplaying and gaming the game.The only RPG that doesn't let you move your character and the only strategy game that allows you to kill any annoying vassal or kinsman without losing its difficulty and becoming a god-game.Furthermore Paradox is generous with its DLC giving free updates at every DLC and make the mechanics possible in your non-DLC game such as Republics rising and Pagan raiding. as a bonus if you want to solely play with friends all DLC are taken from the host meaning you can try a DLC out with a friend before deciding to buy it.-Amazing replayabillity-A true world with countless scenarios-A good AI-Vikings!-Mangement both Macro and Micro-Intrigue-Lots of characters to pick from and lots of starting dates.-Allows roleplay and power-gamingIf you decide on buying the game I would like to advise starting in Ireland aka Nooby isle and get familiar with the interface and some mechanics before trying on something bigger.

												CK2 is a grand strategy game which deals in dynasties and people, not nations and governments, and it's all the more addictive as a result. You can play to win- maximise your stats, work the systems and never marry a hunchback. Or you can roleplay it- if your character is a cruel, craven drunkard with a penchant for impaling his enemies, don't shy away from executing your imprisoned brother or murdering the heir of France in a ""tragic hunting accident""! I have got more fun out of this than a dozen other games. I cannot recommend it enough.			"

												Great game. There are so many things you can do that provide hours worth of endless gameplay. It can be a bit troubling and tough to get started once you first start, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty easy. Great for anyone who wants a real medieval experience.			"

												Crusader Kings 2 is a great original grand strategy game incompusing vast amounts of management and entrigue that most players will not be able to wrap their heads around their first attempt or even two playing without the help of a expieranced friend sitting behind them.From top to bottom there are characters in every part of every kingdom and empire no matter how big or how small, how powerful or weak those characters exist and can make huge accomplishments if chance or will provide them with the means. Empire > King(s) > Dukes > Counts > Barons, Mayors, Bishops > Your councilers > a plethera of courtiers > and huge armys, what do you do with this giant mathmatical fractoral? Who knows what you want but each part of the chain has people that want individual things and they will try to guide the system to their will if you don't. ""This is the game of thrones. You either live or you die. There is no middle ground."" AND IT REALLY IS JUST LIKE GAME OF THRONES AND ITS AWESOME!			"

												Over the years I've logged over 1250 hours in this game. To say that it is one of my favorites would be an obvious given. What i like the most about it is that it focuses on the lives of a dynasty that I can create and develop over the annals of medieval European history. With all of the expansions this can also be extended to the mid east and Indian subcontenant.  The game continues to evolve with each successive addition to add more and more variety between governing types, religions, cultures, and even lifestyles. I would not call it high action, though it has its moments, but a game that can be paced and simply enjoyed in terms of strategy. If you love strategy and the intrigue of dynasty building this game is for you.As a bonus; if you're a fan of game of thrones.. the game of thrones mod is amazing.			"

												I picked this game up on free weekend ""Can't be that hard,"" I said, ""Being king is easy!"" I said. I loaded up the tutorial, and all was going well. I had fought back agaisnt a rebellious vassel, had a proper heir and everything. That's when it all started. My own brother had asked the pope to declare me a demon or whatnot, something like that. Anyway, I had begun an assassination plot agaisnt him, and I tried to convince my nephew, his own son to join me in his assassination. He refused and went crying to his father, ""UNCLE LOOFA IS TRYING TO KILL YOU, PAPA!"" I soon declared war on the poor guys, before my vassel had rebelled agaisnt me because it turns out his daughter was married to my brother. He was soon publically executed, until all the kingdoms due south of mine were apparently all besties with my vassel, and oh dear, turns out they murdered my heir before the ragequit.Deus vult.Edit:While king of Leon, the black death swept over europe. Now, I, the king, didn't think I'd have to worry. I had to worry. First, my wife was infected. Then my children. Then me. What did I do? I offered to some muslim emirates down south to have my youngest son. Of course they'd accept, they'd want a hostage to keep control over me.Oh, how they were wrong.While they where considering the offer, I myself contracted the plague. That was fine, though. Even in death, my plans would work. As Pedro was shipped away to the south, a jihad was declared. Soldiers poured into Leon, but then Pedro arrived.Soldiers were taking and razing the land as they moved towards the capital, but in a coughing, painful fit of laughter, king Alfonso died in his throne, knowing that in the big picture, he had won.Pedro, you served Leon well. Thank you.			"

Crusader Kings II takes place between 1066 and 1453, and there are literally hundreds of characters throughout that span that you can play as. Being a king is very different than playing a count, but neither’s journey is less interesting. The stories play out constantly, whether you play a provincial count or a godlike emperor. While your goal is ostensibly to sustain your dynasty as long as possible, Crusader Kings II is more about the journey than the goal. Getting there is more than half the fun.Crusader Kings II is complex, and the tutorials explain perhaps a third of the stuff you’ll really want to know. After a week of play you still have burning questions about major game systems that just aren’t covered in the tooltips or manual. But the potential is totally there, so long as you can stick with it and conquer the sometimes-overwhelming interface. There are little buttons everywhere, and while the interface is pretty useable once you get used to it, it’s never as easy to find specific characters or visualize their relationships as it probably should be. This in particular makes the game feel impenetrable at first.Overall Crusader Kings II can be a heck of a lot of fun. The more you understand, the more fun you have. Once you start getting past the learning curve you’ll find yourself more and more absorbed by all the complex little dramas that swirl around your nobles.THE GOOD- Challenging gameplay- Strategic interpersonal relationships- A complex and deeply rewarding system of diplomacy- Many DLC's for expanded play- Well-designed and easily navigable menusTHE BAD- Steep learning curve- Complex game mechanics- Overwhelming interface- Many DLC's are needed for optimal playDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE "

												Such a splendid story generator hasn't been made since King of Dragon Pass, except maybe Dwarf Fortress which this game has plenty in common with too. Mainly the ""Losing is fun"" attitude. The game is an endless cavalcade of royal families backstabbing and incest and plotting in courts, but there's no game over as long as you have still some heirs with which to continue the saga. Very much like Game of Thrones. Highly highly recommended.			"

												One day I was playing the Extended Timeline mod (great mod by the way) for Europa Universalis IV and I got the hankering to see what all the commotion the CK II peasants have been babbling about for so long was about. Considering most of the money from the DLC's is almost completely necessary (twice as long game lenth, twice as large map size, Muslims playable, Nords playable, Pagans playable, Republics playable, the Pope's hat customizable etc.) a $160 price tag for the collection is more than hefty and I would certainly have not bought nor would have reccomended this game had I not gotten it for just $40. However, this game is incredibly fun - it is about managing your dynasty through nearly 600 years of absolute mayhem, ensuring that out of all your plotting, traitorous subjects not one can murder your children: because you insta-lose if you don't. It's about seeing who gets what title and who gets to manage what provinces or what city, it's about religion, imperialism, feudalism - though far from a cakewalk and with a learning curve even for someone who wasted countless hours of their life playing EU IV, this game is sophisticated yet just simple enough to be remarakably enjoyable.Every type of nation in this game plays uniquely - sit back and do nothing as Irish peasants, viciously and ruthlessly sail around and pillage with an axe in your hand as a screaming Viking lord, attempt to gradually recoverr the innumerable lost territories for Byzantium/Rome, restore unity and stability so that the Islamic Golden Age can continue, or just simply invade all these fools as a crazed Mongol/Magyar/Cuman/Khazar horde. This game is just fun - I can't exactly name what it is, but something about this game is just extraordinary. Maybe it's the exceptional soundtrack...raisin/4 is good game			"

												My first foray into Paradox's ""grand strategy"" titles, this game is unlike any other I've played. It's multi-layered and complex, but the core is you playing as a feudal lord in Medieval Europe beginning in 1066. How you decide to define your goals is entirely up to you, and the interesting elements of the game has more to do with the relationships between your lord, your family, and the competing families, duchies, lords, kings, and emperors that populate the land. This is definitely bound to be a classic.			"

												Crusader Kings in an incredibly indepth sandbox medieval grand strategy game. Simply put you are given a map and a dynasty and your task is to do what ever you want with them! Take a lowly Count and raise him (or his heirs) to Emperor. Eliminate your rivals at court through intrigue. Conquer Europe and Asia in the name of a restored Empire! You choose an objective to achieve and use the games carefully designed features to achieve it.Things to note: There is no real time battles; numbers, terrain and generals dictate win/losses.It's not a graphically interesting game; don't expect the spectacle of the Total War series here.It can be tough to get into; initially the game can be overwhelming but if you stick with it you won't be disappointed.In my opinion this game is a must have for any strategy fan; push through the learning phases and you will loose hundreds of hours to this game.More info in the video bellow for those interested.[url=https://youtu.be/QHbOkqzLrCc/url} "

												This is a pretty nice game to be honest, although, really, I enjoy it a lot more since I got a fair amount of the DLC.Been on and off this for some time, but the more I play it, the more I love it. It's not like the Total War series (which I originally thought it would be like) at all, it's so much more gritty and, in some ways, devilish. It gets to the point where you manage to get past the learning curve which, thankfully, isn't too steep, and you're able to build a nice kingdom that has secure borders and is the ire of many. Pretty soon you'll have people bowing to you and wishing your might didn't come crashing down on you!The intrigue system is, for all intents and purposes, your home at some point or another. You'll be using this to stage either Grand Feasts or Mass Conversion to a religion or culture, but it's more fun after a point to be the WRONG religion in relation to your neighbours. Makes things  very  interesting. There is a little bit of micro-managing, especially when it comes to trying to get claims and manipulating other powers, but once you get this down, you'll be living in a spinster's paradise.			"

												Let me start of by stating that Paradox Studios is by far my favorite company. They make their games mod friendly, they create games with great depth and amazing mechanics that essentially develop into hours and hours spent constantly replaying as different characters in different eras of time. Not only do they release the game with this much customer care, but they also continuously update it and include features without DLC that dramatically improve the game. Crusader Kings II is a ridiculously fun strategy game that you'll be able to spend hours and hours playing, while never boring in the process. It's character development and focus on historical realism makes Crusader Kings II quite possibly the best video game ever made. New comers to strategy will find it really hard to understand the mechanics at play, as it took several people that I know (as well as myself) HOURS of gameplay to finally get a clue as to what we were doing, But, once you understand the game, you begin your reign over the medieval world.

												Hours played is conservative because I generally play offline. I like to try out a lot of different games and genres, but I always come back to CK2 (and I lose entire weekends to it when I'm supposed to be working). My favourite strategy game by far.It wasn't easy for me to learn (to be honest, I'm still absolutely terrible at it) - I had to look up things online frequently at the beginning - but even screwing everything up can be fun. I love the dynastic aspect of it (think Rome TW's dynasties but better). I get a kick out of marrying people off and stealing heirs. I don't often play an aggressive game - you can war and pillage if you feel like it, but you don't have to, which makes the game ridiculously replayable for me because eventually I get bored of raising armies and chasing idiots across the sea.My favourite part is earning kingdoms through a couple of generations of sneaky, well-placed betrothals. Which always inevitably backfires. You start doting on your little bloodline, get cocky because the wives start popping out geniuses all day erry day, and then bam, your only son gets landed by inheriting some obscure dead relative's puny county, marries an inbred forty year old, and screws up all of the beautiful perfection. I fangirl this game so hard...The game is frequently updated, and for me, stability is rarely an issue. I love the DLCs (yes, even Conclave). I want more events, and traitors, and faces... as I said, fangirl. But I've played this so much, and I still find new stuff in every playthrough. Well worth the steep learning curve.			"

The Game of Thrones mod is superb, the platform of CK2 works brilliantly (apart from the soundtrack, which you simply turn off and play the hbo soundtrack instead).

												It's a series of family trees (a familial forest, if you will) with a seemingly random event generator, whilst you essentially play as the godfather of your own pre-industrial mafia state. The game is about managing relations (based around an opinion modifier) with your vassals, personal court, liege lords, alliances and your family in general in order to succeed and thrive in the world. Made all the more complicated by the fact these people aren't always mutually exclusive, and if your younger brother is a powerful duke set to inherit your lands he does become a serious threat to be mitigated by alliances elsewhere formed solely by marriage, which will offer sufficient protection - but may scupper your attempts to breed with that commoner with the genetic Genius and Attractive traits and spawn some sort of Uber-Lord heir.Still: after all this you are part of a noble family spreading across Europe, West and North Africa, the Near East, and now India in the hope of... well, surviving mostly. That is the aim: the game is not about conquering, it's about stability, lasting longer than humanly possible as you serve as multiple patriarchs of your family. Even after the Mongols appear in the East and take half of your territory and annex you the next year: you won't have lost. You may lose your Kingdom to rebellions, your warfare, but as long as you remain in control of at least a County (the second smallest land division of the game) or a merchant House (one of the smallest units but only available in the Republic expansion): you will survive. Warfare is simple in some respects, it's based on territory, the leader, and unit types with a random dice roll. If you have significantly more men, you will win. If not, positioning them at choke points and distraction tactics do work - having an enemy army chase a small mobile stack, whilst your main force seizes their capital is a viable route to take. But, that takes a while, and in less you're defending it will cause your vassals to become and their men to become irritated and want to return home. You call up your vassals to fight for you much like an alliance, and if they don't like you: they simply will not come. Now, you can rely on your own men to some extent (maybe even hire some mercenaries for cash or a Holy Order - if you're fighting infidels) in a small kingdom or independent duchy your personal forces and permanent retinues can provide a decent army. But really, you need them as the core for which your vassals surround, otherwise they're going to be killed and the next rebellion that pops up will leave you defenceless.The base game has you play as a Christian noble (though with some variation as you can be: Catholic, Orthodox, or Miaphysite) though this is what most of the game is still based around there are some fantastic DLCs. The DLC has been as clunky as it has been brilliant however due to implementing non-feudal cultures into game mechanics designed around Christianity and vassalage.  For example, my personal favourite: the Legacy of Rome, is based around unique events for the Byzantine Empire and potentially refounding the Roman Empire. All DLC did however come accompanied with a free patch allowing for the game to update considerably anyway, so the base has long since changed significantly. The DLC allows for you to play a new play style, which frankly you may not enjoy: Rajahs of India is dull for me, however the Legacy of Rome and playing as a Zoroastrian in the Old Gods is fantastic. The only ones I will outright say to buy or avoid are:- Buy: Ruler Designer - you lose access to ironman, but designing your own house and choosing your religion does make being Jewish (Sons of Abraham) or Zoroastrian much simpler.- Avoid: CK2-EU4 Save Converter - ostensibly built to allow you to play your CK2 realm through EU4 but it simply doesn't work, there have been points where it has actually worked, but every update to either game breaks it and by the time it has caught up and been fixed, a new update is being announced.Other than that if you like the sound of a DLC, buy it. If you like Rome? The Legacy is for you. Venetian fan? The Republic. You like ahistorical late game invasions by an angry Aztec horde that you forgot about? The Sunset Invasion. 300 years of extra game play? Oh-ho-ho Charlemagne and the Old Gods.There's other minor cosmetic DLC too (unit sprites, music etc) that are pretty dull, but the majority of the DLC is complicated and really does add a lot to the game. Not just the unique play types I've mentioned, but the random events alone can be worth it. Such as when your child turns out to be the spawn of Satan, summons a cabal of witches, assassinates you, and attempts to conquer the Earth in the name of Evil.On the performance side of things: the Clausewitz engine is funny if you have an unusual monitor set up, though. I primarily use an 1176x664 which it will work on, but leave me unable to push the ""accept"" button, rendering warfare and diplomacy immediately unusable. So, prewarning there. Other than that the game is generally stable, however since the India expansion it does take up a considerable amount of memory to run: it is the most intensive of the Paradox Interactive games.So that's it, that's the review. If you kind of like history (but you're not going to be a pedant about getting things slightly off for the sake of playability), maps, managing relationships, and betrayal: this is the game for you. In essence, if you look at the Mafia and think ""yes, that is something I could get involved with"" then you'll lose just as much as your life as I have in a downards spiral whilst you tell yourself ""just 5 more minutes.""

												What is Crusader Kings 2? You ask as you boot up the game for the very first time. 6 hours later you are involved in a plot to kill your brother, crusading for the holy land, and your uncle is leading a revolt to lower your crown authority.Crusader Kings 2 is a grand strategy game developed by Paradox that lets you play as a count, duke, king, or emperor during the timeframe of 1066 to 1453. Instead of most grand strategy games where your ruler lives forever, in Crusader Kings 2 your character will die and then you will continue to play has their heir until your dynasty is killed off or the game ends. In fact the entire game is based around you running your dynasty rather than your country. Good traits, prestige, and wealth are all passed down so it is important that you maintain good bloodlines, even if you need to kill a few family members off. The second part of the game is religion. When a Crusade or Jihad is called, you are expected to join and fight or suffer the consequences. Rulers of the same faith will tend not to go to war with each other while the opposites will. There is a lot more stuff I didn't mention but you are going to just have to play to find out.The game, unfortunately, has the ""Paradox Plague"" meaning that if you want to do anything (custom character/country) you are going to need to pay for the dlc. Even major things like playing as Islamic characters requires a dlc. Granted they are cheap and go on sale quite often, but it is still content that should already be in the game, or at least a free update. Thankfully the game has great mod support so you can play user created content.Crusader kings 2 is worth your time and you will sink a ton of hours into it. There is a learning curve, but once you get over that you will be ruling with the best of them.9/10UPDATE: Get the EUIV converter.			"

												When you play this game, you must know that you will fail again and again and again in the beginning. Take every failure as an oppurtunity to learn what works and what fails. Ask yourself: ""Why did I fail?"" and strive to adjust your tactics accordingly. After I had failed as the king of Scotland at least two dozen times I finally became competent enough to survive, and with time...thrive. It is important you learn from your mistakes in this game, let your failures serve you rather than fuel frustration.			"

												Takes a really good game to make me play for 16 hours almost non-stop on my first session.Crusader Kings 2 is an RTS like many of Paradox's previous titles; highly complex (where your typical RTS is concerned) and providing a highly realistic simulation of empire-expansion. Every facet, save tactical involvement in battles, is explored with detail, and with much at the player's control.One of the key features in CK2 is it's dynastic political system. Not only must you secure your line of succession through heirs to continue in your quest for glory, but there are no formal alliances. Everyone you can count on is either directly in your sphere of influence and thus obligated to serve, or aligned through familial ties.Even though I bought it during the sale, as previously I was unsure, now that I've played Crusader Kings 2, I can definitely say I'd not have issue with paying full price for it. This is even one of the few games I wouldn't be opposed to paying full price for DLC.5/5			"

												As of now, I have ~200 hours in this game and I have to say I love it. However, there are some things you should know before buying this game.1. The learning curve is semi-steep2. There is no 'objective' per se. You have to find what YOU want to do in the game.3. You should have the major DLCs like The Old Gods, Charlemagne, The Republic, Sons of Abraham, and Legacy of Rome.I'll admit that initially this game appears to be an overwhelming database of content, but the truth is that it only looks that way and is in no way confusing once you get about five hours into it. There are too many features for me to mention, but I HIGHLY recommend buying this game as it has tons of replay value.Update: ~800 hours in and the game still is just as fun. I can't recommend it more!			"

												Oh gosh, the visceral experience of looking at maps, menus, and occasionaly seeing two giant men duke it on over a county is one of the most thrilling experiences I have ever had.Forget Call of Duty and Battlefied when it comes to intensity. When your only heir contracts Smallpox and you are sure he will die, you are on the edge of your seat hoping for a miracle, even though one won't come, even with all that piety sitting there being nice and pretty.You won't regret buying this game, even if you aren't a maps and menus sort of man, this has helped me learn about the different nations throughout Medieval Europe, and how you can ruin history, so can everyone else! Simply by playing as Vikings and taking Scotland and making it Skotland.10/10, would play again.			"

 Crusader Kings II Review This is going to be a long in-depth review into Crusader Kings 2 so you better get some snacks to fill yourself up for the read.  Gameplay (8/10):  Crusader Kings 2 is a very unique game in the category of gameplay. It gets this uniqueness by bringing 2 genres together in a way different then usual. These two genres are RPG and real-time strategy. Unlike a game like Age of Wonders III where your RPG elements come from designing a undying hero, Crusader Kings II lets you create and play as characters that range from weak to powerful yet no matter what are extremely mortal. In Crusader Kings II your character has a set of traits that they start with however this can change in a blink of an eye. These traits can be obtained and loss through events and the traits can alter certain events meaning if you truly want you can play as if you have those traits. Crusader King II also brings in RPG to a slightly bigger level with not only managing relations with the outside world but with realistic an historic vassals who can leave powerless if left unattended. Also Crusader Kings II makes you manage your vast and growing dynasty in the game who can press their own inherited claims. In the category of strategy Paradox brings their classical style of strategy to this game with you playing and altering the past from historic time marks from between 769-1453 which then you may convert the save file so you may continue the saga on another Paradox strategy game. In the end where this game lacks is due to the massive locked content behind DLC (more covered later). Certain religions and start dates are completely inaccessible because of this.  Mechanics (9/10):  One area where Crusader Kings II excels in is mechanics. Unlike its counter-part in Europa Universalis IV, Crusader Kings II has a great variety of things to do even during peace time. Crusader King II has an in depth relationship system where certain decisions you make and traits you have can have an effect on a relationship with someone. These effects are shown as numbers where +100 is the highest opinion you can get while -100 is the lowest opinion you can get. Crusader Kings II is a game where relationships can turn from sweet to sour with the help of another system, the intrigue system. The intrigue system can be used to plot and kill people of your choice however if caught can drastically change the situation.  The systems work well and fit in together like a perfectly planned puzzle, even the marriage system. Using the marriage and intrigue systems in unison you can make your wife claim all of her brother's land and then she can pass it on to your heirs. There is three major systems that I haven't talked about that form the basis of this game. The first one includes a hierarchical feudal system. Firstly there are counts (the weakest playable characters) who own pieces of land who have barons living in them. If you have a few counties you may become a duke and etc. all the way from kings to emperors. The base mechanic is that you may only have vassals (people with land under you who pay taxes to you) that have a lower rank. You have a max amount of vassals you can have before you begin suffering from penalties, this is to stop rapid expansion and is to balance the game. Another base system is the holding system. Every character has a set amount of counties or baronies they can hold (a.k.a holdings). Duchy, kingdom and empire tier titles do not count as a holding. In a matter of fact having multiple of one of these titles can boost your holding limit. The final major system is the casus belli system. Unlike a game like Civilization V you need a casus belli to go to war (i.e. it is a reason to go to war). You may get these by fabricating claims or by naturally inheriting claims and more. There are so many more mechanics but then this review would become miles long but overall mechanics are detailed and in-depth, the only problem can be the huge number and complexity of them.  AI (7/10):   Like most strategy games Crusader Kings II has a difficulty option that changes the way the AI works. However it is unconventionally placed in the options menu. Yes this allows you to change the difficulty of a save mid-way through however it changes the difficulty of all the saves. Looking at the actual difficulties the differences between easy and hard can be seen. In easy the AI plays more passively and only declare war for casus belli they already have and rarely ever fabricate their own claims. In hard this is different as the AI will take a few more risks and is more likely to jump on someone's weakness even if it is a small one. Also they more pro-actively fabricate claims on other people's territory and in harder modes the AI is much better at vassal and family management. However there are smaller aspects of AI that is useful yet terribly flawed. If you have excess holdings you are able to let a AI give out your excess holdings. This piece of the AI is broken as it can give out the duchy your capital is in and make one of your vassal massively over-powered. In my opinion the gap between easy and hard is too great and a finer scale of difficulty must be used. In addition to that the easy AI should be given some more intellect so very basic decisions do not come out with the most outrageous decisions that even a new player would not make.  Price (6/10):   This is often the deciding factor when buying a game and that is the price. The base version of the game is £25.99. In my opinion this is a fair price but this is where the drawbacks come in. This game has huge amounts of DLC that when bought and added have great changes to the game and bring in a lot of new features and a lot of these features were developed after the game came out. However this is not the thing with all the DLC. When choosing a character you choose a person out of the map but some of these characters (e.g. Muslims) you cannot play in the base game. The game goes furthermore to rub it in your face by discolouring the play button, deactivating it and by saying ""You need to buy the Sword of Islam DLC"". That is not the only problem. Some of this DLC seems pointless. Although a lot of these pointless DLCs are 99p, these are things you would expect to be part of updates. For example new music, new textures for cultural units and even more useless crap. Yes people may say ""it is a business they need to earn money"" but do they really need to go this far? I think not. To get all the content of this game it costs a staggering £122.99 (This number is not outdated). This is by far the biggest dragging point of the game.  Overall (8/10):   Overall this game is very unique in its content. Despite its slight complicity once you’re into the game it just becomes second nature. It’s one more turn equivalent of just that one more kill or just that one more plot to finish effect does leave a massive effect on you. Oh and not to forget it huge replay-ability where no two runs are the same. I believe that the overall good quality of the game can somewhat make up for the high price.			"

												It's a series of family trees (a familial forest, if you will) with a seemingly random event generator, whilst you essentially play as the godfather of your own pre-industrial mafia state. The game is about managing relations (based around an opinion modifier) with your vassals, personal court, liege lords, alliances and your family in general in order to succeed and thrive in the world. Made all the more complicated by the fact these people aren't always mutually exclusive, and if your younger brother is a powerful duke set to inherit your lands he does become a serious threat to be mitigated by alliances elsewhere formed solely by marriage, which will offer sufficient protection - but may scupper your attempts to breed with that commoner with the genetic Genius and Attractive traits and spawn some sort of Uber-Lord heir.Still: after all this you are part of a noble family spreading across Europe, West and North Africa, the Near East, and now India in the hope of... well, surviving mostly. That is the aim: the game is not about conquering, it's about stability, lasting longer than humanly possible as you serve as multiple patriarchs of your family. Even after the Mongols appear in the East and take half of your territory and annex you the next year: you won't have lost. You may lose your Kingdom to rebellions, your warfare, but as long as you remain in control of at least a County (the second smallest land division of the game) or a merchant House (one of the smallest units but only available in the Republic expansion): you will survive. Warfare is simple in some respects, it's based on territory, the leader, and unit types with a random dice roll. If you have significantly more men, you will win. If not, positioning them at choke points and distraction tactics do work - having an enemy army chase a small mobile stack, whilst your main force seizes their capital is a viable route to take. But, that takes a while, and in less you're defending it will cause your vassals to become and their men to become irritated and want to return home. You call up your vassals to fight for you much like an alliance, and if they don't like you: they simply will not come. Now, you can rely on your own men to some extent (maybe even hire some mercenaries for cash or a Holy Order - if you're fighting infidels) in a small kingdom or independent duchy your personal forces and permanent retinues can provide a decent army. But really, you need them as the core for which your vassals surround, otherwise they're going to be killed and the next rebellion that pops up will leave you defenceless.The base game has you play as a Christian noble (though with some variation as you can be: Catholic, Orthodox, or Miaphysite) though this is what most of the game is still based around there are some fantastic DLCs. The DLC has been as clunky as it has been brilliant however due to implementing non-feudal cultures into game mechanics designed around Christianity and vassalage.  For example, my personal favourite: the Legacy of Rome, is based around unique events for the Byzantine Empire and potentially refounding the Roman Empire. All DLC did however come accompanied with a free patch allowing for the game to update considerably anyway, so the base has long since changed significantly. The DLC allows for you to play a new play style, which frankly you may not enjoy: Rajahs of India is dull for me, however the Legacy of Rome and playing as a Zoroastrian in the Old Gods is fantastic. The only ones I will outright say to buy or avoid are:- Buy: Ruler Designer - you lose access to ironman, but designing your own house and choosing your religion does make being Jewish (Sons of Abraham) or Zoroastrian much simpler.- Avoid: CK2-EU4 Save Converter - ostensibly built to allow you to play your CK2 realm through EU4 but it simply doesn't work, there have been points where it has actually worked, but every update to either game breaks it and by the time it has caught up and been fixed, a new update is being announced.Other than that if you like the sound of a DLC, buy it. If you like Rome? The Legacy is for you. Venetian fan? The Republic. You like ahistorical late game invasions by an angry Aztec horde that you forgot about? The Sunset Invasion. 300 years of extra game play? Oh-ho-ho Charlemagne and the Old Gods.There's other minor cosmetic DLC too (unit sprites, music etc) that are pretty dull, but the majority of the DLC is complicated and really does add a lot to the game. Not just the unique play types I've mentioned, but the random events alone can be worth it. Such as when your child turns out to be the spawn of Satan, summons a cabal of witches, assassinates you, and attempts to conquer the Earth in the name of Evil.On the performance side of things: the Clausewitz engine is funny if you have an unusual monitor set up, though. I primarily use an 1176x664 which it will work on, but leave me unable to push the ""accept"" button, rendering warfare and diplomacy immediately unusable. So, prewarning there. Other than that the game is generally stable, however since the India expansion it does take up a considerable amount of memory to run: it is the most intensive of the Paradox Interactive games.So that's it, that's the review. If you kind of like history (but you're not going to be a pedant about getting things slightly off for the sake of playability), maps, managing relationships, and betrayal: this is the game for you. In essence, if you look at the Mafia and think ""yes, that is something I could get involved with"" then you'll lose just as much as your life as I have in a downards spiral whilst you tell yourself ""just 5 more minutes.""

TL;DRThis game makes Jaime and Cersei's p0rn shoot at Joffrey's funeral seem like rainbows and unicorns. ___________________________________ 26 year old king: Involved my sweet uncle by granting him a title and some hot, sinister honey to a plot to assassinate the nurturing breasts that fed me from my youth--my own mother. Imprisoned my sweet sister unsuccessfully. Now she is determined to tear her flesh and blood apart. Betrothed to an eight year old who had the specialty of being humble, a plus in my book! Everybody did it back then when this was considered to be the norm, at least for the British monarch, but now I finally got a taste of virtually grasping its essence in its most truest form. Alas, once I quit the game because I was getting very sleepy did the sudden realization of what morbid behavior I had done begin to gnaw deep within my grief, drenched soul. Taylor Swift's Shake It Off! always soothes me at day's end. Swift's angelic voice and mesmerizing twerking won't even relieve this guilt trip of mine. What have I become? WHAT. HAVE. EYYEEE. BECOME! ...the only logical solution is to start a new game to redeem myself. I feel better now.			"

												I really do'nt know what to say except: this is an excellent game. The way the entire system of  Medieval World was set up; the makers did a wonderful job. I am a history teacher, I thought I was informed about this time period. How mistaken was I. Now, this game has help me understand the mind set of the Medieval times. Also, how things worked in that time. Please, I highly urge you to purchase this game, mainly if you love this time or not you will be pleased with this period of our history. Try it! You will NOT be disappointed. The most important aspect of this game, is to be patient. Remember, this is a game you must think matters through and not go in without thinking first. Think before you do and not do before you think. Finally, the A.I. is competive and the story lines are great. Remember, no game is perfect, but this is an absolute wonderful game. I wouldn't NOT tell anyone to buy a game that cost a good amount of money on something awful.			"

												Probably the best game I've played in a long, long, time.In my opinion, it's more choice & consequence focused RPG than strategy game. At least, that's how I've been playing for twenty hours, thus far. I've had so much fun as my randy Transylvanian duke, with a penchant for seducing every woman at court, and the wives of others - sadly, he later died in his bed due to a mysterious snake being in there with him; haters gonna hate, I suppose.I had hoped you could play as a religious order, or an unlanded noble - that would make for even more awesome roleplaying - unfortunately you can't. I highly recommend this, with some of the major DLC - especially ones which add even more character interaction, choices, mechanics, etc. I'm currently playing as a merchant prince of Venice, and it really is a very different experience - I feel like some sort of mob boss.My only complaint is the battle system. It's often just a frustration - which is why I was glad I didn't have to focus on it as a merchant prince of Venice.(P.S. I only fell in love with this game when I stopped playing it as a pure strategy game, and played it for the immersive character interactions. Haven't been able to stop playing it since.)			"

												All those good things I said about Crusader Kings?  They apply here too.  This game is just amazing.  The interface is better, the graphics are better, the messages and information clearer, and the game play, while requiring a little more patience, is more satisfying.  Still it may be a little much for newcomers to grand strategy, so I suggest checking out some gameplay vids on YouTube after you've messed with the interface a bit.			"

												Brilliant game. My only complaint would be that after 1000 hours played (this account and another) i've yet to play from start to finish. This isn't due to me getting bored and restarting, its simply due to the fact that after a few 100 years the game becomes unplayable due to lag. Maybe my computers just terrible but I know im not the only one that this happens to.			"

												This has to be one of the most comprehensive strategy games I've ever played. Even without fighting battles personally (like you can in the Total War series), I think it does in fact rival the Total War series itself and in many ways I believe the develepers of the Total War games could actually learn a thing or two from this game. I would recommend this to anyone who loves strategy games, especially to those interested in history as a subject, just be prepared to get extremely hooked.			"

												An absolutely excellent strategy game. It is fun, deep, and engaging, but beware of the high learning curve. Once you get past the learning curve, it shows itself to be one of the best strategy games ever. It might even be my favourite game of all time.It is essentially a medieval dynasty simulator. Unlike most strategy games, you do not play directly as the country, but rather as a land owning ruler with many vassals, who in turn own land. It sort of has an RPG aspect with character stats and relationships that form between characters. when you die you are succeeded by your heir, but if that heir is not of your dynasty, the game ends. There is really no real set goal to the game, other than reach the end date of 1453. You make your own goals, such as conquering  a rival power's land, Reforming Pagan religions to resist Christianity, restoring Jewish Israel, Zoroastrian Persia, or even the Roman Empire, and try to survive in a hostile time filled with war and intrigue.

												Probably the best game I've played in a long, long, time.In my opinion, it's more choice & consequence focused RPG than strategy game. At least, that's how I've been playing for twenty hours, thus far. I've had so much fun as my randy Transylvanian duke, with a penchant for seducing every woman at court, and the wives of others - sadly, he later died in his bed due to a mysterious snake being in there with him; haters gonna hate, I suppose.I had hoped you could play as a religious order, or an unlanded noble - that would make for even more awesome roleplaying - unfortunately you can't. I highly recommend this, with some of the major DLC - especially ones which add even more character interaction, choices, mechanics, etc. I'm currently playing as a merchant prince of Venice, and it really is a very different experience - I feel like some sort of mob boss.My only complaint is the battle system. It's often just a frustration - which is why I was glad I didn't have to focus on it as a merchant prince of Venice.(P.S. I only fell in love with this game when I stopped playing it as a pure strategy game, and played it for the immersive character interactions. Haven't been able to stop playing it since.)			"

												Fantastic. My most played individual game by far. With every patch, every expansion the game has gradually gone from good to just downright fantastic. Take the role of an individual person and lead your dynasty to greatness, control duchies, become king and form a-historical empires as you please. With the added ability to convert a CK2 game into a Europa Universalis IV game the experience is further lengthened and strenghtened. The dev team behind the game is fully in-tuned with the wishes of the fans and their forums show this, as fan's wishes for new expansions are slowly but surely making their way into the game. We've had catholisim fleshed out, Vikings, Islam and the Byzantian empire with more sure to follow. Sure, there are some negatives. Fear isn't modelled at all, you can't rule based on fear and the constant match-making can get tedious. Rebellion squashing used to be a hassle but has since been made more managable save the few incidents where rebel stacks several times your own personal retinue and combined armed forces stand up to overthrow you it's fairly well balanced. That said, there's a reason for this as well - you're a terrible ruler and you don't deserve to sit on a throne. A++ would play again, continuing to play.. over a thousand hours to date. That should in all honestly speak for itself.			"

												Let me tell you some actual things that I've done in that Crusader Kings II:I was the Queen of Wales, and I saw that the person who was third in line for the duchy of York was an unmarried woman. She had three young children, two boys and a girl. The current Duke of York was a young man, with a single son, and a chaste wife. I invited the woman who might inherit York to my court, and I arranged for her to marry into my family. Meanwhile, I betrothed all of her children to members of my family. Being a member of my court, she had little choice in the matter. Then, I murdered the Duke of York, sending assassins after him. It took a small fortune, but he was eliminated. His young son made a poor feudal lord, being four, and it was quite easy to convince his court to murder him. With that murder, my erstwhile courtier became the Duchess of York. Two generations later, thanks to my long term family planning, the Duchy of York came into the possession of my family.I was a Scottish Duke, and I served my king loyally for two decades. He was my friend, my cousin, and I served with pride as his chancellor. But he sickened and died, and his young child became king. A wee lad of six, and I was made his regent and tutor. I also discovered that I was his heir. So, I murdered him, and usurped the crown. My new vassals were unhappy with my actions, so I purged them and replaced them with cousins. I betrothed my son to a brilliant, lustful Byzantine princess, and all seemed well. Until my son swore an oath of celibacy. With needs her husband could not fulfil, my daughter in law turned to me. Not so long after, a baby boy was born. I legitimized the child, murdered my son and my wife, and started over with my new family. I was known as Malcolm the Good.I was the Empress of Cymru (once known as Britannia), and my realm had turned to the Cathar faith. The Cathar faith is a Catholic heresy that believed in reincarnation, that a person might be man or woman in any given life, and which believed in gender equality. Being Cathar, I was able to land a woman with a fine mind for tactics as a countess, and I made her my marshal. When the Caliph declared a Jihad against me, trying to retake Hispania, I gave her command of my armies. At times, all three flanks of my main force were commanded by women. That countess led my armies in every major battle, becoming pregnant twice during the course of the war despite being 39/40 at the time of the births. She was wounded more than once, she led armies into battle while being outnumbered 3:2 or worse, but she never lost a battle. She became the second most famous person in all of Europe at that time, with more prestige than the Pope or Caliph or Byzantine Emperor or the Khans. By all accounts, over three hundred thousand infidels were killed by her forces. After the war, she suffered from depression, she lost her courage, but she was still the best person to lead the fight in a Great Holy War against the Norse tribes, far from her home in Portugal. She died at home, and one of her born-on-a-battlefield sons succeeded her.I was the head of the Norse faith and Queen of Denmark, and a treacherous family member gathered an army and struck directly at my capital. He destroyed my retinue army, and assaulted my capital. Outnumbered, with no support from my allies, with my other family members choosing to support the usurper, I was forced to surrender. I remained a duchess, but all of the barons and mayors and religious holdings in my territory reported to the usurper. For a decade, I raided Ireland and northern France, carrying off loot and hostages for ransom. Building myself a great hoard, I waited until the right moment. Eventually, the usurper became embroiled in a war in East Francia, fighting most of the still powerful Karling family. With his armies weakened, I hired mercenaries and I struck at his capital, assaulting it and all of his holdings. He tried to bring back his armies, but my own force outnumbered his almost four to one, and he was crushed. He died in battle, and I imprisoned his brother and heir; I banished him from my realm, reclaiming my rightful titles as head of the Norse faith and Queen of Denmark.I have conquered Europe in Odin's name. I have forced the wives of my defeated foes to become my concubines, and I have shed oceans of blood in the name of women's rights. I have accidentally married my great-granddaughter and deliberately married my sister. I have served Popes and I have murdered Popes. I have been trained in the art of war by a Ronin. I have had misadventures involving a merry band of outlaws in my forests. I have restored the Roman Empire. I have murdered spouses for fun and profit. I have seen battlefields where the dead number in the tens of thousands, and fought wars where neither side could muster five hundred men. I have turned back the Mongol hordes, and I have watched in despair as they annihilated my armies. I have conquered Rome for Islam, and I have retaken Jerusalem for Christ. I have plotted, murdered, schemed, fabricated, built factions, sent bribes, hired mercenaries, raised armies, raised children, murdered children, arranged marriages, taken lovers, banished prisoners, executed prisoners, shown mercy to prisoners, died childless and alone, died with far too many children holding power and claims to the throne, and so much more.If you approach Crusader Kings II as Risk with an annoying thing about people that you need to deal with every so often, you might have some fun, but you're missing out on the real game: Eugenics and Murder Simulator II. The game is totally not for everyone. It is NOT a game that people pick up quickly. But once you get into it, it's the deepest and most rewarding RPG ever made. It's about guiding a family through history, through the sinners and the saints, through the great kings and the terrible ones, it's about surviving all the multitudes of things that can go tragically wrong, and it's about the joy of crushing your enemies, to see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women.As you might guess, I'm a fan. It really isn't for everyone, but if you have the patience to get to the point where you can take control of your own destiny there's really no game like it.			"

The learning curve is steap but once you understand it you will understand all you need to know, from victoria 2 to hearts of Iron. I bought this and all DLC and began to play. After i got the hang of it i kept playing. I played for three days straight, Sleeping for only 8 hours through the course of those 3 days.

												Amazing game, but definitely not for everybody. Requires a lot of patience and thinking for this one, not your usual strategy game. Downsides, it doesn't have a very good tutorial (there's a LOT to learn about this game, I'm 20 hours in and I'm still not even close of discovering everything that you can do, but check youtube videos, there's tons of them helping) and, apart from some problems while loading saved games (sometimes they get corrupted for no reason) and some version problems for online multiplayer, it's a great game to be entertained for hours.If you like Game of Thrones and European history, you'll be in for an awesome time!

I then married them to countess's and duchess's around the world. By my second ruler i had built up a large army and joined a crusade for the holy land. I was crowned the King of Jerusalum and gave my 5th and 6th son vast amounts of land in that area while my heir got cyprus. At this point my wife had a satanic daughter and tried to kill my other children. I married her off to some fat 74 year old count in hungry, thats a form of punishment. After that a great jihad was declared and all my lands were taken from me, My 5th and 6th son converted to islam to save there skin. From here my next son married the queen of aragon and my grandson was crowned king. i was content to live out my days as a good king, but the Aztecs picked the wrong homosexual dwarf to f with, they tried to invade my lands and i called on my mass of relatives to defend me, which incledThe King of PolandThe King of England10 random dukes in the Holy Romand Empire 5 dukes in Byzantuimand of Course my kinsman the Sunni Caliph We trashed the Aztecs and on that day the pope and the Caliph fought together.10/10 would have Muslim relatives again..

												So good it made me quit smokingIf you have a job don't play this, if you have a wife/girlfriend don't play this, if you have children or a person that is dependent on you don't play this. If you're a looser like me who has no responsibilities then this game will make you feel like a real winner. The learning curve is steap but once you understand it you will understand all you need to know, from victoria 2 to hearts of Iron. I bought this and all DLC and began to play. After i got the hang of it i kept playing. I played for three days straight, Sleeping for only 8 hours through the course of those 3 days. On the last day I was so determined to finish my campaign that i didn't eat for 9 hours, didn't drink anything for 6 hours, didn't♥♥♥♥♥♥for 7 hours. Because of all this Cigarettes were the last thing on my mind. This game actually pays itself off in the first 2 weeks because of all that money that would normally go to cigarettes. 10/10 Prevents Cancer			"

But then one day I had my best overall Emperor had the traits strong genius and quick and I had a great wife she was Fair, Kind, and Lustful (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). But then I made the fatal decision to sleep with a courtier. When she produced a child I didn’t want it to ruin my reputation so I decided to not recognize the child.  Then after around 17 years I died multiple times from children having various diseases but then it came down to my Youngest being 18 he was the best out the lot he had strong and fair traits of his parents I then married a courtier who was a Genius. We had a child who was male. BUT THEN I looked at little Timmy and I saw a trait Inbred… I couldn’t figure out what caused this then I remembered that courtier then it all came to me. I married the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ daughter I tried to launch multiple assassination attempts against my heir but I couldn’t kill him. Then I died from smallpox and played the inbred craven 12 year old. People began starting factions as they now hated me for various reasons and I wouldn’t die I kept stooping assassins and eventually my empire fell. little timmy grew up to rule a empire for only 22 years before he was imprisoned and executed by his uncle.10/10 Wear protection when banging women who you just meet.

												I really do'nt know what to say except: this is an excellent game. The way the entire system of  Medieval World was set up; the makers did a wonderful job. I am a history teacher, I thought I was informed about this time period. How mistaken was I. Now, this game has help me understand the mind set of the Medieval times. Also, how things worked in that time. Please, I highly urge you to purchase this game, mainly if you love this time or not you will be pleased with this period of our history. Try it! You will NOT be disappointed. The most important aspect of this game, is to be patient. Remember, this is a game you must think matters through and not go in without thinking first. Think before you do and not do before you think. Finally, the A.I. is competive and the story lines are great. Remember, no game is perfect, but this is an absolute wonderful game. I wouldn't NOT tell anyone to buy a game that cost a good amount of money on something awful.			"

												Finally, a game that does DLC right.I came into this franchise a little after the Old Gods DLC was released. Intially, I just played the original game, since there's a pretty steep learning curve and  the base game alone has tons of hours of gameplay by itself. The great thing about this game is, it a fully complete and deep game no matter if you decide to expand or not. With that said, each expansion has brought a different flavor and experience to the gameplay that I hadn't even known that I wanted until I was playing it. Having played them now, I would not be able to go back to just the original game as is. Even owning this game for as long as I have, I still play it on a consistent basis.Some people argue about how expensive the game and all of it's DLC are.  CK2 goes on sale like, every other month (if not more). Pick up a DLC here and there (theres so much in these that you really will be kept busy by the features in each) for a fraction of the regular price. Half of the DLCs you can ignore, because they are mainly eye candy things - extra skins or shields. I wouldn't worry about those until you have all the gameplay ones in your library.And if all else fails, there's a great Game of Thrones mod.			"

												I remember when I had a family, friends, and a youthful figure. This game took all of that away, and gave me something better. Every day after school I sprint home to resume my Crusader Kings 2 journey, forging my dynasty to make it the greatest in all of Europe. My teachers tell me I will have to repeat the 8th grade, that my grades are slipping, I tell them to meet on the hills of Normandy where my dynasty reigns with an iron fist. My family has tried everything, whether it be cutting my computer cords, stealing my monitor, or turning off the power in our house; I always find a way to return to my beloved Crusader Kings 2. The first 200 hours of this game are a warmup lap, after you complete the warmup lap you realize you need at least another 600 hours to get the complete experience... After 800 hours, you cannot stop, and you realize this game has consumed your life in every aspect, but do you care? Of course not, because deep down you know that your real life doesnt matter anymore, only the lives of your characters in-game matter. Once you come to this realization, you will be at peace. I must finish this review now, my Chancellor has notified me that my liege lord is waging war, I must gather my troops and prepare for impending conflict. Farewell all, and pray for me.			"

												CK2 is not for everyone. The interface and ""gameplay"" are very dense. The game consists mostly of an interactive map and clickable menus and the buik of processing goes to the system simulating other characters' choices and movements alongside your own. I definitely recommend watching some of the thorough gameplay introductions you can find on YouTube before you buy, and then again as you learn if you want to have any idea how to progress in this game. I love it, but you may not. Pairs well with a nice Malbec.			"

												I keep coming back to this game. I've introduced it to my 54 year old father who is all about Civ games. It's just a well done game that continues to come out with interesting expansions and you are never fulfilled in your conquest or intrigue. It's an intense board game come to life. I've logged many many hours in this game and it's cousins. When I discovered this game a few years ago I was overwhelmed with how difficult it first seems, even playthroughs and guides couldn't really tell me or show me exactly how to play. And each time you reinstall the game you have a new goal, a new play that you learn and then the developers add something new that you want to try. If you haven't yet installed this game after it has been sitting in your library,  even after all these years. Try it again, give it more than 30 minutes. You'll fall in love with it and it may just become your favorite game. Plus then you'll get to finally play EU4 and everything else that they develop as well.			"

												547 hours is the time I have spent playing this game, for most other games this is enough to make you an expert but with Crusader Kings 2 you're still a Newbie.You can play this game if you want to take over the world of if you just want to roleplay your dynasty. I prefer the latter I like to build the prestige of a lowly count and his family and start marrying stratigically so I can do the former and take over the world without invading, of course sometimes you will have to defend but as long as you have some strong allies then you're pretty good. I'm pretty bad at the fighting side even after 547 hours of playing this and a few hundred playing Crusader Kings 1 but this is one game where sucking is still good fun.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed this game.I mainly play the Game of Thrones mod and probably only have around 15 hours of the base game out of my entire 200+ hours. Even though they might have some of the worse forum policies I've seen so far, I still love the political intrigue that comes with the game. Dynasties rise and fall, nations conquered, etc. Shattered retreat has a mod that removes it from the game completely (which is good since I hate shattered retreat, mainly due to the fact that if an entire army is going to retreat they would be much less organized. Especially if 10-12,000 troops just died out of your 15,000. If anything the army would split and scatted randomly, not being much of an army anymore.)Although I do hope for an RPG with similar political intrigue in the future (hopefully Game of Thrones based with smarter AI) as that would be a game of dreams for me.Amazing stories can also be created in the game, and I love the changes in history (or the differences in the Game of Thrones storyline) that can be found throughout it all. It's all extremely satisfying and I hope for more great mods in the future.Although when Crusader Kings 3 comes out you'll probably feel like your playing the first Crusader Kings on initial release. PI has a thing for reverting to it's base stage and making you pay for all the cool and interesting upgrades from the previous games through semi-expensive DLC.At least it's not Train Simulator DLC.

												Ever dreamed of cutting off your neighbourghs balls because he screwed your wife? Ever dreamed of then executing your wife and all your children so you can marry that hot hungarian princess and produce children with CLAIMS? No? just me? Anyway, this is Crusader Kings 2.Crusader Kings 2 is a personal grand strategy game by Paradox Entertainment, taking place between 769 a.D and and 1453 a.D (assuming you got the dlc). In between, you will form a grand Dynasty, backstab enemies, fight wars, ♥♥♥♥ing go crusadin and♥♥♥♥♥♥and hopefully rule the world. Or you might just die childless to the 715th byzantine revolt in the last 30 years.Unlike most other grand strategy games, ck2 works on a ""personal"" base, instead of a ""national"" base. What that means is, you are not the country of poophill, you are duke kevin II of poophill. This mechanic leads to a very interesting gameplay, where personal rivalries and intrigues, as well as the capabilities of the different characters play a major role. As such, it is fundamentally different from other grand strategy games, which is always welcome in my mind.Due to this personal system, the game also offers great variety on who to play. Wanna play a great byzantine emperor and reinstate the roman empire? You do you, go ahead. Want to play as a pisspoor eunuch, whose only way of dynastial survival is being cucked by his wife? If you're into that kind of thing, feel free to. The game has near limitless possibilities on who and how to play, and it will keep you entertained for hundreds, if not thousands of hours.The biggest contra of this game, however, is it's insane amount of dlc. Of course, most of them are not mandatory for an enjoyable experience (I for one recommend: at least get legacy of rome and the old gods.), but they do add up to an insane amount of money for one game. As such, you should grab this game while it's on sale. Stuff on sale is cheaper. Cheaper is better. You can spend more money on food that way. Or on your weird fetishes, but hey, i don't know anything about you.To come to a conclusion, I can fully recommend CK2 to anyone who's interested in a different take on the grand-strategy genre, to medieval history nerds of all kinds and sizes and especially to psychopaths who like cutting off other peoples balls or blinding them, just because he won a tournament against you (that's what you get, Patreikos).Happy Crusading, Deus Vult!

												An absolutely excellent strategy game. It is fun, deep, and engaging, but beware of the high learning curve. Once you get past the learning curve, it shows itself to be one of the best strategy games ever. It might even be my favourite game of all time.It is essentially a medieval dynasty simulator. Unlike most strategy games, you do not play directly as the country, but rather as a land owning ruler with many vassals, who in turn own land. It sort of has an RPG aspect with character stats and relationships that form between characters. when you die you are succeeded by your heir, but if that heir is not of your dynasty, the game ends. There is really no real set goal to the game, other than reach the end date of 1453. You make your own goals, such as conquering  a rival power's land, Reforming Pagan religions to resist Christianity, restoring Jewish Israel, Zoroastrian Persia, or even the Roman Empire, and try to survive in a hostile time filled with war and intrigue.

												Crusader Kings II involes complicated strategy: diplomatically and economically as well as in handling domestic affairs to prevent insurrections and dynastically to continue your family's rule. It is set in one of the most captivating and exciting periods in history, has a myriad of possibilities, and even shows complex webs of feudal relationships quite well. It is a game that may seem overwhelming at first -- but that initial overwhelmingness translates into much thought and variations later. As with Europa Universalis 4, I definitely recommend the game, but it needs its DLC, which can get quite expensive at times.			"

												This game is seriously addictive. I can't stop playing, but it's great. Downsides are that it's a bit tricky / intimidating starting out, not much in the way of a good tutorial, and it can be complex. However it's still very accessible, just make sure to clock a few hours before writing this game off and get in the swing of things first if you're initially struggling. Great if you want to transition from more popular strategy like CiV into more complex games. The Game of Thrones mod is a must if you're a fan of the series. Absolutely recommend this if you appreciate games with depth.			"

												This is rather a simulation than a game. It has synchronisation issues and crashes in multiplayer sometimes.  the player need an imense amount of time. The game does not really have a steam integration neither does it help players connect with other players. it has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of DLCs at insane prices. there is almost no music and the extra tracks are DLCs that cost extra.It has hell long loding screens. it has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tutorial which is probably the most boring thing to get into ever. But i still would recommend it. its a very good game. its complex. fun to play with friends and has many other very cool features. its one of those games you can play almost passively at one time and very actively at another.If you are looking for a world domination game this probably ain't really the thing, because it takes very long time to ammess smaller regions with war and war usually brings less new land than a few well placed marriages.31 hours of playing and i'm still not sure if i really understand all the mechanics. so yes this game is great, but its surely not everyones taste.

												There's very little to say that the dedicated, vocal and truly helpful CK2 community has not already said.  Grand Strategy is the name of the genre, but everyone knows the game is really both a broad and deep Medieval Dynasty Simulator.The learning curve is often described as steep, but it is only as steep as you want it to be.  Want proficiency in all the subsystems so you can build a dominant hegemonic empire?   Just want to fool around with history and see what happens?    The game will happily take all comers.If new to the game, don't worry about the DLC avalanche.   Try out the base game and see if it's your cup of tea.  (Hint:  if you like history or strategy or power or maps or even sweeping dynastic stories, it will be your cup of tea.  If you like all of these things, then welcome home.)			"

												I bought the game 3 days ago and I have 45 hours in it so far.. This game is so addictive. I much prefer this game to similar games such as Europa Universalis IV, especially when you bundle it up with all of the DLC.I can't recommend this game enough, it is so complex and intricate while being exceptionally rewarding. Don't expect a military strategy in the vein of Total War, as Crusader Kings 2 goes beyond the scope of any Total War game. some people may find the combat lacking compared to games like Total War etc. However these are completely different types of games, which some people just don't get. Combat comes down to size of force, composition of units, commander abilities, terrain and other modifiers. You don't get direct control like you would in Total War etc.There are so many different mechanics at play all at once. You have the Feudal system, where you're trying to please your vassals and build relationships with them, while you're trying to protect and enhance your dynasty, all the while stopping plots on you or your family, you're trying build claims on land to justify an invasion and you're setting up an Anti-Pope because the Pope excommunicated your uncle... Seriously when it all comes together it is both mind-boggling and fantastic.If you've always wanted to Marry your mother and imprison your father while waging war on your illegitmate half-brother.. well now you can. And it's brilliant.			"

												Went from TotalWar and Creative Assembly to Paradox games and the difference is mind-blowing. Never had this much fun with a strategygame. Really challenging and fun. The depth and complexity with everything from politics and family is so, so far away from totalwars simple game it can't even be compared. I love this game from the bottom of my hearth.			"

												I bought the game 3 days ago and I have 45 hours in it so far.. This game is so addictive. I much prefer this game to similar games such as Europa Universalis IV, especially when you bundle it up with all of the DLC.I can't recommend this game enough, it is so complex and intricate while being exceptionally rewarding. Don't expect a military strategy in the vein of Total War, as Crusader Kings 2 goes beyond the scope of any Total War game. some people may find the combat lacking compared to games like Total War etc. However these are completely different types of games, which some people just don't get. Combat comes down to size of force, composition of units, commander abilities, terrain and other modifiers. You don't get direct control like you would in Total War etc.There are so many different mechanics at play all at once. You have the Feudal system, where you're trying to please your vassals and build relationships with them, while you're trying to protect and enhance your dynasty, all the while stopping plots on you or your family, you're trying build claims on land to justify an invasion and you're setting up an Anti-Pope because the Pope excommunicated your uncle... Seriously when it all comes together it is both mind-boggling and fantastic.If you've always wanted to Marry your mother and imprison your father while waging war on your illegitmate half-brother.. well now you can. And it's brilliant.			"

												If you've ever wanted to RP as a 63 year old queen of Ireland who goes on late night romps with a single guard through the muddy streets of her city looking to fight a pack of ruffians and (of course) winning the fist-fight all on her own, this is the game for you. Or if you've ever wanted to start a game, get bit by snakes a year in, and die without heirs, effectively ending the game, all of this being random and out of your control, this is the game for you. So much fun.			"

												One of the greatest games ever made.I always had a love-hate/hate-love to Paradox Interactive. It all started when I used to play their 2005 published game ""Knights of Honor"" and they never released a KoH2. But with the start of the Crusader Kings series I started to love them again, even though, it took them years to release a second part.I awaited this game with high expectations, which got fullfilled. The economical and political algorythm is deep and complex, so the game provides hours of game fun for every strategy junkie. Even if I think the DLCs are slightly expensive for the short time they release them every now and then, it is still worth buying them.Everyone who search for a great strategy game should really have a look at ""CKII"".Tip: Search your favourite search engine for ""CKII Game of Thrones Mod"" for the probably best Game of Thrones mods of all games.

												This game is the most accessible and least buggy game that Paradox has ever released.You can unify your lands through marriage or mace, conquer Europe, go from Count of Dublin to King of Africa over the course of generations, or merely try to hold your kingdom together in the face of your relatives, who might not be so numerous or so quarrelsome if you didn't feel like having 10 kids a generation or two back.Ultimately, Crusader Kings 2 is a game of emergent story. I don't remember my conquests as much as I remember the time that a once-favored cousin in Ulster managed to grab a piece of Italy through marriage and immediately defected to the Holy Roman Empire, leading to a massive war as I attempted to bring my wayward vassal to heel and left me managing a motley crew of dissatisfied Italians who now owed fealty to a distant Irish liege.

												Sheikh Hakim of Ascalon and Beersheba was put into a peculiar situation whereupon he needed an heir to his titles.  As fond as Hakim was of his wife, Fatima, his vassals were chortling behind his back: he only had the one wife!  Well, one wife became two, and two daughters became three.Things became more desperate as the the good Sheikh advanced in age.  Very concerned about having an heir to claim his titles and take care of his dynasty, Hakim took another wife, and yet another.  Fortunately his many daughters - six now - were betrothed to men who would be valuable (if mercurial) allies against the Emir who coveted the Sheikh's territory.At last, a son was born to Hakim and Fatima.  Abdulallah would be groomed and prepared to become the best hope for the Sheikhdom of Ascalon and Beersheba.  In time, Abdulallah would prove himself by going on Hajj to Mecca and fighting rampaging Crusaders bound for nearby Jerusalem.  When Sheikh Hakim spoke his final words - the Mohammedan Confession - his son became the lord at long last.Abdulallah's first task as Sheikh of Ascalon and Beersheba was to rise up and defeat the tyrannical Emir who dared to revoke his dynastic titles upon his father's death.  With the help of Allah - and a few coins well spent on Turkish mercenaries - he did just that.Crusader Kings II may go down as one of the most brilliant games I've ever played.			"

												Probably the most deep and engaging historical game ever made.  Turns you into a know-it-all of early European/Eurasian history...and interstingly enough was probably was the best supplemental material for my History major throughout my college career lolBut seriously, CKII is like the real-life Game of Thrones.  You act as a sort of sociopathic line of kings/dukes/counts/etc and try to navigate the incredibly complex political realm of 800-1300 CE.  The game taught me more about the pagan faiths and general world geography than any class ever did.  Insane amount of detail and historical information, including political figures and their personal traits.  Makes you appreciate the game even more.  Even recommended it to professors as a sort of simulation of the time period.12/10			"

												I love historical strategy games, and then the ability redo history the way you want is more satisfying. Don't mind me, I'm just a lowly count who put his children in Carolingian bedchambers across all of Europe. Oh that person mysteriously died, meaning my children's marriages are beneficial because they're spouses are set up to inherit everything, and my grandchildren will be of my house, who in time will inherit everything?? And then I'll marry my grandchildren to each other because incest is wincest! Remember, it's all about you and your family surviving! This is a simulator to see how egotistical you can get.It's a great game overall. The default difficutly isn't too hard, but it's not too easy either. Replay value is very high becasue nothing really happens the same way.Fun fact: people don't like when you murder the king so you can become king. Civil wars are a ♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												I was introduced to paradox interactive a few years back (5 years) and played eu 2 religiously.Europa universailis is a macro game while crusader kings 2 is more micro. What I mean is you manage individual's ambitions and intrigues; macro events like kingdom wars are quick and not very strategic. Micro events like assassinations, marriage, kidnapping, torture, dynasty events, throne claiming, and personal stuff are how you manage countries.Even though it looks like the EU series it plays completely different. It takes a while to get used to but once you get into it it is really exciting to make things personal.			"

												What makes this game so fun is also what makes it so replayable, the ability to write your own alternate history.There are so many ways you can play out your characters. Often unexpected events lead to very interesting, challenging or downright hilarious scenarios. Very often various characters that you plays as (somtimes even those you don't plays as) will end up endearing themselves to you, as you painstakingly try to guide them succesfully through the political quagmire that the feudal system can become.That being said, this is by no means a simple game, it is complex and can be daunting at first.The graphics are functional, and only serve to convey information for the most part.The majority of the storytelling will be going on in your imagination, since there are no cutscenes and events appear as a text popup with some artwork. Personally I love coming up with elaborate character stories, so this isn't even a factor for me.Battles are simplistic in nature, essentially clashes of numbers with some factors thrown in, like commander skills and traits, terrain and so forth.In conclusion, if you like grand strategy, I absolutely recommend it.

												If you like both Role Play and Strategy games, this is the One True Game for you!Crusader Kings II features both well known Role Play elements (like character traits, decisions you make, interactions and opinions) and Strategy elements that fans of the genre are so used to.In this awesome game you play with a count, a duke, a nobody, a king or an emperor (featuring female characters of course) and behave however you see fit to rule or to live in this crazy backstabbing traitorous world once known as Europe. Handle rebellions or invasions from other kingdoms, handle the muslims or the catholics (you choose whatever you want after all), make sure the Pope likes you so you're not excommunicated and other kings or lords are not your worse nightmares, because they can and they will crush you.Shape Medieval Europe as you like...conquer the whole world with one single Kingdom and show how powerful your House is, but be careful...dark forces may be working against you inside your own castle...in your own court or council. That's right, you can hire people to be your councilors granting them titles if you want like Master of the Horse, Master of the Hunt and Seneschal among many others.The multiplayer aspect of the game is fantastic both in LAN and Internet servers allowing you to play with or against your friends. The game also supports modding being the most famous, perhaps, A Game of Thrones mod for Crusader Kings II, which, by the way, brings the game to a higher level.The only downside of Crusader Kings II is an indirect one: the cost of the many DLC turns out to be higher than some could handle but the DLC themselves add so many awesome new features to the game that going hungry for a month is totally worth it.My final rating for this game is an honest 9/10! Get it, learn the basics and play it alone or with friends! I assure you, medieval Europe will be glad to have you there...""Many were called, few were chosen""			"

Matrillineally married my daughter who was the cousin and niece of my old character's son to him, securing my dynasty's control over the Empire in future generations.10/10 best incestuous seduction simulator 2015.

												The base game allows you to play a dynasty in medieval times. From ruler to ruler. You'll manage inheritance, engage in political backstabbing, conquests, tournaments and much more. You might wonder, all this playtime and no achievements? That's because not playing ironman or using mods disables them. But who needs them? The main strength of CK2 lies in it's big mods. Period. Like A Game Of Thrones mod, where you can play as most characters you know from the show or books. There are of course Dragons too. Or Warhammer Geheimnisnacht, with many different races and cultures. Elves, Dwarves, Lizardmen, Greenskins (Orcs), Skaven (rat people) Vampire clans, Tomb Kings (undead necromancers), Chaos Nomads, many different types of Humans and much much more. Not to mention Slaanesh. All of the flavor you might know from old Warhammer Fantasy, without the controversial AoS stuff. There are mods for other fantasy worlds too, like Elder Kings (TES) and Middle Earth.If the total price for game+DLC scares you, just wait for a sale and grab it all cheaply. Not to mention you don't need most stuff.			"

												I was introduced to paradox interactive a few years back (5 years) and played eu 2 religiously.Europa universailis is a macro game while crusader kings 2 is more micro. What I mean is you manage individual's ambitions and intrigues; macro events like kingdom wars are quick and not very strategic. Micro events like assassinations, marriage, kidnapping, torture, dynasty events, throne claiming, and personal stuff are how you manage countries.Even though it looks like the EU series it plays completely different. It takes a while to get used to but once you get into it it is really exciting to make things personal.			"

												I love historical strategy games, and then the ability redo history the way you want is more satisfying. Don't mind me, I'm just a lowly count who put his children in Carolingian bedchambers across all of Europe. Oh that person mysteriously died, meaning my children's marriages are beneficial because they're spouses are set up to inherit everything, and my grandchildren will be of my house, who in time will inherit everything?? And then I'll marry my grandchildren to each other because incest is wincest! Remember, it's all about you and your family surviving! This is a simulator to see how egotistical you can get.It's a great game overall. The default difficutly isn't too hard, but it's not too easy either. Replay value is very high becasue nothing really happens the same way.Fun fact: people don't like when you murder the king so you can become king. Civil wars are a ♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												What makes this game so fun is also what makes it so replayable, the ability to write your own alternate history.There are so many ways you can play out your characters. Often unexpected events lead to very interesting, challenging or downright hilarious scenarios. Very often various characters that you plays as (somtimes even those you don't plays as) will end up endearing themselves to you, as you painstakingly try to guide them succesfully through the political quagmire that the feudal system can become.That being said, this is by no means a simple game, it is complex and can be daunting at first.The graphics are functional, and only serve to convey information for the most part.The majority of the storytelling will be going on in your imagination, since there are no cutscenes and events appear as a text popup with some artwork. Personally I love coming up with elaborate character stories, so this isn't even a factor for me.Battles are simplistic in nature, essentially clashes of numbers with some factors thrown in, like commander skills and traits, terrain and so forth.In conclusion, if you like grand strategy, I absolutely recommend it.

												Disclaimer: I like somewhat complex games like Eve Online (yay spreadsheets), Civilization, Stellaris, Kerbal Space Program (best game...ever!!!!!!), Rimworld...you get my drift. So if you hate those games, I'm probably not a good benchmark for you ;)Just bought this during the winter discount period, and wow!! For anyone who likes micro-managing stuff and ""deep"" games, this is a total no-brainer. If the intrigue, spying and politics in Eve Online are something you like...you will like this too. Want to marry some lord's wife? No problem, just get him assassinated. Pretty much anything is possible. It's a bit like Civilization in terms of sucking you in. The hours just fly by. The main difference is that you actually CARE about characters in game. They aren't just figures on a board. Yes, upgrading structures and building armies is essential...but so are the relationships you build and influence between in-game characters. It just creates more of a ""story""...YOUR story. I just downloaded the Game of Thrones mod and OH MY GOD IS IT GOOD!!! Right now I'm Littlefinger and I'm plotting to kill Edard Stark (the naive fool...stupid man!) so I can marry his wife. If that fails, Sansa will be mine...or Denyris. Geoffrey is a dead man, I just haven't decided how to get rid of him. I'm gonna wipe out the Lannisters (except for Tyrion of course). Tempted to create an alliance between the pirates, the dragon chick, Tyrion, Wildlings and maybe some of the Starks if they aren't so bloody dumb and get themselves killed. But first I need to make a child with Edard's wife or his daughter...because if Littlefinger dies of the plague or some other stupid reason, that baby will get me on the Iron Throne. If you like deep games giving you a great story, tons of complexity and micro-management, unlimited replayability and great mod support...get it. If you consider Broforce complex or watch the Kardashians for educational purposes...this game probably isn't for you ;)			"

												For the past year my top game would definitely be ""Crusader Kings II"" for the PC. Simply put, it's a grand strategy game where you strive to conquer Europe through military and diplomatic warfare.The game has a serious learning curve, but with a few tutorials it comes together eventually. It has a great community, and if you're mildly interested in grand strategy games, the demo on Steam is definitely worth a try.Nothing is more satisfying than inheriting a large kingdom through a multi-generational plan involving series of assassinations, while simultaneously fighting off your religious enemies and enacting your masterfully designed eugenics program (to produce the perfect heir).

												Started a new game one week before finals, what could go wrong? Night before first exam, I can't stop, the Kingdom of Francia is within reach and I must succeed. Almost failed Constitutional Law exam. Night before second exam, it's been hours now that I'm frantically trying to save my dynasty. I've killed my brothers, sisters, sons and daughters in order to make the Basileus of the Byzantine Empire my heir. He dies, his slow matrilineally married son inherits. Suddenly, I die. My game is about to be over, no heirs of my dynasty, two weeks of my life about to come to an abrupt end. All his children must be imprisoned and executed, and now I have to deal with the fallout. I barely passed the Social Psychology exam. Night before third exam, I'm in the flow of a crusade on Hispania, when I realize another dynasty member has become Basileus. Time to try again. Many good dynasty men and women rulers died in that crusade. But I finally became the Basileus and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, tonight was a good night. The following morning I aced the History exam, my professor never knew the Roman Empire was restored thanks to a Great Crusade that united the Byzantine Empire and Holy Roman Empire. TL:DR:10/10 Will become your #1 priority above all else.			"

												In order to understand why I like this game so much, bear with me for a second while I share a small story. Ivan the 2nd was the new ruler of Muscovy. His father had expanded the duchy greatly, but he had 3 sons. Ivan was the eldest, and his two younger brothers were not even of age yet. Still, when Dad suddenly died they each received a bit of the massive duchy. Ivan the 2nd was not happy about this state of affairs. Ivan had weak claims on each of their kingdoms, but he couldn't press them via war. The middle brother was just a few months away from turning 16 and he could get a wife! If he got a wife then that meant children and Ivan the 2nd would never get that territory back from his brothers. Then a terrible, awful, evil idea entered his mind. If he couldn't fight them directly, there was another way to inherit the provinces. After all, if something were to suddenly ""happen"" to his two younger brothers, then he stood to get everything. What a tragedy it was when both of the young children suddenly died in mysterious circumstances before they could have children of their own. Then Ivan the 2nd formed the Kingdom of Rus just in time for the Mongols to show up. Oops.			"

												If you like both Role Play and Strategy games, this is the One True Game for you!Crusader Kings II features both well known Role Play elements (like character traits, decisions you make, interactions and opinions) and Strategy elements that fans of the genre are so used to.In this awesome game you play with a count, a duke, a nobody, a king or an emperor (featuring female characters of course) and behave however you see fit to rule or to live in this crazy backstabbing traitorous world once known as Europe. Handle rebellions or invasions from other kingdoms, handle the muslims or the catholics (you choose whatever you want after all), make sure the Pope likes you so you're not excommunicated and other kings or lords are not your worse nightmares, because they can and they will crush you.Shape Medieval Europe as you like...conquer the whole world with one single Kingdom and show how powerful your House is, but be careful...dark forces may be working against you inside your own castle...in your own court or council. That's right, you can hire people to be your councilors granting them titles if you want like Master of the Horse, Master of the Hunt and Seneschal among many others.The multiplayer aspect of the game is fantastic both in LAN and Internet servers allowing you to play with or against your friends. The game also supports modding being the most famous, perhaps, A Game of Thrones mod for Crusader Kings II, which, by the way, brings the game to a higher level.The only downside of Crusader Kings II is an indirect one: the cost of the many DLC turns out to be higher than some could handle but the DLC themselves add so many awesome new features to the game that going hungry for a month is totally worth it.My final rating for this game is an honest 9/10! Get it, learn the basics and play it alone or with friends! I assure you, medieval Europe will be glad to have you there...""Many were called, few were chosen""			"

												I have now logged 100 hours with this game + countless more on other Paradox titles: from a personal standpoint, this is the best game Paradox has made. This is strange to say because it doesn't really cover my favorite time period - that would be Europa Universalis. But in CK2, playing as an individual ruler and having to deal with all the varied personalities that you encounter in your role gives the game a narrative and role-play element that sets it above the rest of the Paradox series. The struggle to keep up with claims, maintain a strong council, prevent your vassals from starting revolts, arrange politically advantageous marriages, assassinate liabilities in your court - it all feels like you're playing a medieval House of Cards, or perhaps more appropriately the first two seasons of Game of Thrones. You will do horrible things to preserve and advance your family in the world, and you will enjoy it. Kinslayer means little when you're Emperor.			"

As time went on, I began to enjoy the company of my Queef Buckle. I left for many crusades, I assisted allies close and distant, but Queef Buckle was always in my heart. I confessed my love to Queef Buckle, my darkling Queef Buckle. But life took a dark turn, and someone murdered my Queef Buckle. King Kazimierz fell into depression, the feeling of killing heretics no longer felt the same, as if fighting for nothing. I discovered who murdered my darling Queef Buckle, the light of my life, and executed her. King Kazimierz did not live much longer. The tragedy of Queef Buckles murder still existed however, and the sons of the executed grew angry at the monarchy. My brother took his chance and began to rebel, plunging Poland into civil war. Conquered areas soon took their chance to regain their independence. Poland was lost, a ruin, all because my darling Queef Buckle was murdered in cold blood.10/10.			"

												If you've played Europa Universalis and co, then this game is awesome. Enough said - buy it and dive in. If you've never played a Paradox game of this nature before then read on....This game has a steep learning curve, matched only by the joy from the gameplay after you get over the initial hump. My brother showed me the interface and took me through some of the concepts of the game initially which got me over that learning curve. I would recommend watching some kind of Youtube videos or reading up on the game concepts because it doesn't pull any punches when it comes to the terminology of the era.There's a moment when it just starts to click and when it does, it feels like you've opened a door to a whole new world of great gaming. I have spent more time playing this game than any other.I would recommend buying some of the expansion packs for flavour as the big ones have some excellent additions to the Crusader Kings gameplay however to start with, the normal game is great. I have always been a fan of the Total War series. This game is not that. It's not as hands on tactical (regarding battles and such), it's much more strategic in it's approach. It's much more personable. Your character, his or her family, friends, relations, vassals and enemies really MATTER.I have always been a fan of the Civ series. This game is not that. It's a much more in depth dive into the feudal system. Civilisation is a brilliant glimpse at the whole of human history. This is the PHD on the middle ages.If you're into strategy games, you deserve to play this and don't be put off by the initial learning barrier. Because when you're succeeding at this game, there's no feeling like it.			"

I decided to discipline her by throwing her in prison for a couple of weeks and when I let her out again all hell breaks loose, she's now this demon child who causes an extreme amount of bad luck and deaths around the castle.

And then the Pope got involved. Crusade for Aquitaine with all of Europe against me and like a badass, decide to send all 15k of my men to Rome. Take Rome before they have a chance to react and capture the pope. Win the Crusades and get 2000 prestige. Marry my daughter to the Abbasid Caliph. Ruler dies of old age at 67. Heir's s a brave strategist. Establish empire of Hispania. Start conquering Britannia by the bunches. Have to stop when I have 2 peasant revolts and an independence revolt in my homeland and crush them. Realize my guy has a weak claim on the Abbasid Caliphate. Check out the ruler. Turns out he is a Greek! And as a good Muslim ruler, I decide to liberate the empire from him. Luckily for me, They  had a Shia rising event. Conquer them and both of the Caliphs of Islam are my vassals and then bam, a crusade plus decadence revolt, and the odd liberation force my empire from the largest in the world to nothing but a kingdom. 10/10 only this happens in CK2			"

												At first glance, this game is extremely intimidating. The UI and overall gameplay are complex and hard to understand without tutorials; even with the tutorials, the game is just confusing. It doesn't help that you are never really given any goals or anything to do. Now, you may be wondering, why am I saying these negative things if this is a positive review?Because those are the things that make this game great.Crusader Kings II gives the best interpretation of Medieval government, diplomacy, warfare, and royalty in any game. Ever. While it lacks the fancy battles of Medieval II: Total War, it brings in mechanics like functioning diplomacy and levies for a much more realistic and fun grand strategy game. On the topic of complexity, a newcomer may find the maps and tabs to be excessive and stupid. Once you realize their function, however, you will find them indispensable. I mentioned earlier that this game has no clear cut goal. This is probably the best part, as you really define your own experience. Work your way up from Count to Emperor. Or don't. Maybe your personal goal as a Spanish Catholic is to finish the Reconquista. Maybe you want to convert to Islam and teach Christendom a lesson. It's completely up to you, making for a unique and personal playthrough every time.Your main incentive to get off your♥♥♥♥♥♥and achieve stuff is your dynasty. In the beginning, this may just be you and your personal family (if you are starting small), but by the end you will have a branching royal dynasty who may even be on the other thrones of Europe. Crusader Kings II has you play as a ruling member of your dynasty, and mixes in your character's personal life into the mix with your strategy gaming. Many events will pop up about your character making choices in regards to their spouse, children, friends, and enemies. This gives you a personal attachment (good or bad) to your character as well as others, making each playthrough even more unique.To conclude, I'll bring up another plus: The modding community. Mods have added minor tweaks as well as moved the game into the fictional universes of A Song of Ice and Fire and even The Elder Scrolls. They add even more replay value to a game that will keep sucking you back in no matter what. Thanks for reading.			"

												Take a Total War game. Remove the RTS elements. Improve on the political elements. That's essentially what this game is.Edit: Ok, that may be simplifying things down, but it is really really good if you like Total War games for the politics. There's more than just that, like a religion system, inheritance, and intrigue plots. It's really complex at first but once you get the hang of things you'll enjoy the depth of all the menus and events.			"

												Lie to your spouse, betray your liege, murder your own family - all in a day's work for any CK2 player.  This game is a wonderful tool for educating one as to why it is that sociopaths always rise to the top and the world is run by scumbags... and it does it by putting you in their shoes and making you stare into the Nietschean abyss of human ambition until Machiavelli himself would say ""Yo, Darth Scumbag, dial it back a bit, ok?""You know that you've truly started to get into CK2 when you look at Geoffry Lannister and think ""He's not such a bad guy.  Heck knows I've done worse.""  You're halfway there when the ghost of Alfred Hitchcock appears to you and starts applauding.  Eventually you'll start calling guys like Francis Underwood and Kaiser Soze ""boring amateurs.""  You will begin to question your own morality, your own sanity, having to tell people that ""Hey, it's just a game.""  Then one day your jerk neighbor with the annoying dog gets arrested on an annonymous tip about the drug stash that you paid off the garbageman to hide in his garage and his dog discovers a two pound chocolate bar in it's food dish.  Then, and only then, will you realize that CK2 has made you a better person.  Yes, better.  Stronger, more determined, free of the constraints and burdens of lesser people.  Their silly morals and ethics have made them weak.  They deserve to be conquered by someone with more ambition, more intelligence, more drive.  Someone like you.Three job promotions, one new house and two unsolvable missing rivals later you sit back and realize that buying CK2 was the best decision that you ever made in your life.10/10 - I regret nothing.

												""Crusader Kings II"" is an unfortunate name for a game that is SO much more than the title indicates. CK2 is a history simulator that takes place during various times in the Middle Ages (700-1400 AD). It is also a Medieval role playing game, with clear elements of Dungeons and Dragons implemented throughout.I have never played a deeper, more intricate, and more sophisticated grand strategy game than CK2. Every time period represented has (an ever-growing) map of the ""world"" (Europe, N. Africa, India, C. Asia). The map is incredibly detailed and full of different cultures, and even better... you can pick just about ANY ruler you wish (ranging in influence from Emperor to lowly Vassal). Some favorites are Charlemagne (esp. for the detailed, historically accurate drama that plays out during his life), Rurik (viking founder of Rus/Kiev) and King Alfonso VI of Leon (the Tutorial character!). At the moment, there are ~8 ""time bookmarks"" that one can select when starting a custom game. It is stunning to see the world map change so much between each interval. What this means for you is an almost endless amount of variety. And you will undoubtedly learn a lot about history in the process (I know I did).As if this isn't already enough, CK2 takes things one step further by being an RPG as well. It's kind of like ""Civilization meets Dungeons and Dragons."" In CK2 you ROLEPLAY your chosen ruler... while still managing and expanding your realm (and techs) like you would in Civilization. Every character in the game has a set of D&D-like base stats: Diplomacy, Martial, Stewardship, Intrigue and Learning. On top of this - and also like in D&D - every character has a number of personality traits (like Genius, Cynical, Ambitious), as well as personal ambitions (have a child, see kingdom prosper) and a personal focus (War, Carousing, Seduction). The  secondary traits I mentioned (of which there are MANY) are of course linked to your core D&D stats (e.g. Martial determines how good you are at War, Learning ability comes with Genius, Diplomacy is needed to be an affective Carouser).Some character traits are set in stone from birth. Others can be earned/loss through how you RP your character. Or through luck. Or questing. Or by precious relics in your inventory/vault.And let me just say... that there many, many opportunities for RPing. You can always go looking for it yourself... say by starting your OWN crusade... or by making one of your Dukes the Court Jester so he tries to break away from your kingdom... or by secretly joining a Satanic cult that gives you superpowers (like Summon Familiar). This last part is where CK2 diverges from history/reality a bit... but who cares! Mideival history is more fun with D&D superpowers!Look, I could write a more lenghty review of this product... and feel like it deserves one... but the simple take-home message here is: if you are a fan of games like Civilization and like RPGs set in Medieval times.... THEN JUST BUY CRUSADER KINGS 2.Oh and get most of the DLC as well...Yeah that's the only downside to how this works. Vanilla CK2 is lacking some of the things I mentioned (like joining cults). Paradox is constantly expanding the depth, breadth and replayability of this game by slowly releasing DLC. Ok, whatever. Just accept this. Then go ahead and load up on DLC. It's frequently on sale for 50-75% off.			"

												This is perhaps one of the best strategy games in modern age. While the in-game tutorial is somewhat lacking at best, that should NOT keep you from purchasing this incredible game. There are hundreds upon hundreds of written- and videoguides that explain every single aspect of the game. True, it has an immense learning-curve, but if you take your time and sink a few days into it, you definetly WILL NOT regret this purchase - i know i don't, and i have over 200 hours logged.TL;DRDon't come into this game expecting to dominate the feudal politics with open warfare alone. This game takes time, once you get to grips with the basics, this game is insanely addictive.			"

												THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO, before the dawn of man as we knew him, there was Sir Santa of Claus, an ape-like creature making crude and pointless toys out of dinobones and his own waste, hurling them at chimp-like creatures with crinkled hands regardless of how they behaved the previous year. These so-called ""toys"" were buried as witches, and defecated upon, and hurled at predators when wakened by the searing grunts of children. It wasn't a holly jolly Christmas that year. For many were killed. A war-like race of elves from the Red Planet landed on the ice-encased Earth, and they were immediately enslaved by the unevolved Santa Ape to make his confused toys using galactic elfin technology. Toys were made into recognizable shapes and given names like ""train, "" but these toys were also thrown at predators and defecated upon because they were so stupid. Christmas still sucked, in a big way.			"

												Crusader Kings II: The latest entry in the Paradox Grand Strategy game lineup.    Unlike in most of Paradox's strategy games, you take control not of an entire nation, but of the rulers within that nation. If your ruler has no heir, it's game over. Duke, King, and Emperor are all well represented here. The base game starts in a pretty historical 1066 (the Old Gods expansion pushes it back to 876). However, once you unpause it, history is thrown out the window. Everything can change from there on out.     Once you are familar with the UI and pretty much all the features of it, which can take a while as Paradox's tutorial is not extremely helpful in that regard, you are ready to start a real campaign. You set the campaign goals, forma  specific empire or Dutchy, make your dynasty last to the end of the game, 1453. It's up to YOU.   Controling the leader is a nice change of pace as well, becaus eit adds an RPG like mechanic to a strategy game. Many things can happen to your character, and ultimatly death, and then you take control of his/her heir. The mechanics are fleshed out and deep. They feel meaningful. You need to have a reason to declare war, and a good portion of the time you only have claims to one province at a time. This makes conquest difficult, but rewarding a little more realistic than other Paradox games. The graphics are pretty good for a strategy game of this nature, where you are essentailly staring at a map waiting for things to change. The Clauswitz engien does well in that regard. All the artwork ingame is beautifully done and looks marvelous. In the end, the only thing that truly bugs me is the amount of DLC. Many of it is purly cosmetic and is not needed to fully enjoy the game, but they do add to the atmostphere. If you are to get any of the DLC make sure to get Sword of Islam, The Republic. The Old Gods, and The Legacy of Rome as those are the meaty expansion type DLC's. If you want a very ahistorical scenario pick up ""The Sunest Invasion"" to have the Aztecs bid for control of Europe as well in an alternate history scenario.Overall I give Crusader Kings II a 9/10.

												It's quite impressing game. Compared to Europa Universalis IV it is more focused on running your very own family business instead of ruling an empire. Nevertheless map is small then in EU it feels quite more into-depth when picking best mariage partner for your sons and doughters which will (hopefully) go on with your struggle to found an empire. Probably new 'Stellaris' will be a mix out of both?Waited long to buy this title, as I doubt it is a never ending progress with all that DLC out there. Catched a quite impressive bundle, but still 2-3 DLC's missing...well the newest ones, which I hope to get in a sale ...hm... the other year probably. What lately brought me into buying this was the impressive workshop with it's huge mass of very interesting mods. It starts with some UI and color changes, upgrades with items, mechanics, fantasy mods and others and results in complete conversation mods like 'A game of thrones' or Stellaris like 'Sci-Fi' scenarios, which pretty much change every aspect, including map, of the game. With my current ~20 hours gameplay I'm just playing arround to find out all one could do, but looking forward to start my very own dynasty next. :)			"

												This game is like crack, it's addictive and once you start playing it and actually learn it, you realize that there is no game better than this.The learning curve might be a bit hard, but once you get over it. Man, it is ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.Put countless hours in to it when it was new and bought every useful expansions pack (On sale, because I'm greedy).And all I can say after purchasing every useful expansion pack is ""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.""It has consumed me, I was only a mere shell of a boy until I played CK2, now I have aged into a man.I guess I have seen most of the Christian/Pagan messages by now, but for some reason I just keep playing as them because it creates new stories every time with different characters. It just seems to have endless gameplayAs said, I wouldn't recommend something that's bad, but this is unhealthy good. Meaning that once you master it, you will probably sit countless hours in front of your screen, marrying away your children, building a kingdom and a dynasty, killing some heathens, plotting to kill your wife so you can marry a younger one etc etc.My most interesting character was Borkvard who was ironically called ""The Blind"" who was a maimed master of intrigue and a possesed lunatic. He managed to revoke many of his family members titles simply by spying on them and finding reasons to arrest them. So he could blot them all to Odin, he already had kinslayer for killing the last reasonable kinsman to go against him so no problem there. The guys he decides to blot all begs ""Pleae Borkvard you can't kill me, we are family!"" to which Borkvard just went full nope and said ""It only proves my strong bonds to Odin"" and sacrificed all 3 of his kinsman and inheriting all their titles. And weirdly enough achieving his Paragon of Virtue ambition.He went on doing several mad things like the red turnips act and such, before long after he died of old age and everyone hated him. 420/69 why would you even need a life when you have CK2?

												Play this sh!t. It will never get old.You pick a family and just play those f*ckers over hundreds of years of a struggle for power in medieval Europe. The newest expansions make the timeline more than 600 years long, bruh. What's that? You want the freedom to murder any character in the game? You got it, son. Children? Babies? Yeah, dude, f*ck 'em! You want to start as a little one-holding minor lord anywhere in Europe, Northern Africa, and Western Asia, and try to conquer all of it? No worries. That's you. You want to just marry your family into power all over the place while you stay put in your strongheld territory? Yeah, man. You can do that sh!t, too. "

												Crusader Kings 2 is a truly marvelous simulator of medieval dinasties. It is very deep and complex yet simple to grasp in its basic concepts. It's very fun to play, mixing some RPG elements (you will develop a natural sympathy/hatred with all characters in the game) with strategical management of the map. Moreover, it's historically extremely accurate and detailed.I suggest this to everyone who has a minimum interest in the Middle Ages :-)			"

												Bought this yesterday on sale. So far I've been enjoying playing as an Irish Petty King (Duke) and conquering neighbouring counties.I've lost 2 children, almost went bankrupt for having to hire mercenaries to defend against a revolt led by my former marshal and vassal. And I got a nice looking welsh woman =V03/11 update: My first char died of natural death. His heir honored him by winning his war and becoming King of Éire! Now I'm plotting to kill a vassal that doesn't like me for the recently changed laws that give the Crown more authority. It's a woman, so the plot is completely justified.			"

												I really want to like this game.  I do, I really do.  But I just don't.  Maybe I just don't get it?  Maybe I spent too long trying over and over with the ""be a small duke in Ireland to learn the ropes"" suggestion.  Maybe one of the dozens of goofy DLCs would make it more palatable for me.I think it's just that the game experience winds up being extremes in terms of things going on.  I spend years sitting and waiting for things - getting a false claim so I can start a war, getting enough money accumulated to afford a war, etc.  You want to plot to kill a young heir so that you take their place?  Hope you don't mind waiting 10 years!  Then, once a war actually starts, 100 little nonsense notifications pop up - oh hey, you've got a major pitched battle going, could you arrange a marriage for me or assign a guardian for my child?  Maybe you want to seduce a random courtier?  Oh, and of course, once I get a groove going and have a ruler who works well with a decent heir and am making some progress, he takes a bonk to the head and is ""incapable"" - but then won't die, so I spend years unable to do anything.I think I wanted this to be Medieval 2 Total War with deeper interpersonal dynamics and it just isn't, it's a totally different sort of game.  Was worth the $10 I paid on sale, but glad I didn't pay more.  Not saying you won't like it, but I definitely did not.			"

												This game is fun enough and fills a nice niche for people who want to play a grand strategy. I cannot recommend it, however, due to where the development team spends their time. Please take a look at the number and price of DLC available for this game. It's obvious that the dev team has continued to spend a lot of time working on this game. However, the core game itself could use a lot of improvement. The interface is confusing, especially when you're trying to establish relationships (education, and especially when attempting to match people for marriage). This is a very character-based game, however the search function for characters is dismal. Very frequently the search function does not provide full results for the query you provide, and doesn't offer options such as searching within a specific empire, kingdom, duchy, realm, or county. Should you attempt to look for people by looking at characters and seeing their relationships (family, vassals, etc) you are given very little useful information about those characters unless you click on them and make them your primary window, when it would be much more useful to the player to have a choice of views that would include stats and traits as a list of multiple characters. Finally, probably originally intended as a way to deter frequent loading of previous saved games, the ability to load games once you're actually playing is quite painstaking. There's no way to quit to the main menu without first resigning a game, and then loading a saved game takes 4 clicks when 2 should suffice, and the saved game information provided is minimal, even with a full screen preview prior to the 4th click.Perhaps if the devs were making efforts to improve the core game's interface somewhere amidst pushing out dozens of DLCs I would be more apt to recommend this game, but as it stands (especially with purchasable DLCs being advertised to you in-game) I cannot.

This is the most enjoyable game I have on steam for how random things can become if you let them happen, I like to play games on the brink of destruction of your destiny with a basstard child of yours. Its just a great game fully recommend. If you have trouble playing this game please comment if your new to the game or recently bought this amazing game. Other than that thank you for reading and have a nice day.Also why I use basstard is not just fish joke but it is tickling Valves fancy-son *grammer checker* anywho have a nice one.			"

												5 hours in and I finally finished the TUTORIAL!You read that right. 5 hours. For the tutorial.That is not a negative for me. That is by far one of the biggest positives in a game I've had in a while.This game is layered like the world's biggest onion. The amount of micromanagement in this game is definitely something for the record books.And the lore! The lore is rich, detailed, abundant--and most importantly--factually correct. If history class/social studies approached the material in the curriculum like Crusader Kings 2 does, I most certainly would have paid more attention in school. =PI've read the base game itself is woefully incomplete, and that the developers of CK2 have a penchant of nick-and-diming the player for content patches. That's really unfortunate, because an aggressive DLC model of a 40-60$ game is just plain rude and almost shows a sort of indignation towards the player. Every patch has minor mechanics (yet essential none-the-less) that should not be sold for 20$; we're being charged largely for an increased lore canon, which, in most games, I'd have no problem with (unless of course it cost 300$ like the canon in CK2 does). I do have a gripe with it in Ck2, however, because we're essentially being charged an arm and a leg for anecdotes on world history. I find that particular business practice to be offensive, but at the same time the developers deserve to be compensated for their hard work. Unfortunately, 20$ per dlc is like George R R martin charging you 20$ every time he wants to add a new chapter to the last Game of Thrones book, and so I refuse to pay full price. I suggest you do too. Instead, look for the DLC bundles through secondary sellers and save yourself your hard-earned money.If you're an impatient person, CK2 is not the game for you. I'd only really recommend CK2 if you're a history and strategy buff, and only if you like reading. And I mean, really like reading . This game is just one giant history text book and requires constantly poring over lengthy passages to learn complex gameplay mechanics (as well as character histories, opinions, etc), all while trying not to run your dynasty into the ground. Good luck! ;)			"

												Very deep game with interesting gameplay systems, marred by a lack of polish and a really bad UI.- After four years of development there's still no way to assign a title to someone from that region's details view, you have to do it the other way around and select the character first! Makes assigning vassals to conquered land sooo tedious. And that's just one example. One wonders why they don't let you export/import that stuff so you can edit it in LibreOffice Calc or Excel, it would actually feel better. <troll> Just provide a CKII skin DLC for those programs </troll>.- The much-touted roleplaying elements are nothing more than a bunch of dialog boxes. And they do love to obstruct your view by spamming dialog boxes. You know some games like Civ 5 have a better way of presenting updates to the player, right guys?- The combat isn't particularly interesting.- Doing anything in this game is typically a lot of work, often for little reward- The Youtuber/Streamers that seem to have fun with this usually exploit the system to the max, exploits that Paradox then takes out of the game, often without a proper replacement. Don't expect to have fun like them.No matter what you do, unless you love frustration don't play the William the Bast.erd start where you have a big army and go after England. The game mechanics don't support this scenario well neither from a gameplay or historical point of view, and the devs haven't made any effort to make it better since the game's release. You've been warned. (Curious? The game will usually snatch your victory from you just as you were crushing the last English province. Your King allies with your enemy and cancels your war, no option to rebel despite technically having your own kingdom now. That's the usual outcome of the suggested starting scenario... thanks Paradox, know what we'd like instead of more DLCs?)As an aside, I don't like Paradox's new policy of releasing a bunch of DLCs along with free patches. It means that feature introduced in one DLC can't interact much with others, and that they're unlikely to get revisited later. Please go back to the old ""patch-expansion"" model we were used to with Hearts of Iron III... people think they can pick and choose and pay less now, but they don't realize what they lost along the way. Newcomers, in particular, who get the base game for the cheap to try things out, will never know if they disliked their experience because they just don't like the game, or because it would have been better with 200$ of DLCs. A bit steep, to try a game the average gamer is statistically likely to dislike? And forget the refund policy, you need more than a hundred hours to make your mind on this one, not two.Despite my dislike for this game I might come back to it. So many people defend it as amazing that I can't help but wonder if I missed something or I just didn't experience the right scenario. But even if I discover it it will have been at the cost of close to 100 hours of my life, not sure that's worth it.Heck, if the idea is ""make your own fun"", I'm pretty sure I've had exponentially more hours of fun and satisfaction with a soccer ball, purchased for a small fraction of this game's cost.

												It's funny how many Paradox shills here keep reusing the same arguments.""But you spent over xxxx hours on it""""DLCs aren't a must, you couldn't play non-christian character X since the release of CK""CK2 has the same problem as Kerbal Space Program: The game is run by incompotent and greedy developers.There are so many flaws in how the game mechanics work and contrast to history we know IRL (see: Iqta government), yet Jewhan actually has the guts of seperating the main DLC from its music, potraits and unit models.Paying 15$ for a bunch of copy paste provinces to the south, with the information tweaked of the characters from Wikipedia? Writing a few scripts so a text with an image can come up to give you more piety? Yeah, clearly alot of effort went into these DLCs, especially if you compare them to the Warhammer mod.Also, isn't this game called 'Crusader Kings 2'? So why can't we play the other side of the crusade, unless we pay 10$ for it?Alot of people argue that this is because muslims weren't playable from the start.That's the most pathetic excuse I have ever read on Steam. So I could just release a fighting game where you can play faction x against faction y, but I charge extra so you can play faction y yourself? Even though all of the fighting moves were already in the game?You don't have to be a developer to know how easy it must've been to insert all these ""new"" characters and change some attributes.Summary: The developer intended to not release those unplayable religions from the start and locked them, so he could find a better date to release them as DLCs.

All of the vital decisions your leader must make, all of the stats of all of the characters you must manipulate, all of your armies, taxes and laws. I cannot play this game, because I cannot read it.  Without UI scaling, I cannot read this game on my monitor.  And for that reason, I cannot recommend this game.

												I regret I sank too much time into this black hole of a game.  CK2 when everything boils down to it is essentially a university student's biology simulator but with medevil politcs survival instead of plants and animals competing.Oh it started so well, but patch after patch, dlc after dlc and the game's been shackled to a CPU load whether you bought the extras or not.  Great way to sell you the stuff because it's right there up in your face in game but after the Rajas of India expansion no one could deny the devasting effects of Paradox's business model.Today the final straw broke the camels back.  Got bored so I reinstalled to see how things went after very very long hiatus and low and behold the one and only great saving grace: Crusader Kings 2 Plus mod (CK2+) was pulled from steam workshop along with zero activity on GitHub and the others after July.  In conclusion, I may never play another Paradox game again unless it's well under.Congratulations Paradox on a job well done screwing us over!

In one playthrough, starting from 867 finishing in 1452 I went from a Duke in Norway to being the Emperor of Scandinavia, having a vast portion of Europe at my control. It was a long emotional rollercoaster that lasted 70+ hours.If you're into Risk-esque game, this is for you. It's hard to get into, but once you're in you're there for good.

												This is a Paradox game - a probably eeriely complex strategy game, if you never heard of them before.You probably need dozens of hours to learn the game, after the tutorial, and you will lose your first games, because there is some connection between two datas you weren't aware of.To be successful, you will probably have to micromanage a lot. You should read the wiki  (www.ckiiwiki.com/Crusader_Kings_II_Wiki).If this doesnt frighten you, you can have hundreds of hours fun with this game, be it with building the biggest and baddest empire, be it with the smallest lord just to survive. It can be a challenge - if you choose the right lord -, impossible, or a walk in the park (after you learn the game, of course...).I have my fun building an empire from scratch, micromanaging everything from my family to the buildings in my demesne and conquering everything around me, as soon as I can. But this game allows a lot, so search for your own purpose in the game, and allow for the randon number generator...I love it.			"

												Good game for anyone interested in grand strategy. While the battles in the game literally consist of assigning commanders to flanks and watching the numbers of each side drop, the depth of every other aspect of the game more than makes up for that area. To be honest, with enough skill and manipulation (say, manipulating people off a balcony or over a cliff in a carriage) of other characters you could probably get away without fighting a single battle and end up with a sizeable realm.Like other Paradox grand strategy titles, this one has a particular focus: characters. CKII is much less about the lands than the people who rule them, which can make the game a challenge from beginning to end. It doesn't matter if you're the King of France if you're a new incompetent person who everyone hates! This is both a benefit and a hindrance, and make for much more interesting gaming. With one character, you might be leading Crusades and expanding your realm: a sudden death and you're fighting tooth and nail to hold onto your titles.Another good aspect is the scale. The number of characters playable, from 1066 to the 14th century, is virtually endless. This gives the game great replay value, and lower ranks like Dukes are stillvery interesting to play provided you make use of the full range of backstabbing ploys and traitorous acts available to you in various forms.The only issue I have is the prevalance of DLC, required to play groups like Muslims, Pagans and Republics. This means that in order to get the full CKII experience, you do have to stump up a lot more than the £30 original price.Overall, good game, well worth the money, excellent replay value; don't go expecting explosive action, though. The best (and worst) of CKII is hidden under the cloak, so to speak.			"

												After eventually becoming king of Ireland, I stamped out any and all heresy I could find, enfored absurdly harsh tax laws, married my sole daughter off to a hunchbacked lunatic in order to get a foothold on the kingdom of Scotland to begin my conquest (and further my goal of conquering England altogether), murdered three entire dynasties with hired assassins to create a power vacuum in order to stake my claims and was then poisoned to death by my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ grandson at the age of 67 (most likely because I had his mother imprisoned for her infidelity, also she was possessed by the devil).

												If you enjoy cerebral strategy games, I can't recommend this enough.  The mechanics are often complex, and the learning curve is pretty steep, but the game community is super friendly and willing to help explain things.  As far as cost goes, this game is a great value and is very replayable.  I have 200+ hours invested so far.			"

												Where to start? My steam stats aren't helpful, because I originally owned the GamersGate version of it and only recently had it migrated to steam. Nevertheless, I would estimate that this is the single game I've played the most since its release a couple of years ago.2 important things have been the main contributors. The 'roleplaying' element is strong in this one. Taking the heritage of the original Crusader Kings, where the characters and their family relationships, rivalries and complex courts helped shaped the success of your dynasty in its rush to acquire titles, CK2 has let the concept blossom. You interact with characters - whether those in your own court and demesne or other families and title-holders, plotting against them, marrying them, sending assassins to help a title pass closer to one of your dynasty. There are lots and lots of events, random and semi-random to guide the freeform story taking place.Secondly, Paradox have a fantastic DLC/update structure in place. Supported by paid DLC of two types, they have improved the game for two years already (and going strong for more), adding new mechanics and refining old ones. Major DLC usually involved adding a category of playable characters (originally only Christian feudal rulers available), but many of the core mechanics have just gone into the patches which have been going strong all this time. Cosmetic DLC has also been good and now well-priced for a quid or so.It does take a little bit of effort to get into, and a Let's Play from youtube is highly recommend to get started, but if you're up for some personality-laden strategy, I don't know why you haven't already given this a go?!

If I had my list across genres this would be up there with Masters of Magic, Master of Orion, Civ4, Wing Commander 2, Warcraft 2, and WoW in terms of a game that just keeps bringing me back to it time and again. The replayability on this game is simply amazing.  You can play as any lord of any land in the middle ages, and if Paradox didn't put the land your looking for in there.....just Mod it to add it in!!!The modding community both from other players and even from the developers is phenomenal on this game and you absolutely MUST play the Game of Thrones and Elder Scrolls mods.You can get ahead by virtually any means possible: marriage, construction, espionage, war....you name it. This is THE game to play when you want to experience guiding a family through the ages.The learning curve is steep (I'm told, I was a CK1 vet so this was actual much easier to navigate for me), but very worth it.

												Plotting to murder your uncle, King of Bohemia, has never been more fun! CKII is a grand strategy game without any clear goals except for those you set for yourself. Take control of a mayor of minor family in medieval Europe and see how history plays out. I advise to role-play a lot and make decisions based on the traits of your character, since it will make for some ""interesting"" situations which will provide new challenges. It's a great improvement over CK1 in nearly every aspect, and especially concerning the interface: it might very well be the most accessible game Paradox has ever made, although the learning curve is still quite steep. Expansions are also well worth it, since they allow you to play previously unplayable factions. Also highly recommended for fans of Game of Thrones, since the politics in this game remind me a lot of those books/show (and what do you know: there is actually a GoT mod :)			"

												Crusader Kings II is one of the best strategy games ever.  I have been a fan of strategy games since the glory days of the mid 1990's, but I have not played a strategy game more than this one.  It has a fine balance of playing with politics and war that no other game has.  I love how there is no main goal for any particular playthrough, besides ensuring the survival of your dynasty.  You can choose any random area and play as that areas main character and their dynasty.  Unlike the Total War games and games like Civilization, there are no cheap moments where you can be allied with someone and then the next turn get attacked out of nowhere.  You have to have a legitimate reason for your actions in this game and more than anygame, I look forward to the fallout of mistakes I make.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is a strategy fan.  There is a bit of a learning curve, but once you understand how the game works, it is pretty awesome.			"

Except there is no end-goal besides the goals you set yourself. The only way to end the game is a) lose or b) reach the end-date.I personally love starting out as a count in Norway, and strive for the welfare of Norway or the Empire of Scandinavia. Plundering heathen England is always fun, converting Spain to the Norse faith and conquering Rome for good measure.Every time you start the game something different happens, lead your dynasty to greatness or ruin, it's up to you.And a word of warning, this game will steal hours of your life.

												Easily Paradox's most accessible to date. Despite this ease of access the game  is deceptively deep. A game of characters, where empires and kingdoms merely present the background; where the goals are inherently  personal, and can include merely trying to usurp a minor barony to establishing your family's hegemony over Europe.  A game where you won't blink an eye at murdering your incompetent family members, scheming rivals, and the occasional anti-pope, all in the name of ""the realm."" A game where marrying off  your club-footed, inbred children to lowly lords to secure their allegiance is met with much praise. Totally awesome.			"

But be careful, this is extremely complex and can be pretty confusing if you don't know what to do. If you love complicated game mechanics and history or you just want to be a king, then you should get this game, regardless of if its on sale or not. *By the way: CK2 also has mod support. (I strongly recommend the A Game of Thrones mod, where you can play as any character from George R. R. Martin's A Song of Fire and Ice series. Its probably the best mod for this game, though its more of a conversion than a mod.)			"

												When I first bought CKII I played it for 10 minutes after completing the tutorial, the game needless to say is most probably the most complicated game I have ever played and after watching numerous playthroughs on youtube and tutorials I felt ready to dive back into it. From my game hours you can probably see I got the hang of it finally, that's the worst thing about CKII its horrible to learn and feels like a chore at first and requires quite a bit of patience but once you get the hang of it the game is amazing. CKII is nothing like any strategy game you have played before, sure games like Total War introduce a couple of characters and familys but nothing like what CKII does having thousands of unique characters of different cultures, religions and goals makes this game what it is. I can honestly say that I have done many playthroughs of this game and each time it feels like a new fresh experience. The beauty of CKII is the fact that it doesn't force you to be huge or rich or have a brilliant military, in fact the game has nothing to do with your nation, it is about YOU. Your character, your family, your choices. Playing a minor count in ireland and marrying into the Capets, rulers of france and then killing their family until your son is the new heir to the french throne feels brilliant. Or if that's not your thing you can participate in the mass scale crusades to win back the holy land(Jerusalem) and become its new king. The huge amount of decisions the game lets you have to achieve your goals is brilliant. That's the other great thing about CKII it is YOUR goals, the game doesn't tell you what to do it leaves it all to you, do you want to conquer the world? Try. Do you want to just survive? Go ahead. In conclusion Crusader Kings II is probably the greatest strategy I have ever played to this day and I don't see that ever changing. 10/10, Plus it has a huge amount of mods to give you more replayability.

The only way to end the game is a) lose or b) reach the end-date.I personally love starting out as a count in Norway, and strive for the welfare of Norway or the Empire of Scandinavia. Plundering heathen England is always fun, converting Spain to the Norse faith and conquering Rome for good measure.Every time you start the game something different happens, lead your dynasty to greatness or ruin, it's up to you.And a word of warning, this game will steal hours of your life.

												Easily Paradox's most accessible to date. Despite this ease of access the game  is deceptively deep. A game of characters, where empires and kingdoms merely present the background; where the goals are inherently  personal, and can include merely trying to usurp a minor barony to establishing your family's hegemony over Europe.  A game where you won't blink an eye at murdering your incompetent family members, scheming rivals, and the occasional anti-pope, all in the name of ""the realm."" A game where marrying off  your club-footed, inbred children to lowly lords to secure their allegiance is met with much praise. Totally awesome.			"

												If I had to identify the major roadblock to me enjoying grand strategy titles, it is the inevitable surging creep of the game getting harder and harder to manage as the game goes on. I'm not saying this is bad for everyone, but I find it hard to enjoy a game that is actively trying to destroy everything I've built and done for the past several hours. Imagine if you had to maintain your builds in minecraft against decay.Crusader Kings II is my #1 Grand Strategy title and one of my favorite game of all time because the gameplay doesn't have the difficulty creep. From the very moment you get vassal counts to the end game where you control entire kingdoms spanning Europe, the management of your Kingdom remains more or less the same, just increasing in quantity. Instead of having to constantly deal with everything trying to collapse around you whenever you want to expand, you face the same trials you've always faced. For me, it allows both an immersive, somewhat challenging, time-consuming experience, but without the intense frustration found in similar titles.As for the positives of the game, you not only get to rule a growing realm, becoming more and more powerful and facing the changing political situation of the map year after year, but you get to play a character and his family, worrying about keeping everyone happy so they all go along with your grand vision of world conquest. The mechanics of battle are a tad simplistic, but there is more than enough to keep you occupied as you avoid river crossing and trying to find the appropriate terrain to defend on, all the while trying to occupy your enemies lands and preventing him from doing the same to you. Religion plays a major part of the game, whether you are a Christian, Muslim, Pagan, or Jew. Keeping yourself from being excommunicated or avoiding high decadence is always a challenge for the most experienced player.If you're looking for a Grand Strategy title having been frustrated with the genre for its overly challenging difficulty curve, I'd recommend CKII in a hearbeat. Perhaps not right for every gamer, it's still a fantastic title and if you are remotely interested in Grand Strategy, Management Games, or History, you should pick this up.			"

												Paradox are well known for their ambitious scope when it comes to making games and what experience they have at doing it too.  CK2 is certainly no exception and their best yet in my opinion.  I love the medieval world as a historical setting so for me, this makes CK2 the best game by Paradox yet.It is a true mammoth challenge that has endless possibilities.  Admittedly, the mechanics and controls are complex and take a while to getting used to but once you get your head around it, it's remarkably straightforward.  For those critics out there who say CK2 is overly complicated, may I suggest it's not the game for you for there is no way to create a game of such incredible depth without some initial complexity.  However, if you have the patience to overcome a few difficult hours of learning the ropes, then the rewards are infinite and the stories you can create are truly fantastic, funny, horrific and unforgettable.The DLC has added even greater depth and variety to an already marvellous game and the variety of Mods available are fantastic too with some notable highlights being a Game of Thrones and Elder Scrolls mod.This game certainly appeals to a certain type of gamer and won't be for everyone but if it's your kinda game, then get stuck in and say goodbye to countless hours of your life as you chart the highs and lows of your feudal characters and try to create a house to equal the Borgias!

												This game is some of the most fun I've had in a long time. Speaking as someone who enjoys the total war series as well as many other strategy titles, this was a great, great buy. It's very much a strategy game (don't expect *to* much depth to the combat), with a myriad of different options available to your characters depending on how you play. Want to win via subterfuge? Then marry your sons and daughters off right assisinate off anyone in their path to the throne. Want to win via conquest? Come up with spurious claims to their territories and invade by land or sea. Gain piety and ask the pope for invasion privelege. The game is very open ended and the mods only make it even better. The latest patch (old gods) has added in looting and pillaging (and more beards) which although I haven't had much chance to play around with is great fun and an extra dimension. A great, great buy if you like strategy, with a good community behind it.*Edit* - The new expansion brough me back again after some time away and I can say that after 150+ hours invested in this game, it's one of the favourites in my library. The endless myriad of options that are presented as you play through combined with the many many different ways to play and objectives you can make for yourself make it a game you can just play again and again. 11/10, will play again :)			"

Spending in-game decades trying to fortify some tiny cities, only to defend yourself from overly powerful neighboring areas.

												Crusader Kings II is a very entertaining game. While actively managing and (hopefully expanding!) your nation you must  also be prepared for the future in several ways-most notably you must have an heir. Marraiges are very important and often vital to a nation's security and success. Firstly marraiges with foreign princesses or powerful nobility provide strong alliances. Additionally, your descendants may be able to pursue the claims of the spouse marrying into your dynasty, if the right conditions occur. However, you must besure to evalute the traits of a wife/husband, not just their background because marrying a character with severe defects such as slow or imbecile, can ruin a dynasty's plans for several decades.The different time periods, regions, and rulers you can play as provide a lot of variety. With paid DLC, you can play any character ruling in 769, 867, or anytime between 1066 and 1337. These characters' families can be played up until 1453. Also with the appropriate DLC, you can play as a character of any of the in-game religions. This means chacaters located from Scandanvia to India, and Mongolia to Mali. Even without any extras, you can play almost any Christian character between 1337 and 1453.While the game is complicated enough to take some getting used to, after a few hours you should be able to get the hang of it. So don't let the learning curve keep you away from the game! Besides, if you ever have questions about almost any aspect of the gameplay, information is avalibleonline-especially at the game's Wiki (<http://www.ckiiwiki.com>). If you do end up purchasing the game, different strategies and situations should be enjoyed to their fullest extent!			"

												Crusader Kings II wasn't my first foray into Paradox's grand strategy games, but it's definitely the one that got me actually into them. The game is very intricate with many nuances, yet manages to be reasonably accessible to a new player without spending hours upon hours learning the very basics. And once you've scratched the service the game is totally addicting. It's very rare to be able to genuinely say it, but no two games of Crusader Kings II are alike.My first attempt at Paradox's games was Hearts of Iron III. It was the most appealing time era for me and one of the more recent ones at the time. But it was quite an experience for a newcomer. I played the tutorial all the way through as recommended and got a rudimentary idea of how it worked. Even after 15 hours I felt like I had no idea what was going on though. There were no graphics, there were too many units, too much going on all at once. Even if the AI could be turned on to handle details of the game you didn't care about, just one section felt like a monumentous task on its own. Everything was just a number, it was totally detached even if it was interesting. Compare that to this game, where you are just one guy. One guy. Maybe you own one county, maybe you own an empire. But in the end, the game is about your character and his family. There are plenty of decisions to be made still, but they're more top level - ""What do I want to do and how do I want to do it"", not three tiers down. You spend more time on the plan than the actual execution of the plan, which is what I would expect from a game that bills itelf ""Grand Strategy"". You're the king of the castle, the executive of the company. Knowing the intricacies of your empire works to your advantage most certainly. But it is only an aide, not a necessity to execute your plan if that shines any light into the accessibility.But that's not the only draw. The game also has character, something incredibly difficult to do with regard to faceless nations. You are your king. You live life. Good things happen. Bad things happen. You never know exactly how things will turn out. Sometimes your king will live till 50. Sometimes it'll be 70. Maybe he'll get murdered or sick. Maybe he'll abandon having an heir for a life of celibacy. Or maybe he'll go completely insane. Your king, his family, and the relationships with his vassals is a very pivotal part of the game. Bribe, manipulate, persuade, it feels just like a political position when you're in charge of a large empire. It adds a layer of immersivity that maps of Europe simply don't have. The uncertainty of life is very real in this game.If you are someone who had been turned off from Paradox's other grand strategy games I would highly recommend picking this up. There are so many different things to do and unique ways to play in the intricate simulated world of Crusader Kings II. I'm utterly hooked on this game and can see myself putting 1000 hours in it with all the DLC.			"

This game had me rubbing my face due to being overwhelmed so quickly.  I must have started the learning scenario over about 10 times.  At last after not giving up!!!!  I'm taking over cities, castles, and churches!  I'm plotting and killing anyone in the way of my Crown!!  I'm crushing armies and claiming their lands!!!!  What?  You don't want to marry me?

												This game feels like an almost perfect Game of Thrones game where you play as Tywin Lannister, planning and scheming on taking over control of the world.Pros: Emphasis on family breeding and conquering new lands by marriage and assassination! This game is all about developing your family, its power and influence. You carefully arrange marriages. Firstly, to ensure your heirs would get the best genes. Secondly, to install your family members on thrones in neighbouring counties, duchies and kingdoms. This takes great patience, planning, and some luck as well. Often you will have to assassinate other rulers or their heirs to achieve this. By the way you'll learn weird ways the different inheritance laws work. Why is it important to install cousins, nephews and other kinsmen on thrones in other ""provinces""? Because the same family name grants you an eternal military alliance and even lets you to join your domains easier in the future (with a marriage, of course). In dynasty we trust!Also, sometimes you will have to kill your own family members, or help your sons in impregnating their wives. All to ensure the only right line of succession :)Inner working of a kingdom, with sovereigns, vassals and their warsBeside the above you will of course raise armies and battle other rulers, but its mechanics in the game are somewhat simplified. Realism is amplified by the addition of factions; you may revolt against your sovereign along with other vassals, e.g. against an inheritance law, or to install certain person on the throne.Cons:Time consuming searching for bridesThe game interface is a bit coarse, although better than in the previous installment of the series. I mostly whine about the problematic in-game search engine for characters, used mostly to find brides and grooms. It should let you specify more options for the characters you seek. Instead, you can choose some basic options, and then you have to sort through a ton of people. Probably most of the play time I spend on searching, so it is an important feature. Fortunately, it's still not able to spoil the fun of managing your dynasty :)Bugs on Linux version The game is still buggy on Linux. Some players report that disabling the launcher they implemented months ago solves the problems, some don't. Recently my game would crash to desktop every several months, without any symptoms, so I had to switch to Windows to continue playing without constant whining.DLC plague – “hey, let’s add a bunch of new functions to the game, and put each in a different lovable payable DLC!” Paradox' greatest sin is its DLC policy. Most of them are simply NOT WORTH ITS COST. They usually add one significant function to the game. The latest - Way of Life - claims to add ""hundreds of new events"". I bought it, played it, and highly doubt it! Before you purchase any DLC, ask on the web which are definitely worth buying!Not enough of diversified music tracksThe music tracks for different culture groups are few but very atmospheric. Although, after 200 years no matter how great they are, listhening to them just becomes tedious. Of course most of them you have to purchase in separate DLCs...Conclusion:All in all, this is a perfect idea for a game, and an imperfect implementation of that idea, though the best (and only?) one I know. You love GoT and Tywin Lannister? Quickly buy it!			"

												Crusader Kings II is a Medieval kill-all-infidels-and-die-from-the-plague-em-up, and it's a pretty solid game by itself although I would strongly reccomend getting the following DLC:The Old Gods (because everyone needs a little human sacrifice in their lives)Way of Life (because you get to seduce your sister and become a crazy fanatic possessed by the devil but that's okay because you're a master boardgamer!)Legacy of Rome (because the pope can go suck on my Byzantine nuts)Sword of Islam (because kebab is stronk (until the pope decides to attack))and maybeRajas of India (because who doesn't want control over an IT Tech Support Empire)With that said, It must be said that this game has an insane learning curve curvier than yo' mama and the tutorial won't teach you anything. The way to learn to play is by checking out some let's plays on YouTube or by simply learning for yourself.This game's strong point is with it's RPG elements and the way the story of your dynasty plays out. The objective of the game is to make sure your dynasty survives until 1453 and getting as much prestige and piety along the way. You can play as any earl/duke/king/emperor from Europe to the Sahara to the Middle East to India to Eurasia from the mid 8th century (if you have the Charlemagne DLC) to 1453. You play as one person and when said person dies you continue playing as their heir, but if your heir is not of your dynasty or you don't have one, then it's game over. A sure way of getting as many heirs as possible is by being a♥♥♥♥♥♥and legitamising as many of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s as you see fit, however this does lead to bitter rivalries among your children.Despite trying to keep your dynasty alive, there are no real goals and this is where the RPG elements shine through. You can play as an earl and work your way up through the fuedal system to king/emperor, you can expand your lands and become king or emperor, and my favourite is playing as Byzantium and setting my sights on restoring the Roman Empire and mending the great schism (which is why you need Legacy of Rome plus some other features it adds to Byzantium). You can also plot to kill people, ♥♥♥♥ your cousin, care for your family, ♥♥♥♥ your cousin, learn the secrets of the stars, ♥♥♥♥ your cousin, and you can ♥♥♥♥ your sister!If you're a history nerd like me you will have endless fun with CKII and if you're also into the Renaissance and early Industrial Era then you should also pick up Europa Universallis IV and get a converter so your CKII save can go directly into EUIV, which is nice.10/10 - would marry my sister again			"

												I don't recommend getting the standalone ck2 unless its on a very good deal or/and you want it for the game of thrones mod. Otherwise all those dlc will cost you a small fortune. Youre better off waiting for a bundle with most/all the dlc to be on a promotion.As for the game itself, it's a highly detailed world, fascinating chains of events can occur. Because it's literally intriguing it can be very addictive but the weird thing is, most the time i dont actually feel like i'm having that much fun! But i want to find out what's going to happen and how my decisions may alter things. That's not to say it can't be fun, but this game has other qualities. It is a bit of a gem.			"

												Crusader Kings 2 is what one would consider a deep end grand strategy, where to suceed one will need to learn the game system thoroughly, and the execution of advance plays will only really occur once the player has emersed themselve in countless hours of gameplay. Although it has a military style, most of the gameplay is centred around intrigue, and the tactical aspects of warfare is not explored. It focus highly personal interaction between a liege lord and its vassals, and stability and advancement depends highly on one's ability manipulate, assasinate, and plot, with the end result being reinforced through open warfare. It is a very deep game worth exploring for those who fancy themselves as strategist. A draw back to the game is the extensive amount of DLC valuing up to $160, the concept of game content has been vastly commercialised, and many producers tend to sell great games in parts. In my mind the concept of DLC should just be as the term says, downloadable content, content made by producers to improve the dynamics of the gameplay should the player choose to download it. However it should not be charged. Or content that could be unlocked via gameplay, however payable to be unlocked if the player does not have the time to pursue such a path. Considering how most of the DLC does not add significant content to the game, and it could really only be considered extra spice, it should really come as a patch. What should be charged and payable by the players are expansion packs, by definition a package which changes the gameplay signinificantly, to the point where the game does not play the same. Such a significant incremental build up can reasonably be valued to atleast half the game's retail value, a good example for this is the Sims 3 series. To conclude, Crusader King 2 is a deep strategy game for fevent strategist. However, its dynamics has been mared with improvements to game via producers coming in as payable DLC as oppose to traditional DLC which is free of charge; and is the producers way of saying thank you for joining us. Still a great game, have sunk 450 hrs, would recommend.			"

												One of my favorite games. This is a strategy/history game, based on Medieval Europe. Unlike other grand strategy games, you don't  control a country, but a single character, in control of a county, duchy, kingdom, or empire, between 1066 and 1453 AD. You don't directly control much, and must manage your court, and your demesne (counties you rule), for prestige. The game is primarily spent telling armies where to go (battles are automatic; you do not control them!), engaging in diplomacy with other leaders, constant conspiracy, and marrying your sons and daughters to wealthy nobles. It's quite a good game, with extremely unique mechanics, and I imagine it would be great on multiplayer! +Great, Original Gameplay, combines Civilization with The Sims.+Political Intrigue feels Engaging and Real+Great Soundtrack-Can be Tedious at Times, Particularly Marriages-DLC is greatly overpriced.

												A lot of negative reviews based on DLC.   Don't believe the hype.  This game is immensely enjoyable in its vanilla form, and worth every penny at full price.  In fact, I think the vanilla is probably worth double full price, it's that deep.  I have over a hundred hours in and feel like I could easily put in hundreds more without tire.  This is the grandest of grand strategy games.  I personally don't mind the DLC format in this instance, as the vanilla game is so full.  The DLCs are available to customize your experience if you so choose.  Whether or not they themselves are worth the price, I cannot comment on, but I haven't felt at all limited by the base game yet.			"

												Graphics 7/10 It's a strategy game so you are not supposed to stay zoomed in really close. From a distance I guess the graphics look satisfying but when you zoom in they don't look that good.Gameplay 9/10Crusader Kings 2 is a game about the life of a king and his dynasty. It's a pretty difficult game on different levels. When it comes to war, it can get pretty hard. When I first got the demo sometime last year, I sucked so bad at the diplomacy and war. When I got the game for Christmas last year, I got better. I would recommend that you try as a count, then a duke, and then a king. If you are terrible at war, I would suggest you focus on other goals.Replay Ability 8/10I would say that replaying the game a few times would be fun but there is one problem. You play as characters who actually existed (there is a Wikipedia link for each char) and when you play the game at a certain time there are the same characters. Changing the time could work for a little bit but you still eventually run out of choices. There is a DLC called Ruler Designer where you can customize your character but there is a problem down below.DLC and Expansion Packs 5/10Imagine buying a pizza and all what you get is just one simple cheese pizza and when you want toppings to make a variety of tastes they ask you to give several dollars. Well, that's what the problem with DLC in this game is. There is even a DLC that costs 15$ when it does not even have enough content.Modding Community 8/10The modding community is good. There are some mods that do some well adding to the game like CK+. There are some mods that crash your game or threaten to do so. Overall I would recommend some mods. I would like it if they made an extended timeline mod or infinite timeline.Game Price 6/10So this is a game that has been around for 3 years and is still $40? At this point I'd say it should be $20.Multiplayer 8/10I am more of a single player person but the multiplayer in the game is fine.Bugs/Glitches 9/10The game runs very fine. If your event holder is filled with events, it could slow down your game. AI's do tend to act weird occasionally in a way I can't explain. But try not to worry about bugs.Audio 8/10The music is good even though it gets pretty annoying after a while. The only other problem is the death scream. It's so friggin annoying. But I remember seeing a mod that replaces it with a sad violin tune. I guess everything else is okay with audioFun 9/10 (This states my opinion on the game)I really like this game it's just so addicting. I like how it's basically you are basically making your own history so I would recommend it to anyone who likes grand strategy and especially medieval history.Rating: 77/100Tip: Don't play this while someone is behind watching you.

												I have had hours of play time from CK2 and the DLC has extended that no end. The game is a macro simulator of European Aristocratic life in the Middle Ages. That sounds super boring but it incredibly fun, plotting and scheming to inherit titles of your rivals or marrying your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ son of to inbred courtiers. The depth of this game is amazing. I would recommend it to anyone interested in 4X genres. A word of warning, going to war is not the focus of this game, so those interested in micro simulations of battles (similar to the Total War series) might be disappointed.			"

												For me, this game is perhaps the most gripping medieval political simulation I've ever played. Hours upon hours of my life have been invested in this game, estimated more than 300 hours before I converted my copy to a steam copy (gamersgate gave me a steam code for it and all the dlc I had). Deep and engaging diplomacy that requires one to have a strategy, lest your short term gains be spoiled by a disloyal vassal, jealous relative... I once even had my ideal heir murdered by my second wife so the first son I had with her could be my heir. Plot your way to the top of feudal power and entrench your dynasty in a historical sandbox. With all the DLC available that enables the player to play lords of pagan, muslim and jewish faiths, the EU IV converter DLC that allows you to take a game from the end of the dark ages to the early 19th century; this game is an absolute must own for any lover of history and political simulations, or even people looking for a empire management game with rpg elements.20/10			"

												Its been an uphill battle getting my friends onto this game, and I completely understand why. The amount of information tossed at you puts old school text games to shame, A very specific but overloaded UI will take you a very long time to understand all the features, and 10x longer figuring out how everything influences everything else. The claims can be very shallow, and at a certain point I stopped giving a ♥♥♥♥ about royal blood lines and it became more of a breeding sim looking for the best traits, but at the end of the day if you take your time and have patience with this game you will have countless hours of fun. I know alot of people will want to rage quit the second they die and their empire falls apart because they didnt set up heirs properly, or when they lose a duel they should of won easily, but alot of that is the charm of the game just at its worst. Worth buying if your patient enough to learn to love it.			"

												Totally boring, not worth buying at all.In all seriousness, Crusader Kings 2 is a great game hampered by Paradox's poor DLC scheme. The base game is definitely playable and definitely still fun, but you'll be missing out on many years of content that Paradox has unfortunately locked behind a paywall. Even without the DLC, you'll find yourself saying things like ""I need to kill my second son to make sure my inheritance doesn't get split!"" and other things that'll make your friends think you're a psychopath.Multiplayer sessions are incredibly fun as well, though the game lacks drop-in multiplayer, necessitating a save-and-load if someone needs to join.I would highly recommend this if on sale, as the game regularly goes on sale for at least 50% off, if not more. Otherwise, it's a fortune for all the DLC.			"

												So this one time I managed to get my family running all of north europe. My second cousin decided to murder my children, and then me. Another time I was playing with my wife to show her the game, I died within 2 years and was then playing as a baby who was being cared for by her welsh betrothed! Yet another time I decided to imprison as many foreign women as possible to turn them into my concubines - what's that? A new lady in the dungeon? Step aside slaves, this one is MINE.I thought I was an ethical, or at least decent person. This game changes all that. How far will you go to secure more power? How many babies of your own will you smother? How many mass sacrifices must be performed? Anyway, if you like playing games that are a database with a sweet GUI - please, please buy this game. Be warned though, there is an insane learning curve. Like, mega mega mega - so be prepared to get killed a few times. Anyway, 11/10. Best game on steam. Would buy again.			"

												If I was only able to play one game for the rest of my life it would be this game.  One of the drawbacks of grand strategy games is that they have the tendency to feel mechanical and isolated.  CK2 is one of the few games in this genre that does not suffer from this problem.  Its RPG elements put a human quality to the game.  You have a character you choose a wife, you have kids and you raise them up.  Instead of staring at numbers or faceless hordes of identical troops you are dealing with family members and rivals who have a face and a name.  That being said the game still includes a heavy elements of classic grand strategy.  You can conquer the world, and become the biggest empire.  The diference in this game instead of being loyal to a country you are loyal to a dynasty and a family.  Your motivation is not nationalistic conquest but to secure your dynasty in the world.  This mixture of elements makes for an addicting experience and one that is unique on every playthrough.			"

												I've played about 20 hours of the regular game and... its ok I guess. I prefer Victoria 2 or EU3 honestly.What makes this game simply amazing is its potential to be modded. Crusader Kings 2 hands down has the best mods out of any Paradox grad strategy game, and I'd argue that its a top 10 contender for modded games or games to enjoy with mods.My other 300+ hours have been in the Game of Thrones mod which is simply fantastic. If you're going to play this game, you have to try that mod at some point.My only complaint of this game compared to Vicky or EU is that its much more RNG heavy. I've found myself far too often stripped of meaningful control and have my nation fall apart to one or two silly events. This simply doesn't happen in the other grand strat games- you have more control of your nation in those.			"

												Here we go... Finally I am reviewing a grand strategy game. First off, I just want to say that this game is definitely NOT for everyone. Due to the learning curve of the genre (more on that later), this game will inevitably have haters, but this is okay. Personally, I absolutely LOVE this game. Everything about it is just simply amazing. In this review, I will talk about pretty much everything that is important about the game.	First off, let's talk about the least impressive part of Crusader Kings II: the graphics. They are decent, and do the job. The map is more detailed than in any Paradox game before this (excluding Sengoku), and is actually pleasing to look at. The models of soldiers and your council members on the map aren't too great either, but once again they get the job done. There are map modes which essentially display information to the player through colors/words on the map, and these are incredibly useful. It should also be mentioned that the interface displays a lot of information, and can be a bit overwhelming for the player.	 Now, on to the good stuff. The music is simply incredible. I love video game music, and honestly I have never heard a soundtrack like this one before. If I made a person who wasn't a gamer listen to this music, they would never guess it was from a video game. It is hard reviewing music, so just Google the soundtrack. Paradox was awesome enough to upload the whole soundtrack to YouTube for your listening pleasure, so what are you waiting for? Also, Paradox included the soundtrack in the game's Steam directory, which was incredibly kind for them to do. Before moving on to the next topic, I should also mention that the main theme is simply incredible. It plays when the game loads and on the main menu. The first time you hear it, you will inevitably get goose bumps.	While the previous things add up to an amazing experience, the most important part of any game is its gameplay. Explaining the gameplay would literally take me all day, so I will sum it up in a few sentences. Essentially, you play as a feudal lord (either a count, duke, king or emperor) in the timeline of 1066-1453 (the starting date is pushed back to 867 if you have The Old Gods expansion). Yes, the game is long, and can last for over 30 hours easily, and with all of the DLC there are over 1000 different characters on the map of Europe and a bit of Africa and Asia you can play as, all with different dynasties and play completely differently. Also keep in mind that the game has completely random events, which means that every play through is different and unique in its own way. Also, this game is a sandbox: you make your own goals. You win by essentially getting to the end date, which is  rather easy to do, so you can almost do ANYTHING. One day your wife can become pregnant randomly. If you already have a son, you might want to plot to kill your wife so that the child isn't born, and therefore cannot become jealous and kill your heir to the throne. This is just one example out of many thing that will happen to you in Crusader Kings II. Honestly, CKII is the void of ethics in almost every single way. You can either be the nicest guy possible, or can be the cruelest ruler anyone has ever seen. The possibilities are nearly endless, and you can spend hundreds upon thousands of hours in the game. At the time of this review, I only have about 30 hours in the game, but I can definitely see myself playing hundreds of hours because I feel I have barely touched the surface of this game. While all seems good so far, the game has one major flaw: the difficulty curve. I came from Europa Universalis IV (another fantastic Paradox game), which has a much easier learning curve because the tutorial is amazing, so I was able to adapt in about 5 hours. For someone that has never played a grand strategy before, learning this game will take a lot of effort and time. The in game tutorial is terrible, and the player will have to read forums and watch videos on how to play. If you want my advice, the Crusader Kings subreddit (r/crusaderkings) has a great tutorial on it, and it is the shortest one, too. If you have a friend that knows how to play the game, I am sure they would be happy to teach you how to play. One more thing I should talk about is the DLC. There is a lot of DLC for the game, and if you can I recommend buying the Crusader Kings II Collection. It doesn't actually come with all the DLC, so the important ones that you will also have to buy are The Old Gods (pushes the starting date back and allows you to play as the Pagans), Rajas of India (adds Indian nations) and Sons of Abraham (adds Jewish nations). If you have Europa Universalis IV, you should also get the save converter which allows you to easily export your game to EU4, allowing for even MORE gameplay!tl;dr - Crusader Kings II is an amazing strategy game that is will keep you hooked for hours at a time. I'd highly recommend it.			"

												The complex social kingdom world domination game!  In reality this is a deep empire builder while with a steep learning curve, it's large array of tutorials really help to get the most out of whatever social position you find yourself in.  Building your family dynasty takes time effort, and sometimes a bit of forced luck.  Definitely a keeper for the future this is the most epic strategy game for all those who love the genre, better than EU series due to the social relationship model that drives the game. Historically based before the EU timeline, and savegames can continue into the new era with EU.While cheating helps you learn the game mechanics, infinite gold will only get you so far because, now with new 'iron-mode' the game has achievements and it forces you to stop cheating.. which is fine! Because in this game the enjoyment comes from the challenge and the defeats as much as the victories.Well rounded, long playlife, this game is truely epic, historically accurate enough to keep the gameplay plausible and all new DLC a must to collect.Strong recommendation to buy, hard to disappoint if you like strategy, depth and intrigue 98/100.

												This is a rich, complicated game that sits at the intersection of many rich, complicated things: centuries-long empire building, tangled soap-opera relationships, and medieval role-play. There is always something going on, always something interesting to do; as with Sid Meier's Civilization, it's hard to find a good moment at which to stop playing—despite the fact that you control time in the game. Though its setting and complexity was intimidating at first (I'd suggest you watch playthroughs and tutorials on YouTube before starting), playing CKII is engrossing, rewarding, and results in stories you want to tell others.And I've yet to run it with any of the DLC expansions.

												Outstanding game. A grand strategy that captures the Medieval period like no other. Very easy to learn and the focus on individual people more then the realm you rule over makes this very unique among strategy games. If you've ever wanted to play 'Game of Thrones' this is the title for you; There's even a complete Thrones conversion mod!Definitely pick this title up. You won't be disappointed!			"

												This is one of those few game that can't get a proper trailer. Why? Because it would be like trying to convey all the back-stabbing, scheming and plotting of the whole Game of Thrones or House of Cards into 2 minutes of video.That's what this game is about: Schemes, convenience marriages, assassination, eugenetics and vengeance, all carefully lined-up over several years, even decades of in-game time (hours and hours of gameplay), most of the time to see it all crumble under a low-handed AI political movement, or an obscure medieval succession law (like the one that says ""the daugther with a son takes preference over the older, son-less daugther"").There is war, battles and conquest, yes, but they are reduced to a bare minimum. The important part is your excuse to go to war: You need to have a motive, such as enforcing the claim of one of your nobles over a certain duchy currently owned by a rival king. The fun comes from get your hands on nobles who have that claim, for example, bribing your rivals heirs so that they'll come to your court and marry one of your daugthers.If you like political intrigue and a non-fantasy medieval setting, you can't go wrong with this game.10/10			"

												I'm someone who's not easily entertained and doesn't have fun doing much of anything. I still had fun with this game though. It simplifies doing what would be a horrifying atrocity in any other context down to a math problem of navigating game mechanics. In the tutorial, I completely ignored what I was instructed to do, killed my brothers to become the king of Leon, Castille, and Galicia, and then killed my sister's husband before seducing and marrying her. I immediately died and the realm passed to my now one year old incest baby who was able to achieve the reconquista 400 years early as well as conquering half of north Africa before he died at the age of 80. The realm was split into three following his death, but it was cool because one of the sons worshipped satan so everyone was just kind of okay with him being executed.TL;DR : Good role-play elements coupled with interesting character interactions amount to a great game where you play as a medieval dynasty. However, the DLC policy can make the pricing a bit prohibitive, definitely wait for a sale if you're wanting to buy in.			"

												You can probably add about 200 additional hours to the time listed on my profile. I bought this recently after having a ""review"" (ahem) copy for a while. What can I say that hasn't already been said? This game is like a hybridrole-playing/grand strategy game. You are roleplaying as a dynasty during the middle ages, and your goal is to...well, do whatever the hell you want to do. Want to paint the map in your country's preferred color? Check. Want to reform the Roman Empire? Check. Want to invite nobles to parties, screw their wives, and then assassinate them? Check. Want to marry your sister and sire inbred heirs? Check. There are very few things you can't do in this game, with the notable exception of declaring war on someone without a valid cassus belli. In short, the world is yours for the taking. Just don't be surprised if a giant green blob decides to alter your plans for world domination. Deus Vult!			"

												This is a Paradox game - a probably eeriely complex strategy game, if you never heard of them before.You probably need dozens of hours to learn the game, after the tutorial, and you will lose your first games, because there is some connection between two datas you weren't aware of.To be successful, you will probably have to micromanage a lot. You should read the wiki  (www.ckiiwiki.com/Crusader_Kings_II_Wiki).If this doesnt frighten you, you can have hundreds of hours fun with this game, be it with building the biggest and baddest empire, be it with the smallest lord just to survive. It can be a challenge - if you choose the right lord -, impossible, or a walk in the park (after you learn the game, of course...).I have my fun building an empire from scratch, micromanaging everything from my family to the buildings in my demesne and conquering everything around me, as soon as I can. But this game allows a lot, so search for your own purpose in the game, and allow for the randon number generator...I love it.			"

												If you're looking for a heavily detailed strategy game to get lost in, then look no further. Crusader Kings 2 is like an advanced version of Risk (advanced to a ballistic extent!) You not only have to manage the land which your dynasty controls, but the crazy politics within your own family (they will assassinate each other to further their own interests, including you!) At the same time, you have to manage many nobles fighting over land titles, all while watching your enemy dynasties, while plotting your own next move. Eventually, one way or another, your character will die. You suddenly control your new heir. How well accepted he or she will be will depend upon their traits and skills. This is why you need to marry wisely and assign your heirs (and possible heirs) to the ideal tutors. Your son could turn out to be a brilliant strategist, or a raving lunatic! You might find yourself in the position of having to assassinate your own son in order to protect your dynasty.Literally everything you do in this game involves risk, followed by clever management over the complications which result. This is a game for obsessive personalities, or otherwise those who enjoy intellectual challenges. It easily consumes your time, be warned!My only complaint, and it's not a small one, is that if you allow the game to update automatically, your saved games might suddenly be obsolete without downloading the latest beta version! This happened to be recently, and even after downloading it I still do not have access to my saved games! I spent many hours and much effort building my prolific empire, only to lose all of my progress! It's frustrating enough for me to not recommend this game! But all things said and done, I've really enjoyed this game and the makers put such effort into it that I feel this error in judgment (or glitch) should be overlooked. Still...holy crap. Whatever you do, DO DISABLE 'Updates' under 'Properties' and then be cautious when/if you should decide to update it.			"

												First of all let me just say that this game is the best strategy game I have ever played. No other game in which you control a civilisation or nation etc can come even close. The details and stories that come out of this game can be found in any review and give you ideas of just what can happen.The interface can be slightly tricky when you first start and it probably takes a couple of hours too truly understand the complex behaviour of other characters, including your own children. But you WILL get used to it and find it very well produced and easy to use when you get used to it. The look of the game is perfect, simple enough in some aspects (that can be modded) yet enough detail in certain map modes (there are about 8 different map modes that you will be using really) to make it very pretty indeed.Now for some stories...-Murdering your wife and son and banishing your daughter because your dad made you marry your aunt and your two children are inbred  8/10-Raiding the lands of the Holy Roman Emperor who gets super mad and declares a Holy war against you and your pagan people. Almost dead then converting to Catholicism and joining the HRE for your grandchild to then become the Emperor yourself and then converting back to Norse Pagan and forcing half of the Empire to convert too 9/10-Killing your disabled and wheelchair bound brother and then invading half of Germany because a fat German lass has taken pity on him and made spastic love creating an inbred devilspawn who somehow is the heir to your realm 10/10			"

												Totally boring, not worth buying at all.In all seriousness, Crusader Kings 2 is a great game hampered by Paradox's poor DLC scheme. The base game is definitely playable and definitely still fun, but you'll be missing out on many years of content that Paradox has unfortunately locked behind a paywall. Even without the DLC, you'll find yourself saying things like ""I need to kill my second son to make sure my inheritance doesn't get split!"" and other things that'll make your friends think you're a psychopath.Multiplayer sessions are incredibly fun as well, though the game lacks drop-in multiplayer, necessitating a save-and-load if someone needs to join.I would highly recommend this if on sale, as the game regularly goes on sale for at least 50% off, if not more. Otherwise, it's a fortune for all the DLC.			"

												So this one time I managed to get my family running all of north europe. My second cousin decided to murder my children, and then me. Another time I was playing with my wife to show her the game, I died within 2 years and was then playing as a baby who was being cared for by her welsh betrothed! Yet another time I decided to imprison as many foreign women as possible to turn them into my concubines - what's that? A new lady in the dungeon? Step aside slaves, this one is MINE.I thought I was an ethical, or at least decent person. This game changes all that. How far will you go to secure more power? How many babies of your own will you smother? How many mass sacrifices must be performed? Anyway, if you like playing games that are a database with a sweet GUI - please, please buy this game. Be warned though, there is an insane learning curve. Like, mega mega mega - so be prepared to get killed a few times. Anyway, 11/10. Best game on steam. Would buy again.			"

												This game can offer coutless hours of entertainment to the right audience. This game if for people with patience, and like strategy games. The beginning can be a bit complicated to new players and will probably take some time to get used to. But once you do, you rewrite history. Either as the Emporer of The Holy Roman Empire, or as a count in the Papacy. This game however focus more on people than the actual nation. If you are into the nation you should pick up Europa Universalis III or IV. The goal of the game is to lose though. Because where is the fun in guiding your nation from 867 (With Old Gods or Sons of Abarbham DLC) to 1453? There are countless ways to lose. How about you and your wife are not at that good of terms and you need a new spymaster and she has a good intrigue skill, you assign her and her think that this is going to be a start of a new relationship with her. A month later your wine tastes a bit funny... But you see what I mean, the game is not for anybody but for people who are intrested in making their own stories and political intrigue, this is the game for you.			"

												A very addictive grand strategy game with a very thematic in-depth RPG elements imbued. Unlike it's sibling game--EU4 where you shape your empire's future via policies, diplomatic, and military conquest, this game emphasizes on political intrigue to sustain your bloodline to rule over your realm. The game's narrative/story is driven by the game mechanics so every time you play you'll uncover and weave your own game story, sometimes hilarious and sometimes poignant.

This game had me rubbing my face due to being overwhelmed so quickly.  I must have started the learning scenario over about 10 times.  At last after not giving up!!!!  I'm taking over cities, castles, and churches!  I'm plotting and killing anyone in the way of my Crown!!  I'm crushing armies and claiming their lands!!!!  What?  You don't want to marry me?

												This game feels like an almost perfect Game of Thrones game where you play as Tywin Lannister, planning and scheming on taking over control of the world.Pros: Emphasis on family breeding and conquering new lands by marriage and assassination! This game is all about developing your family, its power and influence. You carefully arrange marriages. Firstly, to ensure your heirs would get the best genes. Secondly, to install your family members on thrones in neighbouring counties, duchies and kingdoms. This takes great patience, planning, and some luck as well. Often you will have to assassinate other rulers or their heirs to achieve this. By the way you'll learn weird ways the different inheritance laws work. Why is it important to install cousins, nephews and other kinsmen on thrones in other ""provinces""? Because the same family name grants you an eternal military alliance and even lets you to join your domains easier in the future (with a marriage, of course). In dynasty we trust!Also, sometimes you will have to kill your own family members, or help your sons in impregnating their wives. All to ensure the only right line of succession :)Inner working of a kingdom, with sovereigns, vassals and their warsBeside the above you will of course raise armies and battle other rulers, but its mechanics in the game are somewhat simplified. Realism is amplified by the addition of factions; you may revolt against your sovereign along with other vassals, e.g. against an inheritance law, or to install certain person on the throne.Cons:Time consuming searching for bridesThe game interface is a bit coarse, although better than in the previous installment of the series. I mostly whine about the problematic in-game search engine for characters, used mostly to find brides and grooms. It should let you specify more options for the characters you seek. Instead, you can choose some basic options, and then you have to sort through a ton of people. Probably most of the play time I spend on searching, so it is an important feature. Fortunately, it's still not able to spoil the fun of managing your dynasty :)Bugs on Linux version The game is still buggy on Linux. Some players report that disabling the launcher they implemented months ago solves the problems, some don't. Recently my game would crash to desktop every several months, without any symptoms, so I had to switch to Windows to continue playing without constant whining.DLC plague – “hey, let’s add a bunch of new functions to the game, and put each in a different lovable payable DLC!” Paradox' greatest sin is its DLC policy. Most of them are simply NOT WORTH ITS COST. They usually add one significant function to the game. The latest - Way of Life - claims to add ""hundreds of new events"". I bought it, played it, and highly doubt it! Before you purchase any DLC, ask on the web which are definitely worth buying!Not enough of diversified music tracksThe music tracks for different culture groups are few but very atmospheric. Although, after 200 years no matter how great they are, listhening to them just becomes tedious. Of course most of them you have to purchase in separate DLCs...Conclusion:All in all, this is a perfect idea for a game, and an imperfect implementation of that idea, though the best (and only?) one I know. You love GoT and Tywin Lannister? Quickly buy it!			"

												Man what can I say about this game, I played quite a few of paradoxes game but this is magnus opus in my opinion, there just enough strategy, a wee bit of intrigue. To be fair I think what people love about this game this is the closest you can get to playing the game of thrones without having your throat slit like half the characters of said series.My only main complaint is that achievement are obtained in Ironman mode.

												One of the finest games of its type. Once you get a handle on the admittedly initially complicated mechanics, it's a very deep story generator that will lead to tons of stories nobody who hasn't played this game will understand. But you will, you'll always remember the time you destroyed France via seduction, and marched with the Pope on holy crusade to India, while also defending against the Norse Caliphate.			"

												I came to this game from EU4, which I adore. Both games have their strengths, EU4 as a Grand Strategy/Map painting game, CKII as a slower, more intimate killing experience. Obviously they're extremely different in many, many ways. I don't recommend picking up one just because you like the other, though they do both share the same high quality I've come to expect from Paradox.I've been having a lot of fun playing the game so far, and I'm very satisfied with my purchase. The DLCs are nice as well, though they mostly just unlock features rather than add them, I don't get the idea that they're as ""must have"" as the EU4 ones.If you're looking into buying this game but have never played anything similar, I recommend doing your research first, it's nothing like any ""blockbuster"" game out there			"

												Playing with history is always fun, and with Crusader Kings II, players get a whole lot of depth into managing a slice of Europe--but with much left to the imagination.CK2 is, by far, one of the most engrossing grand strategy games. Not only is there the standard war and conquest, but CK2's intrigue system is also extremely entertaining. It's also particularly enjoyable to arrange royal marriages so that, somewhere down the line, you suddenly inherit a bunch of land and then poof: you're a Petty King. For me, the fun in CK2 isn't micromanaging your state. It's about creating a world within your head with characters whose fates are in the hands of the game.			"

												I'm a big fan of Paradox's Grand Strategy. CK2 has been a lot of fun for me, especially with a few pieces of DLC.Manipulating dynasties while keeping an eye on your own adds a layer of complexity that takes some getting used to, so I recommend going into the game without the ""my line will last 1000 years"" mindset.Other than that, like most Paradox games, there's a tricky learning curve, but once you get the hang of it CK2 is a ton of fun.

												This game can offer coutless hours of entertainment to the right audience. This game if for people with patience, and like strategy games. The beginning can be a bit complicated to new players and will probably take some time to get used to. But once you do, you rewrite history. Either as the Emporer of The Holy Roman Empire, or as a count in the Papacy. This game however focus more on people than the actual nation. If you are into the nation you should pick up Europa Universalis III or IV. The goal of the game is to lose though. Because where is the fun in guiding your nation from 867 (With Old Gods or Sons of Abarbham DLC) to 1453? There are countless ways to lose. How about you and your wife are not at that good of terms and you need a new spymaster and she has a good intrigue skill, you assign her and her think that this is going to be a start of a new relationship with her. A month later your wine tastes a bit funny... But you see what I mean, the game is not for anybody but for people who are intrested in making their own stories and political intrigue, this is the game for you.			"

												After spending countless hours playing the game, I truly believe I am prepared to write a review for it. The variety of scenarios that are available even with the vanilla game truly astounded me. You can play as hundreds of different dynasties, and you can experience millions of different lives. This game is probably one of the best in this decade, and I definitely recommend it. Even then, there are many DLCs which can enhance a player's game, especially The Republic DLC which provides the player with a new dynamic in which they must earn their family's inheritance of titles through popular vote. In addition to the mods which are provided by our very own Steam community and other parties, the game truly replayable.			"

												Playing cooperative Crusader Kings II is like sitting down with your friends to play Let's Pretend. It's an endless gold mine of interesting stories, amusing decisions, and surprise events. The learning curve is very steep as far as normal game standards go, but there are lots of good learning resources online, and once things click, the experience is very rewarding.CK2 is enjoyable when played solo, but play it with friends if you can. You'll never know how entertaining it is to tell the story of your character's pilgrimage to Mecca until you actually do it. Leave your son under your friend's tutelage and get ready for some horror stories about how he's bringing up the child. This game serves up the drama like nobody's business.It's amazing and very, very entertaining. Highly recommended.			"

With all it's good and bad traits which influence your rule. Just the other night my renowned polish king, who won every war he started, including two crusades, got his head smashed in on a battlefield somewhere near Jerusalem. Instead of dying heroicly and letting his son take over, he actualy survived and gained the trait ""maimed"" and ""incapable"". My king now sits on his throne drooling and staring vacantly ahead while my Spymaster, who happens to be a deceitful hedonist and a hunchback, is helping himself to my titles...Man, I love this game.

Not only does it have a suprising amount of historical accuracy, deep gameplay (game's only minus in my book is that it's hard for newcomers), and extremely moddable. What does that mean? Frankly that this game, while being the best European medieval simulator out there, is also through mods the best GoT/ASOIAF game since the Game of Thrones mod for this game is amazing, and nearly overhauls the whole game, giving you two games for 1 price. This game is a no brainer for anyone with any kind of historical interest or fantasy.Logged 500+hrs so far, and is by far my favourite game of all time, being both a huge fan of history and Paradox's Grand Strategy games			"

CKII, unlike many strategy games, is more about the legacy you leave behind. one minute your the Duke of York the next you ascend the throne of England itself. just as your getting comfortable the the pope calls a crusade and being the good catholic, you raise your banners and take 10,000 troops to the holy lands, after much blood shed and death you win through and are granted the crown of jerusalem...... you hand out the hard won titles, retaining the best for your own family. A year later it all changes, your assassinated (by who knows), your son is too young to rule, and thus recieves a relationship penalty with your vassals, they do mot like weak rulers. civil war breaks out. a jihad is called and your far flung kingdoms are under siege. you loose your foreign conquests unable to defend them, you loose your crown of England, and your duchy is taken..... your left with a single county...... but always ready to react, to rebuild, to take revenge you bide your time for the next bout of turmoil.

I believe this game is worth 40$ but if you could wait to get it then do it. Wait for a sale because it is better to get the game & the DLC than just the game.

												Extremly addictive and complex game. Rise in power through diplomacy, war or marriage. If your character dies, you will continue to play as your heir, so make sure you have one! And since it is also a mini genetics simulation, try to make sure to breed nice traits into your family. If you like even more complexity and war, have a look at Europa Universalis IV!			"

												This game is big. I mean, it is huge. If you are worried it has too much for your liking, you are quite probably right. But then again, as individuals, we are known to acquire tastes that we might not first envision having and that is actually a nice thing; it keeps our experience of life fresh.CKII is one of my acquired tastes. My strategy background is basically age of empires and warcraft. I never really liked the concept of games that give you a big schematic map, to mess around with abstract numbers and statistics to guide your empire. I always liked the rather personal, down-and-dirty action of RTS and the hability to arrange buildings and troops in creative ways aligned to my aesthetical likings. I have never played a game like Civ, because turns+maps really seemed to take away everything I actually liked about strategy games. I, rather inadvertently, started to enjoy some of the more ""abstract"" strategy games through the Total War series. I bought it because of the real time battles and never really intended to play the campaigns due to the turn based quality of it. Only after I finally lost interest on the general purposeless quick battles I begun to play a grand campaign just to give my battles some meaning and, what can I say; I actually begun to enjoy the turn based genre almost as much as the RTS of my childhood. When I first learned about CKII I wasn't very sure about playing a game without any real time battles and troop commanding I  grew up with. To jump head-on on a game that was pure number-crunching (in my opinion at the time) was more akin to a leap of faith. I really only bought the game because it was medieval and I like all things medieval; so why not give it a try, I thought. How happy I am I did.Yup, the game is pure map view, no real time battles (not in a AOE or Total War sense) and no little units to order around building things, but it is still one of the most personal, immersing and satisfying experiences I ever had with a game. How Paradox Interactive managed to do that is no short of pure genius. You do not play as some god-like ruler who wills something into existence, rather, you play as character on a world full of similar characters with all sorts of aspirations, ideas and skills. You are guiding not a nation, but your estate and your family through a very dramatic time in history where everything could be lost with badly arranged marriage. You will feel like some medieval Godfather, looking out for your family  (dynasty) and making decisions that most of the time will get some of the members angry at you, but all in the greater interest of kingdom and your dynasty. Its not a game where you loose your capital and you loose, or where they kill you and game over. It is a game where, wherever someone with your blood is alive, there is a chance that you can build everything from scratch; provided you are cunning enough. It is this focus on individual characters and their traits that make the game so personal and immersing. It is not uncommon to actually feel good when your heir is a very skilfull administrator to continue guiding the empire after your demise, nor it is unheard of people actually making some serious soul-searching after murdering digital babies in order to inherit someone elses kindgom due to lack of heirs.Bottom line is: the game is huge, it is overwhelming at first and visual panache is not its thing. If you are looking for something other than that, do buy this game and give it an honest chance. It is quite probable that you will play nothing else for some good 40 hours after things really get going and you are totally absorved by all the intrigue, plots and political chaos this rich virtual medieval europe throws at you.

												So one time I was playing as the king of Kiev, then I died. Now I am playing as my 3 year old daughter. I was playing with three of my friends in multiplayer (And thats one awsome thing, this game has multiplayer!!!!) and it was all going well, none of my vassals really hated me as a 3 year old Queen, until... about 3 text boxes appeared. I paused the game to read them all. I'm not much of a reader, I read the entire first one, skimmed the second one, and all-out didnt even read the last one..damn, was that a bad idea. That last one said something, Still I dont know what it said, but suddenly all of Kiev was gone! Kiev was now part of Hungary (One of my friends was king of Hungary at the time, too). If only I read what that letter said I would still be Queen of Kiev and not a peasent of Hungary. But, I still love the game and I ended up just saving, leaving, and joining back in but as a diffrent King...It was fun.			"

												So when I first played this game, I had no idea what I was doing. But I carried on and picked things up as I played and it started getting good. I got this for quite cheap and the DLC for much cheaper when they went on sale and it gives you so much choice for who to play as in the world. (One thing that I don't like about the character creation is how limiting it can be with the +/- factors, it'd be best to only put the cap on if you wanted to play Ironman mode). But what I like is that there's always something going on in the world, and that all the little decisions you make can come back to stab you in the back, and how each individual person has their own agenda and how some much is interlinked, it's really not as hard as you think once you play a short while, you can always look at a let's play on youtube or something like that too if you're still stuck. It's really weird to watch history unfold differently, like Norway fending off William of Normandy for the English throne, the Byzantine Empire expanding into Eastern Europe and even to Africa and watching the Norse take over Scotland, Ireland and Wales; every game is different, as is every character. There's some great high's in this game, like reforming a heretic or pagan religion, establishing a new kingdom or empire, winning a huge civil war and watching neighbours get torn apart whilst you just take what you want from them, but there's also lows, like being raided, your own children trying to kill you, dangerous factions in your realm and ambitious neighbours. But, you gotta take it how it comes in this game and deal with it as best as you can, one day you'll have finally pleased all your vassals and united your lands and everything's good, then you die from depression. Boom. You're the 6 year old girl that inherited your fathers throne and you've got vassals eyeing up your lands and wanting independence and you've gotta get it sorted before the ultimatium letters arrive. There's also a tonne of really great mods on the workshop and online, like Lord of the Rings, The Elder Scrolls and Game of Thrones that turn it into literally a huge DLC. You can even name your children and holdings to whatever you want. Can't say I've played any other game that lets you imprison a new born baby or blind an old woman ;D			"

This game does have a huge learning curb and it should not push you away at all. Once you learn how to play the game there millions of ways you can go upon playing this game. Watching Arumba on youtube really helped me learn the game and hes really entertaining If you need help watch his videos. overall I would give this game about a 9 out of 10 worth every penny if you can get it cheaper the better!!!!

												Out of all the Paradox games -- this one is probably the most creative. Sometimes playing HOI or EU, I do wonder about the people, technically, guiding my world, what they're like, what they're up to and this game is a near-perfect, like, perfect iteration of that -- only in Medieval times. The gameplay concept is so good because it's so true. Commonly in history, it's really only a handful of people that actually steer where all of this goes --and the strings, both overt and covert, that pull them in all directions-- you play all of that. The politics, religious interactivity, the wars of all kinds: petty sucession disputes to all-out, globe-spanning Crusades/Jihads  -- and all the day-to-day stuff any person could find themselves involved with: decadence, love and romance, raising children, making friends and killing said-children so your preffered heir reaches the throne...normal stuff -- all of this is rolled together in one of Paradox's most impressive games to date.

												Paradox are well known for their ambitious scope when it comes to making games and what experience they have at doing it too.  CK2 is certainly no exception and their best yet in my opinion.  I love the medieval world as a historical setting so for me, this makes CK2 the best game by Paradox yet.It is a true mammoth challenge that has endless possibilities.  Admittedly, the mechanics and controls are complex and take a while to getting used to but once you get your head around it, it's remarkably straightforward.  For those critics out there who say CK2 is overly complicated, may I suggest it's not the game for you for there is no way to create a game of such incredible depth without some initial complexity.  However, if you have the patience to overcome a few difficult hours of learning the ropes, then the rewards are infinite and the stories you can create are truly fantastic, funny, horrific and unforgettable.The DLC has added even greater depth and variety to an already marvellous game and the variety of Mods available are fantastic too with some notable highlights being a Game of Thrones and Elder Scrolls mod.This game certainly appeals to a certain type of gamer and won't be for everyone but if it's your kinda game, then get stuck in and say goodbye to countless hours of your life as you chart the highs and lows of your feudal characters and try to create a house to equal the Borgias!

Spending in-game decades trying to fortify some tiny cities, only to defend yourself from overly powerful neighboring areas.

												As an avid fan of grand strategy games, this is the one i would recommend to get if you are new to the genre. To me Crusader Kings II is a game about creating interesting stories. I'll elaborate:The most interesting moments in this game usually are so random and unexpected, that when you tell other people who play CK2 they will be genuinely interested and intrigued by them. It really feels like anything and everything can happen. It is total chaos. Sometimes EVERYTHING goes wrong, for instance your heir turns out to be an ugly midget homosexual who inherits the Holy Roman Empire and everyone hates him so much that the Holy Roman Empire just falls apart. Learning curve wise it is a lot simpler than the EU franchise or god frobid, Hearts of Iron, but i feel that speaks more to the complexity of other grand strategies. It will stil take your at least a week to get most of the mechanics down. It might even take longer. This leads to the final part of my review - the expansions. This game features a plethora of great expansions that truly change the pase of the game. They add more interesting mechanics and make the game even more interesting, . I'd recommend getting the entire shebang of major expansions as a bundle when it's on sale. It's definitely worth it. Overall i think this is a great game and it gets even better when you play with friends. If you like complex strategy games and empire management, i think you will love this. :) "

												As far as grand strategy games go, it's hard to beat Crusader Kings II. The scope, replayability, and emergent narrative are the best in genre, bar none.The base game allows you to start in 1066 or later. When you start, you will select a character of Count, Duke, King, or Emperor level. Difficulty varies by the specific situation that your chosen character begins with; the game can become extraordinarily difficulty, or very easy based on how many vassals/hostile neighbors/raiders/hordes you'll have to face.The basic gameplay consists of making decisions about your dynasty (marriage, murder, education, etc), managing your holdings (cities, temples, castles), politicking (gaining positions of prestige, arranging political marriages and alliances, placating vassals), and making war (pressing your claims, participating in Holy Wars/Crusades, fending off raiders.)Each of the above systems forms part of the mosiac that you will paint with your characters through the generations. When your character dies, you will hopefully have an heir with which to continue your dynasty; you will then play as your heir, and so on... for several hundred years.The game's pace is somewhat slow - you'll spend years arranging marriages, fabricating claims, and gathering strength to press those claims. Your armies will take time to move from place to place via land or sea. You will need to think at least two steps ahead and put the pieces in place for the coming years, and generations, so that your dynasty can rise to greatness.Map control isn't the end-all, be-all of this game; rather, the specific decisions, maneuvering, and exploits of your family are. If you want detailed battles, like Total War, this is not the game for you: combat is largely abstracted into troop types (light infantry, heavy infantry, archers, light cavalry, heavy cavalry, special units), their moral, their commanders, and the terrain on which you are fighting. Once a battle has begun, your only real choice is whether or not to attempt to retreat (usually a bad idea.) Combat takes place in real-time, and can take several days of in-game time to resolve.Notes on some of the DLC that I own:-Charlemagne: Brings the start date back to 769; this is a lower-tech beginning compared to the standard 1066 start date. This allows you to create custom kingdoms and empires. Highly Reccommend.-The Old Gods: Allows you to start in 867. If you want to play a badass pagan viking, this is the start for you. Highly Recommend.-Legacy of Rome: A Byzantine Empire-focused DLC pack that introduces more events, allows the restoration of the Roman Empire, and mending of the Schism. Most importantly, it enables retinues across all factions - these are standing, professional armies. Highly recommend.-Way of Life: Allows you to make more life-choices for your current character as you play. Highly recommend it.-Horse Lords: Allows you to play nomadic steppe peoples. Makes the Silk Road a factor. Moderately recommend.-Sons of Abraham: More Holy orders, more religion based events. Moderately recommend.-Sunset Invasion: Aztecs invade you late in the middle ages. Can be interesting, but not a common choice among the community.There are dozens of unit packs, portrait packs, heraldry packs, and music packs. I recommend the specific versions of these for the faction you're playing, if you want immersion.All in all, Crusader Kings 2 is one of the most polished, engrossing, and interesting grand strategy games I've ever played. It really is a Game of Thrones simulator (and there's even a Game of Thrones mod available if that's your flavor.)			"

												Crusader Kings II is a very entertaining game. While actively managing and (hopefully expanding!) your nation you must  also be prepared for the future in several ways-most notably you must have an heir. Marraiges are very important and often vital to a nation's security and success. Firstly marraiges with foreign princesses or powerful nobility provide strong alliances. Additionally, your descendants may be able to pursue the claims of the spouse marrying into your dynasty, if the right conditions occur. However, you must besure to evalute the traits of a wife/husband, not just their background because marrying a character with severe defects such as slow or imbecile, can ruin a dynasty's plans for several decades.The different time periods, regions, and rulers you can play as provide a lot of variety. With paid DLC, you can play any character ruling in 769, 867, or anytime between 1066 and 1337. These characters' families can be played up until 1453. Also with the appropriate DLC, you can play as a character of any of the in-game religions. This means chacaters located from Scandanvia to India, and Mongolia to Mali. Even without any extras, you can play almost any Christian character between 1337 and 1453.While the game is complicated enough to take some getting used to, after a few hours you should be able to get the hang of it. So don't let the learning curve keep you away from the game!

												Well now - so early in the year, and already a contender for me GOTY! A wonderful mix of Grand Strategy and.. well... The Sims? Hard to explain. Much better tutorials Etc than previous Paradox games means anyone can get in on the fun. My only negative? The inability to play Pagans/Muslims/Republics screams 'Expansion Pack' to me. Still, plenty of variety and things to do in this on its own. Support a developer that makes 'different' games and buy this, and not generic crap such as Call of Duty.			"

												This game is very enjoyable and has a lot of depth considering how evil paradox are ( if you think EA are bad with dlc, just buy this game. paradox make an expansion and cut out the ♥♥♥♥ing art and music from that expansion and sell it differently) modding is the real winner in this gameif you ever wanted to role play as rob stark and not betary the freys you can do itif you wanted to conquer the north as a wood elf chiften in the elder scrolls universe you can do it as well.

												Once you get over the initial learning curve and can manage the plethora of information the game bombards you with the game is very enjoyable. I love watching how my decissions impact the game in the medium and long run as family members and vassals die, plot, and do strange and unexpected things. The random elements also keep it very exciting!! In my current game I'm dabbling in ""Norse Eugenics"" and creating a ruling class of strong/quick/attractive/genius nobility. Raiding counties to capture females with these traits, making them concubines and converting them to our religion, then marrying them off to selective Norse men!! :)			"

With the Old Gods expansion a game I thought was the greatest, deepest, most immersive strategy title Ive ever played has somehow become greater, deeper and more immersive. There's simply nothing else like it. Its essentially a politics, intrigue, sociology and general human interaction simulator set during the middle ages that comes closer to emulating real world human relationships, interactions and politics than any other game Ive ever played. Over 300 hours in and Im still getting new things from this game. Its staggeringly good.			"

												Good game for anyone interested in grand strategy. While the battles in the game literally consist of assigning commanders to flanks and watching the numbers of each side drop, the depth of every other aspect of the game more than makes up for that area. To be honest, with enough skill and manipulation (say, manipulating people off a balcony or over a cliff in a carriage) of other characters you could probably get away without fighting a single battle and end up with a sizeable realm.Like other Paradox grand strategy titles, this one has a particular focus: characters. CKII is much less about the lands than the people who rule them, which can make the game a challenge from beginning to end. It doesn't matter if you're the King of France if you're a new incompetent person who everyone hates! This is both a benefit and a hindrance, and make for much more interesting gaming. With one character, you might be leading Crusades and expanding your realm: a sudden death and you're fighting tooth and nail to hold onto your titles.Another good aspect is the scale. The number of characters playable, from 1066 to the 14th century, is virtually endless. This gives the game great replay value, and lower ranks like Dukes are stillvery interesting to play provided you make use of the full range of backstabbing ploys and traitorous acts available to you in various forms.The only issue I have is the prevalance of DLC, required to play groups like Muslims, Pagans and Republics. This means that in order to get the full CKII experience, you do have to stump up a lot more than the £30 original price.Overall, good game, well worth the money, excellent replay value; don't go expecting explosive action, though. The best (and worst) of CKII is hidden under the cloak, so to speak.			"

												The game is great.  Prepare to spend countless hours trying to figure it out but once you do the game becomes amazing and offers a unique experience each time you play.  Want to be Ghengis Khan and kick the crap out of eastern Europe?  Want to be a Viking and pillage?  How about join a Jihad to kick the Christian infidels from the Holy Land or join a crusade to save Jerusalem from the Muslim invaders?  Do it.  Its not flashy but the music goes along with the game and the music DLCs offer hours of great sounding music.  Nothing like reforming the Roman Empire listening to the Songs of Byzantium DLC.  Its a great game and can be found in a bundle pack for a good price.  Paradox keep up the good work.			"

												I'm someone who's not easily entertained and doesn't have fun doing much of anything. I still had fun with this game though. It simplifies doing what would be a horrifying atrocity in any other context down to a math problem of navigating game mechanics. In the tutorial, I completely ignored what I was instructed to do, killed my brothers to become the king of Leon, Castille, and Galicia, and then killed my sister's husband before seducing and marrying her. I immediately died and the realm passed to my now one year old incest baby who was able to achieve the reconquista 400 years early as well as conquering half of north Africa before he died at the age of 80. The realm was split into three following his death, but it was cool because one of the sons worshipped satan so everyone was just kind of okay with him being executed.TL;DR : Good role-play elements coupled with interesting character interactions amount to a great game where you play as a medieval dynasty. However, the DLC policy can make the pricing a bit prohibitive, definitely wait for a sale if you're wanting to buy in.			"

												Crusader Kings II. A game that perfectly combines Strategy and RPG together. Whether you'd like to start out as a petty king of Wales, or a sheikh of a Muslim caliphate- (DLC's may be needed unfortunately), this game is very intriuging and fun with every one of your actions having a knock-on effect that could affect you later on in the game. Though I sometimes struggle to expand out of my tiny county in France, the game has a very ambitious and exciting atmosphere, with all sorts of likely scenarios coming face to face with you. Whether a traveller from the far east, or a request from the King of Castille asking for your daughters hand, or even needing to bring up children in the way you may see fit, every single choice will cause a consequence, whether good or bad.Sometimes you have to stick around and wait for something to happen, but in the meantime I tend to arrange my childrens marriages and education as well as send gifts and my councillers on various missions across the known world. I am still learning about the game and the new possibilities I could undertake, but in the past 3 weeks, I have played under different titles in the known world and made different choices and characters in each one. Let me explain more, you can create your own council, deploy armies and arrange marriages and education and even choose to imprison or assassinate somebody, when you grow more powerful you can remove ""Duke"" and plant in ""King"" and eventually.. ""Emperor"". You can create alliances or enemies, choose what to do with people and even banish or execute them, the game has a vast amount of decisions and possibilities which I am still discovering every time I play this game again. Do I recommend this game? Yes, but it depends on your likes and interests. If you're a fan of medieval European/Middle Eastern history as well as strategic thinking, you will enjoy this creation. Thank you for reading my review and decide what you think. Good day/night ladies and gentlemen.Deus Vult!			"

												This is a game about Iteration.If you like attempting a process/workflow, seeing the results and then trying to do it again but better than this game is for you.I say this because I work for a tech company, love my job, and see a mirror of what I do at work in this game - only it's much more fun!  This is a developer's game.This game has many layers - you will not understand everything.  The idea is actually that you don't.  The devs want you to react to what happens from an emotional standpoint and the game will respond in a way that actually makes sense.Want to be an awesome Barbarrian King and conquer the world?  Go ahead!  Oh, you died and now are playing as your spoiled son?  Will the bloodthirsty, barbarian generals your father put in power respect and obey you?  I highly doubt it.  Maybe next time you'll arrange for one of those generals to be your heir insted.After nearly 1400 hours logged into this game I can say it is the best gaming investment I've ever made.  Their are hundreds of starting locations and each one has different nuances that you will only learn through trial and error until you get to whatever you consider perfection.  Even when you achieve what you consider perfection you will look back at that playthrough and realize countless mistakes you could fix the next time around.My adivce on playing this game is to start with the western religions, then india, then the middle east, and finailly the tribal religions.  This will progress your learning of the game in a stable way and also present ever increasing challenges.			"

												I have played an inordinate amount of this game. If you like Civ and like diplomacy with lots of other nations and like shifting maps, then this is a great buy. The combat isn't great and the interface is horrifically unintuitive due to the complexity of the game. You need to invest time up front to lose a couple of two hour games to learn what the heck you're supposed to be doing at any point, but once you do, you find one of the deepest and most rewarding games out there.Immense amounts of fun to scheme against others, get involved in or suppress civil wars, arrange marriages, attempt to mentor and breed good traits into your kids, and grow as a county/duchy/nation/empire. Huge amounts of fun just to see what the rest of the world gets up to on its own, far away from you. Different cultures and religions play quite differently from one another, which adds to the replay. It's fun to keep large countries or empires from fracturing, which keeps the game engaging even after you are larger than your rivals in the world.Lots of additional content makes for a fun game, but it's preposterously expensive as a whole. Wait for it to go on deep discount, as it does at least every time that a new expansion is released, and you'll get more than your money's worth.			"

												A lot of negative reviews based on DLC.   Don't believe the hype.  This game is immensely enjoyable in its vanilla form, and worth every penny at full price.  In fact, I think the vanilla is probably worth double full price, it's that deep.  I have over a hundred hours in and feel like I could easily put in hundreds more without tire.  This is the grandest of grand strategy games.  I personally don't mind the DLC format in this instance, as the vanilla game is so full.  The DLCs are available to customize your experience if you so choose.  Whether or not they themselves are worth the price, I cannot comment on, but I haven't felt at all limited by the base game yet.			"

After the affair had been going for some time and my wife was getting on in her years without giving me a son I had my own wife killed (balconies are so dangerous) then had my cousin killed. Then married my cousin's widow. Twisted plots like these and more are yours to craft.			"

												I'll be honest, it took me a while to get in to this game. The first time I played it, I played for a few hours, learnt most of the basics and then stopped and didn't come back to it for a while. I think this was partly because it is very in-depth and it seemed a bit slow-moving at times. However, after a couple of months, I came back to it and already knowing the general gist of the game, was able to get a lot more out of it and really enjoyed playing.So buy this game and persist with it. The first few hours may be a bit hard going, but after that it's extremely enjoyable and annoyingly addictive!			"

CK 2 does the little things perfectly, every expansion has changed the game in nuanced ways, and the addition of achievements has been a nice touch. The Elder Scrolls mod (Elder Kings) and the Game of Thrones Mod blow similar mods out of the water.Highly recommend that you give this game a chance, particularly if strategy games are your thing.

If you take the time to learn the game, the strategies, and the vocabulary, you will find yourself feeling not just great, but power-hungry and ambitious. Also, the soundtrack is absolutely beautiful. I have the entire soundtrack downloaded to listen to whenever I want, even though I have never liked medieval choir music before. Prepare you and your family (whom may hear many tales of your new dynasty) for the totally-engrossing, brutal, medieval, political simulator that is Crusader Kings II.			"

												Crusader Kings 2 is a dynastic family simulator set in the middle ages and is a game that gets incedibly complex very quickly. The game has a steep learning curve, so only buy if you are prepared to spend a few hours learning the game. The game has a lot of DLC, but Pardox's DLC policy is pretty good. Each major DLC release accompanies a major patch which includes some features present in the DLC. In addition, in multiplayer, everyone connected to the host will have access to the same features present on the DLC active on the host, ex: My friend connects to me, I have Old Gods active and he doesn't, He has access to the Old Gods features. By default you can play as a Christian (both Catholic and Orthodox) landowner, or even a vassal of a land owner. Muslim and Pagan rulers are locked behind DLC becasue they are mechanicly different in many ways. DLC I would recomend:Sword of Islam (If you want to play as a Muslim, if not don't bother)Legacy of Rome (Retinue!)The Republic (Republics!)The Old Gods (Earlier Start Date, Pagans)If you like complex, historicly theamed games set in the middle ages, I would recomend. If not then this isn't for you.			"

												This game is a prime example of the type of game that requires you to earn your fun. The game's mechanics, while not entirely inaccessible, require a lot of learning to truly understand, but once you have a firm grasp of the game's mechanics it's by far the most amazing medieval strategy sandbox out there, with lots of potential not only for conquest and expansion but also for emergent narrative and role-play. Unlike many other grand strategy games, the game gives its various characters a lot of personality, so you're not only playing the expansion of a dynasty but getting to engage with each of your dynasty members on a personal level.If you like strategy games, this is a must have. The opportunity cost of needing to learn its mechanics is totally worth it.			"

												This is the sort of game where you sit down figuring you'll play a gimmick character for a few years just to see how things shake out, only to wake up from a daze realizing it's 50 years and several real-time hours later, you're the viking merchant prince of the Irish republic, you've sacrificed at LEAST a dozen people to Odin, you've raided the British countryside so often you've got frequent♥♥♥♥♥♥and-pillage miles, you have a growing monopoly on trade in the north, your son won't stop plotting to kill you, Scotland has been created and destroyed from rebellions about five times, that jackass neighbor with the prime coastline cities still won't die so you can take advantage of the inevitable succession crisis, the East and West Frankish empires have somehow switched places from all the coup attempts, you've erected a runestone declaring how huge your♥♥♥♥♥♥♥is, and you're still on your first ruler.If that sounded like your type of game, this game will devour your spare time if you get past the learning curve, which, while not insignificant, is easily the most accessible of any of Paradox's games. The DLC is mostly cheap portrait and song packs, with the main DLCs giving access to factions the massive patches that came with them overhauled. I'd wait for a big if you want to snatch up most of the DLC, but if you REALLY like the sound of one they're almost all worth full price.			"

												Crusader Kings II is a grand strategy. Let my stress the word ""grand."" This game requires investment. Not just a monetary investment, but the investment of your time. Its a game that will take quite a long time to learn, let alone master. But in Crusader Kings II, is one of the richest, and deepest grand strategy experiences in a video game of all time. In Crusader Kings 2 you play as an individual during a year of your choosing, I believe anywhere from 866 AD to around 1499, plotting for more power in a Medieval Court, Game of Thrones style. The game is riddled with depth and intrigue, and you're going to have to be willing to get your hands dirty if you want to make it to the proverbial top of the pile. Did I say get your hands dirty? I meant filthy. You're going to have to do some heinous, treacherous things if you want to end up at the top. You can't really trust anyone - not even your own flesh and blood in this one. You may have fathered good ol' Johnny for 19 years, but Johnny is rather ambitious, and will take you out of the spotlight if it means he can have his spot at the throne. It's ruthless.Crusader Kings II is a game where you can send your brother to his death atop the sands of Syria by the hands of Jihadists, bang his grieving wife, make her bare your children, and then plot the murder of the little runts too. Oh, and you get to secretly arrange plots against people you don't like, get everyone else in on it, and then pull a Gaius Julius Caesar-esque everyone-run-up-and-collectively-stab-Henry-to-death type of thing. It's a great game, and if you have the time and effort to invest into it, I suggest you purchase it.			"

												This game is honestly one of my favorite games of all time. Keep in mind the fact that I like history more than the average person, and I love this kind of game. If you like constant action, it might not be the best choice. But the amazing thing about this game is that it has the ability to make you amazing with some of the best traits, then you have a daughter that is an imbecile, ugly, club-footed, and has a hunchback. It is capable of keeping you interested and constantly interacting with one or more features in the game. For example, one play through I started as a count in Ireland, which in the game is probably the easiest spot to start for beginners (Not much happens so you have time to adjust things and learn the game to a point where you are comfortable). As this count in Ireland, I expanded my one county into a duchy, which is an even greater title and provided me with a lot of happiness and wealth. But then, my half-brother decided to call a revolt, saying he should be in control of the duchy. I went to war and lost, and he ended up throwing me in the darkest deepest dungeon possible (I still kept one county, which I was suprised about, seeing as he wanted to kill me) When in this dungeon, I contracted typhoid fever, and my brother decided to put me on house arrest. My youngest son randomly broke me out, and I went back to my county. I had married off my daughters, and at the time my allies couldn't help with the revolt my brother called on me. So I decided enough was enough, and declared war. Scotland, Mercia, and Wessex came down with their armies (Which to me at the time was a very huge amount of men) And we decimated my brother. I regained my throne, and began raising troops. I took my army to war against the rest of the single counties, seeing as I had lost a large amount of my life to the dungeon. I took enough land (80% of the Kingdom of Ireland) to create the kingdom. As soon as I made it, I passed away. My oldest son took over the majority of my kingdom, while the duchy went to my youngest (Still in the same country). Being a new character (My oldest son) I decided it was time to expand the kingdom I had made. I fought until I reached scotland, killed my sister to end the alliance, and then declared war and took it. I had so much power, that I wanted to make the Empire of Britannia to match how I felt. I did exactly that, and became the Emperor. However, after some time of ruling the Empire, a foreign country wanted my land, so we went to war. I had over half the amount of troops he had (At least I thought I did) and I felt extremely confident I was going to prevail. Little did I know that the Emperor of the HRE didn't like me. I didn't know the reason, until I saw that he was the previous king of Scotland, and his father was the Emperor of the HRE before me. So now I was facing a 10k+ army included with the 4k coming from another country. They killed my army instantly, all of my land was sieged and burnt, and my children and siblings were all arrested and died from disease. I had nothing after so long that I actually felt a real anger building. It was the first time in a long time a game had brought emotion so real into my heart. That is when I realized how good this game was. It is so amazing, it is able to upset you, but at the same time bring happiness and satisfaction when you destroy your enemies. You can call Jihads as the Caliph of Islam, you can join crusades for the holy sites in the world, you can rule or be ruled. So many opportunities in this game, and all of them bring good or bad feelings. Oh, and about my story, my character ended up being excommunicated by the pope, and I was assassinated.			"

												While for some this game can be challenging to learn, it is a great game for fans of the genre. Those unfamiliar with the genre may wish to start with a different game first, although it is certainly possible to learn this game without that prior experience.			"

												Crusader Kings 2 is an epic Strategy game where you play as a family of characters to develop and expand your kingdom. This game is heaps of fun, with friends and by yourself because the RPG elements of your character, that combine marvelously with historical events, as well as building and expanding your kingdom into a medieval power! The game is also complex, and the research that went behind it is amazing. Different cultures, religions, customs, make the game rich in diversity and alot of fun.Overall, the best game I have in my Steam library :)			"

												It's the greatest game I've ever played. I've committed a terrifying number of hours to this game and I've still never come close to my primary goal of completing a save from the early start to the bitter end. I'll do it one day! I'd recommend picking up DLC a few months after it's released to save yourself from buggy dissapointment. Generally, I feel the portrait DLCs and anything introducing game mechanics are normally worth it (but slightly expensive) and the music/unit sprite DLCs are an utter waste of your cash.			"

												A very unique RPG/Strategy game about the Medieval world. As the name suggests, you can play as a crusader king, but that is far from everything, with the right dlcs you can also play as pagan tribals, nomadic khans, muslim caliphs and so on. There is a lot of intrigue in this game, so you will often notice that you were just part of something that came out of Game of Thrones or something, you will eventually lose all morals after playing this game, you will murder all but one of your own children if that means inheriting some neighbouring kingdom/empire. Oh and who can forget that this game is also an excellent breeding simulator? Selectivelly choose your spouses with certain traits that you wish your future offspring to have, kill off all those without said traits, and in a hundred years or so you will have your family line made up of super humans that are strong, genious, attractive and quick at the same time. All in all, buy this♥♥♥♥♥♥ you will not regret it.			"

I have yet to come across a feeling in a game that quite matches the satisfaction of seeing your hard work justified when your 250 year old Dynasty finally rises from minor county barons to rulers of the land. Mods and integration with the Europa Universalis series are a welcome bonus. Truly a great game.			"

												The possibilities in this game are endless. Do you wish to have your families name echo across time as glorious conquerers? Perhaps you'd rather have it praised as a pious man, servant only to your god. How about a lurker of the shadows, known only to be a ""shady character"". This is a game that you will spend much time, much more than alot of the games out there. It is easy to get lost in the game and look at a clock to see 4 hours have passed when it seems like you just sat down. The game itself (without add-ons ) is very well done, although after seeing what the add-ons bring to the table such as new scenarios and many new things to do you, you may want to pick them up. The modding community is pretty lively for this game as well. If you like grand strategy games, i truely believe this game will suite you.			"

												The greatest ""Grand Strategy"" game ever produced. It doesn't exist a game which achieves this quality, historical reference and complexity.I played it more than 1'100 hours and I'm far away to get tired of playing Crusader Kings II and I'm very far away of having played all the interesting kingdoms, clans or religions. Each game differs so much from the last one. The dynasty mustn't die out - to marry the right wife is essential in order of a successor and strategic alliances. Subordinated nobility aspires as much my crown as legitimated successors or relatives. Where is the greatest danger? A rising neighbour, the  superior mussulmans, the mongolian horsemen, a more and more powerful subordinate, a second wife, who prefers her son as successor instead of the first ones, maybe an intrigeur who has already started an assassination in order to achiev his political goals? Fortunately I have my counsellors - but can I really trust them or are they already involved in a complot against me?? There exist much more aspects.It's not always easy to locate the risks - everything can change from one day to the other. This are medieval times. And if I loose my crown I'm the one, among other rivals, who aspires it...			"

There is no better medieval strategy game out there and it will be a long time untill some title tries to ``usurp`` the throne that Crusader Kings II is sitting on.The only negative thing I can say about is that if you want the full experiance of this game you need every DLC (except Sunset Invasion - dont get me started on this one)Wait for a discount on everything because the marketing is awfull and they want us to pay like 140$ to have the game fully updated. Wait for it and then buy it! Dont think twice if you are a fan of the medieval strategies and you want some roleplaying experiance. The amount of emotions this game is going to give you is indescribable. 10/10  - 2 points because of the crappy marketing politics = solid 8/10 Great gameP.S I have 300+ hours off steam, so I think I know what I am talking about :)			"

												I have played an inordinate amount of this game. If you like Civ and like diplomacy with lots of other nations and like shifting maps, then this is a great buy. The combat isn't great and the interface is horrifically unintuitive due to the complexity of the game. You need to invest time up front to lose a couple of two hour games to learn what the heck you're supposed to be doing at any point, but once you do, you find one of the deepest and most rewarding games out there.Immense amounts of fun to scheme against others, get involved in or suppress civil wars, arrange marriages, attempt to mentor and breed good traits into your kids, and grow as a county/duchy/nation/empire. Huge amounts of fun just to see what the rest of the world gets up to on its own, far away from you. Different cultures and religions play quite differently from one another, which adds to the replay. It's fun to keep large countries or empires from fracturing, which keeps the game engaging even after you are larger than your rivals in the world.Lots of additional content makes for a fun game, but it's preposterously expensive as a whole. Wait for it to go on deep discount, as it does at least every time that a new expansion is released, and you'll get more than your money's worth.			"

												A lot of negative reviews based on DLC.   Don't believe the hype.  This game is immensely enjoyable in its vanilla form, and worth every penny at full price.  In fact, I think the vanilla is probably worth double full price, it's that deep.  I have over a hundred hours in and feel like I could easily put in hundreds more without tire.  This is the grandest of grand strategy games.  I personally don't mind the DLC format in this instance, as the vanilla game is so full.  The DLCs are available to customize your experience if you so choose.  Whether or not they themselves are worth the price, I cannot comment on, but I haven't felt at all limited by the base game yet.			"

												Crusader Kings II is maybe the finest, most in-depth grand strategy game I have played. It brings the usual Paradox level of detail to the medieval age. The game itself takes place between the mid 11th and late 15th centuries, though the Old Gods expansion pushes that range wider, by providing an alternate starting date at the middle of the 9th century.I called CK2 a grand strategy game above, but it would be more accurate to call this game a dynasty simulator. You will play not as a nation, but a medieval ruler. You can start low as a count or high as an emperor, the end goal is the same: ensure the prosperity of your dynasty through diplomacy, intrigue and conquest. You can play as virtually any noble of medieval europe from the rank of count all the way to kings and emperors. Ever wanted to see if you can unite the world under the banner of Iceland? Well.. here is your chance to see.Victory and defeat are a little different in this game. You might start out as a king and have your brother knock you from your throne. In other games, this would mean you lost. In CK2 it merely means, that you are now a mere duke, or count, depending on your other titles. Don't make the mistake of thinking this game to be easy however. While it is hard to ""lose"" in the classical sense (the only way to do that is to lose all titles OR have no valid heirs - leading to the end of your dynasty), it also takes both skill, cunning and luck to ""prosper"" in the medieval ages.So what are you waiting for? Grab the game and start building that empire.			"

												I don't know that the English language is deep enough to properly heap the praise upon this game that it truly deserves. The replayability is phenomenal, the stategy is incredibly deep and involving, and there are literally too many ways to play the game for me to list them without writing a novel. My friend plays the game like a geneticist, trying to breed the perfect ruler. I play the game constantly trying to spread whatever religion I'm playing, because it's obviously the only true religion.With hundreds of playable characters and hundreds of different ways to play, I can see myself playing this for thousands and thousands of hours before I get bored of it. Heck, look at how much I've played already. Download this game, download the six important expansions (Ruler Designer, Sword of Islam, Legacy of Rome, The Republic, The Old Gods, Sons of Abraham) and then decide how you want to play! Conquer the world? Have one of your children elected Pope? Mend the Great Schism in the Christian Church? Establish the Jewish nation of Israel? That's just a tiny little bit of what you can do in Crusader Kings, and I can't recommend this enough!			"

												I've been playing this game for around 2 years at this point, and its endless expansions and countless possibilities keep me coming back time after time. Some of the stories that I've vicariously lived through playing Crusader Kings II have been incredible - the 74 year long dynasty of a father who assassinates his brothers to unite a kingdom, only for that kingdom to crash and break upon his death, leaving it in the hands of three young sisters - his daughters - who go on to relive their fathers' legacy; each one plotting to kill the other in the name of uniting the kingdom once more.That time when all of England was Norway. When all of France was England. When half of Europe was the Aztec empire, or, the time that I reunited Portugal through diabolical scheming, assassination attempts and intrigue in bucketloads.I've recently got into modding CK2, as well, and although slightly daunting at first, it is relatively comprehensive to tinker around with. I've yet to complete a mod; however have had fun poking around in the game engine to create my own (non-canon) religion and set up various event strings. A must for any modder.Get this game, you won't regret it. If you are not familiar with the complex nature of Paradox games, do go through the tutorial and do read forum guides; you'll get a lot more out of it. I look forward to seeing what comes next! Thank you, Paradox!			"

												*Beware!!!* Steep learning curb!!!!   I've been playing day and night and still have to Google words since I'm not aware of the English King's talks, ranks, titles, and such.  I'm more of a Nobunaga and ROTK type guy.  None the less I couldn't pass up on the recent sale STEAM had.  Even though I'm having a hard time knowing what's going on I'm having just as much fun learning.  The first few hours I will admit I felt like I got put into a advance physics class due to me cheating off a friends paper in class. A class I didn't belong in.  This game had me rubbing my face due to being overwhelmed so quickly.  I must have started the learning scenario over about 10 times.  At last after not giving up!!!!

												This game feels like an almost perfect Game of Thrones game where you play as Tywin Lannister, planning and scheming on taking over control of the world.Pros: Emphasis on family breeding and conquering new lands by marriage and assassination! This game is all about developing your family, its power and influence. You carefully arrange marriages. Firstly, to ensure your heirs would get the best genes. Secondly, to install your family members on thrones in neighbouring counties, duchies and kingdoms. This takes great patience, planning, and some luck as well. Often you will have to assassinate other rulers or their heirs to achieve this. By the way you'll learn weird ways the different inheritance laws work. Why is it important to install cousins, nephews and other kinsmen on thrones in other ""provinces""? Because the same family name grants you an eternal military alliance and even lets you to join your domains easier in the future (with a marriage, of course). In dynasty we trust!Also, sometimes you will have to kill your own family members, or help your sons in impregnating their wives. All to ensure the only right line of succession :)Inner working of a kingdom, with sovereigns, vassals and their warsBeside the above you will of course raise armies and battle other rulers, but its mechanics in the game are somewhat simplified. Realism is amplified by the addition of factions; you may revolt against your sovereign along with other vassals, e.g. against an inheritance law, or to install certain person on the throne.Cons:Time consuming searching for bridesThe game interface is a bit coarse, although better than in the previous installment of the series. I mostly whine about the problematic in-game search engine for characters, used mostly to find brides and grooms. It should let you specify more options for the characters you seek. Instead, you can choose some basic options, and then you have to sort through a ton of people. Probably most of the play time I spend on searching, so it is an important feature. Fortunately, it's still not able to spoil the fun of managing your dynasty :)Bugs on Linux version The game is still buggy on Linux. Some players report that disabling the launcher they implemented months ago solves the problems, some don't. Recently my game would crash to desktop every several months, without any symptoms, so I had to switch to Windows to continue playing without constant whining.DLC plague – “hey, let’s add a bunch of new functions to the game, and put each in a different lovable payable DLC!” Paradox' greatest sin is its DLC policy. Most of them are simply NOT WORTH ITS COST. They usually add one significant function to the game. The latest - Way of Life - claims to add ""hundreds of new events"". I bought it, played it, and highly doubt it! Before you purchase any DLC, ask on the web which are definitely worth buying!Not enough of diversified music tracksThe music tracks for different culture groups are few but very atmospheric. Although, after 200 years no matter how great they are, listhening to them just becomes tedious. Of course most of them you have to purchase in separate DLCs...Conclusion:All in all, this is a perfect idea for a game, and an imperfect implementation of that idea, though the best (and only?) one I know. You love GoT and Tywin Lannister? Quickly buy it!			"

												One of Best grand strategy games. You can conquer other countries not only by power, but also you can use politics too. You have to make sure your heir will get your demense, or your dinasty will lost and game over.pros for me :+ deep strategy+ you cannot survive without your vassal, or allies+ trait make everything better or worst+ ironman mode make you think twice for every decision+ nice graphic, colorfull and make my eyes are refreshed when change to realm map+ you can transfer your save data to EU IV for more years playcons for me :- i don't like left clicked for more option (new update. i prefer the old one)- the tutorial doesn't not much help me. I learn it by play it again and again until i get used to the UI and Basic strategy.- the war is not deep (or am i just don't know the strategy at war? who know)- spend a lot of my time that i leave my console dusty- IF YOU WANT TO GET ACHIEVEMENT, ENABLE IRONMANMODE AND DISABLE RULER DESIGNER MOD! my score : 9/10I hope Paradox make new grand strategy in fantasy world.

												Crusader Kings II does a great job of creating adicting stratagy in a very realistic medieval setting. You start with a map of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and choose and lord from count or earl to emperor.  Many of the possible choices are based on real historical char. The game spans the life of the char, and hundreds of years of heirs. The combat is simulated, but the game is so deep overall that it makes up for it in a ton of other ways. Also there is some great mods for it such as the Game of Thrones mod that is the best GOT game out there as this is the perfect base game for it.			"

												Crusader Kings II is one of the best grand strategy games I have ever had the pleasure of playing. The game has beautiful graphics, execellent gameplay mechanics, an engine that is heads above other competitors, and challenge that keeps bringing players back for more. Add on the dozens and dozens of modifications and DLCs this game brings Grand Strategy to a whole new level. This being said, it is worth mentioning that there is somewhat of a learning curve and the instructions, at least for me, seemed more difficult and confusing than simply jumping in to the game. As well, some of the events and other parts of the game are difficult to fully appreciate without knowledge of the time period. Another personal desire/qualm is the fact that one cannot play as the Papacy, even though you are allowed to play as such powerful characters as the Caliphs of the Near East. It would add a whole new level of replayability. All in all a magnificent game and a must own if you enjoy the period.			"

												The only Paradox game I've played so far, yet I recommend it wholeheartedly. Crusader Kings is a strategy game that focuses on the characters rather than the nation-states; and that changes the dynamics completely. It's the most ""humanistic"" strategy game I've played, where plots, backstabbing and power-mongering is rampant. Trying to keep your dynasty alive, and your realm together, is some of the best fun I've ever had. Give Crusader Kings ago, you won't regret it.			"

I'd recommend picking up DLC a few months after it's released to save yourself from buggy dissapointment.

												I loved this game, but due to the battle changes and 'coalition/defensive pact' changes in conclave, as well as bugs that have persisted for over a year (The worst of which is when a revolt leader dies they'll just get their own independant country instead of folding back into yours), and repeated dlc thats weak on content I can no longer recommend it.Paradox seems invested in their vision of nofun mechanics that don't make the game more challanging, just more tedious (shattared retreats, hosts, defensive pacts, as well as a thousand tiny things that have been in the game for forever like being unable to end a revolt when a province is occupied for an enemy when an ai can totally do that),Steam says I have 700 hours in this game,  I'd played close to double that since I didn't play with steam open when I started, and the last 100 hours of so have been me desperatly trying to overlook all the problems that have been introduced combined with the problems that have always been there that I looked past because the rest of the game was solid.I don't want crusader kings to be europa universalis, and I don't want to play a game that is STILL a buggy mess years after release.EDIT: As of reaper's call the game now has custom setup options at game start that allow you to customise how your game works including turning off defensive pacts and shattered retreats without disabling ironman/achievements. This, along with other quality of life additions (such as pillage being a toggle now holy♥♥♥♥♥♥thank you paradox finally) means that I am now happy to reccomend this game again.			"

												10/10Owing to the succession laws of my country, a technicality prevented my ascension to absolute power over the land. Fearing the backlash from the nobility, I was unable to turn the influence I inherited from my merchant father, whom my mother married ""Matrilinealy"", into a physical act of power in the form of an armed coup. Also, owing to the cultural convictions of the populace, armed rebellion was a distinct probability, indeed built in to their constitution as a check against Tyranny.Upon mulling this over, I hoped to find an etymological kink in my alarming realization that I AM a ""Tyrant"". While I couldn't rid myself of the label, I did notice that in the Greek tradition, while a ""Tyrant"" IS someone who achieves power outside of the methods a society has deliberately created, the negative connotation we experience was not necessarily (although, admittedly, often enough) felt by them. Indeed, when a Tyrant was welcomed and appreciated, it was during a time where the current system was not functioning. If I could capture that word, and guide it properly through it's emotional course, I started thinking that I might be able to channel the best and worst definitions of that word in a manner that serves my needs.Thus, I sent my Chancellor to sow dissent in the regions of the empire with the strongest religious tendencies, warning of affiliations between the Emperor and Islam, confident that the difficulties in disproving such a connection makes proving them with factual evidence unnecessary. Between assignments, he labored to please god find some interpretation that will allow me to pursue my aims with a semblance legitimacy.My Marshal was sent to repress rebellions in territories that were under no threat of doing so, with instructions to warn the populace against the imminent threat of an Islamic uprising secretly backed by an Emperor who wants to disarm it's citizens. By militarizing locals in the name of justice against Tyrant Emperor, he will be in a better position to evaluate where and how many weapons are being stored.My Court Chaplin was sent, alongside gifts of money I just happened to want to donate, to the local religious leaders to demonstrate the support my efforts afforded their congregations in the form of masses of passionate, scared, angry zealots, and that reciprocation would be mutually beneficial.My Spymaster was sent around the land to spread rumors that the Emperor, actually, was not at all legitimate on the same grounds that I actually am not. I have a game I like to play where I accuse someone of something I know they are innocent of that I may see what genuine denial of guilt looks like, especially if it is something that I am guilty of committing or plan to commit. When he dismissed the accusations as ""beneath his dignity"", he gave me leave to do the same when the time came to overtly assert myself. Regarding the issue itself, enough of the populace believes our Emperor is as illegitimate as I am in fact that it shouldn't be regarded seriously now.My Steward was sent to collect taxes in the poorest regions in my grasp, with instructions to apologize for having to collect but their Emperor insisted they do so.Now, to let the damage fester, I will continue to fight the version of my Emperor that my minions have created, and declare victory when thwarted and claim credit for anything positive done by the Emperor, especially if I did not support it, and preemptively call hypocrite anywhere I engage in hypocrisy.Wish me luck! Awesome game!			"

												In CK2 you control a county/duchy/kingdom, assign your own council, propose marriages for your courtiers, develop your regions, ally or go to war with your neighbours, venture on crusades/jiihads, buy mercenary armies... and this is just the normal part of the game.But CK2 is not just your regular strategy game. In this game, it's all about your dinasty! You marry per convenience in order to form better alliances, you plot against vassals that have claims on your lands... sometimes even against your own family, you murder your wife and children if the heir is not your own blood, you assassinate opponents or friends as needed, fabricate claims on lands, instigate other kingdom's vassals to rebel against their lieges, execute, free or ransom prisoners, get maimed on battles and become a useless peon, die of syphilis or other nasty diseases, get assassinated by your own brother/uncle/mother in a plot conjured by your own spymaster, allies will turn their back on you and join your rivals when you most needed them, you will rise slowly and steadily and then lose everything because you were either too greedy or just because you died naturally without being able to set the right strategy to give continuity to your dinasty, popes will excommungate you or give you gold for your contribution against infidels... and countless of other situations that make this game pretty unique.If you want something different and special, this is the game for you!

												Plotting to murder your uncle, King of Bohemia, has never been more fun! CKII is a grand strategy game without any clear goals except for those you set for yourself. Take control of a mayor of minor family in medieval Europe and see how history plays out. I advise to role-play a lot and make decisions based on the traits of your character, since it will make for some ""interesting"" situations which will provide new challenges. It's a great improvement over CK1 in nearly every aspect, and especially concerning the interface: it might very well be the most accessible game Paradox has ever made, although the learning curve is still quite steep. Expansions are also well worth it, since they allow you to play previously unplayable factions. Also highly recommended for fans of Game of Thrones, since the politics in this game remind me a lot of those books/show (and what do you know: there is actually a GoT mod :)			"

												Crusader Kings II is one of the best strategy games ever.  I have been a fan of strategy games since the glory days of the mid 1990's, but I have not played a strategy game more than this one.  It has a fine balance of playing with politics and war that no other game has.  I love how there is no main goal for any particular playthrough, besides ensuring the survival of your dynasty.  You can choose any random area and play as that areas main character and their dynasty.  Unlike the Total War games and games like Civilization, there are no cheap moments where you can be allied with someone and then the next turn get attacked out of nowhere.  You have to have a legitimate reason for your actions in this game and more than anygame, I look forward to the fallout of mistakes I make.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is a strategy fan.  There is a bit of a learning curve, but once you understand how the game works, it is pretty awesome.			"

												This game has taken a lot of my time that I would gladly lose again. In this game I can play as a Curonian and rewrite history. It's a fun game, that takes a lot of practice, patience and wits to stand over your enemies. I own many games and much more DLC's but this game is one of the few in which each next one keeps on giving. The only dislike is for how the Baltic region state has been overlooked and is made weaker than it was in reality and as well the names of most of Curonians are taken from lithuanian language and as well the pronaunciation of our deity are skewed between our nations. Some are modern Latvian, and some are modern Lithuanian and then there comes Estonian but in a much lesser accurances. But I can overlook that in order to enjoy this game further.			"

Posted: December 30, 2014
												Where to begin... Forgive the long story, because my explanation as to why it is such a great game can only be described by the stories that are created when you play, as so many others who have posted theirs would likely agree.All right. I'm a lowly count in Poitiers. The year is 786. I married a greek woman by the name of Daphne 16 year ago, and had 5 sons with her. All was well. I had two counties and life was beautiful. My wife and I were hoping to have a little girl soon, but we were patient. I had my eyes set on a county to the north, Thouars, and I had my Chancellor working on a loophole to allow me to lay claim to it. Everything was going great! However, this happiness could not last. It was after the birth of my 5th son, Berenguie, that a series of... Interesting events began.He was born in 779 and by God the boy was displaying some very strange behavior even as an infant. The courtiers said he started laughing uncontrollably after he was cut with a sharp knife and was bleeding everywhere, and the other children said he was making creepy buzzing noises when he was around. He began to scare the courtiers (and myself, to be honest) so I called for the Court Chaplain, Aldebert of St. Savin. He then informed me that the child was a spawn of the Devil and that my wife, Daphne, ""Had congress"" with the devil. Daphne did not confess, but she never tried to deny it either. I had no choice but to disown the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child (for he was Satan's, not my own!) and imprison the witch. I had to keep the child though... He has no inheritance, but still must be cared for.That event occured around 781. So after a a year or so of mourning (and actively trying to repair the damage that a wife who cheated on me with the devil and gave birth to his demonic spawn in a bloody Catholic community caused) I remarried, and now, and for the past four years, Daphne and Berenguie are still causing me untold sorrow: My second son woke in the night screaming, foaming at the mouth with a swollen, blood-shot eye muttering to himself about ""a little monster"" stabbing him in the eye, all while little Demon Berenguie was happily striding around as if nothing happened... While me and all of my vassals and courtiers feared the kid even more.And my ex-wife? Yeah I had her imprisoned, supposedly, but when I went to execute her for her part in all of this, she wasn't there and when I looked her up, her location was ""Unknown."" Great. a demon child stabbing my heirs and a witch who is in love with me is somewhere doing God only knows what... Then I found out what she was up to.When my new wife left on a spiritual trip for several days, Daphne poked her ugly head back in while she was gone and there I was, back in her arms. Of COURSE she was now married to some guy over in Italy, and ABSOLUTELY she became pregnant after our little romantic rendevous! So I'm now stressed to the max, guilt eating away at me over and over so I desperately try to have her, and the unborn child, killed before it comes back to bite me square in the rear end. Months go by, no luck. She has the child... And it's a girl! I call off the plot to have her killed. The entire time Daphne and I were married her one ""Ambition"" was to have a daughter. That gave me pause, not to mention I already have 6 sons (Including the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ demonspawn) and that's my first and only daughter. Call me a softy but I couldn't kill them now. But it doesn't stop there, no sir. Daphne's new husband comes all the way to Poitiers to confront me about the affair! I'm given one last chance to break off the affair with my lover: and I tell him to go screw himself, I'm not ending it. He storms back, likely thinking of ways to get me back that involve alll kinds of murder, but I'm a couple steps ahead: I've already plotted to kill him, with his own wife no less (who is disturbingly happy about assisting me).So now I'm waiting on the death of that Italian prick so I can take back my lover!  And I get a message saying my second son, Abbon who is now 14, was found dead in his bed, his face frozen in a terrified grimace. No noticeable damage to his body, his face was pale with a streak of blood running down his cheek and it looks like he died of fright. As for Berenguie? The 10 year old who just lost his brother? He's once again acting happier than normal without a care in the world.Now it's not over yet, I'm still in this game waiting to see how it unfolds, but all of this happened in about two hours of gameplay. All random. And so much more can happen too. Please play this game. If you like strategy/simulation type games, which I'm assuming you do or you wouldn't be here reading this at all, buy this game.

												Paradox grand strategy game. Does anything more need to be said? Well, I guess I'll say a little anyway. If you ever wanted to lead a Medieval dynasty from the dark ages to the early Renaissance, and conquer half of Europe (and maybe a chunk of Africa and the Middle East) along the way, this is the game for you. With constantly added features, I find myself coming back to this game and leading another dynasty over and over again. The cons: It's hard to keep up with how often they add new content. But is that really that much of a negative? If you're like me, and will play a campaign once every few months or so, then it will simply make every new game fresh. Just visit Paradox's forums to see if there is going to be a new update soon before starting. I've lost a couple of playthroughs midway through because I've started shortly before a major patch and I've got auto-update on Steam.			"

												I've been playing this game for around 2 years at this point, and its endless expansions and countless possibilities keep me coming back time after time. Some of the stories that I've vicariously lived through playing Crusader Kings II have been incredible - the 74 year long dynasty of a father who assassinates his brothers to unite a kingdom, only for that kingdom to crash and break upon his death, leaving it in the hands of three young sisters - his daughters - who go on to relive their fathers' legacy; each one plotting to kill the other in the name of uniting the kingdom once more.That time when all of England was Norway. When all of France was England. When half of Europe was the Aztec empire, or, the time that I reunited Portugal through diabolical scheming, assassination attempts and intrigue in bucketloads.I've recently got into modding CK2, as well, and although slightly daunting at first, it is relatively comprehensive to tinker around with. I've yet to complete a mod; however have had fun poking around in the game engine to create my own (non-canon) religion and set up various event strings. A must for any modder.Get this game, you won't regret it. If you are not familiar with the complex nature of Paradox games, do go through the tutorial and do read forum guides; you'll get a lot more out of it. I look forward to seeing what comes next! Thank you, Paradox!			"

This game had me rubbing my face due to being overwhelmed so quickly.  I must have started the learning scenario over about 10 times.  At last after not giving up!!!!

												This game feels like an almost perfect Game of Thrones game where you play as Tywin Lannister, planning and scheming on taking over control of the world.Pros: Emphasis on family breeding and conquering new lands by marriage and assassination! This game is all about developing your family, its power and influence. You carefully arrange marriages. Firstly, to ensure your heirs would get the best genes. Secondly, to install your family members on thrones in neighbouring counties, duchies and kingdoms. This takes great patience, planning, and some luck as well. Often you will have to assassinate other rulers or their heirs to achieve this. By the way you'll learn weird ways the different inheritance laws work. Why is it important to install cousins, nephews and other kinsmen on thrones in other ""provinces""? Because the same family name grants you an eternal military alliance and even lets you to join your domains easier in the future (with a marriage, of course). In dynasty we trust!Also, sometimes you will have to kill your own family members, or help your sons in impregnating their wives. All to ensure the only right line of succession :)Inner working of a kingdom, with sovereigns, vassals and their warsBeside the above you will of course raise armies and battle other rulers, but its mechanics in the game are somewhat simplified. Realism is amplified by the addition of factions; you may revolt against your sovereign along with other vassals, e.g. against an inheritance law, or to install certain person on the throne.Cons:Time consuming searching for bridesThe game interface is a bit coarse, although better than in the previous installment of the series. I mostly whine about the problematic in-game search engine for characters, used mostly to find brides and grooms. It should let you specify more options for the characters you seek. Instead, you can choose some basic options, and then you have to sort through a ton of people. Probably most of the play time I spend on searching, so it is an important feature. Fortunately, it's still not able to spoil the fun of managing your dynasty :)Bugs on Linux version The game is still buggy on Linux. Some players report that disabling the launcher they implemented months ago solves the problems, some don't. Recently my game would crash to desktop every several months, without any symptoms, so I had to switch to Windows to continue playing without constant whining.DLC plague – “hey, let’s add a bunch of new functions to the game, and put each in a different lovable payable DLC!” Paradox' greatest sin is its DLC policy. Most of them are simply NOT WORTH ITS COST. They usually add one significant function to the game. The latest - Way of Life - claims to add ""hundreds of new events"". I bought it, played it, and highly doubt it! Before you purchase any DLC, ask on the web which are definitely worth buying!Not enough of diversified music tracksThe music tracks for different culture groups are few but very atmospheric. Although, after 200 years no matter how great they are, listhening to them just becomes tedious. Of course most of them you have to purchase in separate DLCs...Conclusion:All in all, this is a perfect idea for a game, and an imperfect implementation of that idea, though the best (and only?) one I know. You love GoT and Tywin Lannister? Quickly buy it!			"

												Since I bought this game I haven't been able to tear myself away.  It's like the best bits of Total War and Age of Empires all rolled into a great game.  It's truly fantastic. There are a few little glitches, however; the tutorials don't work properly (they tell you to click on buttons that don't exist, for example) and occasionally the tooltips will say something like ""Your [Religion.GetPietyName] is blah blah..."" which distracts from the immersive nature of the game.  For these small reasons I'm glad I didn't pay full price - however I feel that £7.50 is truly worth the money for the amount of gameplay you get.			"

												While this game does have it's problems, as does any game, it contains within it a certain charm. Yes, the multiplayer is very glitchy and the game has a tendancy to change versions (That you're running without closing the game) causing your games to disconnect mid-multiplayer, but I find it has a certain quality that is missed with other simulation games of the type. The flexability of the ways you can play, the core fact that it's a game about politics and less about war (although that is an important part), and simply because of the in-depth details the game contains about every single character just makes the game so great. It is anything but easy and takes many attempts and a lot of practice to gain any actual sense of achievment but when you get to that point, there are few greater feelings to a true lover of managment/simulation/political games. I would play, and do play it, over and over again.			"

Being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, he would never be allowed to inherit anything. That doesn't count the effects that inbreeding had on him, which turned him into a grotesque monster. He died at age 5.My daughter shrugged and went back to screwing her cousins and had 3 more children.10/10			"

												I have learned so much about geography and mideval succession laws and politics from this game, and that's a good thing. I may or may no have stacked up a sizeable infant bodycount in that process, but I really wanted to inherit Sicily, so I think it was justified in the end.  There are not many games where a random event yields the option of 'publicly bed a wench.  Karen will think most highly of you' (I honestly still have no idea who Karen was) or ""Show them how a true man dies, Lizardlips"".

												You will never be safe. There will never be a point in the game where you will be unassailable. The threats, both within and without, are as ubiquitous as they are immense. In my first playthrough, my own wife murdered my infant son so her daughter from a previous marriage would inherit my throne, and it was all I could do to kill her in return, find another wife, and have another son before the war wound I sustained fighting on the Emperor's behalf brought me down.Then my son died of pneumonia, and that was the end of House von Donau.

This game does have a huge learning curb and it should not push you away at all. Once you learn how to play the game there millions of ways you can go upon playing this game. Watching Arumba on youtube really helped me learn the game and hes really entertaining If you need help watch his videos. overall I would give this game about a 9 out of 10 worth every penny if you can get it cheaper the better!!!!

												Are you a high strategy fan? do you like scheming and backstabbing and dealing with unforseen circumstances? then this is the game for you, if your not then it isn't, it is not for you.This game has a long long time period to get anywhere unless your really really good at the game or just really lucky, you will find your subordinates will betray you no matter how hard you try to keep the peace, because you cannot make everyone happy right?What sucks is you can too often get a rebellion in the early stages of the game and find yourself massively outnumbered if your not extremly careful, this I feel needs to change, would be really cool to have the option to hire foriegn mercenaries to come help you can even loan money from friendly neighbouring countries, but you can't so your screwed.I feel this game is lacking something, more diplomacy perhaps, more intuitive building, this is a game you will be looking up stuff on google because the game fails to explain it properly and that's a shame because once you learn everything, you can have some fun with this game.Recommended if it is on discount.

												Awesome game! Founding kingdoms and empires. Creating a vast family tree to secure the continuation of your dynasty only to have everyone turn on eachother. Get an idiot for an heir. Steal some land from neighbour whose territory is falling apart from civil wars.♥♥♥♥♥♥off the Pope. And just when you think you have everything sorted out barbarians invade. This game is not so much about winning as dodging disasters. Going from being emperor to just a duke few generations later doesn't have to mean you did anything wrong. Keep going. See how far you can get!This game is hard! It takes a quite while before you figure out what's important and how to do anything. I recommend playing the demo a few times until you know it well and know if this is the game for you. The game might have seen a few updates since the demo but it will give you a sense of how things work.			"

												In Crusader Kings II you select a character ranging from Count to Emperor, Iceland to India, and guide his or her dynasty to glory from the days of Charlemagne all the way to the Hundred Years' War (769 - 1453).Along the journey you will encounter friends to help you gain power and prestige; rivals to scheme against; allies and enemies to defend and dominate... all while ensuring your family lives on in power, though under your watchful eye.CKII is a masterpiece of intrigue. A true test of patience and character; or brute force and recklessness; and either can work if you play it right.			"

												This is a rich, complicated game that sits at the intersection of many rich, complicated things: centuries-long empire building, tangled soap-opera relationships, and medieval role-play. There is always something going on, always something interesting to do; as with Sid Meier's Civilization, it's hard to find a good moment at which to stop playing—despite the fact that you control time in the game. Though its setting and complexity was intimidating at first (I'd suggest you watch playthroughs and tutorials on YouTube before starting), playing CKII is engrossing, rewarding, and results in stories you want to tell others.And I've yet to run it with any of the DLC expansions.

												For me, this game is perhaps the most gripping medieval political simulation I've ever played. Hours upon hours of my life have been invested in this game, estimated more than 300 hours before I converted my copy to a steam copy (gamersgate gave me a steam code for it and all the dlc I had). Deep and engaging diplomacy that requires one to have a strategy, lest your short term gains be spoiled by a disloyal vassal, jealous relative... I once even had my ideal heir murdered by my second wife so the first son I had with her could be my heir. Plot your way to the top of feudal power and entrench your dynasty in a historical sandbox. With all the DLC available that enables the player to play lords of pagan, muslim and jewish faiths, the EU IV converter DLC that allows you to take a game from the end of the dark ages to the early 19th century; this game is an absolute must own for any lover of history and political simulations, or even people looking for a empire management game with rpg elements.20/10			"

												As other games are about building up a country, in Crusader Kings 2 you build up your dynasty. You are but one family member who builds up to be a duke, or a king or even emperor. This can be done by either conquest or inheritance, friendly or by stabbing your brother in the back.  You can be a lot and you can do a lot which makes for endless replayability. It's also rather easier to get into in comparison to Victoria 2 and Hearts of Iron 3.			"

The game is a Grand Strategy game which means you do not take control of battles, instead you are in control of the state, deciding its politics and making sure that you become a pre-eminent power in Europe. Now that doesn't sound that as unique as the other games paradox have made, but as well as a grand strategy this is an RPG. First of all the RPG elements are not like Mass Effect or Skyrim, they are event based which means you decide how certain events go and see where it takes you. You can become a benevolent ruler who is just and kind, or you can become a intricate web weaver, assassinating rivals and killing siblings. You can even become insane or/and possessed!Now there is A LOT of DLC for this game and that can put you off. But this has not been pulled from the game (well most of it hasn't), instead they have been developed after the main game came out and add a variety of RPG enhancements and events. They also enable you to play different religions and cultures. The DLCs i would recommend are:Sword of IslamLegacy of RomeOld GodsSons of AbrahamWay of LifeCharlemagne They are all the major expansions except for Raja's of India and Republics which i found were a bit lacking and can be left out without any major changes. All the other Dynasty shield packs and song packs are totally optional (although if you are going to buy one song pack buy the Old Gods one).This game is worth full price and will give you hundreds of hours of game content and will give you an experience you will never forget. Also if you are unsure then wait for a steam sale and get the game and the major expansions for an incredibly cheap price!			"

												Get this one.This game is a Grand Strategy game where you lead anything from a minor county to the Holy Roman Empire to victory. Except there is no end-goal besides the goals you set yourself. The only way to end the game is a) lose or b) reach the end-date.I personally love starting out as a count in Norway, and strive for the welfare of Norway or the Empire of Scandinavia. Plundering heathen England is always fun, converting Spain to the Norse faith and conquering Rome for good measure.Every time you start the game something different happens, lead your dynasty to greatness or ruin, it's up to you.And a word of warning, this game will steal hours of your life.

												Easily Paradox's most accessible to date. Despite this ease of access the game  is deceptively deep. A game of characters, where empires and kingdoms merely present the background; where the goals are inherently  personal, and can include merely trying to usurp a minor barony to establishing your family's hegemony over Europe.  A game where you won't blink an eye at murdering your incompetent family members, scheming rivals, and the occasional anti-pope, all in the name of ""the realm."" A game where marrying off  your club-footed, inbred children to lowly lords to secure their allegiance is met with much praise. Totally awesome.			"

												Crusader Kings 2 was my first entry into the greand strategy genre, and after 100 hours of conquest, domination, politics, civil strife, heartbreak, victory, and defeat, I can safely say that CK2 is my favorite game of the year. When you start out, the game seems too hard, overly frustrating, and not worth anyone's time. The tutorials don't help at all, and everything will go wrong without you knowing anything about how. At this point, please take my advice... KEEP GOING. I have never had so much fun losing in a game, and the sense of discovery when you figure this game out is some of the greatest moments I've had in gaming. Another great thing about this game is that it actually gets you interested in the time period! I can't tell you how many times I've paused the game and went to look up a character or country. So if you want a game with a terrible learning curve that turns into a wonderous experience, CK2 will serve just fine.			"

												I don't know that the English language is deep enough to properly heap the praise upon this game that it truly deserves. The replayability is phenomenal, the stategy is incredibly deep and involving, and there are literally too many ways to play the game for me to list them without writing a novel. My friend plays the game like a geneticist, trying to breed the perfect ruler. I play the game constantly trying to spread whatever religion I'm playing, because it's obviously the only true religion.With hundreds of playable characters and hundreds of different ways to play, I can see myself playing this for thousands and thousands of hours before I get bored of it. Heck, look at how much I've played already. Download this game, download the six important expansions (Ruler Designer, Sword of Islam, Legacy of Rome, The Republic, The Old Gods, Sons of Abraham) and then decide how you want to play! Conquer the world? Have one of your children elected Pope? Mend the Great Schism in the Christian Church? Establish the Jewish nation of Israel? That's just a tiny little bit of what you can do in Crusader Kings, and I can't recommend this enough!			"

												The heathen king of Norway became infatuated with his concubine spy-mistress, who after becoming too old to bear children and set aside surprised the court by bearing the king an illegitimate daughter. Recognized by the king as one of his own, the daughter was accepted into the court and tutored by the best brilliant minds at the king's disposal.The once loyal spy-mistress and mother did not live to see her daughter's coming of age, pacing peacefully in sleep at an old and tender age. The king, distraught at his lover's death could no longer rule as vibrantly as he once did, suffering from a violent and seemingly endless depression. The Gods brought him no joy, nor the thunderous clash of steel and sword and the victories of his sons in battle.Tragedy struck yet again as the king's oldest and heir to the great, sprawling heathen kingdom of Norway fell in battle against the catholic dogs. Broken and plagued by wrath, the king set his second son on the path of vengeance, only to lose him in an outbreak of illness amongst the populace.With his heir's dead, the king could only look towards the daughter of his now lost lover. Plagued by his depression and with no interest in any woman, the king appointed the girl as his successor; the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a once great spy-mistress and his only remaining child.When the daughter finally passed from girlhood into womanhood, so much like her mother was she, that the king's heart once again ignited with passion. The fog cleared from his mind at the very sight of his daughter and the demons of depression no longer maintained their hold on him.Crusader Kings II -- The Medieval Soap Opera Game			"

Pfft, this game goes far beyond such simple concepts and delves into the land of royal incest and infanticide. Plots of murder and drunken polygamy abound in CK2.			"

												Fantastic game! Do not be fooled by the huge amount of DLC, most of it is cosmetic and the rest is definately worth the price when there is a sale going on. Updated are many and often enough to make returning periodically to the game after a long-ish while an extremely fun experience. My rating: 8/10 for the base game, 9/10 for the game plus the extensions I've decided to purchase and the mods i've installed.			"

												This game is complex, but it is a good thing! At first you won't understand it, but just try fooling around and soon you will learn how to play, when you do, you will have one of the best games in the world in your hands!In this game you play as a character from a dynasty, there is no objectives, you can do your own, like, making your dynasty rule all the realms in the world, play as a different and dying religion and try to make it the world religion, all sorts of stuff.While you are playing you have to manage your character and his relations to others, you will have your spouse, your children, your vassals, their families... You can plot to kill everyone, you can cheat on your wife, maybe you married her because of her family but she is ugly! You could fall in love with you cousin... if you are Zoroastrian you can even marry your sister, heck, you can marry your mother! I think this game became my favorite game ever, play it if you like strategy and roleplaying!			"

												Great game. Not much else needs to be said.Well... okay...So, This game features a focus in characters i think no other game has ever done before, with many features and complex opinions of characters, ranging from traits to events to lands to family, in a game where you keep trying to marry into other kingdoms to expand your influence, but when you die, your child asends to a kingdom fueled with hate and your fathers most trusted friends plot against you. 10 years on and half your demense swallowed up to your vassals to calm them, only to be challenged by your cousins two generations down the line, and lose what little you still have. Its very immersive, and one which i cannot reccommed highly enough.However, you need to get music mods as the tracks just really aren't enough to stop the game sounding dull and repetitive, and i kept encountering crashes from 1300 onwards, but these are now minor nit picks and the game is very well built. 9/10. A must for Grand Strategy fans.			"

CK2 is still being updated quite a lot so you dont have to worry about bugs. Game itself is very hard to learn you need to spend a lot hours just to learn the basics.

												One of the best, most addicting games on Steam. Short of Civ V and Skyrim, I think this is the game I have clocked the most hours on on Steam. You can make the game challenging for yourself, or just see what kind of crazy alternative history scenarios you can create. The expansions (the DLC that cost a bit more than the others) have crazy value and the other dlc you can buy is just nice toppings if you care about what they have. I myself have mostly bought the songpacks, because I love the music they bring, but you can enjoy the game entirely without the packs. The expansions unlock more play options in the game, so I highly recommend you get them at least after you've played the game for a bit, as they are complete gamechangers.Heck, if there's a deal like I'm seeing right now for winter sales, pay a little extra for the CKII Collection and get most of the stuff cheap. Right now the base game is 9,99€ and the collection, which includes at least four expansions and a lot of content packs is 19,99€. What a deal! That said, the base game is certainly worth the full price too.What better review for the game than to give some real stories of great moments?1. One of my earliest crazy alternate history scenarios was this: I started as the King of Scotland. Eventually I ended up (through intrigue and deceit) being married to the Empress of Byzantium (one of the most prestigious positions in the historical setting). This of course resulted in my daughter becoming Queen of Scotland and Empress of Byzantium.2. With the Legacy of Rome expansions you can achieve one of the most rewarding things you can ever do in gaming. You can start off as a count in the Byzantine Empire and slowly make your way to becoming Emperor. You'd think that'd be enough, but no. You can then proceed to invade Jerusalem, Alexandria and other holy lands thus restoring the Pentarch and making Orthodoxy the de facto form of Christianity, allowing you to outright turn Catholism into a heresy! But wait, there's more. You are Emperor of Byzantium, also known internally as Rome. It's time to make everyone accept you as the Emperor of Rome. How? Reclaim the old areas, invade Rome and recreate the Roman Empire! First Rome, then the world.3. The Empire of Scandinavia!			"

												2 Words. Simply awesome.I played the first Crusader Kings and loved it. It had weak spots, a lot of them but it was my first grand strategy game. And it got me into the genre. It led to countless hours of Europa Universalis 2 and EU 3.And then CK2 was announced, i couldn't wait to get my hands on the game and had so much fun with it starting as a tiny count back in Switzerland and become the Emperor of the HRE or be a Viking and Inavde the Coastlines. It's a Sandbox and you can do what you want and then add to it the countless possibilies of the Modding Comunity. I played as Rob Stark in the brilliant game of Thrones Mod and won the War for the North.The graphics are okay for a Strategy Game, but you won't get happy with a game like CK2 if you are looking for fancy grahics! The Soud effects are nice and the Music, too. If you played any part of EU or Victoria, you'll love CK2 because it adds a lot of character.Because its about the characters, not just the country.  "

												I'm a sandboxer, so I like the soft-moddability of the game. Plus, I get to learn a little history and geography along the way. My biggest project that I would love to figure out is to be able to create a ""minor title"" like prince, but have it show as the title for vassal kings. My goal is to incorporate the ""missing"" noble ranks into the existing ones in the game.My plan would be to make it so a Baron that holds 2 or more baronies w/o holding a higher title would be Viscount (primary title); Counts that hold 2 or more counties w/0 holding a higher title would be Marquis (primary title), and vassal kings would instead be Grand Duke (if not of your dynasty) or Archduke (if from your dynasty) of (primary kingdom title). If this could be done in a mod, or better yet incorporated into the regular game, I would be THRILLED.			"

												The heathen king of Norway became infatuated with his concubine spy-mistress, who after becoming too old to bear children and set aside surprised the court by bearing the king an illegitimate daughter. Recognized by the king as one of his own, the daughter was accepted into the court and tutored by the best brilliant minds at the king's disposal.The once loyal spy-mistress and mother did not live to see her daughter's coming of age, pacing peacefully in sleep at an old and tender age. The king, distraught at his lover's death could no longer rule as vibrantly as he once did, suffering from a violent and seemingly endless depression. The Gods brought him no joy, nor the thunderous clash of steel and sword and the victories of his sons in battle.Tragedy struck yet again as the king's oldest and heir to the great, sprawling heathen kingdom of Norway fell in battle against the catholic dogs. Broken and plagued by wrath, the king set his second son on the path of vengeance, only to lose him in an outbreak of illness amongst the populace.With his heir's dead, the king could only look towards the daughter of his now lost lover. Plagued by his depression and with no interest in any woman, the king appointed the girl as his successor; the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a once great spy-mistress and his only remaining child.When the daughter finally passed from girlhood into womanhood, so much like her mother was she, that the king's heart once again ignited with passion. The fog cleared from his mind at the very sight of his daughter and the demons of depression no longer maintained their hold on him.Crusader Kings II -- The Medieval Soap Opera Game			"

												Definitely worth a play by budding tyrants looking to enhance their ability of undertaking infanticide, regicide, torture and castration as well as obtain other useful skills such as fabricating claims to seats of power and inciting civil wars for their own personal gain. Of course being a family man they're doing this to secure the future of their dynasty, not just for the fun of it, even though it is rather fun.			"

												I lost a month of my life to this game.  Never getting that back but so worth it.  It's like Risk on steroids.  Start as anyone to conqure or marry into whatever family you want.  Steal titles and land.  Poison relatives.  Murder your extra grandsons.  Your wife had it coming.  Her sister was younger and smarter anyways.  Even helped in the assassination.  She'll make a great Queen.Great game.			"

												Intrigue. Incest. Murder. Murder of inocent babies. Murder of entire families. War. More intrigue. And then more War. People who think action games are violent don't know what they are talking about - Crusader Kings II is one of those games where you will committ ATROCITIES in the name of Lord and Land, and personal gain. And it happens to be a Grand Strategy game, with a lot of micromanaging and little action going on. I can grant you, it's not for everyone. It has little action, and requires a lot of imaginaton and roleplay (like the old text-based adventures like Zork) since the storyline resolves around text Events. And by storyline I mean Do Whatever You Can/Want, that being Let's Retake Spain as the Spanish, or Invading Europe and wipping christiany out of it as the Muslims. It's pretty fun to see the Roman Empire reform under your banner, even more if you happen to be a filthy pagan.			"

												So one time I was playing as the king of Kiev, then I died. Now I am playing as my 3 year old daughter. I was playing with three of my friends in multiplayer (And thats one awsome thing, this game has multiplayer!!!!) and it was all going well, none of my vassals really hated me as a 3 year old Queen, until... about 3 text boxes appeared. I paused the game to read them all. I'm not much of a reader, I read the entire first one, skimmed the second one, and all-out didnt even read the last one..damn, was that a bad idea. That last one said something, Still I dont know what it said, but suddenly all of Kiev was gone! Kiev was now part of Hungary (One of my friends was king of Hungary at the time, too). If only I read what that letter said I would still be Queen of Kiev and not a peasent of Hungary. But, I still love the game and I ended up just saving, leaving, and joining back in but as a diffrent King...It was fun.			"

												While a bit overwhelming at first, once you have a basic grasp of the systems at work, Crusader Kings II is a hillarious game to play, especially with friends.  Start wherever you want, and begin annexing nearby territory by pushing claims you made up with the help of your chancellor.  Become lovers with your son's wife!  Through bizzare marriage ties, make Ireland part of the Byzantine Empire!  Steamroll hapless standing armies that happen to be standing between you and your destination!  Watch as dozens of people you don't know about die to consumption in the notifications sidebar!  Fun alone, better with friends.			"

												Easily one of the best and most immersive games I have ever played. It spans almost 400 years of extremely well researched medieval history, which only gets ahistorically derailed when the player jumps in and starts changing things. The results can be LEGEN- wait for it- DARY. For instance, as Emperor of Byzantium (the almost universally beloved Emperor Joe the Cruel), I married my heir off to the childless Queen of Rus (who I put on the throne by murdering her father and brothers; she wasn't as grateful as one might imagine). She immediately started sleeping with generals and priests and giving birth to illegitimate children, almost faster than I could eliminate them. Realizing my son was a screwup unfit to succeed me, I had him and his wife killed as soon as they had a son, who inherited half of eastern europe at the ripe old age of 12 days. While grooming my young despot to succeed me, I remember my rivalry with a couple of childhood bullies of mine, so 30 years after the fact, I have the two men excommunicated, imprisoned, thrown in the oubliette, and beheaded. The same fate awaits everyone who shares thier blood. Then my wife dies, leaving my firstborn son to inherit Croatia, and my second born to inherit Hungary. They immediately go to war. Desparate to reunite my family's empire into a line of succession, I declare war on my first born son as a front  to arrest him. He kills my second born in battle, and I capture my firstborn and behead him (lauging maniacally, of course). And when I finally kick the bucket, I proceed to play as the most powerful man in the world: my five year old grandson. Half the world wants me dead, the other half wants to disempower me, and I just learned to walk. From here, I coud send my army of 60000 men east, to reunite the holy lands and prove my supremacy over the arabian superpower, or west, to lay waste to the Holy Roman Empire and with it, Papal influence over western Europe. But first, I have power to consolidate, ambitious vassals to thwart, civil wars to fight, and in-laws to assassinate. The possibilities are literally endless.This game taught me that what every other grand strategy game lack, the greatest divide between games and reality, was characters. The sheer number of characters, amount of unique chartacterization, and incredible degree to which that affects gameplay and the course of history is staggering. The driving force of the game's epic stories so rarely has as much to do with countries, armies, and rescources. Much more often, it will be individuals, and thier personalites, and the interpersonal relationships they develop that decide the course of history. The way you develop characters, from decisions you make raising your children, and the personal decisions you make throughtout your life (excellently implemented game mechanics btw), will determine your friends, enemies, piety, culture, battles, triumphs, and possibilities.

												If I had to identify the major roadblock to me enjoying grand strategy titles, it is the inevitable surging creep of the game getting harder and harder to manage as the game goes on. I'm not saying this is bad for everyone, but I find it hard to enjoy a game that is actively trying to destroy everything I've built and done for the past several hours. Imagine if you had to maintain your builds in minecraft against decay.Crusader Kings II is my #1 Grand Strategy title and one of my favorite game of all time because the gameplay doesn't have the difficulty creep. From the very moment you get vassal counts to the end game where you control entire kingdoms spanning Europe, the management of your Kingdom remains more or less the same, just increasing in quantity. Instead of having to constantly deal with everything trying to collapse around you whenever you want to expand, you face the same trials you've always faced. For me, it allows both an immersive, somewhat challenging, time-consuming experience, but without the intense frustration found in similar titles.As for the positives of the game, you not only get to rule a growing realm, becoming more and more powerful and facing the changing political situation of the map year after year, but you get to play a character and his family, worrying about keeping everyone happy so they all go along with your grand vision of world conquest. The mechanics of battle are a tad simplistic, but there is more than enough to keep you occupied as you avoid river crossing and trying to find the appropriate terrain to defend on, all the while trying to occupy your enemies lands and preventing him from doing the same to you. Religion plays a major part of the game, whether you are a Christian, Muslim, Pagan, or Jew. Keeping yourself from being excommunicated or avoiding high decadence is always a challenge for the most experienced player.If you're looking for a Grand Strategy title having been frustrated with the genre for its overly challenging difficulty curve, I'd recommend CKII in a hearbeat. Perhaps not right for every gamer, it's still a fantastic title and if you are remotely interested in Grand Strategy, Management Games, or History, you should pick this up.			"

												Very accessible grand strategy game and a great place to start if you want to get into the genre. You can get lost in the narrative of your dynasty, a narrative that you directly influence over limitless generations. The fact that you play as a distinct ruler that has to deal with betrothals and assassinations and heirs and politics, not to mention his own morality and relationships,  is what sets this game apart from other grand strategy titles. The modding community is wonderful; if you ever get tired of the base game, there are several functional overhauls available. The learning curve is somewhat steep but I am confident that almost anybody can ""get into it"" after a few play session, and it is certainly worth the learning.This game is one of my favorite games and I absolutely recommend it.

There's simply nothing else like it. Its essentially a politics, intrigue, sociology and general human interaction simulator set during the middle ages that comes closer to emulating real world human relationships, interactions and politics than any other game Ive ever played.

I love watching how my decissions impact the game in the medium and long run as family members and vassals die, plot, and do strange and unexpected things. The random elements also keep it very exciting!! In my current game I'm dabbling in ""Norse Eugenics"" and creating a ruling class of strong/quick/attractive/genius nobility. Raiding counties to capture females with these traits, making them concubines and converting them to our religion, then marrying them off to selective Norse men!! :)			"

												You see how much time I played this game. 7.5 hours. And I only know the basics. I have started this game like any other that allows this: Let's assassinate EVERYONE who doesn't like me. That way, I have found out a lot about the diplomacy; looking at why people like/hate me and looking at options other than just assassinate. I have spent only like 10 mins reading about the tips/starts on CK II and the most useful thing I found was: Start at the tutorial island (Ireland), becuase there isn't a lot going on there. Other than that, I couldn't be bothered to go through the in-game tutorials: I prefer to unpick the game by myself, so even after 100 hours of gameplay I can still find something new, something cool. Although I only played 7.5 hours, I can already recommend this game with my heart. And especially now, that it is on humblebundle. I have paid £3.39 for it and it is one of the better games I bought (along with M&B Warband with Napoleonic Wars). Shortly: GET IT IT'S EPIC			"
