												Easy to learn, hard to master. It starts out with easy missions but they get more complex and difficult as you go. It's a pretty fun game though; it's a nice break from the shoot-'em-up games. It requires a lot of patience, but I find it very fun!  Love this game!  :)			"

The idea of Solar Flux is to collect plasma particles and bring them back to sun to equalize its energy. Object seems easy, but add to this asteroids, limited fuel, solar bursts and short time. Just imagine collapsing sun... to stabilize the whole process it's important to be quick and deliver plasma energy as quick as possible. Steering is a little bit tricky and depends on recoil force of ship's thrusters. 4 different galaxies, many different stars. "

												This game is addictive and fun if you like strategy type games, and its very nice visually too. I'd like to see more casual games like this or simillar, I'm enjoying it so far. It has a lot of levels each one a different challenge, please consider giving it a go, I did and I have enjoyed playing this little gem, I also found it Quiet relaxing too. It is a nice change from other more tedious and aggressive type games.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Solar Flux Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Puzzle; Strategy; Space; Pretty Graphics My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 5-10 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Puzzle game aficionados; Game atmosphere connoisseurs REVIEWSolar Flux is a relatively simple puzzle game that makes its mark via pleasing aesthetics, well designed soundscapes, and its quasi-innovative gameplay mechanics.  Most people who generally enjoy the genre of “puzzlers” will probably be able to enjoy it; it can appeal to both casual gamers and those who thirst for a good challenge.The game can essentially be played in two ways.  Simply beating each level is not a daunting task, and, coupled with the ambient music and pretty art style, can provide a gameplay experience that is peaceful and “zen.”  Anyone who may enjoy a nice, serene game experience can find one here.Alternatively, if you are someone who wants to achieve 3-star ratings on every level to unlock all the achievements, then this game can provide a quite challenging and enjoyable task.  Be warned, however, if you are someone who would want to aim for 3-star ratings, then you should be aware that there are a few levels that may cross the threshold from challenging to frustrating.  That said, I personally felt Solar Flux was mostly fair, and properly challenging; and I believe most people will find it to be as well.The beautiful graphics and fitting soundscape are definitely the strongest positives of the game.  The controls are fluid, but may take some time to get accustomed to.  The tutorial sufficiently explains everything you will need to understand in order to beat the game, although some levels will require understanding deeper mechanics to 3-star.  There are plenty of levels and a decent amount of variety, despite the fact that the levels don’t really evolve much as you progress through the game.Solar Flux should have a level of substance and quality that can appeal to most people who are fans of the genre.  It isn’t the most profoundly innovative puzzle game out there, but it certainly offers gameplay marginally different than most games which share the genre.  Bonus points for anyone who can appreciate the aesthetics and may be a fan of celestial bodies.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												Meh...can't we at least get a 'mixed' opinion instead of a thumbs up or down on this one? :-\I thumbed it down, but it is really not without merit. The thing is: you can easily see the good points of this game. Visuals are decent and it has a good atmospheric music to go with it. And even the controls are okay...perhaps even decent.What it doesn't tell you is that it's hard. Extremely hard. To the point of insanity, even. Sure, quite some portion of that is me being not good at lunar landing kind of games. As such, this isn't the first of this sort of game I've just quit because I can't avoid one insta-death astroid without setting a deadly course to the second.The thing is: where games like solar 2 and osmos accept this difficulty of steering and don't get overboard with other things, solar flux adds more layers of frustratingly hard stuff. Stay too close to a sun and your shield melts away. Most levels have flares to pick up while traversing through insta-death asteroids, which means you have to do a pretty much perfect run. Some suns tend to explode, so there's that that may send you off into an object or deep space. Others have timers or require you to set a path you can barely see from your starting position.Oh, and you have limited ammo, so better use it wisely (which is in most levels 'close to none', as you have to time your flare-to-sun injections perfectly so the resulting explosion sends you of to where you actually want to go).Now don't get me wrong: I like hard games, and to a degree, it certainly is challenging. But I feel quite some of the difficulty should've been reserved for a hard mode (like the limited fuel and shields). Or that there'd be an easy mode without those things. And if recent hard games have learned us anything, it's that the levels should be short (which is, admittedly, more or less the case here) and shouldn't hinder the player. That's certainly an issue. After a crash, it insists on a showing a 'you crashed' message where you have to click to restart, and even then it insists on repeating the objective every freakin' time.So in the end, I'm thumbing it down because this really shouldn't be your first space sim. The difficulty curve is, IMHO, just too high. It should be okay (and perhaps even great) to those who fully mastered the movement of games like osmos and are looking for something harder. For anyone else, I'm sorry, but I'd always advise those games first. :-(			"

												Relaxing but frustrating puzzle game. Each level is a puzzle you have to figure out, then you have to use mouse clicking skills to actually complete the puzzle. I like the puzzle solving aspect, but I find the skill side a bit frustrating because your timing and clicking often has to be perfect, or you have to do it again, and again, and again... This can get a little tiresome if you're stuck on a particular level.Nice relaxing music though, and it looks pretty. Recommended if you like exercising your brain and don't mind honing the mouse skills to go with it.			"

												Not really my thing. Its ""novel"" control system of smushing your ship away by clicking feels simultaneously floaty and yet too-precise. They don't believe in using words for menus and such wherever possible, which means it's sometimes obnoxious to navigate things. Core gameplay is not very engaging (again, to me) because it's about delicate swoops and fast reaction times. I can definitely see where other people could have fun, and it has a nice trance-void-techno aesthetic, but if you have similar tastes to me (meaty puzzles and RPGs, keeping twitch-gaming to FPS and the like) the game is going to feel immaterial and bland. 4/10, but depending on how much you enjoy the presentation/style this could go up to 8/10. I'm not recommending, but how good it is feels way more subjective than most games.			"

												Another game in the long list of brilliant post-2008 indie outings. Solar Flux has minimalist, yet aesthetically very pleasing visuals, a good soundscape, simple and tight controls, and a gameplay that's reasonably difficult when you go for just completion, and fiendish at places when you plan to achieve 3 stars in all scenarios.Just one detail to add - many of the obscure-looking 3-star challenges actually have very elegant solutions.Highly recommended!

												I completed all of the Solar Flux puzzles in just under 3 hours. If you are into breaking records and completeing all acheivements then you will be playing much longer. I would recommend buying this game if...A) You like puzzle games.B) You like outer space.C) If it is on sale for cheap.Pros- Creates a nice atmosphere of suns, planets, etc- Gameplay is smooth on either the mouse or the gamepad- Not too frustrating but more relaxing (breaking current records may get very frustrating)- Great concept for a puzzle gameCons- The music was not as atmospheric/ambient as I would have hoped for (This was corrected by turning the game music off    and playing my own soundtrack)- I felt they could have expanded on the space theme. Suns, planets and black holes were great but I felt the time bombs didn't fit into the setting at all. They should have replaced them with an exploding comet or something found in outer spaceOverall this is one of those good little games to pick up during a Steam sale.

												The devs describe Solar Flux as ""a challenging puzzle strategy game"". This is not correct. Well, there is an element of strategy to each and every computer game, so let's reserve the 'strategy' label for RTS (=""real time strategy"", after all) games and the likes. But more importantly: this is not a puzzle game at all. You see, this is not a game of brain teasing puzzles or anything remotely like that. You don't even need to think about ""what's the solution here?"". The solution is very clear from the start of each mission, but the challenge is executing that solution. So this is a game of dexterity and timing.Solar Flux is challenging, I have to give them that. The problem is that the challenge quickly becomes a full-blown chore. In the first few missions, you are introduced to the basics of the game: you need to collect plasma bubbles with your space ship and then fire that plasma at the sun(s) to stabilize them. I had fun with these missions, so the basic idea is sound, although I couldn't imagine executing half of the missions perfectly (what Solar Flux calls ""win 3 stars in the mission""). So I thought: ""Ok I'll leave the 3 stars challenges to the people who want to go for that and I'll just try to at least get through all the missions once ('one star quality')."" But that soon became too much of a chore, as well, so I call it quits. A game should be challenging but not utterly frustrating. And in my opinion, Solar Flux crosses that line. When browsing the reviews for Solar Flux, you'll notice that almost all the reviews that are longer than 20 words call this game frustrating in some way, even when the reviewer recommends the game. If you like a challenge to the point of frustration and if you take note of the fact that this is a game of dexterity and timing and not a puzzle game, you have all the elements you need to decide if this game is for you. However, I would strongly advise against paying full price (€8,99 atm) for Solar Flux. Games like this are on sale often enough.A word about the Steam Achievements: 22 of the 32 achievements require you to complete the missions perfectly (the '3 star' thing I talked about earlier). So the more casual player will only be able to get 10/32 achievements at the most. 8 achievements are easy to get in the first few levels, and 2 achievements are granted for completing all the levels. I don't think the devs really thought this through. This means that 70% of the achievements require you to complete their game in the equivalent of 'nightmare mode'. And the casual gamers earn all the achievements they will get in the first half hour of the game. If this would have been better spread out, the achievements might at least have been an incentive for some people to put up with the frustration of playing this game.			"

												Solar Flux starts off seeming like a decently fun casual puzzle game. However about 30 min in the game starts to get a little annoying. If you are able to actually beat everything like I did you might end up hating the game. This game has got to be one of the most frustrating games I have played in a while. The game itself isn't bad. The sounds and visuals are all fine. My only, but also huge gripe with Solar Flux is that the whole game's premise doesn't actually add up to a fun game for me when you include the other elements of the game like dying in one collision or taking massive damage from star radiation. The problem is that you are controlling a ship in space. Because you are in space, friction does not exist. Therefore movement becomes extremely clunky. For space simulation this is fine. But when precise movements that determine whether you get 3 stars or die a horrible death are required, this movement system is simply not fun. That being said I am still recommending this game because I think true fans of the genre will still enjoy it. Since I tilt really easily from games like this it was probably not made for me.Also in my opinion there is not enough content to justify 10 USD. Wait for a sale.			"

Despite things I dislike, it's quite well made game.Technically game has good sounds & music, visuals and level design.The main point of recommendation is that I obtained such game for free, so it's worth... otherwise I suggest heavy sale...However, everything you do in game is by... mouse (except, pressing ESC). So, to restart level, you don't press ""R"", no, you have to ESC -> refresh/reload symbol.Then, after 1 hour this game crashed...Leaderboard scores are not always saved and probably there are cheaters on those lists...And gameplay itself is sometimes too slow... sometimes very hard or unfair. If you like games that poses you a lot of challenges - time trials, ""precision"" trials, ""mechanical""... then it's definitely for you.			"

The puzzles require timing and planning ahead.Levels require different objectives to earn three stars (least fuel used, least heat damage taken, timed, etc). You can slingshot around planets.

												Their are dozens of puzzle games these days. Some are really fast action things like tetris or Bequeled where you have to think on your feet and have fast reflexes. Others are esoteric and ask you to solve problems like adventure games in the vein of myst, king's quest, machinarium, etc. This game struggles with picking a camp. Some levels ask you to go through outrageously fast, while others take a lot of time (or at least it feels like a lot of time by comparison). It also has a reallly terrible difficulty curve that seesaws between difficult levels and cakewalks which you have to deal with starting in the first chapter of the game, and is still an issue by the fourth and last area. Graphics and controls do their job, I kinda like straight up space: Lots of pretty pictures of Nebulas and Wolf-Rayet Stars and things are included in this game. It's always easy to tell what is background and what is a phyiscs object, which some of these games struggle with.You get levels that ask for a degree of pre-planning and then precision execution of each step, and then levels with such a bizarre 1-step solution that the only way to find it is to keep throwing trial and error restarts using different angles and timings, and then watch the game play itself when you finally get it right. This is the main problem with the game. Satisfaction. It's addictive enough where you want to beat all these par challenges, but once you've overcome them, you don't get any sense of ""♥♥♥♥ YEAH I DID IT""			"

												Well, I had high hopes for this game, thinking it was a modern version of Solar 2. It is not. BUT, it still turned out to be a pretty damn gopod game in its own right. It is a physics puzzle type game where you go around colelcting plasma balls and shooting them into stars to save them from death. You start out on a space station where you l;aunch yourself in whichever direction you wish, and there is planets and debris scattered around that you need to navigate through. You can use the planets orbits to your advantage to move without using up your fuel, and the same goes for shooting plasma into the stars, it creates an energy burst which also can propel you. Pretty clever little game, im glad i bought it, i reccomend it for anyone who is into casual physics puzzle games. Things like Angry birds or Gravity Badgers. This game is along the lines of those, but more complex and in my opinion a LOT better.			"

Maybe it's a little thing, but it made me rage quit the game - each and every time you restart you have to stare for 1-2 seconds at rhe mission title screen.Also, a minor one here, none of the buttons have captions.

												Solar Flux is a physics puzzle game with a space setting. With your space ship you need to collect plasma balls and shoot them into the suns to make them stable. The space ship is controlled by clicking behind the space ship like in Osmos and there are other mechanics like solar flares that you need to take in mind. The puzzles are challenging and the game looks good. It's a nice little casual puzzle game.			"

												This game is really one dimensional. Once you've figured out what to do on a certain level, you're going to have to spend a couple of minutes fondling around with the controls trying to get skim through the levels.It could've been good, if it was longer, and more about puzzles. Right now, it's just a boring construct of a game that feels like it is uncompleted. There could've been more mechanics in the game, more levels that were about actual brain-work rather than frustrating maneuvering. Because of this, it doesn't stand out. There is really nothing special about this game.The soundtrack, visuals, effects, sounds... Are nothing special IMO.This game isn't worth $10, but it is worth $0<$5 whenever the occasional sale arrives.			"

												This game looks gorgeous and tries to expand on its mechanics in varied and interesting ways.However, I have a hard time reconciling the demanding and arbitrary goals with the frustrating movement in a way that provides enjoyment. Slingshotting my spaceship around a moon should feel exhilarating rather than tedious. To the extent that this game succeeds as a series of puzzles to be solved, it also fails by making the execution of solutions a bore to carry out, robbing the player of any joy in their triumph. On top of this gameplay loop, the after-mission scoring punishes the player for not conserving enough fuel/succeeding quickly enough/etc. The idea of playing through the same mission again to conserve an extra one percent of my fuel is painful enough to make me turn back from the game completely, and the promise of trudging through another solution is not intriguing enough to keep me moving forward.

												Solar Flux has got to be my new favourite puzzler. Each mission involves you attempting to save dying suns from oblivion either by feeding them plasma to either increase their power, or to reduce their power to prevent a supernova.  Your ship has minimal thrusting power and so you must rely on the gravitationaly pull of nearby planets and asteroids to slingshot around the sector as you collect the plasma. In addition to this, whenever you shoot your collected plasma into the star, a solar flare is formed, which you can ride along to get an extra boost. The closest game I think Solar Flux reminds me of is Captain Ludwig for IOS. Both have a very similar physics system (look it up if you like, Ludwig's also a pretty good game). Apart from collecting plasma, you've also got to worry about your shield strength - which depletes whenever you are positioned in the sun's lght (you can hide in asteroid shadows to replenish this). There's also the fuel meter to keep an eye on, use all your fuel and the ship will be dead in the wat.. um space dust. This is wheere the game adds the replayability. Much like how angry birds challenges you to use the fewest birds, Solar Flux rewards players for minimal fuel consumption, indeed many missions are possible to complete without using a drop! The satisfaction from zero fuel usage you get is pretty good.Overall, the game is a great little puzzler, easy to learn the basics, but still with plenty of challenge. Adding to that the minimalistic visuals and great space ambience music, Firebrand having done an excellent job of porting an already good tablet game to the pc.			"

												Solar Flux Review - Raymond KTSummary: Travel across the universe and save dying suns from extinction in this unique and challenging puzzle strategy game. You are the last hope to bring salvation to a perishing universe as you collect and deliver fragments of plasma using your omni-directional ship.What it doesn't tell you is that it's hard. Extremely hard. To the point of insanity, even. Sure, quite some portion of that is me being not good at lunar landing kind of games. As such, this isn't the first of this sort of game I've just quit because I can't avoid one insta-death astroid without setting a deadly course to the second.The thing is: where games like solar 2 and osmos accept this difficulty of steering and don't get overboard with other things, solar flux adds more layers of frustratingly hard stuff. Stay too close to a sun and your shield melts away. Most levels have flares to pick up while traversing through insta-death asteroids, which means you have to do a pretty much perfect run. Some suns tend to explode, so there's that that may send you off into an object or deep space. Others have timers or require you to set a path you can barely see from your starting position.Oh, and you have limited ammo, so better use it wisely (which is in most levels 'close to none', as you have to time your flare-to-sun injections perfectly so the resulting explosion sends you of to where you actually want to go).

												Plagued with technical problems as many Steam users report ""Fatal Errors"" on launching due to the hamfisted way the developers hook into the Steam DRM API, Solar Flux must be some pretty good game to go through all the efforts of troubleshooting the launcher (because the developers don't bother with testing). Once you get past the technical hurdles, you'll be disappointed to discover yet another tablet game has been ported to PC. Graphics are simple 2D graphics - we should be thankful the developer at least put in enough effort to make it more than a retro pixel game, but they didn't bother much more than that.Gamplay is disappointingly simple as you would expect from a tablet game.   A lame physics engine no more advanced than Asteroids from last century, this ""puzzler"" has you moving around and interacting with gravity wells to collect some blips before they blow up other blips.   This isn't particularly more interesting than Asteroids.There's no compelling reason to buy this game.  The whole thing could be done in HTML5.   It's a desperate money grab from a low rate developer to squeeze some money out of porting a tablet game to PC.   The launcher bugs should be warning enough to anyone.			"

												It's an alright game but boringSolar Flux is a physics based puzzler where you are a ship that needs to shoot orbs into the sun (just go with it). The puzzly part of the game is that you have limited amounts of time, shields, and fuel which means you need to use gravity and solar flares to your advantage. If you are really into puzzlers and are a completionist, then you'll have fun with it as it is a good challenge.However, I had no motivation to get 3 stars on every level as there is nothing on the line. The game commits the cardinal sin of locking off levels until you score a certain amount on the previous levels but if the levels are the same, then I don't care. There is no story (which is fine) but without that, it's just boring and I was glad that I finished it. The game is also short (ignore the 19 hour time reported as I left the game on to get trading cards).Overall, if you are really into puzzlers or got it for pretty cheap, go for it. Otherwise, get something else.			"

												This game appears to have been created with Mobile in mind; that being said, it is much better than other games targeting the same market because the icons make sense and the options aren't as limiting as most other; ie you have a music slider, sound slider, invert thrust option, resolution setting and fullscreen toggle but there is not an option for borderless windowed which should be included ( I use a separate app to enable it on most games called Borderless Gaming although it is bugged being it won't save favorites on any version I've tried from 8.1 and up to 8.4 ). I won't be judging this game as harshly as other mobile games because of the extended options, high quality graphics, clean ui / menu and overall quality of code and lack of bugs ( as of right now I have yet to experience a bug in the game ).Solar Flux is a Space Puzzle Game with limited physics in place ( space craft thruster, no friction, no gravity pulling you into an orbit, etc... if you launch directly at a planet you will enter orbit which I'm not a fan of; with suns you will crash into them and you can not orbit them unless you enter planetary orbit which is orbiting the sun.. all of the orbiting is on rails ). I wouldn't identify it as strategy because solving puzzles often requires thoughtThe aim of the game is to refuel dying stars, or remove excess energy from stars that are pulsing ( plus actions I have yet to experience; believed to be destroying asteroids, etc... ) by using no fuel or as little fuel as possible and ensuring your shields are not damaged ( self-replenishing after delay ) or damaged as little as possible.The controls are simplified; Click and Right click. Right click will let you aim a space station to launch your vehicle and click with activate thrusters ( HOLD ) which can be toggled to invert ( thruster adds velocity towards your cursor ) or default ( away from cursor ).The graphics are quite nice. The background is multi-layered so some stars appear closer than those in the bottom-most layer. Shadows also appear and look good when they appear; some levels revolve around using them ( either for aiming rebounds or to hide to prevent solar flares or bursts from affecting the craft ).In terms of how long it'll take to beat the game, here's an idea of how many levels there are:There are 4 galaxies: Helios with 6 sectors and 69 possible stars ( 3 per level = 23 ), Oceanus with 3 sectors and 54 possible stars ( 3 per level = 18 ), Hyperion unknown, Cerberus unknown - haven't unlocked unknown yet so this review is will the first galaxy completed ( doesn't take long ) and the second only partially looked at ( I, at first, thought there'd only be one type of sun, the yellow star like our planet Earth, but there are different types and they're beautiful ).Each level can be solved anywhere from a few seconds onward depending on how well you time the bursts to ride on, of which you ride the tangent. Some levels are based on time where the longer the level timer progresses, the lower the energy of the dying sun falls or the higher the energy of a sun going into supernova expells until you either succeed or fail by supplying enough plasma or anti/negative-plasma to the sun or by not having enough plasma or anti/negative-plasma to launch into the sun left on the level and in your spaceship.My game-time isn't accurate as I left the game open to write down the information below ( achievements, menu design, etc... ) etc...UI / Icons and meaning along with achievements list and statistics list ( for those interested ) will be posted as a comment...U rotated left 90 degrees with arrow on top leg = Back ( displayed top left when on menu-screen other than main menu )Cog = Options / SettingsTrophy = Achievements ( Savior = Restore sun to 100% equilibrium; Hopper = Surfed between 2 planets without thrusting; Solar surfer = Rode 3 flares in a row without thrusting; Nice shot = Used plasma to collect and deliver other plasma; Convervationist = completed a mission without using any fuel; vampire = completed a mission without taking any shield damage; Scavenger = Delivered 90% plasma in a single shot; Victorius = Saved all of the main sectors; Bonus bounty = saved all of the bonus sectors; Training Sector Star = Completed all tutorial missions; [ NOTE: Following = won all 3 stars in their respective missions or zone ]: Ignition Sector Star; Voyager Sector Star; Solar Prism Sector Star; Evolution Sector Star; Beyond Sector Star; Asteroids Sector Star; Force Fields Sector Star; Orbital Sector Star; Abyss Sector Star; Meteors Sector Star; Mines Sector Star; Ricochet Sector Star; Cronus Sector Star; Flux Sector Star; Dark Stars Sector Star; Odyssey Sector Star; Void Sector Star; Helios Galaxy Hero; Oceanus Galaxy Hero; Hyperion Galaxy Hero; Cerberus Galaxy Hero; Galactic Champion = Won 3 stars in all galaxies )Graph with arrow climbing then falling then climbing = Game Statistics ( % completed, tie played, galaxies / sectors / missions completed, achievements / bonus sectors unlocked, helios / oceanus / hyperon / cerberus missions attempted,  plasma collected / delivered, fuel expended / refilled, shield damaged / recharged, distance traveled, time spent in light / shaddows / orbit, suns saved / lost / extinguished, novas, slingshots, solar surfs, biggest surf chain, ships destroyed, meteors destroyed, mines detonated )Winners Podium ( 1, 2, 3 ) = Leaderboard with: My Rank ( you in list with others ranked near you if you've played yet, otherwise top players ), vs friends, and top players 1 - 16Circle with F deleted / transparent is the only one that doesn't make sense = CreditsX = Quit with confirm dialogCenter of screen is an attention grabbing PLAY ( > filled icon ) with circles ""orbiting"" in opposing directions on top of the sun which means play.Background cosists of a Sun at the center with solar flares coming off, an eclipse above that, scrolling stars / universe and dust clouds.

												Challenging and addictive puzzle game - just like it should be. Made me rage-quit a few times (which is a good thing, though). However, some levels would benifit from extra polishing and background music would be a nice addition.			"

												Only just started, but seems to be a fun mechanic with the ability to play as a casual style with lots of levels and interesting physics style puzzles.   I play to get through level rather than to get perfect 3 star scores, so it is fairly easy overall.  Play is much more challanging when you try to get those perfect scores (but satisfying as well).  Very easy to pick up and play for short periods (which is a plus for me).  No real flaws for me yet.  Nice music and graphics.  I'll update if things change over time.			"

												Even though it's not really my kind of game, I do recommend it because I think it is a good game for those who like this genre. For me, it just leads to endless frustration and I'll end up throwing a tantrum at my computer for not responding correctly :). I do like the visual and audial presentation, so that was a plus in my short time with this game.			"

												Good physically based space game in which you have to collect plasma orb and use them to save the stars. To do this you have to orbit around planets, fly in space, and stay in the shadow of the planets to avoid overheating.The levels aren't too difficult unless you want to obtain all three stars, in this case some level could become a little bit frustating but not impossibles.
