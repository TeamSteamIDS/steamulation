												The Bridge is made from M. C. Escher's nightmares.  Normally that would be a bad thing, but in this case, it's very good.  The Bridge is a puzzle game with a simple premise: Reach the exit door.  Your only tool is control over the direction of gravity though you can only change its direction slowly.  You will need to avoid deadly obstacles and obtain keys to unlock doors in order to escape.While a few of the levels require frustrating levels of repetition and precision in order to reach your goal, most of them are very enjoyable.  In total there are 24 puzzles and 24 mirror versions which add some elements of difficulty in addition to being reversed.  Strangely I found the mirror versions of some of the hardest levels easier than their normal counterparts.  Even if you aren't into puzzle games, the Escher-like artwork is worth marveling at.One thing I found missing in the game is music.  It seems like a greatly missed opportunity for a unique and strange soundtrack to match the level design.  There is some music in the game but it plays rarely and is very quiet.The other major weakness I found is probably not something many players will encounter:  The collectibles.  Some are absurdly difficult to find, and one even requires you doing something that the game constantly tells you doesn't work for the entire game.  When you do locate them all, the reward is extremely anticlimactic.  It's annoying but like I said, the majority of players probably won't bother with the collectibles and those that do will most likely use guides so they don't go insane trying to find them all.As a fan of puzzle games, I greatly enjoyed The Bridge.  You will too!			"

												With the many platformers and puzzle games constantly being released, The Bridge changes up the puzzle genre with an extremely unique take on puzzles. This game forces the player to view the game in different ways. The mind-bending puzzles has the player's reevaluate the preconceptions they've had on physics and perspective of the world.""It is Isaac Newton meets M.C. Escher.""The puzzles consist of one or many intricate architectures where the player has to manipulate gravity to complete the levels. The levels of the puzzles gradually increase, leaving a sense of accomplishment after completing them. The beginning puzzles start out extremely easy, letting the player finish in a minute or two, but the puzzles towards the end can leave a player stump for days unless they look up a guide or have someone else look at the puzzle (a different set of eyes can look at the puzzle at a different angle).Not only is The Bridge a highly intellectual game, the artwork is something to behold. Many art enthusiasts would enjoy the game, simply for the art. The art style is hand drawn black-and-white lithograph. At first glance, the art did not appeal to me, but after completing the game 100%, I saw how beautiful something so simple can be.With all that said, I dare you, reader, to complete this game 100%. The puzzles can leave you weary and your brain hurting, but the sense of accomplishment is well worth it. "

												I see quite a few people picking this up at the very low sale price. Just in case there's anyone else sitting on the fence about this, I thought I should add a note of caution. This is essentially a physics puzzler, which is ostensibly a genre I enjoy. In this case however, I think the the execution fails to live up to the ideas. For me, most of the challenge in the game came not through reasoning through the puzzles (though there were moments), but in wrestling with object momentum that frequently ended up being more frustrating than satisfying. At the sale price of $1 it's hard to argue that it's a waste of money. But I feel that personally for me it ended up being a waste of time. And that's something a low price does nothing to help. I see many good things written elsewhere about this game, so I may be in a minority in feeling this way, but I can't help but feel that there are far better puzzle games out there, despite the compelling visual style that I still find appeals to me even though it also triggers memories of annoying level design.

												If You like puzzles, it's a must.  M.C. Escher paintings, gone wild as a game of mind bending 4D puzzles.  Seemingly Simple, Yet so complex!It is a level-iteration of what you'd expect Fez to have been, puzzle-wise.   You will get frustrated, you will get stuck.

												Like a lot of other players, I was immediately sold on The Bridge's concept and art style. Both are certainly very solid: Mind-bending puzzles in a graphite or charcoal sketch style inspired by the works of M.C. Escher. Puzzles work by rotating the level and moving your character, and solutions often require managing gravities that work in several different directions within the same level. There's little not to love with that description, and that is ultimately what sold me on the game.What ultimately comes out of that concept, however, is little beyond an exercise in tedium. There are several details in the game's execution that leave more to be desired. (Full disclosure: I reached about halfway through Chapter 4 before realizing that I was not enjoying myself in the slightest.) First, and most noticeably, is the ambling pace of both the character's movement and that of the level rotation. Many times, I found myself just idly holding a direction for several seconds, waiting for the level to reach the desired orientation while my character impotently shuffled about trying to gain footing on the shifting ground. Or I'd end up dragging my feet along a ""twisting"" path -- which usually turns out to be ultimately linear -- to my destination, long after having worked out the solution. I appreciate a good, thoughtfully paced puzzle experience, but perhaps the motion of the level and character should actually match that speed of thought.Perhaps more egregious, though, is that the puzzles, while sometimes fairly challenging, never actually feel satisfying to solve. Unlike other more clever puzzle platformers, there were never any ""Oh, yeah! THAT'S how I'll do it!"" moments while playing The Bridge. Everything seemed to just kind of putt along, and reaching a solution seemed like a given more than an actual achievement. Perhaps it gets more interesting after Chapter 4, but that's the point that I gave up.Other objections could be made of how highly derivative -- downright imitative -- the game is of a certain other time-bending puzzle platformer. One could suggest that shoehorned time reversal mechanic adds absolutely nothing to the game experience other than harking to another better game. Arguments could be made that the narrative and level structures are almost identical to that one game with the timey wimey stuff. One could do all that, if one wasn't enjoying playing Braid so much more.Overall, I wouldn't personally recommend The Bridge, unless you picked it up on sale and don't mind tediously trudging through admittedly very competently illustrated puzzles for a few hours. I commend the developers and wish them the best for their future games, but hopefully next time they won't try to make Braid 2: The Rebraidening.			"

												The Bridge is definitely one of those games that want to make you rip out your hair, in both frustration and outcome satisfaction, all for one good reason; cryptic, mind-boggling puzzles inspired by history's graphics artists makes you feel like you're on top of the world after you've unraveled through each puzzle. By the end of the game, you really do deserve a medal, is the kind of accomplishment I'm talking about.The game consists of getting the unnamed, old chap through to the exit door in each level, to advance. The game's puzzles, inspired by the Dutch artist, M. C. Escher, who plays a massive aspect in this game, as the world and its environment is shown in grayscale with beautifully hand-drawn illustrations. Obstacles such as voids, which can suck you and other objects into a swirly mess, ''Menace Balls'' that can roll around the puzzle world and flatten you to death. Even steep cliffs that could slip you off the world and fall to your death. With all these dangers aside, you can use this to your advantage by rotating the maze world around you as well as reversing the flow of time, to cheat your demise. Along with controlling the core of elemental physics and gravitational pulls, Isaac Newton, eat your heart out.I personally love the dark and rather gothic visual world this game sinks its teeth into. The world is truly a marvel to behold, not only for its diverse, colourless design, but for its ingenuity and artistic flare. You could literally stand there in a level, and just analyse every single little detail that had been hand-drawn and just get lost in the rich, beautiful and elegant designs. It doesn't just go for the levels, even the real world locations makes me feel as if I was reading a gothic child's book, what with its vague nostalgic environments and architecture.The only problem I have with this game is that it's incredibly short, when counting it has only 4 chapters, with only 6 puzzles each. But, with this game's cryptic puzzling, it will keep you stumped out of ideas, as you overcomplicate things and try to get things in the right motion. I'm guilty to say that I've got stuck on one tiny puzzle that left me clueless for over half an hour. Other than that, the controls can be a little iffy here and there, as the game only allows firm movements set in the right motion and time.Definitely a recommendation from me, if you're the brainy independent-type. And yes, I'm not that independent, as I did use a walkthrough guide for this game. Ruined the experience, I know, but definitely pick up this game and don't look for outside help as it does ruin it!			"

												Largely inspired by the abstract paintings of M.C. Escher, The Bridge is an equally abstract puzzle games which merges gorgeous artwork with an almost Marble Madness-esque tilt mechanic to create an original, evocative experience. It asks you to set aside traditional logic, and adopt a new mindset in a world created on and by its own unique rules, which prove harder to adopt to than you might think.The constant flux of gravity is at the center of every puzzle, requiring you to rotate the entire level in order to make your way to the exit. New mechanics such as items which exist in opposition of your own gravity, ones which can only be used by inverting yourself, and other various means to hinder your progress, are introduced as you progress but the basic foundation that up and down are perhaps one and the same holds the game together as things become more and more esoteric in design. It's a very thoughtful game, even in terms of the controls that although sluggish at first, become an integral part of the contemplative pacing once you've adjusted to the relatively slow speed at which everything moves.Underneath the puzzles is a story largely open to interpretation. There are hints at what the protagonist, a nameless but brilliant mathematician was attempting, but right up to the end pieces are purposely left out so as to let your come to your own conclusions. While this works fantastically for the narrative, when it begins to bleed into the gameplay the experience becomes slightly too obtuse and the end goal less and less focused. This is most apparent in the later stages where the difficulty is highest, but the rules as to how everything works still obnoxiously unclear. Even having completed them, I couldn't explain to you how many of the mechanics work, which I feel for the style of game is a rather big problem. Solving a puzzle should be something I can figure out on my own, not a random series of events that somehow allows me to arrive at the same conclusion, and yet this is exactly what happened much of the time.Despite the occasional frustration I had with the level designs, my predominant experience was one of continual wonder and curiosity as I made my way through the gorgeously drawn environments, accompanied by unexpectedly grand sound design and a reposed score that creates the feeling that something is amiss without the need for lengthy cutscneses or drawn out dialog.It's an exceptionally artistic journey, but a short one. I completed the game in just under two and a half hours, and while this does unlock mirrored versions of every level (a minor switch that adds an unexpectedly hefty challenge), I personally didn't feel compelled to complete them. Regardless, if you were intrigued by the art design I wouldn't hesitate to pick this up. While it definitely seemed to lack...something....the end result is still a rewarding and highly intriguing game that kept me engaged and left many puzzles wonderfully open to ponder after I put it down. Though one can only wonder what he would think of such an unusual offspring of his artwork, I feel if Escher was alive today he'd be as impressed as I am with Ty Taylor and Mario Castañeda's strange creation, which might ironically get him some new fans of his own.

												Ever since Antichamber, I've really loved the idea of the challenge of a puzzle or puzzle game as a whole revolving about things not operating by the rules. This game does exactly that. Beginning with the very basics, it introduces new elements which operate by their own rules, giving just enough hints to understand what they do, but leaving the rest up to your discovery. Also, the pencil graphics are really charming, and the soundtrack fits perfectly and makes this a pleasant game to sit down and play with.			"

												The Bridge is Mind bending puzzle game.It deals with gravity, prespectives, movement and momentum. (physics)It has a unique Art style, which gives a good atmosphere to it.It tells a story through fragments of pictures and clues here and there, but the gamaplay is about solving the puzzles.If you give attention to loading screens, you can reveal some secrets somtimes.In short, great puzzle game, I enjoyed solving all puzzles, I liked the art style as well.You can see the Acheivmants section if you want more challenge, there are some good ones.Although, I should mention that its not that kind casual ""puzzle"" game that anyone would like, I advise to see gameplay video.What also I liked about this game and didn't see that before is when I reach a level then later when luanch the game, it loads directly to that level.

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: The Bridge Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Puzzle; Casual; Platformer My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 5-9 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Puzzle game aficionados; Casual gamers REVIEWThe Bridge is definitely a solid puzzler game.  It's easy to jump into and get the hang of, and it does a good job of presenting new mechanics to the gameplay to keep things fresh as you progress.  There is an exceptional job done in finding a way to create challenging, thought-provoking puzzles without being overly frustrating.  The art isn't mind-blowing but it fits the atmosphere of the game very well.  The controls feel natural from the start, and that's important because there is a small amount of platforming required for some of the puzzles. Luckily it is nothing too over-the-top that it ruins the game for those who are trying to enjoy it as a puzzle game and aren't good at platformers. I should note, though, that I was using a controller; which I felt was more comfortable than the keyboard.And one cool addition is the time-warp feature. As with other games where time manipulation is a feature, it can really go a long way to ensure the game doesn’t become too tedious. If you make a mistake during a level you can rewind a few seconds without having to start all over. All in all, I think The Bridge does a good job delivering what it intends to.  I believe a good puzzle game these days needs to find a way to be innovative and challenging without being frustrating and redundant, and this game delivers in that regard.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												Few games capture the academic thought process as well as The Bridge. Our hero--bearded, bespectacled, and dressed in a tweed coat--may fit the classic stereotype of a university professor, but everyone from students to deans will recognize his struggles. We find him alone in a black and white world that reflects the graceful simplicity of pure logic, and we watch him discard unsatisfactory ideas and leave eraser smudges as a reminder of his mistakes. It's a lonely world, fraught with many moments of frustration and suffering from occasional tedium, but every now and then it rewards you with flashes of insight that make the whole endeavor worthwhile.Every puzzle in The Bridge gives you the simple goal of walking through a door. A constant juggle of physics, gravity, and perspective complicates this structure, however, and the game wastes little time in delivering delightful challenges.This progression happens quickly, or rather, it does if you're mentally agile enough to get past the puzzles in a timely manner. Indeed, The Bridge is a short game if you judge it by its 24 short levels. The surrounding world is very alluring. The Bridge's aesthetic draws heavily on the perspective-bending work of M.C. Escher, and much like his art, each level unfolds in grayscale hues that evoke penciled illustrations.What's most refreshing, however, is the game's dedication to minimalism. For most of The Bridge, it's just you and the game, and no health bars or item counters mar that serenity.There's an intriguing story here, too, but piecing it together requires some of the same brainwork you apply to the puzzles. The narrative is not obvious, but it makes itself known in the details.Although rage-inducing difficulty spikes exist, The Bridge generally offers a middle path that should appeal both to newcomers and to expert puzzle solvers.

												Let me start by saying that The Bridge is not a bad game. For an indie game the developers should be proud of what they've accomplished. If there were a somewhere-between-thumbs-up-and-thumbs-down button this is the game I would most want to use it for.I leaned on the side of not recommending it though, for several reasons. This game is inevitably compared to Braid because it has an artsy style, time manipulation, and puzzles. But it's nowhere near the level of those other puzzle games I love, including Braid or Limbo or even Master Reboot. The reason is mostly depth and story. There simply isn't that much here. And what does exist is far too obscure and limited to be moving.Beyond that, the puzzles range from straightforward to extremely frustrasting. The difficulty never really flattened out: I either had a level figured out in the first minute, or could stare at it forever with limited success. A few puzzles required some split second timing, which given the controls and precision in this game (they're laggy and your character can't move fast at all) made them very annoying. It was essentially just repeat forever until you happen to squeeze by.The black and white art might have actually hurt the game more than helped, as it could be hard to tell the difference between some things that were only separated by shades of gray. As for the music, I hardly noticed it, so it didn't leave much of an impact.My final complaint is performance. This is a 2D game with limited effects, but even on an absurdly powerful machine it got extremely choppy at points. It was somewhere down near 1 frame per 2 seconds while I was in freefall. That's just not acceptable, even for an indie game.So overall if you're itching for a puzzle game and don't mind the lack of story, and can look past the game's other flaws, then you can pick up The Bridge and it will give you what you want for a few hours. But personally, I won't be coming back to it any time soon.			"

												The BridgeThe game has a strong philosophical theme: main character resembling a early ninetieth century German philosopher, the idea of changing the world around you, strong symbolism, etc. This theme blends perfectly with the mechanics of the game, the music and the idea of a greyscale drawing graphic. The puzzles are really hard (at least they have been for me) and to solve them you have to discard your idea of gravity, because here everything is relative. From the simple but also great idea of giving the player 2 sets of controls, one for the main character and one for the world, the developers made a little masterpiece.This game answers the question as to whether games are an artform. The game is fun :).....			"

												Probably one of my most favourite games ever; I am a huge M.C. Escher fan myself, and I am always on the lookout for more challenging puzzle platformers. The Bridge combined both, using the rules of gravity to make a challenging puzzle game with the beautiful art of Escher.In each level you can rotate the world so that up becomes down or left becomes up, which you need to do in order to reach the goal. The further you get in the game, the more additional challenges that are added, with the gravity pull working in a different direction for other objects and the like.Admitted; one of the achievements is to find all the wisps, and I wouldn't have been able to find all of them without the use of a guide. But even so, this game is a lot of fun and will make your brain stay active! If you're like me and looking for a challenge, then this game is definitely worth it!			"

Short version: 83%The Bridge is a somewhat pretentious but great puzzle game about surreal perspectives and geometry. The difficulty rating will surely make it memorable for those who manage to somehow reach its end. Long version:Many things have been said about the Bridge. About the innovation of using puzzles based on impossible geometry (like the Penrose triangle). About the creativity of the hand-drawn black and white visual style. About the eerie, surreal story.All of it is true. And all of it is (geatly) exaggerated.First and foremost: the Bridge is nothing more than a set of rotation puzzles with good friction and momentum physics. Some levels are good. Some require a lot of tiresome fidgeting around to find that roughly 0.01° window to pull off the solution.Don’t get me wrong: the puzzle design is great. It is also a little sadistic, especially in the second half of the game. This makes you to stop and think about the core of the problem instead of sheer trial and error, so it achieves that many other puzzle games could not.Next to the difficulty, the most memorable feature of the Bridge is the visual style, which reminds us to the black & white underground obscure graphic novels from the late seventies. Strange as it may sound, but this surreal imagery really fits a logic-based puzzle game.This warped mindset carries itself through the story, or more precisely the very conscious choice of not having any form of story whatsoever. It is just a collection of surrealistic monologues that try to make the player think deeper things into the levels than what they really are: a set of good rotational puzzles with really high difficulty.

												Up until the middle of Ch4, the puzzles were pretty straight forward and logical. After that, things seem to make very little sense, there doesn't seem to be much logic to what's going on, and advancing through the game becomes a matter of trial and error rather than solving problems through logical thinking. As things became rather random, the game just turned into a rather frustrating, annoying experience.			"

tl;dr -> Played this game on acid, and now I keep trying to tilt the world and see everything as an M.C. Escher painting. 11/10 life perspective changing.If you like puzzle platformers, tilting the game world around, and M.C. Escher artstyle, then you will enjoy this game.The aesthetics are very nice - everything is hand-drawn in black-and-white. The details in the scenery are good and varied enough to keep things interesting. The music is decent, but I quickly muted it in favor of my own. Controls are simple and easy to learn - much of your playthrough will involve rotating the game world left or right. There is a brief tutorial and large tip popups are provided when necessary (like when you die). The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with platform puzzlers. I found most of the level solutions to be fairly intuitive and solvable through a bit of trial-and-error. Gameplay involves you trying to reach a door to the next level. To get there, you will have to navigate through the level, most likely rotating the world in different ways to assist you. The door may sometimes be locked, forcing you to first obtain a key. As you progress through the game, new elements are added to keep you on your toes. Without wanting to spoil any surprises, some of the first additions include  a ball that instantly kills you on touch and a vortex that will keep anything that touches it suspended . You have the ability to reverse time as far back as you wish to correct any mistakes. Some levels require a light touch - you may have to slowly rotate the world to get things where you need them to be. Inspired by M.C. Escher's artstyle, physically-impossible level layouts require a lot of world manipulation in order to navigate to the exit. For example, you may have to do a complete 360 of the world to manoeuvre your character through several flights of stairs/ledges. The store page screenshots can give you good indications of what type of levels to expect.Overall, the game is a fantastic puzzle platformer with a nice mechanic and a great artstyle. If you are interested in the genre, then definitely check it out.Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												I find myself really enjoying puzzles later. And this is not the best one. Don't get me wrong, Bridge is a good game, but it looks like poor cousin of Braid, when we are talking about gameplay and methaphoric-metaphysic story, and they got a lot of common letters in their names as well. Art style is brilliant. But from the ""story"" perspective Bridge is the great pretender. Game trying to be an art as hard as it can. Still it's not the bad part. Sad thing for me that Bridge is very easy till the middle of the game, and then it became balance-puzzle. Most of the tasks challenge your balance, reaction and positioning. And sometimes it does that in a very annoying manner. For me it feels like dissonance when ""clever looking"" game mostly questioning not your intellect, but your feel of momentum. 72/100			"

												I've always loved the drawings of Escher, so to  find a game    that was inspired by  him was a bonus.  I do think the  cost of the game is a lttle overpriced.  It seems like Indie games have been rising steadily over the last  couple of years;  that said, it's still an excellent puzzle game  with some  fairly difficult puzzles to solve.  The art style adds to the overall feel of this game and i would highly recommend   getting it when its on sale, or if you get a  coupon dropThe down side to this game  is   a tendancy to solve the puzzles by trial and error   rather than by   doing a Spock on them. , thst said I still enjoyed  playing it    a lot.

The Bridge is a beautiful and (at times) challenging puzzle game that brings impossible M. C. Escher-esque scenarios to life.Short ReviewAt first I fell in love with the visual style and slow pacing - it gave me the urge to contemplate each solution rather than messing with the controls until somthing went my way.  But, the controls soon became tiresome and the puzzles caused me to lose interest.Positives  Challenging puzzles  Visual style  M. C. Escher-esque levelsNegatives  Not enough time with each mechanic  Controls affects are slow (movement and camera)SummaryIt is hard to decide whether or not to recommend The Bridge.  I didn't complete it, and got the game in a bundle meaning that this was practically free.  I enjoyed exploring what The Bridge had to offer, but I'm not sure there was much in if for me other than the initial superficial charm and early puzzles.  Personally I think I would have been happy watching someone else play the first few levels and been left appreciating the simple charm of the aesthetics to being mildly bored by the gameplay.			"

												This game shares various characteristics with another game: BRAID, but The Bridge definitely has more probabilities, which guarantees you will never be bored of whose puzzles (even though you have to repeat all chapters... well, in a much challenging way).The Bridge is incredible masterpiece of delicacy: its music, story, art style and even its nerve-wracking puzzles.On the other hand, I have to say there are some puzzles are not so... ...well, friendly. I mean although those puzzles are beautifully designed, they require players' manipulation too much, which means you can never solve them with even one-degree inaccuracy. Sometimes this is really annoying.Still, no one can deny its extraordinariness.So strongly recommended.P.S. this game brought me a bad headache yesterday....			"

												I got The Bridge as a gift, and I'm sure glad I did.  By far, it's the best ""mind opening"" game that I've ever played.  The graphics are done in an interesting ""DaVinci's Notebook"" style (at least that's what I would call it.), and the sparse storyline is absolutely perfect for what it is.The puzzles are great!  The frustration that comes with them is of the good kind.  You're never felt wondering ""why did they make it like that???!!!""  Instead, you'll have that ""Omg, how didn't I see that sooner"" sort of frustration that really puts you in awe of the game's design.  I LOVE IT. Thus far, I've played through chapter 4 (each chapter has several subset levels).  It's starting to get pretty damned challlenging!  I'd definitely recommend avoiding any sort of guides for the game, as that could easily ruin the experience the developers intended, which they pulled off perfectly.10/10, will play again, will achievement hunt, will speedrace.

												The Bridge is a nice getaway with its artsy look, calm music and mind-frying puzzles that takes place in an impossible world. Not that it only offers a new dimension, but also drags you there with it, in a good way. I really liked the idea of implementing gravity altering mechanics and engaging it with Escher-inspired weird geometry. I enjoyed every bit of my 4 hours in the game.			"

												The Bridge takes ""Isaac Newton meets M.C. Escher"" completely literally and the result is as perplexing as it sounds. Natural gravity is disregarded and surfaces twist to bend back onto themselves. However, this is still a physics puzzle game and so paths and solutions have to be plotted out in a place where up and down are no longer locked in a single position. The black and white sketched out world suits this sort of experimental thinking and the dawdling, clumsy intellectual of an avatar does as well. But those same qualities - that make sense as a matter of theme - slow down trial and error investigation causing the game itself to become tedious and frustrating at times. Aggravating as it can be sometimes waiting for a puzzle to finish turning or the protagonist to get from one place to another, finding the solution and hearing that door creak open is always rewarding. This quality shines especially bright at the halfway mark, when the game revisits all the previous levels as mirrored versions of themselves. Along with flipping the level itself, many new obstacles are added, including a brand new timing element in some sections. Surprisingly, these levels feel only vaguely familiar instead of the lazy rehashes that tactic would expectantly yield. It goes to show how well-crafted the original puzzle worlds were and how great each individual, independent piece is. It's a shame then, that the story doesn't fit together as neatly. It's only told through snippets or thought fragments, leaving most to the imagination. Due to how little material there is to work with, it's difficult to tell if there is a deep, compelling narrative to piece together or if it's positioned as deliberately obtuse in order to hide the fact that the game has nothing to say. The worst thing about it, or the best depending on your perspective, is that I can't seem to stop myself from coming back to it over and over again.			"

												The Bridge is a mind trip of a puzzle game with its wild visuals and gravitational manipulation. The game continuously distorts your perception of reality depending on the rotation of the environment. For most, The Bridge will present a formidable challenge of frustrating, yet rewarding trial-and-error. The story presentation and time reversal elements are very similar to Braid.

												The Bridge is a neat journey that offers a vigorous challenge and some (slightly) new concepts to those well versed in puzzle games.Gameplay revolves around manipulating  gravity around your character, who can't run or jump, and various objects in order to reach a door. As the games goes on more mechanics are added: locks, fast moving boulders, and so on. After the first play though you could always challenge yourself in the mirrored world (which is more than just inversions) or try to find all the wisps.The art and animation are praiseworthy. Impossible architecture fills out the hand-drawn world. The M.C. Esher style is well done and makes this game stand out. Though I enjoyed the art, at times I felt like Air Force academies could use this game to train pilots.In many ways this game is companion to Braid. Where Braid revolved around the concept of freedom in gameplay (running around and messing with time), while The Bridge seems to deal with restraint (physically limited and trapped in gravity). Braid's vivid water-colors also act as a counterpoint to The Bridge's hand drawn black and white style. Though I am simplifying, these differences (and many more) are interesting to note and for that I think the Bride deserves more attentino.There is a lot of depth to this game (upon close inspection) and it is brimming with challenge. Puzzle fiends should have a great time with The Bridge, casual puzzle fans will find a nice challenge.			"

												Did you like Braid?  You'll probably like The Bridge.  It's got a charming sketchy art style and while it's not a long game by any measure, it manages to wring a fair amount of mileage out of the fundamentally simple mechanics.  Because the mechanics of the game are so simple (your options are to walk, rotate, use, or rewind) it's possible to stumble upon the solution to many of the puzzles by simple trial and error, but it's very rewarding to watch a plan come to fruition.The sparse plot\exposition, told largely through short snippets of text and bits of art, is abstract enough to be either deeply compelling, effectively disposable, or annoyingly pretentious, depending on your preferences.

Because the M C Escher style of mechanics seamlessly blended into a puzzle game isn't just the usual antic of trying to figure out the correct order of solving what problems are in front of you.It's about observing the scenario and then constantly reminding yourself that this thing shouldn't be approached your ""normal"" way. That it's perfectly acceptable to be falling sideways while boulders are rolling around the ceiling.The real game is you against your own brain. And the winner then attempts the puzzle.			"

												Fun and very challenging, if not occasionally frustrating, with a unique mechanic and a healthily large variety of puzzles to conquer. The interface is remarkably simple, and can be learned immediately by anyone. The rewind feature is a unique ability that adds to the gameplay value, reducing the frustration you'll undoubtedly experience. It retains the challenge without making you start from scratch when you screw up. Physics are essential to gameplay, but can be so much trickier than many physics based games I've seen. For instance, manipulating gravity by rotating the screen in such a way as to throw a ball accurately from track to track. You really need to think outside the box for this one, as the answers often aren't obvious. An important note is that this game overcomes a common weakness in physics based games, in which there is often a universal trick which can be applied to almost every puzzle, eliminating the challenge altogether. You won't find a hint of that flaw in this game. Then once you've completed all the levels, there's still the expert challenge of a mirror mode, adding to the replay value.For anyone looking for physical manipulation puzzles that are challenging enough to frustrate, I certainly recommend this game.

Your brain will have melted down and leaked out of your ears by that time anyway, so you won't even notice your ineptitude.

												I disagree with some of the other top reviews. It is not an absent minded puzzler, you really have to focus if you want to get through all the levels and enjoy it. Slow controls and giving you little introduction to the various mechanics are the game's way of trying to tell you that you should sit back and plan what you are about to do, rather than dicking about until something seems to click (Which is permitted by many games, and therefore is tempting, but will ultimately be frustrating and unsatisfying in this one). Like the mathematics this game's story hints at, if you do not pay attention you'll miss something, and it only takes missing one thing to be stumped completely. Once you get into your focus-groove, though, you'll understand the appeal. If you don't know what I mean by that last sentence, then this game is probably not for you, so get it for free or cheap if you get it at all.TLDR: It's a very good game, but different.			"

												You are certainly familiar with optical delusions, which you found on the internet or in psychology, and how our mind perceives them. For example those delusions, where you have ladders which lead to different rooms and they are connected, but reversed ect. Have you ever thought about it - have you ever dreamed or wished - you could take a walk in such a place? That it could become reality? Well... here, in this game, it can be true - delusions became your reality! You walk there, rotate gravity, solve puzzles... it's just fantastic! That's why I love it so much :) And of course, the music just fits the place :)It is definitely worth the money and if you love puzzle games, this game will definitely become one of your favorite :)			"

												I feel super conflicted about this one. On the one hand, I'm sure The Bridge was plenty impressive when it came out four years ago, with its beautiful sketchpad art and mind-bending puzzles. On the other hand, I'm just not getting the kind of gratification out of it that I get from something like Braid or Limbo. I'll get into why specifically in a moment, so take this review as less of a dismissal and more of an exploration of its issues. I couldn't find the will to get through it despite my love of puzzles and Escher, but maybe you can.The Bridge is the story of a tiny professor as he puzzles through the strange and impossible worlds branching out from his home. There are four worlds of six puzzles each, and completing all six gets you a brief snippet of a larger story about how this came to be. It's fine flavor for the game but the real meat is the puzzles, with a side of excellent art presenting them as a surrealist master would from his sketchpad. Completing the game once grants you access to hard versions of the same 24 puzzles and more of the story, so if you enjoy the challenges on tap you'll get more of the same, but only that.Those challenges take the form of twisting fragments of worlds that obey their own rules of logic. Walkways curve around in perfect circles, bridges cross each other at impossible angles, and trees float in the pastoral void. There's a door that leads out of each puzzle, and it's almost always locked by key, multiple keys, or pressure plate. To get your Freud-looking fellow to all of these points, you can walk left and right, or rotate the entire world either direction. There's no jumping here, and while the prof doesn't take falling damage he does slide around on inclines like his loafers are greased, so most of the action is going to be rotating the world into place for your shuffling scholar.It's not quite that simple, because the game will quickly introduce gaps that can send you sailing out into the void and giant boulders to crush you flat. The game cleverly allows you to rewind time rather than restart, a move straight out of Braid, but this is never used as a puzzle mechanic so don't get your hopes up. Honestly, despite the Escher-inspired chambers and additional gimmicks introduced like mirror clones, the puzzles just don't have much depth to them. Each one is a single screen large and has to be completed by some combination of walking and rotating, so most of the solutions are going to be immediately apparent. And once they become more challenging it's not from building on the mechnics or forcing you to think differently, it's just more complex networks of the same paths and boulders you've been negotiating up to that point.The hallmark of great puzzle games are puzzles that make you feel like a genius when you finally work them out. Most of the puzzles in The Bridge aren't nearly that complicated, and the ones that are doing by repeating mechanics instead of expanding upon them. There's certainly a niche for puzzlers that are just increasingly difficult permutations of the same thing, but I expected more from The Bridge. Maybe I wouldn't have back at its release, but in 2017 it feels lackluster among the innumerable puzzle platformers to choose from. It's certainly not a bad game, just not one I find myself wanting to spend any more time with.			"

Product received for free
												This is a puzzle game along the lines of Braid. Rather than using Braid's time mechanics, it plays on the mechanics of gravity. The majority of puzzles in the non-mirror world (2 parts to the game, mirror and non-mirror) can generally be solved by turning the screen or walking in one direction or the other. This meant that I was initially disappointed with the difficulty of the game, although there were a few puzzles that took me a few minutes of head scratching to work out.I found the best part of the game came with the mirror world that increased the difficulty and provided the puzzles with more action-based solutions that involve you moving your character around and so he becomes part of the puzzle rather than an object you slide into the exit.The art work is great as is the sound. Most people will probably find the pace of the character's walking speed too slow but you'll rarely need to move him that much once you learn about twisting gravity. It also has quite an 'artsy' story and atmosphere to it. Personally, I ignored it but the depth of it may appeal to many people.Like most puzzle games, you'll either love it because the puzzles appeal to you or they will twist your brain and frustrate you to quit. I'm a logical, visual thinker so most of these puzzles played into my strengths and I enjoyed even the hardest ones. If I can offer one bit of advice, it's that some puzzles are easier if you think about the end position and move back in steps from there.			"

Escher (one of my favorite artists), the mechanics are innovative (literally tilting the levels to do anything from move keys to access otherwise inaccessible areas, and rewinding time in case you mess up) and puzzles that urge you to really use your head so you don't lose a key or get crushed by a giant grinning ball. Anyone looking for some challenging puzzle gameplay should consider giving this game a try.			"

Good Not Great In A Crowded FieldOver the past 5 years there may not be a more over-worked genre than ""indie puzzle"". There are a few stars and The Bridge is trying hard to be one of those. Unfortunately it's simply noticeable and not remarkable. The non-reality space that makes up the core of the puzzles is relatively unique and challenging but not impossible. The art style is very striking, sort of a pencil sketch in motion, but outside of that it's pretty standard fair. You rotate your view, jump and navigate hazards, move giant boulders using physics, switch between dimensions, and get the story in pieces outside of the actual gameplay.At the end of the day its definitely a cut above average but not in the upper echelon. Unless the screenshots and trailer get you really exited you can safely wait for a sale to pick this up, although the base price is by no means excessive.			"

												One of the best puzzle games I've ever played, 10/10.This reminds me of PG Winterbottom in the intricacy of the problems, but without the tedious management of placement, timing and multiple clones to juggle. You rotate the map, or move your character, or rewind from where you failed. Simple controls, but doesn't make it easy for you to work through the game at all. Lots of out-of-the-box thinking is required, some levels had me scratching my head for hours.I thought I finished the game (4 chapters) in under 2 hours, but there's a mirrored version of the entire game after completing it, incorperating elements from the chapter 4 brain-teasers and making them nearly impossible. I genuinely thought at some points they'd made a puzzle or two intentionally unsolvable. Buy it!			"

												I'm not usually one for puzzle games however The Bridge managed to pull me in with it's simplistic yet compelling visual style and the obvious fact that it's a game insiped by the work of M.C.Escher. The goal is pretty straight forward. Chapter after chapter you have to unlock and reach a door to advance further, by having you rotate the whole level in addition to moving your anonymous hero. Every so often it adds new obstacles or mechanics, introducing them in quite simple levels, slowly progressing to more complex ones. It's been a quite entertaining game for me so far and I'd definetely recommend to everyone to give it a try!			"

												The Bridge puts you in the role of a man with the power to rotate the entire world. He gets hit by an apple, and instead of discovering gravity, gains the mutant ability to control it. Not that it helps when you get repeatedly crushed by giant balls and in various harrowing moments, fall up (or sideways) to your doom.But it is a pretty good puzzle game. A tad bit short, but the latter half will make you think a little bit to get this poor man through the game uncrushed.			"

That said, the actual gameplay is unique, the puzzles are good, and the art style is very nice.  Thumbs up.			"

												The Bridge is an interesting game with its flaws.The gameplay is a bit dull, which mostly consists of getting to the other door with the use of keys. Besides basic movement, you can tilt the levels clockwise or anticlockwise, and are also able to reverse time. Unlike Braid however, reversing time isn't used for puzzles, only to reverse a game over. The tilting can also get annoying at times, feeling more like a precision game then a puzzle game at time.Nevertheless, the game does try to spice the gameplay up by adding new rules as you progress (which isn't too much, only 4 worlds and 4 mirrored but a lot harder worlds) and with a very compelling artstyle. It can really make your head spin how you character manages to traverse the levels in rather impossible forms.Is it worth full price? Maybe. But if it's on sale and you're a tiny bit interested in either platforms, puzzles or rather abstract looking games, it'll definetely be worth your time.			"

												The Bridge was a real problem to review. This game is not only covered with beautiful artwork but also with brilliant level design. With every new level the gap of possibilities to solve the puzzles shrinks. I didn’t get the story that much which was a downer for me and the game is a bit short but if you like solving puzzles this is a game for you. I can’t say I didn’t enjoy the game I only wish there was more of it. I will remember some levels for a while but the problem is that’s all there is to remember. 6/10.			"

												The Bridge is a 2D puzzle game with beautiful Escher-like architecture and level design, hand-drawn black-and-white art and its own laws of physics. It is divided into 48 levels with the first half requiring minimal use of logic and feeling like somewhat of a pushover; fortunately, this is mostly remedied in the second half—a mirrored version of the first with additional obstacles thrown in and where a greater number of puzzles actually make you think.  The puzzles start off easily enough, with simple gravity manipulation and key collection, then introduce additional elements consistently: deadly balls which roll as you rotate the environment and can adhere to their own laws of gravity; points which invert gravity and shift you between black and white dimensions where you may only interact with objects matching your current color; vortexes which suck anything near them into place and hold them there until deactivated; mirror images of yourself which require entering multiple doors or picking up multiple keys simultaneously to progress; and gravity curtains, where you may remain stationary while rotating the world to work objects into their desired positions relative to your own.The Bridge features Steam achievements and some well-hidden collectibles to find.  Gamepad is natively supported and the controls are very simple, consisting of walking, rotating the environment clockwise or counter-clockwise, and rewinding time when you make a mistake.  It feels very reminiscent of Braid at times, but the puzzles aren’t as satisfying or clever as those in Braid and the overall difficulty curve should have been based on the second half of the game. Anyone who stops before the mirrored world is doing themselves a disservice and, if I had to judge the game based on the first 24 levels alone, I would have to judge it much more harshly. As a whole, The Bridge manages to be a worthwhile puzzle game and to feel very solid despite being made by two people.			"

There should be an option to speed up the gameplay.The story is also lacking, which is a pitty. It is too vague and easilly missed.  All in all, this is a puzzle game, play it for the puzzles and you shall not be disappointed!			"

												I don't know what it is about this game, but there's something very deeply and profoundly disturbing about it. It's like a terrifyingly beautiful nightmare. It is captivating. I love the art, the originality, and the atmosphere. But you still have this feeling of something being off. The game sucks you in and leaves you wondering what will happen to you once you've been taken. It really is just like those dreams where everything is perfectly fine, except for an uneasy feeling, you don't know what is giving you that feeling, maybe it's those boots that are laying on their side, or the absence of lint on your clothes, you don't know, but you can tell something is wrong. If you are expecting a monster or someone with a chainsaw popping up like it's a B horror flick, you won't find that here. But you will remain uneasy throughout.I recommend this game 100%, and I'm giving it a 10/10. The experience you get from playing this game is unlike any other I've played in the past. It's very unique, it has elements I've seen in other games, rotating the map, manipulating gravity, but the ingenuity with which it was applied is unparalleled. But be warned, this game will haunt you like few other games have.			"

												The tilt-based puzzle gameplay is not a unique idea and is implimented in many smartphone puzzle games, but it is greatly complimented by its artistic ""sketch-like"" design. Despite its simple controls, the movement can be very complex at times, requiring quick directional changes for both rotation and movement in some levels. However, any mistakes can be easily fixed by the convient, but sometimes tidious, rewind function. The greatest downside I encountered was that it is very disorienting; personally, it made me dizzy. I've done my fair share of roller coasters and fair rides without problem so I considered myself intolerant to such matters, but It may have been becuase I was dehydrated, hungry, tired, or any other external causation that makes you sensitive to disorientation, but I quickly decided that whatever the reason, it wasn't worth the trouble. However, for those who know they are less susceptible to dizziness, if you think the game looks pretty and you like complex puzzles, try it out; you might like it.			"

												An interesting, if somewhat mechanically limited puzzle game. The primary focus of the game are the interesting non-Euclidean geometry to the levels, largely inspired by M. C.

Upon finishing the five worlds, there are mirror worlds where the levels are slightly ""twisted"" to become harder, and you go through them again.It's not terribly long, and (with a few exceptions) not TOO difficult.

Upon finishing the five worlds, there are mirror worlds where the levels are slightly ""twisted"" to become harder, and you go through them again.It's not terribly long, and (with a few exceptions) not TOO difficult. I would recommend it to people who enjoy puzzle games, but it doesn't seem to be the sort of game which would appeal to those who are not already fans of the genre.			"

												This game is great. I am so glad I took a chance on it. I got it for less than three bucks in the big Steam Summer Sale. Do you like puzzle games that mess with your mind and scoff at your quaint notions of ""up"" and ""down""? Do you like artsy-fartsy type games with beautiful, non-traditional video game visuals and mechanics? Do you enjoy the works of M.C. Escher? Why haven't you bought this game yet?UPDATE: I still like this game and I still recommend it, but it does get to the point where it feels like a grind to solve some of the more difficult puzzles. Things can get so disorienting with all of the reversals of gravity and such that there's no way to ""think things through"" when you are starting out on a new puzzle (with some of the more difficult ones). It gets to be trial-and error, and then when you solve it you can't really know for sure what you did to solve it. Still, this is a very different sort of puzzle game that you should check out if you are into that sort of thing.			"

												This game is awesome! It was very challenging and it felt great to solve all the puzzles. The artwork in this game is also great. In fact, this game re-introduced me to MC Escher's work. I would recommend this game to people who love puzzle games and a beautiful and unique art style.			"

												A great, underrated puzzle game to play when you just want to relax and take your time figuring puzzles out.Sometimes it does get a tad too hard with you having to spin the screen in pixel perfect ways to get to needed parts and the hidden wisps are a bit too out of the box (unlike the rest of the puzzles), but it is overall a wonderful experience.

												The Bridge pushes the puzzle platformer genre even further with Escher-themed level design. The pencil artstyle, obtuse plot text (sometimes a bit too over the top), and the tinkering music all fit the theme well.While there are a few timing and (seemingly) trial & error soltuions, The Bridge offers a unique world to explore and some very interesting puzzles. After Escher, where else can the puzzle platformer go?			"

												Game bugs you to rate it.Also bugs you to get one of their other games.Updated at the developers request:When I started playing The Bridge, it felt like an innovative little puzzle game somewhat like Braid, PB Winterbottom, etc.  I like the art style.Often games like that have end up feeling either way to easy, or way to hard for a player depending on how quickly they can figure out the puzzles.  My first impressions with The Bridge was that the diffilculity curve was well done.  But then suddently I reached levels where it felt like I wasn't playing a puzzle, I was fighting the game controls.  That wasn't much fun.That all aside, this is nagware.			"

Believe me.. it's NOT!!You're not going to control the man only, u gonna control the gravity too!There are several objects in every puzzle, like, ""Round Angry Stones!"" which will smash your head if you're not careful with using the power you have! Sometimes you need to be snappy by moving around while you're rotating the environment, to avoid getting sucked by a ""Black Hole"" or whatever it's :/It's fun! I didn't play it that much because i get sick very easily!But i did finish the 3 first light grey doors, and it deserve every ""sick feeling"" i had during that time :DI'm sure it's gonna deserves every penny as well.

												Up is down and down is up. Left and right thankfully remain the same, for most of the time... Also be careful, you might fall from the wall. Depth is an illusion, and since up is down, does that mean that effectively there is only one dimension left? Confused? GOOD, you should be! Because this is what 'the bridge' is all about!The Bridge is a puzzle platformer where you manipulate gravity to reach the exit on impossible terrains! This game will make you rethink how your visual comprehension works. The main mechanic of the game is that you can rotate the entire level clockwise or counterclockwise changing the gravity in the process. However that is not all, as the majority of the levels are heavily inspired by the works of M. C. Escher (seriously go google this guy) where walls turn into floors or you end up walking on a pylon that you passed by a few moments ago. This game will give you such a headache that you 'll feel your brain liquifying and then being reshaped as you finally figure out the solution as your brain has accepted the new impossible rules! However sometimes you may arrive at the solution accidentally having no clue of what you actually did! In the end you will begin to see each level differently as instead of walls or floors you will be seeing surfaces, each with its own connections towards other surfaces! And just when you get used to it and feel you are ready for whatever the next level or chapter might be, then it adds more stuff beginning the process anew! And even when you finally complete the main levels, then you 'll get access to their 'mirrored' harder versions!The visuals are quite satisfying, fitting the impossible theme of the game almost making you feel that it could not have any other colors as from the tiny bits of each chapters story you will understand that it is about mathematics! Everything is hand-drawn and the animations are fluid and, for some, may feel a bit slow, however I personally liked the speed, as the levels impossible architecture gave me a feeling of eternity, as you are either stuck in time or that time doesn't matter! The music complements the game perfectly without overshadowing it even at the more intense puzzles.As far as controls go, the game supports controller and either keyboard or controller schemes are easily grasped. Personally I favored keyboard because I could play with one hand only while I was holding my head with the other because of the headache I got!Besides the obvious puzzle fans this game will attract I highly recommend it to anyone who loves to stare at optical illusions or impossible sketches as it can, essentially, give you a ride on them!-------------------------------------------I reviewed this game for the steamified group.For similar reviews and great giveaways feel free to visit http://www.steamified.com "

I feel like I am spending my time turning the screen around. It feels like puzzles were too easy so they added play time by making the process of moving around really slow.Couldn't this screen turn faster! No it can't, because the character and objects have to follow... Then make them move faster too! It is just so frustrating... I need more patience I suppose...			"

												Best played when baked and listening to Godspeed you Black Emporer!.My only (small) issue is that the puzzles in the later stages of the game don't really seem to fit into the theme of the game as well as the earlier puzzles. First, I need to talk about the theme to emphasize my point. The game follows MC Escher as he travels the world of his own mind, one containing geometric figures (seemingly) defying the conventional geometry of the natural world as put forward by traditional math and physics (Isaac Newton even makes a cameo). The thing Escher's work demonstrates is that it is infact possible in two dimensions to make figures that in 3-dimensions make no sense to the human brain and have it still fit logically with mathematical and physical theory. In this way, it is a triumph of logic and the physical world over the human brain.The early puzzles are all sort of academically logic and physics based in that once you have it solved logically you don't need much timing or mechanical skill to solve them, you simply solve the puzzle. In this way, they are much like a math or physics problem. They appear complex, but once you find the trick, the solution is easily repeatable and quite straightforward to arrive at. In these stages the game manages to blend its theme and gameplay quite flawlessly. In the puzzles near the end, this fusion of puzzle mechanics and theme breaks down. Here the puzzles require more timing, and even once you have seen the correct solution it may prove unnattainable due to lack of coordination with the keys.For an experienced gamer, these reflex and timing based puzzles don't offer too much of a challenge. For me, the issue is that this sort of deviates from what they seemed like they were trying to do in the earlier stages which was make puzzles that captured the logically and phyically sound spirit of MC Eschers work.

												Interesting puzzle game with some eye candy elements (if you actually spend some time admireing the levels). However, for the most part the pace of the game was slow, repetitive, and just full of ""try randomly untill you somehow get it right."" It had a lot of potential and did come half way through but that's just another way of saying it fell short. An average player will complete this game with all achievements in 4 to 7 hours, which is decent for the price tag. I would recommend this game to those who want to sit back and relax a little while playing an interesting (to bypassers) looking game.My Score: 6.5/10			"

												It took me about 7 hours to clear out all the puzzles. This game do got some fresh aspects for playing. The normal world is easy to handle while the mirror world is a little hard. Someone who's familiar with this kind of 2D small games may find its physical movement of character unbearable. He can't jump and only a little angle can make him slide. But please be pacient, all those restrictions are for the puzzle solving. I should figure out two soft spots compared with Braid or Machinarium. There  are nearly no detail instructions when new things come out. So at first I just wander around and pass anyway. Second, the music is somewhat dull and unexciting.			"

												A very pleasant surprise for someone who likes games and mathemathics/physics.I myself enjoyed it a lot and had a lot of fun solving especially the harder puzzles. :)It's true that there are some frustrating puzzles too, but in the end are manageable if you put your mind to it.You can get most of the achievements during normal gameplay, but for one or two you'll have to go deeper and read behind the lines to get them.The only downside I didn't liked about it is that it's a bit short for my taste, but for the discounted price tag at which I got it, I really can't complain. I had lots of fun during these 10 hours of gameplay and would play it again sometime for a quick brain training. ^_^I recommend this game to everyone who loves to solve puzzles and don't mind a bit of frustration and a bit of physics and logic.On the other hand I don't recommend this game to those who love a fast paced game and can't handle frustration and don't want to waste time on thinking how to solve a level.

												With a little more time and work, The Bridge would've become an extra special gameplay experience, but due to the design, most puzzles feel like you're fighting and messing around with momentum rather than searching for an ah-ha moment. Regardless of a few smaller issues, there are still a ton of memorable maps which pay optical and physical illusions enough respect, while balancing player fun enough to mix good parts from both and make The Bridge an artistic puzzle platformer well worth grabbing.HighlightsThe best parts of The Bridge are exactly what you see on the store front, a beautiful and imaginative art style that's unique and different enough to set this apart from others. The Bridge doesn't overstay its welcome, and the pleasant U.I. and ambiance serve to keep it casual and relaxing.* Each level feels new and is a pleasure to explore. The floating design on the distant background helps everything feel dreamlikeMistakesThere are a few moments where you actively need to think about how to approach the landscape and physics represented in the level, and suddenly you'll realize how to approach it and solve the problem, but these moments are too few and on the whole you'll be wrestling with momentum or gravity to move your character to the correct position, which feels a little too cheap and shallow.* A distinct lack of music or even distinct ambient sounds is a loss, and would've worked to greatly compliment the art style* The collectibles add nothing to the game, and are frustrating to collect, but can safely be ignored* There's a ridiculous spike in difficulty on levels 4-5 that's very jarringRecommendationsThe Bridge clocks in with around 4-5 hours gameplay and may feel just a touch too highly priced on Steam at £6.99/9.99€/$9.99 when compared to other entries in this genre which are available for cheaper. When viewed alone, it's still a very reasonable price, and if you're a puzzler veteran, you'll probably see this as above average value for money, especially considering it regularly goes on sale for -80% and -90%, leaving it at just $0.99* Due to the Developers confessed inspiration from, and love of the Braid game, and given the title of the game, it's possible that there's a subtly hidden story or message contained throughout the game and some fan theories make for some interesting ideas* There's a great AMA/Q&A with the Developers on reddit that's worth a read* There's a free Trial/Demo version of The Bridge available on XBOX Live[marketplace.xbox.com]* The whole of Chapter 1 can be completed entirely without walking "

												Interesting puzzle game with some eye candy elements (if you actually spend some time admireing the levels). However, for the most part the pace of the game was slow, repetitive, and just full of ""try randomly untill you somehow get it right."" It had a lot of potential and did come half way through but that's just another way of saying it fell short. An average player will complete this game with all achievements in 4 to 7 hours, which is decent for the price tag. I would recommend this game to those who want to sit back and relax a little while playing an interesting (to bypassers) looking game.My Score: 6.5/10			"

												A nice physics/puzzle platformer game in which you rotate the world around to either move objects or make it possible to reach new areas.The levels start of quite simple and easy to work out but towards the end they can get quite confusing and require a lot of thinking and retrying.You come across new mechanics throughout the levels.It's possible to rewind time and undo every action you've made, going back how far you wish and attempt any part without having to redo the whole level. It's slow paced and you can really take your time on the levels.The game is quite short which can be finished within a day and there's not much replay value.There's no real story to follow but you can find various bits of text scattered around the world to read.Simple art design but really well drawn and in grey scale to give each level a nice eerie atmosphere.I got this in a humble bundle and it's not something I would personally buy but I have no complaints about the content in the game.

												As it progressively became harder for him to manage protecting a sane legisation of his executive functions while his conscious mind drifted curiously to spectrums undisclosed to mortals, the uncontrollable impulse to explore unknown territories of reality slowly enveloped most of his life, driving him into depression and isolation. His mysterious house, surrounded by rolling hills and green pastures of grass and clarity, stood alone in the field, a stark symbol of the man's loneliness. Nevertheless, he is a pioneer, exploring new horizons, a skeptic of everyone else's perception, a lie and fascade to him waiting to be peeled aside like wallpaper, and a grossly underappreciated catalyst of a new understanding of life and the meaning of existence, with only his being bereft of the necessary capabilities bar him, a crippling hindrance, standing between him and the fourth dimension.

												Not just 'your avarage puzzler'. The Bridge might seem easy when you're doing the first door, and that's only intended for you to get into the game and it's mechanics. As soon as you open the 2nd door, things start to become harder already. Now I'm up for door #3 and I kinda fear what to find behind this one to make things even harder ;-)The Bridge is a puzzler that combines physics and mathematics as well as Esher's impossible drawings. The combination of those 3 makes you think twice (and even trice) before you even start solving the current puzzle. I even dare to say that this is the most challenging puzzler game in my games library. I wish more of these were made...			"

												The Bridge is another entry in the physics puzzle-platformer genre, and a quite ambitious entry at that!    It focuses on its one main mechanic, which is simply flipping the world, and its gravity with it. However, the levels are designed from the ground up to support it with a M. C. Escher-esque perspective, leading to some twisted and creative levels.   The game has 2 main sets, the second of which is a rework of the previous levels, with added elements that you learned to overcome in the first set. It seems a bit like an extended tutorial, as half of each chapter is about exposing a mechanic to the player, not being too challenging. The puzzles featured here are, in my opinion, better designed, and not difficult to actually finish once you know the solution.   The second, however, has a more physics-driven design, very unlike the first. This might leave you hanging a bit in the first few levels, but it's not as hard as it seemed after you realize that you actually do have to be more meticulous with the physics.   It also features a few secret Wisps (which help you interpret the story) and Achievements that can be frustrating to do if you're not using a guide, or maybe discussing clues with your friends. But none of it is mandatory, so it's a fair addition to the game.   The artstyle of the game is most likely its main draw. It's certainly very unique and it manages to merge its visual level design with the gameplay mechanics seamlessly.   If you're familiar with Escher's work, you'll certainly see where the inspiration came from! If you're not (like I was) this is certainly an opportunity to look into it, if you find this game's aesthetic interesting at all. It's certainly a great selling point, and it's always great when games manage to teach you something as subtly as The Bridge did.   The music, on the other hand, was disappointing to me. While the game is full of twisted perspectives and characters who are near madness, the music felt a bit underwhelming as a direct result. It's not bad, by any means. It's fairly minimalistic, with a few dissonant aspects to it (which I like), but I feel like the game would benefit more from something darker and more disturbing.    With that said, it still did its job, and added to the atmosphere.   The game mechanics all come down to rotating the world around you. Your goal is to reach a door, that is often locked. It can be unlocked by picking up a key, or activating a switch with one (or more) boulder(s). The objects in the levels are also subjected to gravity, however, not necessarily the same as yours. And it's basically about figuring out which path will lead a certain object where it needs to go, in often mind-bending and maze-like levels.   There are vortices (deactivated by a pressure plate), a curtain that negates gravity (so that you can rotate freely and change only the other objects' gravity), etc.   ...I almost forgot! There's also a rewind mechanic. And, of course, it made some people say the game tried to rip Braid off. Well... no. Not at all. Braid used time as its mechanic, and something needed to finish the puzzles. In The Bridge, it merely exists as a handy tool to let you undo mistakes without replaying the levels from the start.    The game has 4 chapters, each with 6 levels (and then there are an equal number of mirrored levels, which are harder and provide more plot elements -- don't consider the game finished without these!). Usually, the first 2-3 levels are about introducing a new mechanic to you, and the other 3 will use them in different ways, providing more challenging puzzles.   I'll admit that a few levels (especially later ones) proved to be a bit difficult. A problem I've had with it, is that it's very hard to actually visualize the solution to the puzzles. It came down to identifying different possible paths, and trying them out until I was close enough to the solution to be able to do the rest easily. I believe this is inherent to the level design, as everything is almost made to trick your eyes, making it a real pain to predict where each path will take you. Adding the fact that you're constantly rotating, which confuses you even more (and may provoke motion sickness, so beware!).   As I said, the later ones are more physics driven, and can be substantially harder if you're not used to it.   All in all, I actually felt somewhat rewarded for finishing it all without the use of a guide (except for the wisps). Some levels took me longer than I expected, but never being too frustrating.   And it was unique, so you should definitely give it a go, if you're into the genre. If you're not, it's probably not your best choice to start out, as there are other games which teach the player its tought-patterns better than The Bridge did (at least for me).  To end it, I just want to make a comment on the story and characters. At the end of each chapter, you'll get a sentence or two to give you a better idea of what's going on. Basically, it's a story about Escher and Newton working together. Escher, an almost mad artist, constantly trying to overcome reality, and Newton, a genius physicist, both using mathematics in unconventional ways.    It touches on finally finding someone as absurd as him, sharing interests, and then pursuing the impossible.   It's all very open to interpretation, of course, but I really liked the way it has been done. The achievements also add a bit to this, specifically the names of the ones you get from simply finishing a chapter (Thinker, Academic, Scholar, Challenger, Heretic, Outcast, Hermit, Genius)... It's definitely not the focus of a game, but I always think it's good when developers spread various elements across the game (not just in the levels, or direct exposition, but on little things like this).   If you haven't figured it out yet, I definitely recommend this game to fans of the genre. How it bridges (heh) the visual and mechanical elements of level design is awesome, and it then coats it with interesting characters and themes that should make the player interested in knowing a bit more about what it's all about.   I've certainly enjoyed it more than I expected, and makes me look forward to the developers' next games!			"

												The Bridge is a rotational, dimensional, warping platformer where you spend a lot of time sliding around and hearing your coat-tails flapping. Whereas Braid is about the manipulation of time, The Bridge is its counterpart about the manipulation of space. There's always the option to undo, of course, but it is challenging to complete a level even with that. Requires lateral thinking, spatial thinking, being okay with grayscale, fondness for the sound of clinking chains. Bonuses include if you have the ability to read upside down.			"

												The Bridge is a 48~ish level 2D puzzle platformer where you navigate by manipulating gravity and your relationship to it in stylish grayscale environments that are often based in optical illusions. The puzzles are sometimes challenging, but seldom frustrating. Failure can be rewound and, while the latter levels do require a touch more dexterity, the core of the problems can be solved through thought and analysis. A very good time was had. There's also a chill soundtrack and a curious story of two scientists pushing boundaries despite being misunderstood by their peers.A few of the achievements are a bit obtuse, with the worst being the collecting of 7 hidden doodads which have extremely obscure hints littering the game, but you wouldn't know to look for them or their hints if nobody told you they were there.

												After learning more about the development cycle for The Bridge I have a lot of respect for this game. The developers really took the limitations of platforming in 2D Unity and made them into strengths after much trial and error. The art is quality too. My only major complaint is the soundtrack is a bit limited. This is one to try if you like Braid, since it's a lot like Braid. (It's a LOT like Braid)			"

												One of the best puzzle games I've ever played. This game is simple yet highly complex and can give you many hours of gameplay if you go after all the achievements. What I liked most about this game was the difficulty curve. Most puzzle games I've played are ridiculously easy and don't pull you in. The Bridge starts off this way but provides some genuinely challenging sections as you progress. The mechanics in this game are interesting enough that even non puzzle game fans would probably enjoy this. Not a strong story line and the character doesn't pull you in as much as other puzzle games on this level (like Machinarium) but still definitely worth playing. Personally I would not pay $9.99 for this game... rather wait for it to go on sale. 8/10 "

												4/5The Bridge is a more than a game, it is a playable work of art. The first thing I noticed about The Bridge, was the simplicity of the controls.  Arrow keys are pretty much all you need.  Don't let that fool you though; The Bridge is as difficult as it is entertaining.  The levels look like they were taken out of an MC Escher sketch book.  You spend a lot of time spinning the world around and manipulating the gravity in order to get through each puzzle.  There are times when your eyes will decieve you, as you get lost in the beautiful sketches that are each level.This is one of those games that you have to try.  If you wait until this game is on sale, you will have no regrets.			"

												A solid puzzler with a good difficulty curve.The earlier levels can be solved by manipulating without much thinking but the challenges get progressively harder until you have to sit up and plan a good number of steps ahead of your actions. This is especially true with some of the achievements and mirror levels.That said, nothing in the game ever feels impossible.My one gripe is the addition of hidden collectables. They are few in number, most of them aren't hard to pick up, and the game actually does have hints to find them. I'm just not a fan as they force you to think in a way disconnected from the rest of the game to interpret the hints. Luckily, there are concise guides on Steam for those (like me) without the patience for a puzzle in a puzzle.			"

												Similar Gameplay to ""And yet it Moves"" - screen rotation is the key mechanic.  A little more laid back though.  They nailed the illusionistic surrealist art style perfectly, and in most cases found novel (if frustrating) ways to integrate into the game play.  If their goal was to make it feel like you're inside an Escher lithograph, then the developers succeeded.The puzzles are challenging as you go on.   Wish there was a hint system or something... I got badly stuck on a level and raged out.  It felt impossible at a few points.  Worth the holiday sale price.  Will pick it back up and try again.			"

The puzzle scale nicely from easy to ... not so very doable (I must admit I haven't gotten through the mirrored worlds yet, they're damned difficult).My frustrations:In a few levels I knew exactly what to do but the little guy walks so slow it took ages to get it done. This only happened in a few levels, so it's not too bad.P.S. If you like computers, Escher and paradoxes you should try some Douglas Hofstadter books, they're amazing!			"

												If you like the art of M. C. Esher and solving perceptual puzzles, this indie game is just your cup of tea.  The Bridge may use some of the tired old devices of gaming like doors for levels and the like, but still manages to feel fresh due to the captivating artwork and progressive difficulty of the puzzles that you encounter at each step along the way.  It is a great casual game to have in your game portfolio for those times when you want to take a break from serious, intense games.  The game works flawlessly with an Xbox 360 controller and the controls are elegantly simple.  Make a wrong move and kill your character - no problem.  You just hit the B button to go backward in your gameplay to a safe spot of your choosing and start trying to solve the puzzle again.  Bad solutions that kill the character show up on the screen as faint images of the character where he died so that you can remember where you got into trouble as you shift the mobius board left, right and around to use game physics to help your character through the puzzle.  The detail in the drawings and the background ambient music make it a pleasure to explore each new scene and find a way to the next scene in each chapter.   And of course there are trading cards and some nifty backgrounds that look great on a player's profile. "

												I was pleasantly surprised by The Bridge. The controls are very simple, but the puzzles get quite tricky. On a gamepad, the left stick controls your character while the triggers rotate the world. That combines with physics and perspective tricks to make for some good challenges. You may need to rotate a level enough to get around to one side, but while making sure a key doesn't fall off of the level from its precarious perch.The controls for the character feel very slow, which I would usually hate, but I think that the ability to rewind when experimenting made up for the sluggish controls. I thought that the difficulty level personally was a really satisfying curve that kept each puzzle feeling like an accomplishment without getting too hard...until the last level; I had to actually look up that single solution. My girlfriend watched and helped with some puzzles, so it only took about 2 hours or so to complete the main game.You should buy this on sale.			"

												Braid meets MC Escher. Has anyone else called it that? I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess someone else has called it that. :)I'm on Chapter 4, and really, really ambivalent about this game... more than I expected to be. The physics/logic puzzles seem more trial and error oriented than either pure logic or brilliant lateral ""ah-ha"" thinking (ntohing yet resembling the epiphanies of Antichamber, Braid or Stanley Parable yet). The art style is kind of neat (again, very DaVinci meets MC Escher-ish) but the soundtrack is more tedious than anything and has started to grate already.I'll say no for the time, but I reserve the right to finish playing through and reverse judgment. Hoping this game has a few tricks in store that *literally* blow my mind :) I'm guessing this is a one-man team and it feels like a decent effort, but I'm very much at arm's length from it.			"

												A puzzle-platform game like this needs three things to be effective - a pleasing art-style or atmosphere, a compelling central game-mechanic or gimmick around which to structure the puzzles, and well-planned puzzle-design. The Bridge has the first two, but is defeated on the third point. I made it all the way through to the final puzzle simply by trial and error, without any real understanding of what I was doing; the game doesn't unfold with the systematic clarity essential to teach the mechanics to the player as he plays. The final puzzle is the only true 'puzzle' in the whole game - and by then it is too late for the player to learn the basic skills needed to solve it. Disappointing.			"

												Love this game, but I will say this; it's not for everyone, sadly. You do need to have at least a basic understanding of extra-dimensional geometry, gravitational theory, and the rather specific(and exacting) branch of quantum physics known as temporal physics, as well as a healthy appreciation for the (seemingly) impossible geometrical art of M.C. Escher.That said, it's a very enjoyable game, provided you have a great deal of patience, and an excellent sense of timing. But whatever you do, DO NOT attempt to play this while you are tired, experiancing vertigo, or otherwise incapacitated; you will make mistakes, you will lose, and you will get frustrated! So only play this when you are calm, clear-headed, and motivated. Do that, and you'll love this game too! :D			"

												Quick review:Short Verdict: A very hard and beautiful puzzle game envolving a lot of trial an error and spatial orientation. I consider myself a good puzzler and I score high in spatial orientation tests. Still, this game was too hard for me. I like puzzles that are more elegant and requires more thinking than trial and error, so the experience wasn't all that great for me. Don't be overconfident in your skills--unless you're really good or willing to use walkthroughs (which I did a few times, especially later in the game), you're probably just gonna get frustrated. So I can't really recommend it (and I actually did at first, because I really wanted to), unless you're that specific player. If you are, go for it, it's a work of art.Pros: Beautifully drawn 2D graphics inspired by Escher's work Awesome BGM 48 levels, if I counted right Very challenging levels should please hardcore puzzlers I could still enjoy it even if I had to use the walkthrough quite a few timesCons: Probably way too hard for most players Requires a lot of trial and error and ridiculous precision, which in my opinion is (almost?) never good in a puzzle game Terrible difficulty curve... you get hard levels, then easier, then even harder, then easier again and so on I felt dizzy playing this game after constantly turning the screen around Movement is really slow, to the point of being annoying sometimes It should be a bit easier moving between level hubs after you unlock them Story didn't make any sense to me... I know there was one, but I have no clue what it was about Hints for Collector achievement are insanely hard if you don't look elsewhereBought on / for: Steam Store for R$ 1,99 (US$ 0.87). Money-wise, it was worth it, considering it was fun to some extent, that it has cards and how much time I spent playing it.			"

												A puzzle-platform game like this needs three things to be effective - a pleasing art-style or atmosphere, a compelling central game-mechanic or gimmick around which to structure the puzzles, and well-planned puzzle-design. The Bridge has the first two, but is defeated on the third point. I made it all the way through to the final puzzle simply by trial and error, without any real understanding of what I was doing; the game doesn't unfold with the systematic clarity essential to teach the mechanics to the player as he plays. The final puzzle is the only true 'puzzle' in the whole game - and by then it is too late for the player to learn the basic skills needed to solve it. Disappointing.			"

												There are things to enjoy in The Bridge.  The art style, particularly in the animations and how they are drawn, are wonderful.  The music isn't intrusive.  Good things.  It's once we move past that things get less pleasant.Lets be up front: The Bridge is a physics-based puzzle game.  You can infer this between some of the store quote and the theme of the game, but nowhere on the face does it say this, and I really wish it did.  If you enjoy physics-based puzzle games, there's likely something to latch onto here.  If you do not, which means you are rather like me, then this game is just ... rough.  Seeing a solution and having to battle the execution is the worst kind of feeling when you're problem solving.  Add on top of this the controls are rather sluggish (Not unresponsive, but it simply takes a while to do anything, and if you have to undo a large portion of movement it just too long) and it really is off-putting.Compounding the rather bitter feelings I was left with are the Developer's absurdly intrusive push to sell you on their new game Tumblestone.  It's just that extra bit of unpleasantness that really makes the whole thing sour.  Literally the first time I boot up your game and I'm asked to check out your other one before I've seen a title screen.  Then when I've finished, decidedly haven't enjoyed myself and wish to move on, there is ltierally a Steam install window for Tumblestone.  Truly a wonderful way to ensure I won't be looking at any of your work in the near future.I haven't - and won't - finish this game, so I can't comment on the length, but the price is really a matter of how much you enjoy the genre.  If you like this kind of thing, developers need support.  As you might expect from the above, they won't be getting mine, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't get yours.			"

												The Bridge reminds me of a colorless Braid. The puzzles are different, but there's a time-rewind mechanic in it, too. It's used to rewind time to undo your mistakes though and it's not actually part of the puzzles. And the way the story is told is almost the same as the way Braid told its story. Most of the puzzles can be solved by sheer luck. The later levels are a bit harder though, especially the last world.It's a short game and most of us will finish it in 3-4 hours max. Long enough for me personally, but hey, if you're into puzzle games you might be disappointed.(The graphics are awesome, by the way. A lot of detail and the levels are actually expertly designed, despite some of them being easy.)[Rating: 77/100]			"

												I know what you're thinking, ""He just doesn't like it because it requires you to use your brain! All he wants to do is play COD all day!"" Now let me tell you two things. One: I dont hate this game, and two: I really don't like COD. This game is beautiful in its graphics and is very appealing to the eye, its just that once you get into the actual gameplay, it is very slow and almost doesn't progress in difficulty or controls at all. ""Its meant to be a simple game! Its a thinking game!"" I completely understand that aspect, it's just that while The Bridge tells you to do its excellently designed puzzles, it does nothing to keep you wanting to do the next thing, the storyline is little to nothing and the game starts off with you as an old man trying to climb up a hill which is the most boring intro experiences ever. ""Its called minimalism!"" I hear you say. I get that completely but while it accomplishes that goal it gives you nothing to hold on to, nothing to make you want to come back for more. I am going to say I dont recommend this game but I am more so in the middle of yes or no, which Steam unfortunately doesn't give you an option to put.I give it an overall 5/10.			"

												I have a love-hate relationship with most platformer titles simply due to timed trials and ridiculous boss battles.  The Bridge thankfully avoids these pitfalls and offers a genuine puzzle-platformer experience.  The gameplay involves rotating the screen while simultaneously moving the character towards their goal--an unlocked door.  Sound easy?  Well it is...at first.  This is one of the most challenging puzzle games I've ever touched.  Any frustration generated fades away instantly as the solution aligns and warm satisfaction carries the player to the next level.  While Braid was interesting and fresh, it became unnecessarily complicated in an effort to scale with the player's progression.  On the other hand, The Bridge is an exercise in perspective rather than a gauntlet of reflex-based challenges and quite simply a joy to play.The Good:- eerie sound design that never becomes excessive- surreal art style that feels like the offspring of M.C. Escher with Edward Gorey's eyes- difficult puzzles (when I say puzzles, I mean actual puzzles not reflex challenges) that merely frustrate rather than enrage- time reversal element similar to Braid that allows for quick adjustments instead of forcing a complete restart- rudimentary story that allows the player to draw their own conclusions and never gets in the wayThe Bad: - engine can be sluggish at times (recent patches have improved this somewhat)- clunky installation (I have yet to uninstall, so this may have improved since launch)The Ugly:- honestly, nothing; one of the rare games that shines just enough not to create an unpleasant glare			"

												It's a nice game, certainly. It's visually stunning (artwork is awesome) and at first glance puzzles are very cool. However after a while it starts feeling kinda slow (movement is slow, drawing is slow, progression is slow). The story is very subtle (next to none I would say), so if you are not really hooked up by the puzzles there is nothing that will prevent you from stop playing. So I did, I stopped. Don't get me wrong, it's not by any means a bad game. It's Braid in a twisting world, but I need it to be just a little faster, or more immersive. My play time is VERY limited and I need to make it count.			"

												The Bridge is by no means an incompetent game. It's a puzzler, with a quirky but pleasing art style, plenty of content, and an appropriately large level of difficulty. I might even have recommended it a few years ago. But I've since been spoiled by puzzlers of tremendous quality, like Braid, Fez, Portal, and (more controversially) The Misadventures of P.B. Winterbottom.In each of the above, the puzzles are soluble only with some kind of bright spark of an idea, with a relatively simple execution. In The Bridge, the puzzles often come down to trial and error, until eventually you arrive at a relatively complex execution. So, instead of a cathartic flash of inspiration at the end of a puzzle, instead you get a mild feeling of relief as the gauntlet is over.Perhaps if The Bridge had a more engaging style, like the above puzzlers do, its more grinding puzzles would not hold it back so. As it stands, The Bridge shoots for atmospheric, which it achieves to a limited extent. However, the atmosphere is too thin and too monotonous to really persuade me to come back to it. In the end, very little motivates me to actually play the game.If it's on sale, you might as well pick it up. Like I said, it's not an incompetent game. But, it's not worth full price, in my opinion.			"

The environments are often illusions which cross over themselves in impossible ways, while you have to control gravity. With each level, there are new mechanics added which work with gravity in different, weird ways, and the puzzles are all tough but not in even slightly a bad way - I only got stuck enough to need a walkthrough on the final level.

												The Bridge is a puzzle game that takes place in a series of level that seems to be inspired by the drawings of impossible constructions by M. C. Escher. The game uses two main mechanisms that the player can use to progress in each level - walking and the ability to turn the worlds around. There's a series of submechanisms depending on the level as well, including gravity manipulation, inversions and more.It's divided into 8 chapters (2 times 4) and as in most games the difficulty increases from each chapter. The first 4 chapter is in the ""standard world"" and the last 4 is in a mirrored world. The first 4 are challenging, but can be overcome with some thought, but the last 4 chapters are very, very difficult. Generally, though, each puzzle is well thought through and even levels using the same mechanisms are very different in design and the way they should be solved.While the gameplay is nice what's the most impressive about this game is its aesthetic side - the music is great and the art style of the game is absolutely spectacular. Overall, if you're into puzzles you're in for a treat. It's visually stunning and there's different challenges for everyone, although later levels are very difficult.EDIT 2 months later: I've reread the review, and while I still recommend it there should be a few notes added. It's a short game and I would not recommend picking it up for the standard €10 it goes for, but it is often for sale at around €2, which is a pretty reasonable price for a handful of hours worth of entertainment.Also it should be mentioned that this is not an easy puzzle game. The earliest chapters are fairly straightforward, but some of the later ones are ridiculously challenging and I admit that I had to check out YouTube for a few of them in order to even make sure what I was supposed to do.That said, if you can get it for a good price, there's still a few hours of good and entertaining exercise for the brain, but don't be supposed to find yourself a little frustrated with the later levels.

												The Bridge is mathemagical! If you like Braid, and Escher and rotating logical puzzles, The Bridge is perfect for you. It also makes you think about the psychological life of theorists that devote so much of their lives to solve abstract problems, and then become prisoners of those problems. The mental prison the protagonist is in seems to represent this devotion to abstract thinking getting in the way of a healthy social life.			"

												Interesting puzzle game that doesnt hold your hand at all.  Unfortunately, it seems I needed abit more hand holding because after about 5 minutes I just wanted the apples to fall on my head to kill me.  Nice art style and unique game concept if your into puzzle games.  Although not my type of game I didn't want to give it a thumbs down for game style preference and based my decision on art/functionality/concept.

The devs really put so much effort into this game to make these amazing puzzles and ideas.What's good about this game:-A perfect puzzle game that's not so hard at the beginning, but gets quite hard when you get towards the end.-The visuals are based on black and white drawings, which matches greatly with the idea and the story of the game.-Great physics.-Makes your brain work.So definitely go ahead and buy this game...you'll really enjoy it.

												""The Bridge"" is right on the borderline of a good/bad game.  It's advertised as a strategy (puzzle) game and that's what it is (no problems there).  All the puzzles are interesting and involve walking through an environment, rotating that environment, and inverting yourself.  In general, each ""level"" consists of multiple ""stages.""  The early stages in each level tend to be easy and the final ones tend to be hard.  Again, no problem.  What I have issue with is that several of the puzzles hide the mechanism for solving it instead of just making the solution more complex.  Specifically, there are broken edges to the world that in almost every case, you can't walk/rotate around.  But, in a couple of puzzles, you can (and must).  There's also a problem with the velocity of the transit.  And then, there's the final Steam Achievement:  Collector.  It's pure gamification.  There's not a chance in the world that anyone could ever find more than one of these naturally.  The only way to find them is to do a search online.  Because of this unnecessary frustration, I was ""this close"" to rating the game down.  But, I did get several hours of thought out of the game.  So, I'm sticking with a Thumbs Up.			"

												As someone who rather likes puzzles, I was surprised to find myself utterly bored by this game.  The mechanics revolve around rotating the world and manipulating gravity, and while you might think that would make for some interesting logic puzzles, it just ends up being incredibly sluggish and grey.  You play through four chapters of decent but unremarkable puzzles, then you go into a mirrored world of pretty much the same four chapters but with additional complications.  I stopped playing soon after getting into the mirrored world because the game just felt more like homework than entertainment.  If you're looking for a good puzzle game, this isn't it.  Try Portal, Limbo, Braid, Antichamber, or The Talos Principle.Edit:Alright, I went back and finished the game.  The puzzles get more interesting towards the end, but also more finicky.  Some require  you being very patient and precise as you carefully slide things around.  Some require you to lodge yourself against the edge of a button so you can slide other things around.  Some require you to to swing balls back and forth to try to get enough momentum.  Basically, you feel like you're fighting against the game mechanics instead of using them.  The experience is just not joyful the way better puzzle games are.			"

												The looks are amazing, but the game itself gets boring fast. The ""plot"" seems to have been thrown in there just because, so the game is filled with nonsensical and very badly-written text.Mechanics are never explored fully before presenting a new one, and the pacing and changes in difficulty from one puzzle to the next are, at many times, ridiculous.If you have played Echochrome, another game based around impossible structures, this game is a downgrade.

												I bought this because I love Braid. This was awesome as a puzzle experience and equally as artistic, but lost some of the emotion that Braid made you dig out of yourself.If Braid were a 10 on platformer puzzlers, I would rate this game at a solid 8. The artistic challenges and implementations were so well done I used it in a presentation for games, but it did not capture some of the loveableness of the Braid characters and did not connect you emotionally to the physics insanities of its levels. Braid made me care about the rabid rabbit lunging at me and also care about Braid unwinding the loss of his love. Bridge only made me want to read about M.C. Escher, nothing more.Definitely woth challening you brain. The art is only a huge♥♥♥♥♥bonus. Go for it!			"

												""The Bridge"" is right on the borderline of a good/bad game.  It's advertised as a strategy (puzzle) game and that's what it is (no problems there).  All the puzzles are interesting and involve walking through an environment, rotating that environment, and inverting yourself.  In general, each ""level"" consists of multiple ""stages.""  The early stages in each level tend to be easy and the final ones tend to be hard.  Again, no problem.  What I have issue with is that several of the puzzles hide the mechanism for solving it instead of just making the solution more complex.  Specifically, there are broken edges to the world that in almost every case, you can't walk/rotate around.  But, in a couple of puzzles, you can (and must).  There's also a problem with the velocity of the transit.  And then, there's the final Steam Achievement:  Collector.  It's pure gamification.  There's not a chance in the world that anyone could ever find more than one of these naturally.  The only way to find them is to do a search online.  Because of this unnecessary frustration, I was ""this close"" to rating the game down.  But, I did get several hours of thought out of the game.  So, I'm sticking with a Thumbs Up.			"

												What a weird little game. It's a pretty funky puzzler. It's a nice pick up and put down kind of thing. I've not played a lot of the game, but I can already tell it's the type of game which I'll be picking up and putting down just to kill ten minutes here and there. Equally, there are those little puzzles which'll just stump you for ages and keep you coming back for more determined to beat them.Nice, quirkly and pretty enagaging.			"

												Beautiful puzzle game with simple mechanics that allow for very interesting levels. Heavily inspired by the art of M.C. Escher it takes you into a world where up and down can be turned into it's heads.Each level has a door that you have to reach and in some cases open with the help of some keys. There are elements that you have to avoid in some cases but you can use for your advantage in other levels. Generally, it does not require too much coordination to make things happen in real time and you can go at your own pace playing with the level until you find the right path. You could find a longer path but the game does not punishes for that. You complete each level or don't, there are no stars or differences for finding a solution quickly or with less effort,Very recommended.			"

												Great artstyle, sketchy puzzles.  I really dig the penciled, black and white art direction of The Bridge, but the puzzles will make you feel more frustrated than smart.  It takes some obvious cues from games like Braid and reminds me of Monument Valley, but the easy to understand, reasonable difficulty curve of those titles are lost on The Bridge.  You move your avatar around and tilt the game world left or right while collecting keys and avoiding falling off the map or getting hit by a death ball.  The simple concept should lend itself to clean, heady puzzles, but fails as much as it succeeds.  The line art ends up getting in the way: it can be near impossible to tell what plane your character is standing or will end up while moving.  Many of the puzzles are also physics based and it's quite easy to screw something up by (reasonably) not thinking you should be finagaling the touchy objects as much as you have to.  This leads to frustrating solutions you'll most likely solve by endless tinkering and guesswork rather than looking at a level and feeling smart by reasoning it out.			"

												This game is absolutely awsome! I thought a long time before I bought it and it was (and is) worth every penny. There is not so much of a story in the game so you shouldn't buy it because of a great mystery story or something like that. The artwork however is great and the riddles are clever, challenging and never unfair. You can try a dozen times and if you make a mistake you can rewind (like in prince of persia sot) and try something other. Mostly you can solve the riddles with pure logic - sometimes you will try and error over and over. The game still does not get boring because each riddle is another challenge with other problems. What I really like about the game is that at the firs minute you think ""Oh, that is ginna be easy"" just to be proven wrong a minute later. The first thing you have to do in each riddle is to figure out the mechanics (like in myst) only then you will have the chance to solve the riddle. It is so much fun and there are so many riddles (I'm still not through with the game after many hours of gameplay) and even the steam challenges are real challenges and (with one exception) solvable with some thinking. You will also fall in love with the beautifully handrawn black and white artwork and the minimalistic but fitting soundtrack. Buy the game if you like riddle games that really are challenging and really give you satisfaction after solving a riddle. The pure ""Let's Play"" hits on youtube should be proof enough that this game absolutely is worth it!			"

5/10  (Русскоговорящим: не покупайте)This is the first time I regret spending money on popular computer game. Fist of all, developers had made a fancy Latinic type for this game, but then they was too lazy and used !FREE TYPE! for other languages (Russian, French...) Using a free type in game you're making money of... It's like spit in faces of your foreign customers. It's not even a puzzle - the most time you are challenging your reactions and accuracy. Ugly graphics&physics. The protagonist doesn't seem interacting with this world - he is too bright, so he looks like piece of paper sliding in front of main picture. They might be acceptable for Browser-Flash-Game from 2009, so of course I wanted something way more beautiful.   Too many details. This whole worls is drawn by pensil, and for first 30 minutes it's worth experiensing. But I find watching pencil sketches for long time really boring thing to do.I can't say this game is awful - it has an awerage level. 5/10 "

												Sorry, I usually complete a game or at least spend a decent amount of hours in it, but I cannot, just for this game, progress anymore. I just don't have the motivation to play the game anymore. It's painful.So heres my review for this game:Initially The Bridge might look interesting. The game definitely has that 'indie' vibe you get from games like FTL. However everything will eventually, and quickly become boring, painful sometimes. You're going to reach the point where getting the achievements is your only motivation. But for me, I couldn't care less about that anymore.Since its an indie-game there are little mechanics. The basic being 'moving time backwards' and 'rotating the area so the orientation of gravity changes'. However you don't really have full control of the rotation due to the limit of puzzles. So none of that creating looking stuff in Portal. The game tries to be fancy by adding annoying obstacles like the 'void', but after a level or two a new toy replaces it. It's like having your gum taken away before you could finish chewing all the taste out of it. In addition, the visuals are misleading. Am I talking about the inaccessible stairs or the obvious routes you are limited to? No. See the rain (gravity) they add in stage 3.There's so little development, all those kewl new obstacles becomes repetitive quickly. This dude is just normal. Boringly normal. Song is boring. Literally the same stuff from stage 1 to the end.The game feels more like a chore than an interactive piece of art. I literally cannot lower my standard anymore without trying to wake myself up from bordom.But♥♥♥♥♥♥it was just 99 cents.			"

												There are some cool things about this game, and maybe I'll peck away at it later, but on balance I'm more aggravated than appreciative of the game.What I like: The crazy art; the wild idea of bringing Escher to life; the mental gymnastics that go into solving everything; the instant rewind button so you don't have to start over every ten seconds; the interesting achievements.What I hate: The insanely long loading times every screen; difficulty isn't linear at all, which is fine but you can't skip a particularly feindish level and come back to it; you walk WAY too slow; some levels are dumb timing challenges where you're trying to get there fast enough and hit the button just at the right split-second, instead of an elegant solution falling into place.Too often that means rewinding constantly just to keep trying to hit the right button at the exact right time.

												I feel like I can't quite recommend this game and will try to sum up why without going on for too long.This game has recieved a ton of praise and much of it I agree with too. The art is gorgeous. The story is interesting, if a bit whimsical. I couldn't bring myself to play through the mirrored levels so perhaps the story gets more fleshed out later on. If you get the game for cheap you might just appreciate the art enough to find it worth the price anyway. I guess I kind of do. I've played through much worse games because I enjoyed an aspect of it like the music.My biggest gripes with the Bridge comes down to basically two things. The controls are kind of clumsy, and everything is SO SLOW. It's hard to be precise, and many of the puzzles requires a fair bit of precision. I very much enjoy even very hard platformers or puzzle games, when the controls are tight and you feel fully, 100% in control of what's going on. Luckily you can rewind time in this game to try again, but it takes away some of the joy when you want to do one thing and the game disagrees. It's hard to anticipate in advance what might happen when you do one thing in the more physics-heavy puzzles, which lead me to my next point. Rewinding time is slow and takes you out of the game. Restarting a puzzle takes a bunch of time as well as I had to get into the menus every time. Your character walks super slow. Gravity is low, so it takes time for things to fall in place and you to see the actions of your thoughts. New mechanics are introduced at times but are generally poorly explained. I enjoy finding out about things on my own! But not when it involves new controls that you only find out about through random button mashing or looking at the game controls again (for an action I didn't know how/where to perform it!). I was stuck on one of the simpler puzzles halfway into the game and had to resort to a youtube video only to proclaim ""how was I supposed to know I could do that!""Perhaps I was hoping for more of a pure puzzle game rather than platformer. As it is I felt I spent too much time battling the intricacies of the game and tons of trial and error rather than thinking about how to approach things logically and figure out things in my head.I have no doubt many people enjoy the game, but these are my thoughts and someone may find them interesting or to be an influence in whether the game is worth a try.

												The Bridge is a little gem that may have escaped some in the past, though its inclusion in multiple bundles has exposed it to a wide variety of people. It even has a release on consoles now. And it deserves it. Though a little short, the art style is perfectly encapsulated within the gameplay and story, with an eerie and solemn vibe matched by a wonderful classical score. You can tell they ripped straight from M.C. Escher, but then again why not? It's beautiful.Once you are finished with the main game they have a mirror mode to try as well. A lot of people got this for basically nothing, so it's hard to argue about price. The game is definitely worth 5 or ten dollars alone. Very solid gameplay, and a few puzzles that will definitely warp your mind. There are also a few secrets to find throughout that should keep anyone wanting more busy. Nothing bad to say about this one. Solid design, visuals, and a really nice soundtrack.			"

												Despite the fact that a character can be controlled, it's not a platformer. There is no jump button and the character moves like a snail. So it's all about the puzzles, primarily based on turning the screen to change the center of gravity. And... it is quite boring and the mechanics become so intricate it becomes a chore to solve the level. It feels so tedious that I quit half-way, when I noticed that the next chapters were the same as before, but mirrored.The mechanics to spice things up are a big stone ball that kills the player but is needed to press buttons, a vortex to suck up anything that gets close, portals that make the player change color to interact with different parts of the level in a specific order of events, and veils to modify the... well it has never been very clear to me what they do. There isn't even a key to reset the current level, the player has to do it from the menu. Lastly, the story isn't compelling.There are clear inspirations from Braid, but it is not an experience near as enjoyable or interesting.So I don't end on a completely negative review, I liked the art and some of the musics.

												(Experience: completed roughly 10 rounds)(Time spent: around 20min)(Bought price: $0.99 at 90% discount)     This is definitely an interesting screen-rotating game that you rarely see as a casual open-minded gamer.  However, after completing the first chapter (roughly 6-7 challenges) I got completely bored of the instant repetitive nature of the gameplay. As you progress, The Bridge introduces a number of new elements of challenges - for example, a wrecking ball that kills you upon touch - but even these little details will not grab hold of the gamer's attention long enough to realise that the experiences you get out of your progression is not much different from your first 10 minutes of playing.     Bottomline: it's a nice experience but it's not worth more than a dollar's worth of your time. Also, you will be looking at a lot of grey. A whole lot of grey the entire time you play.			"

												Sorry, I usually complete a game or at least spend a decent amount of hours in it, but I cannot, just for this game, progress anymore. I just don't have the motivation to play the game anymore. It's painful.So heres my review for this game:Initially The Bridge might look interesting. The game definitely has that 'indie' vibe you get from games like FTL. However everything will eventually, and quickly become boring, painful sometimes. You're going to reach the point where getting the achievements is your only motivation. But for me, I couldn't care less about that anymore.Since its an indie-game there are little mechanics. The basic being 'moving time backwards' and 'rotating the area so the orientation of gravity changes'. However you don't really have full control of the rotation due to the limit of puzzles. So none of that creating looking stuff in Portal. The game tries to be fancy by adding annoying obstacles like the 'void', but after a level or two a new toy replaces it. It's like having your gum taken away before you could finish chewing all the taste out of it. In addition, the visuals are misleading. Am I talking about the inaccessible stairs or the obvious routes you are limited to? No. See the rain (gravity) they add in stage 3.There's so little development, all those kewl new obstacles becomes repetitive quickly. This dude is just normal. Boringly normal. Song is boring. Literally the same stuff from stage 1 to the end.The game feels more like a chore than an interactive piece of art. I literally cannot lower my standard anymore without trying to wake myself up from bordom.But♥♥♥♥♥♥it was just 99 cents.			"

												The game idea seemed really neat and mingblowing. But I am afraid ""challenging and creative"" does not fit this game. Overall design was probably meant to pull you into empty and colorless world, which brings simple, but appealing atmosphere. And it does not. Whole world lacks deepness, levels are plain and simple. There's like one or two ways to go and no way to mess up in the process. Game has no appeal in both graphical and game design and is also very short.			"

												Interesting concept, great art, entrancing music.  You alter gravity to walk around impossible MC Escher-type structures.  However, the puzzles are just too annoying.  Some of the mechanics of swapping from foreground to background of structures doesn't work as you intend, so I had to resort to a lot of random walking and switching and more switching rather than just reasoning it out, which I don't find quite as fun.  I ended up quitting it and haven't picked it up again and don't intend to until my rage subsides.			"

												The game is a puzzle platforming (ish, you walk around) with a mix of annoyance and headache. You walk around, manipulating the gravity of the world, avoiding balls of death and collecting keys. Much like braid the complexity of the puzzles increase each level and there is often a new mechanic introduced.I would say that Either you love or hate this game, its very well done, but I am personally not the correct player for this type of game so I didnt like it very much after the first 3 chapters (each chapter is 7 levels).I kind of lost interest after a while to solve the levels, so I started looking at solutions on youtube for the final 2 levels and the mirror world levels, just so I could take the achievements. All in all I played 4.2 hours, but if you solve everything yourself then I wouldnt be surprised if it will take about 7-8 hours or more.Graphics is as they look like in the screenshots and trailers, personally i both like and dislike them, but they work fine for the purpose.Technically the game worked fine, no crashes or anything, though it seems to run quite heavy, I couldnt play youtube movies in the steam overlay without them lagging.I would suggest buying Braid instead of this, better graphics, better music and better gameplay. Much less frustrating and more engaging story.If youve already played Braid and want something more thinking-heavy, then you should get this. Beware of annoying deaths though.			"

												Combines the puzzles of Braid with the artwork (and story, to some degree) of Limbo. The puzzles here are really tough and the learning curve is steep. There's a good reason for this though - once you've worked out the puzzle, that's it, it's over. It needs to be difficult to be playable at all. Which is a shame, because a game that's too hard takes away the fun of playing it. I don't feel like there's enough novelty of what you can do in this game as far as input goes - most of the game is either played in your head or trial and error. Both Braid and Limbo are better games because of this.			"

												I really would have wished for a more neutral rating, since the first levels really are awesome. I played the first 3 chapters and enjoyed them immensely. The riddles make sense and are pure logic.But with chapter 4 they introduce a new element that just does not get explained and suddenly it's just try and error. There is no help in the game that explains how elements are working. And then there are bugs - I got stuck at a level in Chapter 4, so stopped playing to continue the next day. But instead of loading the correct level it was loading an already completed level. And then it jumped the one I failed previously. Given how long the title is on the market a bug they could have addressed by now.So if you like logic riddles the first 3 chapters are among the nicest I have played in a long time. But if you find it frustrating when games go from logic to trial and error you might not want to buy this.			"

However, it's not cool to take everything from Braid and simply replace the art, music, and gameplay.  I would go as far to say that even the game mechanics and concepts are mostly derived from Braid. There is no innovation, only badly executed inspiration, not to mention that the puzzles (except the last one) are way too easy.			"

												I have a soft spot for certain titles, games that force me to change my perspective on what makes a ""decent game"". In this modern era, most folks flock in droves mindlessly to the next huge broseph game, super sharp graphics with a simple theme using the same old formula. *Yawn* Then games like this one come along, and deserves nothing but praise, but alas, becasue of a general lack of mainstream promotions remain a ""gem"" in the gravel mostly passed by those who cannot think for themselves and are unable to choose what is a great game via hype trains. This was a pleasure and a joy so far. It challenges people to use a tool mostly ignored in modern gaming. A brain. (Sick burn dude) With challenging puzzles, amazing themes and mechanics, and a beautiful art style, it was a pleasure. When a puzzle is moments from being solved, and you strike that ""AH-HA!"" point, it feels so satisfying. Nothing but props for this title. Well made and whimsical, it is something i would recommend for everyone and anyone who is willing to challenge themselves. Achievements and Badge progress for fellow farmers and a atmosphere that can stand the test of time. Amazing all around. Just avoid those google sites, and really wrap your skills around a void blanket called ""The Bridge""			"

I also found that none of the elements included in this game were explained? When I was doing my first playthrough I had to look at guides come Chapter 4 because nothing was explained in enough detail?This game is 2D, but it uses gravity and different weird dimensions to make a puzzle game. I enjoyed this game as a whole, but I would have preferred more instruction come to the later levels, as well as less ""sensitive"" solutions so that doing the solution correctly on the 2nd last puzzle of the game doesn't take an hour to work by chance.Just my 2cents: there are better games, but this one has an interesting concept.

												If you’ve played any indie platformers then you’ve already played this game. It’s your typical puzzle platformer game but with a twist, and in this case the twist is the frustratingly slow ability to change the direction of gravity. The puzzles are either insanely easy or super obscure, there’s no real story and the art style isn’t anything special. Overall The Bridge is just not that great, I couldn’t even get myself to finish it even though I finished 3/4th of the game.			"

												Summary: Gravity based puzzle game with time reversal mechanic.Positives: Escher style pencil art is fantastic. Atmosphere is well done. No puzzle requires skill only thought (although some practice required). Relatively short game, entirely complete in a few hours. Time reversal serves to recover errors and refine movement quickly.Negatives: Doesn't play with optical illusions despite art style. While it feels very similar to Braid in style and utilises the same time reversal function, there is no contest on which is the better game. Time reversal not really explored beyond recovery of errors, bar one secret.Conclusion: If you've not played Braid or are not intending to then this is an enjoyable puzzle game to add to your collection. Well contained this will not however have much replayability, good or bad depending what you are looking for. If you have Braid or were thinking about playing Braid, then this game from a puzzle perspective is the quite the inferior challenge and experience.			"

												Thr Bridge's  ironically linear approach to puzzles  betray it's Escher inspired design. The simple puzzles often require less time to solve than they do to complete thanks to the slow rotation speed of the world . The game is made more boring by adding in the slow walking speed and dull score. The art style is interesting but not enough to carry the game.			"

												Interesting concept and art-style but also a little on the short side. The reward for beating some of the tougher puzzles never really seems worth it and the more difficult levels can be borderline frustrating. There are a lot of different mechanics on display, all of which executed solidly and the controls are simple yet effective. It's good, it's just not £10 good imho. Worth getting on offer if its about.			"

												You know when you're browsing a site like Reddit or StumbleUpon, and you see that one post that's really bizzare and doesn't really make sense unless you examine it for a few minutes? But the moment everything falls into place you have that ""aaaaaaaaaaah that was really cool"" moment and then go about your day, never to remember that moment or post ever again?This is the game version of that senario. This game is so short I beat it within the short timespan between waking up at 8 in the morning before leaving for class at 10. During that time the game held my attention irrevocably, making my mind and perception twist and warp until it was able to wrap around the rules of the particular level that I was on. But the moment all the pieces fell into place, the puzzle was solved immediately and I went about to the next level, ready to meld my mind around the next challenge. Then I completely forgot I owned this game after that.Conclusion:4/10Interesting puzzles, but very underwhelming once you were able to change your perspective. If you want to try for yourself, then I suggesst waiting for around for a 50-75% sale.			"

												If you're looking for something similar to Braid this is not it, puzzles are often solved just by rotating the screen around just to see what happens by chance. Often I didn't even realise how I solved a puzzle, unlike Braid where you feel like a genius after solving each puzzle, Bridge makes you feel confused and frustrated at the sometimes clumsy physics of object and the slowness of the rewind mechanic.

												Not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination, but it seems like it very much wants to be Braid, and it's simply not good of a game, in either gameplay or experience.  The game's biggest weakeness is that the normal game is too simple, but what seems like the ""real"" game, the mirror levels, is far too difficult.  The normal games puzzles are fairly easy to figure out without too much difficult, but rarely feel as rewarding as a great puzzle game often does when solving a particularly good one.  The mirror levels introduce such a level of execution difficulty that even when the solution is known, the execution level required makes the game very difficult.  Not a good endorsement of a puzzle game, in my mind.  In the end, despite completing all the normal levels and multiple mirror levels, I simply can't say this game gave me the puzzles or the satisfaction I was looking for, even when it was challenging.  Some great art and ideas, but the execution is lacking, and the cohesive whole is good, but never great.  If you love puzzle games, pick this up on sale, and you'll find some good there...but if you're on the fence, make sure you don't expect this to be another Braid, and go in with your expectation set accordingly.

												This is a carbon copy of Braid. Shamelessly so. The puzzles start off quite promising but quickly descend in to a mix of horrible physics problems and unintuitive puzzle elements that don't really lend themselves to deduction and give no sense of acomplishment. It's not too long before you get frustrated with how slow the character moves and how often the music loops. Unless you really have a boner for Escher, I'd swing past The Braidge.			"

												An interesting game with an obvious M.C. Escher theme that suffers from three main problems, in my opinion.  First, each level consists of one puzzle to solve and there aren't that many levels.  Second, some of the achievements seem to be bugged or are very nit-picky to achieve (being silent on the library level especially).  And third, the game tries to double its length by making ""mirror"" levels, which are the same levels as the first half of the game, but flipped and with a bit of added difficulty.  Only worth it if it's on sale.			"

												Granted I'm only two chapters (out of four) into it, but these didn't take me long to complete.  Most of these I saw or worked through the solution first time.  It's very simple: you really have only the option to rotate the screen (counter- or) clockwise.  Controls are clunky.  The artwork is classically simple, but nothing very impressive.  Time manipulation (a la Braid) is only a simple ""you died, rewind time"" device, and (at least not as far as I got) has no bearing on the puzzles.  I'd give this a five.  Clean and simple, but unchallenging, and pretty quickly boring.  Nothing exceptional, not like Braid or Portal.   Go play Fez, instead.			"

												A real brainmelter. A tough one, but fun. Swirls, reversed gravity, alternate dimensions... It's a tough puzzler. Add the fact that you can turn the world clockwise and counter-clockwise, and that you meet clones of yours (which can't collide or it's game over) and it simply can get really messy. I had a hard time with this game. Dimension changing and rotating make this game complex and requires a lot of tries and patience.Another thing you have to take into account is timing, which is sometimes the most important thing which you simply can't avoid.It's not a puzzler for everyone. Some people will find it annoying and confusing for many reasons. The graphical style also doesn't make anything easier. Even though maps look fantastic, black/white/shades of grey colours sometimes play with your mind and you don't know what's going on. This game would be a perfect for me to ragequit and throw buckets of crap at the developer, but they would not let me do this. This game has a feature every indie game should have (especially puzzlers and platformers) - REWIND. Yes, you can rewind your actions. You can rewind infinitely during a level and even as far as to the very beginning. I have to admit I did not enjoy all the levels. I just found some to be too crazy and confusing. ??? What's going on here and how do I solve it. I asked myself these question quite a few times. I suggest trying to beat them, but even if you get stuck like I did, use a guide. I used a guide quite a few times as my brain reached its limits and so did the patience, but I wanted to experience the game and at least try to beat them.This a confusing game, which requires a lot of patience, attempts and thinking, but thankfully rewind feature saves the day. Get if you like weird setting and brain challenges. "

												Not worth the time or money, really. I only finished the game out to completion because I'm that way. Sometimes it's simply because I spent the money and other times it is because of my OCD. There are games that I have just dropped completely, however, but this wasn't one of them.The Bridge had a very interesting idea, but it was poorly executed. Braid was a MUCH better game that you should go purchase right now and not waste your money on this cheap ""sequel.""For me, the puzzles just got too annoying too quickly and required too much painstaking effort to make sure the littlest piece didn't mess up. As OCD as I am, I usually enjoy immense effort in things like that, but this game just rubbed me the wrong way.The gameplay was also very slow. Even if you know what to do in a level, it takes forever to get it done. The walking and turning is just terribly slow in something like 95% of the levels. Some people argue that it's because it is level-dependent, but there were only like 2 levels where I noticed the pacing was increased vastly. Other than that, all of them seemed the same slow drag to me.Besides that, the color palette and lack of a story made it boring. Braid told a story and looked beautiful doing it. I usually don't hold games up side-by-side in a review, but this game tried to repeat Braid's success and failed. The game would have looked much better styled up like Braid (and it even shows that in two different 5 second scenes) and it really needed a story.Overall, it seemed like a boring slog through annoying puzzles that led to no real payout of any kind.

Manipulate gravity to redefine the ceiling as the floor while venturing through impossible architectures. Explore increasingly difficult worlds, each uniquely detailed and designed to leave the player with a pronounced sense of intellectual accomplishment. The Bridge exemplifies games as an art form, with beautifully hand-drawn art in the style of a black-and-white lithograph.			"

												This was my go-to puzzle game when I needed to kill time. It layers each of its mechanics slowly, and, before you know it, you’re stumped in a puzzle where gravity is sideways, alternate gravity is upside-down, the map screen is tilted at a 45-degree angle, and the Newton-wannabe that you control is falling off of the platform.  Luckily, when you die, you can rewind time in a very Braid-like manner to re-attempt the puzzle. The game is built on the ability to rotate the screen, changing the gravity for the protagonist and allowing him to access otherwise unreachable destinations. In each puzzle, you must get a key and go through a door. This simple goal becomes complicated when the Escher-inspired puzzles begin rotating.  As you explore more puzzles, other features are introduced: a white plane and a black plane, the ability to change or align these planes’ gravity, and a portal that flips the 2D puzzle entirely.I find the black-and-white art beautiful, but it’s distracting or obscuring in some puzzles. The story also takes a note from Braid: minor bits after a few puzzles, fed to you with a vague, heavy hand. I’m not sure where the Faux Newton plot is going, but I don’t care. As long as you don’t take the game as seriously as it wants you take it, it’s enjoyable.			"

												This game had me within the first 10 seconds. It is beautifully drawn and boasts a unique style of gameplay. A definite must for Escher fans. The nature of the puzzles takes some time to get used to and the first half of the game isn't too difficult. In saying that, I spent a good deal of my hours played on the last half of the game, when the puzzles proved a lot more difficult. This game is a workout for the brain. Not much going on control wise.... walk left, walk right, tilt left, tilt right. It's just when to do what and how much of it to do that really matters in this game. Too much tilt and you can find yourself falling straight off the map. I found this game challenging enough. Each puzzle could be solved within a reasonable amount of time and it did not make me want to throw my computer out the window....which is always a good thing. Combine the puzzles with the artwork and gameplay and you have yourself a very enjoyable game. I recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games and give it a 9 out of 10. Points lost because it just ended all too quickly for me. I wanted more!!!			"

												The start of the game reminded me of Braid (another great game), but in a good way. I'm about half way through the 'normal' campaign, and the puzzles are fun and challenging.Also love the Escher artwork, especially when the weird constructions are actually part of the puzzle!Great game.

												The bridge is a Puzzle game that uses gravity mechanics as you tilt the world and move your character to get to end of the level (the door) while avoiding and using obstacles like the boulder and the vortex to solve the puzzles. I love the appearance of this game as it is in a grey sketch. This game is one of the best puzzle games i've played in a while.			"

												I totally recommend this game only for people who loves to solve puzzle. I actually think this game is just for geeks! There are quiete interesting topology based problems you can. If you are a person who are not quite into solving puzzles. All I can say is this game can drive you nuts!			"

												Enjoyable and short puzzle-platformer where the ""gimmick"" is the ability to rotate the entire level in order to manipulate the gravity of you and other objects around you. The rotation is similar to And Yet It Moves in that regard, and there's a simple time-rewind mechanic in order to undo your mistakes (although this does not actually factor into any of the actual puzzles for the most part). There's also an ""overworld"" that consists of your house, the yard around it, and multiple doors to the different, numbered worlds (and individual doors to each of the sub-levels in those worlds). So in those two regards (overworld layout and the simple ""undo your mistakes"" button), it somewhat reminds me of Braid. The art style is interesting, complete with odd geometry and floating objects, but the lack of color for the main game gets a bit tiring. The puzzles have a good difficulty curve, and getting all the achievements requires some work (and/or guides). It's not very long and feels like And Yet It Moves with touches of Braid, but the mechanics and difficulty are both solid. I'd buy it on sale for a few dollars.			"

												The bridge does itself no favors my borrowing heavily from M C Escher and Braid... while the art is good, it is not as good as Escher, and the same goes for the gameplay.  Don't be fooled by the wrappings, this game is most similar to those rolling ball puzzles you will find in nick nack stores.  I wish they would have taken the time to develop what they have, instead of relying on the borrowed trappings of other, better works.			"

												A genuinely good puzzler.  The controls are simple: A & D move you, left & right arrows spin the world, W triggers doors and inverters.  Some levels take careful planning, and even when you see how to solve the level, working out how to make it happen can be tricky as well!  6 rooms in each of 4 levels, and then the same mirrored; 48 levels in all.  I thought the mirrored levels would be simple, but while the room is a mirror of the original, there are other twists to add challenges to them as well.The game's artwork is again, simple, but genuinely good.  The levels are black & white, but animated in a similar manner as old cartoons; things like the shading of the doors changing from frame to frame, giving it a mild flicker.  It's delightfully charming and a nice touch.Overall, a highly recommended puzzler.			"

												The Bridge is a very addicting puzzle game in which you manipulate gravity and other objects to navigate through the puzzles.  I would recommend it to anyone and even if you missed the 1$ sale it is still worth the 10$ price.The graphics are interestingly done and the gameplay is easy to pick up.  The level progression is fluid and you learn different situations at a time before moving onto the next type of puzzle. I am trying to give a review without adding any spoilers which is why it is a little vague on gameplay.  However as I mentioned it's a great game and worth a shot. :)			"

												Play Time: 52 minsLevels acheived: Chapter 4 level 4Opinion: Boring                I enjoy playing challenging puzzle games alot as it's nice to have my brian be the deciding factor on whether I win or lose and not the skill at using mouse and keyboard. So I bought this interesting game for just 70p to see what it's like. I was rather disappointed.                 The game delivers a nice looking world with each level that is fun to look at as the landscape is very confusing, using quirky optical illusions to distort the map. This I really liked but in the way of puzzle gameplay it was slow and not very challenging. I found I could complete most levels through just using trial and error once or twice to get to the end instead of actually using my brain to figure out where I was meant to go and how I was supposed to minipulate the terrain (yes this can be considered a fault on my part and I respect that). The one time I did use my brain to track my steps through the puzzle world was more like going through a maze than completing a puzzle, not a very puzzling level.                Another reason I don't recommend it is the progression through the levels is not at all rewarding. The story was not at all interesting if at all existent, and the reason I say this is because at the end of each level there was a thought for you to read. It did not tell a story or explained why this was happening, it was just nonsense. This coupled with the very uninteresting new components added each chapter, left me with no motivation to continue through the levels to discover what was at the end. It also didn't help that the character walks the pace of a snail, ""If you would like to get there this life time that would be great.""                 What I did like about the game was the ability to warp back in time when you failed, instead of completely restarting the game. Having to restart every time I died, keys flying off the map, boulders getting too up close and personal, would of been very irritating. The map design was very clever with all the optical illusions and the confusing layout, with the added art form the maps where nice to look at and very unique.                 The game is unique with map and puzzle design but not fun to play and gives no reason to continue playing.			"

												This isn't so much a negative review as it is a ""know what you're getting into"" review. Technically a No, but with a giant asterisk. I bought this game on sale for a dollar. I definitely got my dollar's worth. I think that if I had paid full price, I would have been disappointed, but only because of the glowing 9/10 reviews. Had I expected less, I would've been more satisfied with what I got.First, the puzzles themselves weren't great. There was no sense of build as I went on. I never felt like I was learning more about what it meant to interact in a world of impossible shapes. I had no ""Aha!"" moments where a shift in my thinking made the solution obvious. More than a few times my reaction was ""Really? It was that easy?"" The later puzzles pile on complexity but feel more like a slog than an intricate problem.This is compounded by the second problem: The controls feel very clunky. It makes the exploratory / trial-and-error phase of learning about the puzzles more work than fun. It's not all bad. The art and sound design are excellent. There is some fun puzzling to be had. It's just overall the game fails to deliver. I give it 6 misspent youths out of a possible 10. If you go in expecting 9/10, you will be disappointed.			"

												I've had my eye on this game for  a while, so, 4 days ago, when it came down to $1, I jumped.It's probably worth the full $10 (though as a total cheapskate, you might not catch me buying it for more then $5 (if I needed to buy it again for some reason)).I love puzzle games, but I find it difficult to get the right kind; they're always too easy, or repeditive, or fast paced, or require the existance of decent hand-eye coordination. This game works at your pace, with a huge diversity of puzzles, and potentaily hours of entertainment (it depends what pace you work at, of course).The graphics are charming, and the controls are quite unique (though I always feel bad for the little character when I'm screwing with the gravity).I enjoyed the confusion other people seemed to have when I handed them my laptop and let them have a go, and I'm proud to boast that I finished the game having never looked up the answers ( I did need some help with the ""collector"" achievement, though).Fantastic game.

												If Braid and Closure had a love child that was raised by M. C. Escher, you'd get this game.It's got a unique puzzle mechanic and does great things with it.  It takes a bit for it to get really warmed up, but then it reveals just how clever it can be.Downsides are that the music is aggressively average, and the game could stand to be a bit longer.  There are also a few puzzles where you have to be really precise with how you set things up, but it's not too frustrating.Give it a shot, it's a great game!			"

												It's... something. Very artistic, even more than Braid, but it feels like a love letter to Braid anyway. It's hard to think like The Bridge wants you to. I feel like the ramp up the levels of each chapter is not smooth. Usually the first few levels can be beaten derping around, and then the last two really require luck or a lot of trial and error. I feel like I didn't have the tools I needed to understand how to beat the last few levels. Instead it was just a lot of trial and error, and I won. Worth it as a frain-bocking exercise and artistic experience for a couple bucks.			"

												The Bridge was quite a satisfying puzzle platformer with a fantastic art style. The premise is that you navigate a series of mathematical constructs based on the work of M C Escher. Each construct is a separate self contained puzzle where you must manipulate gravity by rotating the world and eventually reach the exit. Eschers drawings were already a marvel to try and navigate in a visual sense and placing them into a game such as this now enables you to actually explore them! The art style also matches this concept perfectly by closely replicating the original Escher drawings and does not distract from solving the puzzles.The puzzles themselves start off fairly simple and I was able to fly through the first three areas fairly quickly. Although, the difficulty really ramps up in the second half of the game. That being said solving the puzzles felt intuitive and I never had to resort to fast timing or twitch mechanics. That being said, once I had a handle of how all the gravity mechanics worked together the last few puzzles did not provide as much of a challenge as I was expecting. A few other features that I really appreciated were the ability to rewind time and the visual cues that were used to indicate how gravity applied to each different object on screen. The visual cues were especially useful late game when there were often multiple gravity effects in play at one time. Also, the ability to simply rewind time and undo mistakes encouraged experimentation and trial and error, which was perfect when I couldn't immediately see the solution to a puzzle. Although, I felt that sometimes I could just trial and error all the way to a solution without ever actually 'solving' it.All in all I did rather enjoy playing The Bridge, the puzzles were challenging for the most part while not becoming utterly frustrating. Not as inspired as the likes of Braid but there were definitely some interesting mechanics. Would recommend for sure.			"

												Score: 7/10If you want a long, fullfilling challenge I'll warn you: The Bridge is a relatively short puzzle game, unless you get stuck in a single place for long you should really be able to finish EVERYTHING in about five hours (Though you should find yourself a guide if you want the collector achievement, some are impossible to get without hints that, no, you won't find in game).About the game in itself: the graphics are quite nice and lovely, if you love Escher you'll LOVE the game just by staring at its impossible graphics which, at the same time, make for mind-boggling puzzles.Sadly, the mechanics of the game are NOT as complex as the graphics suggests...As most puzzles games, expecially those where you control the world as well as your character, your abilities are limited (This time more by speed than actual limiting, but if a death-ball is between you and where you want to go forget about changing the world fast enough that you ""skip"" the ball: it'll follow you to your death)This however makes the solution maybe too linear, sometimes making the user start to meta-think the solution (going left not because it'll lead me to the solution but because going right will kill me so it's obviously not the answer).Adding more mechanics doesn't fix it, as essentially starts becoming ""Okay, can't go left, nor right, I'll use that switcher there then.""The hardest levels try to fix this by relying more on momentum and timed movements, while they succeed I personally dislike those due to feeling ""un-puzzle-like"" to me.The puzzles tend to be still challenging if you try to ""understand"" the solution, expecially due to the peculiar graphics making it hard to get a clear idea of what's going on the screen, so I suggest everyone playing this game to do this, but it lost some points due to being too weak to the ""trial-and-error"" solution.

												In each level, you have to get to the exit door. You do this by walking, rotating gravity, avoiding evil balls, pick up keys, and control a bunch of other mechanics. Most levels are clever, but can be solved with some trial-and-error. Some require precise movement/timing/alignment of gravity. This can get very annoying, but at least you can rewind as much as you want. There is some Escher stuff going on in the level design; paths that cross themselves.This game will not appeal to everybody: it is very frustrating at times, especially when you want to get one of the balls to move in a certain direction but rotating gravity makes the dude slide to his death. If you want a slow, hand-drawn physics puzzle game and don't easily get dizzy, I can recommend this game, but only just. Worth playing, but not worth €9,99.			"

												8/10Difficult. I loved this game because, yes it was hard, but I enjoyed it. The game play is simple using A and D to move left and right in order to turn the environment around. The puzzles are engaging and you really feel a sigh of relief and a sense of achievement when you finsh this game. The achievements set up a good challenge as some are really hard to get which adds a little extra to the game. There are a lot of puzzles in this game there are 8 main chapters and 9 sub-chapters per chapter (72 in total). There is a lot of replability in this game once you have forgoten the puzzle's solutions.I liked the black and white asthetic style. It suits the game and is fitting for the story.If you pay enough attention to the environment you can tell that there is a story behind all the things that you are doing. I did not feel as though the story was forced on me though so if you just want a puzzle game that is what you will get.Overall I enjoyed this game and found the puzzles a real challenge. I am ashamed to say it, but I had to look at a walkthrough for a couple of puzzles because I just could not work them out. If you are like me and you love stories there is a subtle one running throughout, but as I say it can by just a puzzle game.			"

												This is a wonderful puzzle game that fans of MC Escher, or the mobile game Monument Valley, should definitely look into. If you like perspective and logic puzzles this is not to be missed.The dreamy hand drawn and monochramic art style is full of great little details and the different level elements really come into prominence when you start rotating and using the stage. In one level I hadn't noticed that the 'log' on the ground was actually a lit candle when the stage was rotated 90 degrees and the candle was suddenly upright. Flourishes like how the character is sketched into each level, and the way a  'trace' of him is left each time you fail and rewind, lend a lot of personality to the game as well. It feels like an Escher drawing so it really does feel like we're in the playground of his imagination.I play puzzle games in small bursts but I can already tell that The Bridge is one of those special games where I will be eager to tackle and finish the puzzles and the game, but I'll also be hoping that the game won't end any time soon. Great  stuff. A+			"

												This game feels to me like it's trying to be Braid 2, with esoteric rhetoric, simple-yet-convoluted symbolism, and pensive vibes (not to mention a rewind mechanic). Unfortunately, for me it just falls flat. What made Braid really work for me was how well-executed the rewind mechanic was, how versatile it was, and how everything built off of time to create a unique and thoughtful atmosphere, rather than a bunch of random puzzles thrown together. The controls were tight, the artwork beautiful, and the puzzles complex enough to keep me thinking about them and coming back to them for days.I can't really say the same applies here. While the mathematician-style of abstract thought and thinking in several dimensions is present here, the game comes across as something simple trying to be something pensive. The controls are slow. Your character moves the speed of a snail in molasses frozen in an iceburg buried under a mountain. While this does aid in the pensive vibes I get from this game, nothing about this game is all that pensive (and I was feeling this even BEFORE I played Antichamber, which succeeds dramatically where this game does not). The puzzles are extremely simple, at least for the first three chapters, and everything can be done with minimal experimentation. I would really like it if i could think about the puzzles at my own pace, rather than solving a puzzle mentally in seconds and having to slow my mind down to a crawl as the character ever so slowly meanders across the screen. Antichamber and Braid do this brilliantly; you can move around and come back at any time if a particular puzzle looks too hard, and solve it in seconds if you finally figure out how. Here, there's no such joy of discovery, since you'll likely discover the solution on accident as you wander ever so slowly back and forth.Unfortunately, this game also suffers from what a lot of indie games seem to nowadays: a terrible difficulty spike for no reason. The first three chapters (and half the fourth) were unbelivably simple and required no thoughtwork whatsoever. Then, one level abruptly is insaely complex, time-consuming, and far more difficult than anything before it, with nothing leading up to it at all. That's not how you design a puzzle game. That's not how you design any game.Lastly, new mechanics aren't introduced well. It's totally fine to have new mechanics as a game progresses, but it took me quite a few minutes to realize that those arrows flip gravity. Why? Because the flipping-gravity effect looks nothing like it has anything to do with flipping gravity. I would expect something straightforward; rotate the camera 180 degrees, grey out the screen a bit, maybe flash a two-way arrow, something simple. Instead, there's a circle wipe from the center outwards reminiscent of a Powerpoint slideshow, and the level kinda looks like it's changed in the process, but I can't really tell because the level is vertically symmetrical anyway. Oops. Oh, and gently touching one of those boulders kills you dead on the spot, because why not.It's stuff like this that just irks me about a game. Especially because, just with a few more months of beta-testing and polish, this game could be absolutely amazing. They've got some fantastic ideas here, and they've executed them horribly. That's just the saddest thing for me, because I like games that are great, and this one just barely isn't there.			"

												I guess this game was heavily inspired by Bastion. But that one at least was fun.Graphics style is good.Music is basically missing and the few chords get annoying soon.The first three worlds are way too simple.The fourth world gets interesting and challenging, but it never explains the gravity changing principles properly, you're likely to search for help online.The last level and the following ""mirrored worlds"" are based on ugly gimmicks, like pixel positioning. Many parts of that are no longer a puzzle game, but something like a reverse platformer (try to hit that ledge with that ball by controlling gravity).You never know what you can step on (and from which angle) and what is just decoration.The loading times are terrible.But worst of all, the whole game is unbelievably slow. All animations take eternity, the gravity rotation is very slow, the game time can't be sped up, and reversing time is tiringly slow as well (if you spent 2 minutes without movement just pondering about the level and then want to return past that point, you're going to spend a lot of time looking at a still character). The whole game is so lazy, that it took me all my will to continue with more levels in the mirrored worlds. It's just wasting your time instead of letting you play. And all of that could be solved so easily - let people skip initial level animations, and add a button to speed up game time. But it isn't.			"

												The artwork for this game is pretty intricate, which really adds to the gameplay. The puzzles overall are a mix of casual, which get progressively harder or more time-sensitive as you get further into the game.I think one of the driving factors against it would be it's limited playtime, which many puzzle games suffer from - there's not a lot of replayability here, so it's more-or-less a one-and-done game.It's not a bad game, but I agree with another reviewer in how it's somewhere in the middle for me, in terms of recommend/not recommend. It was about 10 hours total that I had spent play this game, including all puzzles and achievements. For the original store price and the time it takes to complete the game, I probably wouldn't recommend buying it - wait for a coupon or a sale.			"

												A nice little puzzle game with a steep learning curve. Pros: I personally liked the art style, which I think worked well with puzzles that remind me of optical illusions. The rewind mechanic is one of the more forgiving aspects of this game, similar to the Prince of Persia's dagger, but without a time limit. The puzzles were engaging enough that I remained invested in playing through to the finish.Cons: Puzzles range from really simple to extremely difficult. I didn't mind using video walkthroughs for some of them, but while some puzzles were easy enough once you figured out the trick, others I wouldn't have figured out without the walkthrough (i.e. using momentum).Bottom line: I would recommend playing through it once, but for me it doesn't hold a lot of replay value.

												Overall a really amazing puzzle game.  Gameplay starts off really simple, getting to know the mechanics and the gravity.  Eventually it gets extremely challenging, forcing you to use everything that you have learned in order to solve a seemingly impossible puzzle.  Point of view plays a big role, letting you change where you are based on screen orientation.  I would for sure say that anyone who enjoys puzzle games should check this one out!			"

												Thought provoking puzzle game with interesting ""plot"" (minimal, but interesting) and challenging levels. Gets a bit repetitive and complicated towards the end, but I guess the challenge is part of the game. Art is a nice style, not my personal preference, but it is nice and clean. Overall I would recommend if your looking for a challenge, but not for a casual puzzle experience.			"

												The Bridge is a logic puzzle game that forces you to evaluate the preconceptions of physics and perspective by manipulate gravity while venturing through impossible architectures.The Bridge world is truly a marvel to behold, not only for its diverse, colourless design, but for its ingenuity and artistic flare.

												This is one of the best puzzle games I have played in a while  The 3D messes with your mind and I love it!  The art style, music, and atmosphere are all beautifly done.   The passing is very good, and the game feel is fantastic.  If you like puzzle games or mind benders, then you will love this game.My only complaint, is that the game is too short.Honest 10/10 from me			"

												Very unique game with a beautiful art style. Fun for people who enjoy abtract thinkng games which require you to think differenlt (like Portal). Can get difficult, but that only makes completing levels that much more satisfying! (or make you feel like a total idiot it's a 50/50 chance). Also the music is really cool and setts the mood well, and if you get stuck t doesn't become repetative.10/10 would buy again			"

												A beautifully crafted game in which you solve maze-like puzzles mostly by turning your world round and round and upside down. As you do so, sliding things slide, rolling things roll, and your character falls from floor to ceiling to wall.Sadly, if your mind is boggle-prone, you will soon encounter seemingly unsolvable puzzles. Boggled being my mind's normal resting state, I soon encountered a puzzle (the 3rd, if memory serves) that I had to revisit many times before the mind-bogglingly simple solution presented itself. The following puzzle stumps me yet.I would have appreciated a gentler difficulty slope on the road to bogglement, but it is what it is (a very clever and attractive game), I am what I am (a rather unclever and unattractive gamer), and I cannot really blame the game for the latter circumstance.4 of 5 stars			"

												I really like the idea of the game. Playing a puzzle based on physics and 2D/3D trickering images.But to me this game is to slow (e.g. the rotation) and bohemian. After I got the very basics I have been confronted with the same kind of puzzles, over and over again… Then something new came in without introduction. It took me some time to wake up and think again but after solving that puzzle I closed the game.			"

												A very unique 2D puzzle game. It has a simple but amazing mechanic: control gravity. Every puzzle needs some gravity shifting to be completed and most of the time they require you to think how to get something from its spot to another spot where it could be useful for you to get to the door to the next level. The puzzles aren't ""impossible hard"", all are solvable in a reasonable amount of time thanks to the possibility to rewind time. Also, the style of the game is neat too. All in all, a very good and simple-looking puzzle game!Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												A nice little puzzle game with a steep learning curve. Pros: I personally liked the art style, which I think worked well with puzzles that remind me of optical illusions. The rewind mechanic is one of the more forgiving aspects of this game, similar to the Prince of Persia's dagger, but without a time limit. The puzzles were engaging enough that I remained invested in playing through to the finish.Cons: Puzzles range from really simple to extremely difficult. I didn't mind using video walkthroughs for some of them, but while some puzzles were easy enough once you figured out the trick, others I wouldn't have figured out without the walkthrough (i.e. using momentum).Bottom line: I would recommend playing through it once, but for me it doesn't hold a lot of replay value.

												8/10Difficult. I loved this game because, yes it was hard, but I enjoyed it. The game play is simple using A and D to move left and right in order to turn the environment around. The puzzles are engaging and you really feel a sigh of relief and a sense of achievement when you finsh this game. The achievements set up a good challenge as some are really hard to get which adds a little extra to the game. There are a lot of puzzles in this game there are 8 main chapters and 9 sub-chapters per chapter (72 in total). There is a lot of replability in this game once you have forgoten the puzzle's solutions.I liked the black and white asthetic style. It suits the game and is fitting for the story.If you pay enough attention to the environment you can tell that there is a story behind all the things that you are doing. I did not feel as though the story was forced on me though so if you just want a puzzle game that is what you will get.Overall I enjoyed this game and found the puzzles a real challenge. I am ashamed to say it, but I had to look at a walkthrough for a couple of puzzles because I just could not work them out. If you are like me and you love stories there is a subtle one running throughout, but as I say it can by just a puzzle game.			"

												This is a wonderful puzzle game that fans of MC Escher, or the mobile game Monument Valley, should definitely look into. If you like perspective and logic puzzles this is not to be missed.The dreamy hand drawn and monochramic art style is full of great little details and the different level elements really come into prominence when you start rotating and using the stage. In one level I hadn't noticed that the 'log' on the ground was actually a lit candle when the stage was rotated 90 degrees and the candle was suddenly upright. Flourishes like how the character is sketched into each level, and the way a  'trace' of him is left each time you fail and rewind, lend a lot of personality to the game as well. It feels like an Escher drawing so it really does feel like we're in the playground of his imagination.I play puzzle games in small bursts but I can already tell that The Bridge is one of those special games where I will be eager to tackle and finish the puzzles and the game, but I'll also be hoping that the game won't end any time soon. Great  stuff. A+			"

												I was a bit skeptical about this game.. I was wrong. This game is really amazing. It makes you think through puzzles within THREE different dimensions! I know that sounds difficult to do but each level does a really awesome job at teaching you each function every level as to not overwelm you. If you're really good at problem solving this game can last you probably a good 8 hours I'm assuming as I got through what I believe is the first half in about 3.5 hours. The art style is very similar to a combination of Braid and Limbo which are also both really awesome game. I highly recommend checking this game out!			"

												June 4, 2015The Bridge is an interesting game. The pacing is nice in the first half, but slows down later. Some players may find the obscure storyline annoying, but the story is mostly in the background. There's a surprising amount of puzzle variation for only having 4 real buttons for controls. Keyboard controls fine, nothing requires analog controls.I'm not really sure what to think of the game after finishing it. The story is interesting but feels incomplete. The second half of the game gets a bit busy with too many objects to manipulate. New mechanics are added for only a few levels, and are not cleanly introduced.I like the game, but the later levels became a bit of a drag, to the point that I just needed walkthroughs as I didn't want to spend a lot of time with uncompelling puzzles. So it's good early, becomes a bit too precision-based in the very end. Not too frustrating, but I've had better puzzles. It's good, but not a rush-buy at full price. I'd recommend the game to puzzle fans for at least 50% off, under $5 USD.			"

												I honestly thought this was made by the creator of Braid, but apparently it isn't.  It has a similar style of artwork and even has the ""rewind"" feature.  Just like braid, it's a fun and challenging puzzler, but not as good as braid.  I took a break from it recently because I even got stumped on a level (and I don't give up on a puzzle/level easily), but am looking forward to more play time eventually.  I'd say buy it when it's on sale, but not at full price :P  Basically, if you enjoyed Braid, you'll enjoy The Bridge ^_^			"

												If you're looking for a game to engross you for hours on end, let me start by saying this is not for you. With 8.5 hours into the game, I have all but completed the whole thing. The whole story was completed within probably 6 hours, if you would consider it a story. It's more of just multiple puzzles put together to really twist your brain. With each puzzle being completed, the story get just a little bit more ""interesting"".The game does make you think; afterall it is a puzzler. You simply have to walk left and right or rotate the world left or right. With just those four directional queues, you have to maneuver your way through around 50 puzzles. If you make a mistake, you can rewind time as far back as you want or need to. It feel like an indepth platformer / puzzler. The visual appeal is there in a sense. The game doesn't project visually stunning graphics. It's meant to have a simple, trippy, and hand drawn / rustic feeling. It gits the mysterious category it is portraying. The layout of the puzzles is what causes the trippy atmosphere. All of the puzzles encompass physically impossible maps and puzzle boards. Sometimes while rotating the world and walking, my eyes would flutter and become dizzy just from trying to comprehend how what I am doing is working. I don't play many games. I tend to look at them, think I'd enjoy them and add them to my library. This one actually caught my attention in my library and ended up binge playing it thoroughly. Is it worth the $9.99? I don't think so. If you can get it for a dollar or two, maybe. There was also a flaw in the game where, if you free fall for a long period of time, the framerate drops immensly to 1 or 2 fps. Very unhappy about that. This is the exact reason I did not get 100% of the achievements. The game also supports full controller support. I opted to use the keyboard only as 1) I didn't even realize that it supported the controller until I was 3/4 done this review and 2) I wanted to try just keyboard control. I use a controller 9/10 when playing a game through Steam or on my PC and wanted to really get a feel for the KB/M controls of games.Overall, I'm happy I played the game. It was interesting and something a little off the beaten path, per se. Would I ever play it again? I don't think so. Maybe once or twice to show people or try to get 100% one last time, but that's about it. I definitely won't be back anytime soon as I doubt the framerate issue will be fixed anytime soon.			"

												The game uses a mechanic similar to And Yet It Moves, you twist the world around you to complete puzzles. Difficulty increases steadily, sometimes a little sharper than expected. The world gives you small environmental clues to help foster a solution.The only thing I will say is that the mirrored worlds are horse♥♥♥♥♥♥ They aren't mirrored, they are just more difficult versions of previous puzzles, often times needing a ridiculous amount of patience or finesse to pull off. Using physics that were never necessary before. It is no longer about solving the puzzle, all about abusing the game mechanic to get to your goal. It's the terrible half of the game.			"

												Short, sweet, and utterly wonderful to look at, this eyecatching game has a knack for capturing the cerebral art of M.C. Escher perfectly, but with a price in puzzle design. In concept, his mind bending art is perfect for creating interesting navigational puzzles, but their decisions to make the character slow in movement and the trial and error methods needed to solve the later puzzles ultimately lets down on the concept. By no means does this make it a poor game, quite the contrary; the earlier puzzles are truly gratifying, and while they do grow on some interesting concepts, the shortness of the games keeps it welcoming, so that the final few puzzles barely detract. A fictional story is also told describing the relationship between Escher and Sir Isaac Newton, and adds another layer to the game that makes progression all the more enjoyable. The mirrored levels provided after the base game is completed, as well as numerous little challenges and hidden secrets keep the game very replayable, but only if you actively look for them. Otherwise, it is a charmingly brief experience that will most likely leave you with a feeling of both satisfaction and desire for a little bit more.Providing that you have the patience to wade through its more irritating puzzles, you will find a great little game, and a wonderful hommage to the legendary artist.

												If you have ever looked at one of M.C. Escher's drawings of impossible buildings (with people walking on what should be a floor but you can't tell if it's actually the wall or the ceiling) and wondered what it would be like to wander around on that fantastical mind-bending playground, you need to play this game.Imagine FEZ, but with a hand-sketched style and set inside an M.C. Escher drawing.  The mental challenge reminds me of trying to solve one of those puzzles where you have to remove the metal ring from a rope threaded through a couple blocks of wood, or try to separate different-shaped metal rings from each other.  This game provides the same sort of spatial puzzle-solving challenge.The puzzles felt fair: nothing is hidden from you.  They do a great job with the difficulty curve: every level felt like it was just a little bit harder than the last one, and I didn't experience any big difficulty spikes.  That being said, once it gets going, this game does get quite difficult.  But if you stick with it and keep trying different things, you will keep making progress.  And every time you finish a tough level, the feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment is fantastic.If you are looking for a tough but fair puzzle game, I highly recommend that you check out The Bridge.

												The Bridge is a cerebral yet visceral physics puzzler inspired by the life and works of MC Escher. The art is very Escher-like and wonderfully rendered. Storywise it has some similarities with Braid and might not satisfy those looking for neat plot resolutions.I'm among those who had lag problems on a few levels but they were never game-breaking, just annoying.If you're fond of real-life spatial puzzles (marble rollers, block sliders, wrought iron bar puzzles, rubik's cubes) you'll probably enjoy this one. It combines true-to-life elements from those old school puzzles with otherworldly gravity manipulation mechanics.			"

												This game had me within the first 10 seconds. It is beautifully drawn and boasts a unique style of gameplay. A definite must for Escher fans. The nature of the puzzles takes some time to get used to and the first half of the game isn't too difficult. In saying that, I spent a good deal of my hours played on the last half of the game, when the puzzles proved a lot more difficult. This game is a workout for the brain. Not much going on control wise.... walk left, walk right, tilt left, tilt right. It's just when to do what and how much of it to do that really matters in this game. Too much tilt and you can find yourself falling straight off the map. I found this game challenging enough. Each puzzle could be solved within a reasonable amount of time and it did not make me want to throw my computer out the window....which is always a good thing. Combine the puzzles with the artwork and gameplay and you have yourself a very enjoyable game. I recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games and give it a 9 out of 10. Points lost because it just ended all too quickly for me. I wanted more!!!			"

												Let me start by saying although I recommend this game, I would rate it as a 6/10.It's a pretty good puzzler, and fans of games like Echochrome and Monument Valley will definitely be into it, as that's what I thought the game would be like when I bought it. Some are comparing it to Braid, but the only part that's the same is that you need to rewind time when you die.The reason for the low rating is because the puzzles are way too easy. Unless you're brand new to puzzle games, you'll breeze through the first half. Once you get to the mirrored versions, the difficulty does ramp up quite a lot, but even those require nothing but trial and error to finish them. ""This didn't work, so let me try this... Nope, that didn't work, either, what about... Ah, yep. Got it."" There was very little mental stimulation going on. Nothing I had to ""figure out.""If this game is on sale, it's worth picking up. If I had paid the full amount, my rating may have been lower.			"

On the first go around I was good until I think the fourth chapter when I finally needed a walkthrough consultant and then used it on and off for the remainder of the game. Parts of it are very hard and I would reccomend a walkthrough as to not hurt your head too much. The world is quite unique with its mysterious story without any voiced dialogue. Still, its pretty fun although you might tear your hair out at points. I give them major credit for making a good puzzle game, even if puzzle games aren't my personal style. Good fun for a buck.			"

												If you liked Monument Valley, you'll probably love this game. The art style is quite different, but there's a similar visual theme of impossible geometrical objects like in MC Escher's drawings, and puzzles relating to this. However, the puzzles in this game are far more challenging and satisfying than those in Monument, in my opinion, and the game has much more depth, being both longer and having more mechanics at play simultaneously in each level. In short, the game is delightful, and passing through each level brings with it some sense of accomplishment, which certainly held my interest through until the end.			"

												This is a very cool Indie Puzzler that has a style similar to that of M.C. Esher's drawings. There is a focus on physics and manipulating the world around you by rotating it and specific objects within it, with the aim of being able to retrieve the key(s) that unlock the door that allows you to finish/leave the level. It's relatively short, only offering a few hours or gameplay, but after completing the 4 main chapters a Mirrored Mode is unlocked.Overall an enjoyable game and is a must-have for puzzle-fans. Enjoy! :D			"

												This is very slow-moving puzzler for the thinking man who likes to take a long look at the situation and envision the path to success. The gameplay consists of < > to rotate the world, and A D to move the character left and right (later on, W S to ""invert"" the world at specific points). Again, it's very slow. If you don't enjoy studying the puzzle and working out the correct path in your mind, there's not much else to keep you engaged. After a couple hours, I was really tired of feeling like I was walking through mud as I stared at more black and grey. It's kind of cool, but I certainly wouldn't buy it at full price. I think I just prefer puzzle games with a bit more pace and gameplay. If you enjoy the challenge of trying to envision something more than the act of doing it, this might be the type of puzzler you'll like. It's just not for me.			"

												Play time ~ 10 hours.This is a decent game. I would have preferred to have color, but it is I guess part of the stylistic approach taken by the creator. The puzzles are mostly physics based so bare that in mind - many related to intertwined paths, grabbing keys, dealing with a cloned partner, and rolling balls. I prefer more mechanical rather than physical puzzles but I would guess many would still enjoy this game. I think I needed a walkthrough one time, so with patience most are solvable (just keep in mind some may require dexterity - since they are physics based so ""brute force"" sometimes does work). I do appreciate that the game is family friend and non-violent.			"

												Fanstastic Puzzle game for any fans of Braid, Limbo, Fez etc. Nice atmospheric feel from the music and art syle, which is based around drawings and perspective. Each level has you in a different drawing and scenario, requiring you to rotate the level in order to progress to the door and advance. Took me around 25 minutes on one level at the end, it got annoying but was extremely satisfying once i'd finished. The ending is pretty rad too. Took me under 3 hours to beat the main story but it has decent replay value with all 4 chapters mirrored once you're finished for a real challenge.			"

												So you get to twist and spin things around, which is a cool mechanic, and can turn the platformer idea on its head (ha!).But it was also a cool mechanic when  And Yet It Moves did it. Throw in some nice puzzle-solving that builds up on these base mechanics, and then the cute visuals that feels like a living sketchpad and you've got a solid game, with typical minimalist story-telling endemic of the indie puzzler scene.Fun to play.

												The game uses a mechanic similar to And Yet It Moves, you twist the world around you to complete puzzles. Difficulty increases steadily, sometimes a little sharper than expected. The world gives you small environmental clues to help foster a solution.The only thing I will say is that the mirrored worlds are horse♥♥♥♥♥♥ They aren't mirrored, they are just more difficult versions of previous puzzles, often times needing a ridiculous amount of patience or finesse to pull off. Using physics that were never necessary before. It is no longer about solving the puzzle, all about abusing the game mechanic to get to your goal. It's the terrible half of the game.			"

												If you're looking for a game to engross you for hours on end, let me start by saying this is not for you. With 8.5 hours into the game, I have all but completed the whole thing. The whole story was completed within probably 6 hours, if you would consider it a story. It's more of just multiple puzzles put together to really twist your brain. With each puzzle being completed, the story get just a little bit more ""interesting"".The game does make you think; afterall it is a puzzler. You simply have to walk left and right or rotate the world left or right. With just those four directional queues, you have to maneuver your way through around 50 puzzles. If you make a mistake, you can rewind time as far back as you want or need to. It feel like an indepth platformer / puzzler. The visual appeal is there in a sense. The game doesn't project visually stunning graphics. It's meant to have a simple, trippy, and hand drawn / rustic feeling. It gits the mysterious category it is portraying. The layout of the puzzles is what causes the trippy atmosphere. All of the puzzles encompass physically impossible maps and puzzle boards. Sometimes while rotating the world and walking, my eyes would flutter and become dizzy just from trying to comprehend how what I am doing is working. I don't play many games. I tend to look at them, think I'd enjoy them and add them to my library. This one actually caught my attention in my library and ended up binge playing it thoroughly. Is it worth the $9.99? I don't think so. If you can get it for a dollar or two, maybe. There was also a flaw in the game where, if you free fall for a long period of time, the framerate drops immensly to 1 or 2 fps. Very unhappy about that. This is the exact reason I did not get 100% of the achievements. The game also supports full controller support. I opted to use the keyboard only as 1) I didn't even realize that it supported the controller until I was 3/4 done this review and 2) I wanted to try just keyboard control. I use a controller 9/10 when playing a game through Steam or on my PC and wanted to really get a feel for the KB/M controls of games.Overall, I'm happy I played the game. It was interesting and something a little off the beaten path, per se. Would I ever play it again? I don't think so. Maybe once or twice to show people or try to get 100% one last time, but that's about it. I definitely won't be back anytime soon as I doubt the framerate issue will be fixed anytime soon.			"

If you're really good at problem solving this game can last you probably a good 8 hours I'm assuming as I got through what I believe is the first half in about 3.5 hours.

												90% of the so-called ""puzzles"" can be solved by anybody, some of the levels are so easy it hurts, very often it all comes down to the same thing. Luckily I bought it on sale at 0,99$. Just a bad wanna-be Braid. Pretty much everything except the puzzles are good: graphic style, music, artworks... Sadly I didn't like the only thing that really matters: the game			"

												The game seems easy o.o I finished The Bridge in just one sitting xD Though it was very short (and still have to do Mirrored) I say this game is pretty good and I enjoyed it very much. 10/10 very interesting! I needed a game like this for a while now. Such addictive game and yet makes you think so much to be able to solve it ... Very good game... it contains 4 chapter each and 6 parts for each chapter I cannot complain... Loved it! It was really worth the money!			"

												Nice puzzle game with a great M.C. Escher design. Super challenging and many interesting puzzle mechanics.Very simple controls: all you can do is walk left/right and rotate the screen, but this allows for a number of interesting physic-based puzzles, with a variety of surreal levels.It's not as good as Braid, but then, what is? It's certainly good enough with quite fresh mind-bending levels.			"

												The Bridge is nothing short of a work of art. An outstanding mix of physics puzzles and surreal illustration with a sublime soundtrack to boot.The puzzles start off simple enough but the difficulty gradually increases with some levels being genuinely challenging and outright brilliant - if not frustating at times. Never have I played a game that required so much abstract thought.The visual style is similar to the work of Dutch artist M. C. Escher and fits the games persona perfectly. I played with both a keyboard and controller and I definitely found the controller a more natural and enjoyable experience.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend The Bridge to anyone with a hankering for a mental challenge and an appreciation for physics, art and magnificent level design.

												Started quite nice with good looking visuals and appropriate soundtrack, but it just became too hardcore for me by level IV-III. Before that you could complete the levels by thinking and trying around a bit, but after the second level on chapter four the fun stopped. The solutions became too far-fetched for my taste. I hoped it would be a more relaxing game which you could just enjoy playing through, but as I said it became too difficult. So I can’t recommend it, since it was nothing for me.			"

The turn-back-time mechanic allows you to experiment a lot without the fear of level restart and doing it all over again. Even the background music fits the setting perfectly and contributes to the dark and mysterious atmosphere of the game.Took me 6.5h to complete and I had a lot of fun.

												The Good: The bridge is a short and sweet puzzle game that takes advantage of gravity and perspective. After strolling through a bunch of levels, each getting inceasingly more difficult or adding a new element to the gameplay, you get used to its mechanics and patterns. It's a creative way to learn to think outside the box while enjoying a unique and bizzare noire art style. The soundtrack is also splendid. The Bad: The Bridge is short if you only want to breeze through the main levels and leave it at that. A few hours of gameplay, maybe more if you get really stuck, even more if the bonus mode you unlock intrigues you. The TL,DR: Get it if you like puzzles and noire art, and want to kill a few hours. Recommended.			"

												The Bridge will bend your brain. Not as much as say Antichamber, but it will force you to think ahead with how your manipulations affect the world around you.You play as an unnamed intellectual (who bears a striking resemblance to surrealist M. C. Escher) who starts out napping under an apple tree. After discovering your ability to rotate the world, you get him awake and discover a number of puzzle doors have appeared in his house; why and how they are here is hinted at in text descriptions given by the protagonist but nothing is really explained. A sense of dread accompanies the game's progress. The first time you meet 'the menace' (balls with huge grinning faces that kill you with one touch), there is an uneasy feeling that something is wrong with these places beyond their defiance of reality. The art is pretty in black and white; the story that is there serves as a vehicle to put you through the puzzles. There is a sense of achievement to be had with the later ones when momentum and quick thinking rotations come into play. One mechanic that could have been explained better is ""the Veil"", which is a curtain that lets you manipulate the gravitational pull on certain objects. At first I thought it let me rotate objects independent of myself, but eventually deciphered its effects. I blundered through the veil puzzles a good bit before its potential hit me.I got this for a dollar and found it easily worth that amount. Depending on your love of puzzle games, it is a good game to lose yourself in while trying to manipulate how to get the protagonist to his exit door. The downside is there is little to no replay. Some achievements help pad out the length as well as hidden collectibles, but basically the 48 puzzles behind the doors are it. The first half of the game is easy as it introduces concepts for you to play with, but then in the second half things get pretty tricky. The Bridge would make Escher proud. Not a game you buy for the story but for the experience of solving its strange puzzles and experiencing its strange, ruined landscapes.			"

												The game uses a mechanic similar to And Yet It Moves, you twist the world around you to complete puzzles. Difficulty increases steadily, sometimes a little sharper than expected. The world gives you small environmental clues to help foster a solution.The only thing I will say is that the mirrored worlds are horse♥♥♥♥♥♥ They aren't mirrored, they are just more difficult versions of previous puzzles, often times needing a ridiculous amount of patience or finesse to pull off. Using physics that were never necessary before. It is no longer about solving the puzzle, all about abusing the game mechanic to get to your goal. It's the terrible half of the game.			"

												If you have ever looked at one of M.C. Escher's drawings of impossible buildings (with people walking on what should be a floor but you can't tell if it's actually the wall or the ceiling) and wondered what it would be like to wander around on that fantastical mind-bending playground, you need to play this game.Imagine FEZ, but with a hand-sketched style and set inside an M.C. Escher drawing.  The mental challenge reminds me of trying to solve one of those puzzles where you have to remove the metal ring from a rope threaded through a couple blocks of wood, or try to separate different-shaped metal rings from each other.  This game provides the same sort of spatial puzzle-solving challenge.The puzzles felt fair: nothing is hidden from you.  They do a great job with the difficulty curve: every level felt like it was just a little bit harder than the last one, and I didn't experience any big difficulty spikes.  That being said, once it gets going, this game does get quite difficult.  But if you stick with it and keep trying different things, you will keep making progress.  And every time you finish a tough level, the feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment is fantastic.If you are looking for a tough but fair puzzle game, I highly recommend that you check out The Bridge.

That says, if you don't enjoy going to museum or don't enjoy art pieces, then this game may not be for you. It's a also puzzle game... with surreal art... distorted perspective.... It won't drive up your andreline... but it may give you a peace of mind (or nightmares...)			"

												Interesting concept for a game based on an interesting artist. Being able to change the perspective takes the most out of Escher's drawings. Tough the game is relatively short, it is packed with several smart puzzles. I still haven't finished the game (but I'm close), but I couldn't find any of the most known Escher drawings, which in my opinion is the only great flaw in this otherwise excellent game			"

												An Escher experience with some tough puzzles. I didn't bother doing the mirrored levels, which is much more than just a flipped levels, but really tough experiences. And it does give a little reward hinted by beating the original levels. Great game. Doing the original levels takes about 1.5 hours. I am not sure how long it takes to do the mirrored versions.			"

												Gravity switching, mind bending, perspective breaking. The bridge is a perfect of example of how to confuse the heck out of me, while also keep me intrigued enough to keep pushing through. The puzzles are pretty hard at times, and I'll admit it, I was going cross eyed at a few specific moments. There were a few times I gave in and looked up the answer... only to find out that I was on the right track anyway.  This is a game where you want to take your time, and go slow, trying to figure each piece out.As for the story, it's another puzzle in itself. Pretty much everyone, including myself, has their own interpretation of who you are, and the story surrounding all the characters. And it manages to do so without coming off as pretentious, or having a ""you're not playing it right"" vibe that some open-ended games have.Full recommendation!			"

												The Bridge is a great little Indie Platformer where you take the roll of the Scientist, Isaac Newton to solve puzzles by messing around with gravity. The artwork is beautifully made and the controls are simple and easy to use. By using A/D to move and Left /Right Arrow Keys to tilt the world. With loads of other platformers competing on the market this one is my personal favourite. If you're going to get the game I would pick it up when it's on sale because it isn't really worth the price with about 5 hours gameplay.Price: £7/$12Gameplay: 8/10Story: N/AGraphics/art: 8/10===================================Overall game: 8/10Do I recommend this game?: Yes			"

												If you're looking for a game to engross you for hours on end, let me start by saying this is not for you. With 8.5 hours into the game, I have all but completed the whole thing. The whole story was completed within probably 6 hours, if you would consider it a story. It's more of just multiple puzzles put together to really twist your brain. With each puzzle being completed, the story get just a little bit more ""interesting"".The game does make you think; afterall it is a puzzler. You simply have to walk left and right or rotate the world left or right. With just those four directional queues, you have to maneuver your way through around 50 puzzles. If you make a mistake, you can rewind time as far back as you want or need to. It feel like an indepth platformer / puzzler. The visual appeal is there in a sense. The game doesn't project visually stunning graphics. It's meant to have a simple, trippy, and hand drawn / rustic feeling. It gits the mysterious category it is portraying. The layout of the puzzles is what causes the trippy atmosphere. All of the puzzles encompass physically impossible maps and puzzle boards. Sometimes while rotating the world and walking, my eyes would flutter and become dizzy just from trying to comprehend how what I am doing is working. I don't play many games. I tend to look at them, think I'd enjoy them and add them to my library. This one actually caught my attention in my library and ended up binge playing it thoroughly. Is it worth the $9.99? I don't think so. If you can get it for a dollar or two, maybe. There was also a flaw in the game where, if you free fall for a long period of time, the framerate drops immensly to 1 or 2 fps. Very unhappy about that. This is the exact reason I did not get 100% of the achievements. The game also supports full controller support. I opted to use the keyboard only as 1) I didn't even realize that it supported the controller until I was 3/4 done this review and 2) I wanted to try just keyboard control. I use a controller 9/10 when playing a game through Steam or on my PC and wanted to really get a feel for the KB/M controls of games.Overall, I'm happy I played the game. It was interesting and something a little off the beaten path, per se. Would I ever play it again? I don't think so. Maybe once or twice to show people or try to get 100% one last time, but that's about it. I definitely won't be back anytime soon as I doubt the framerate issue will be fixed anytime soon.			"

												I was a bit skeptical about this game.. I was wrong. This game is really amazing. It makes you think through puzzles within THREE different dimensions! I know that sounds difficult to do but each level does a really awesome job at teaching you each function every level as to not overwelm you. If you're really good at problem solving this game can last you probably a good 8 hours I'm assuming as I got through what I believe is the first half in about 3.5 hours. The art style is very similar to a combination of Braid and Limbo which are also both really awesome game. I highly recommend checking this game out!			"

												I do believe the praise is justified.  I consider myself an aesthete and I've played a lot of games but this is the first one I've felt compelled to qualify as a work of art.  The only thing that detracted from the experience was a completely avoidable lack of non-repetitive music.  For such a refined taste in puzzles and art I don't understand how more attention wasn't given to the soundtrack.  Regardless, this one lives up to the hype for a change.			"

												Score: 7/10If you want a long, fullfilling challenge I'll warn you: The Bridge is a relatively short puzzle game, unless you get stuck in a single place for long you should really be able to finish EVERYTHING in about five hours (Though you should find yourself a guide if you want the collector achievement, some are impossible to get without hints that, no, you won't find in game).About the game in itself: the graphics are quite nice and lovely, if you love Escher you'll LOVE the game just by staring at its impossible graphics which, at the same time, make for mind-boggling puzzles.Sadly, the mechanics of the game are NOT as complex as the graphics suggests...As most puzzles games, expecially those where you control the world as well as your character, your abilities are limited (This time more by speed than actual limiting, but if a death-ball is between you and where you want to go forget about changing the world fast enough that you ""skip"" the ball: it'll follow you to your death)This however makes the solution maybe too linear, sometimes making the user start to meta-think the solution (going left not because it'll lead me to the solution but because going right will kill me so it's obviously not the answer).Adding more mechanics doesn't fix it, as essentially starts becoming ""Okay, can't go left, nor right, I'll use that switcher there then.""The hardest levels try to fix this by relying more on momentum and timed movements, while they succeed I personally dislike those due to feeling ""un-puzzle-like"" to me.The puzzles tend to be still challenging if you try to ""understand"" the solution, expecially due to the peculiar graphics making it hard to get a clear idea of what's going on the screen, so I suggest everyone playing this game to do this, but it lost some points due to being too weak to the ""trial-and-error"" solution.

												I played more of The Bridge today (I'd started it the other day, but playing it was making me sleepy). It's a puzzle platformer with simple controls: you can move your avatar left and right, and rotate the entire level clockwise and counterclockwise—and that's it, but it gets a lot of milage out of those simple controls, with increasingly difficult puzzles that require you to understand the game's mechanics to make it to the end of each level.After 24 levels, I thought I'd reached the end, but it turns out that this was just the halfway point, after which you're required to return to a harder version of each of the previous levels. Maybe I would have kept playing if the controls didn't feel so sluggish, or if the music hadn't become so very tedious, but at this point I've had my fill. Still, it's a decent game and I'd reccomend it, but it wasn't a revelatory experience on the level of Braid or FEZ.			"

												The Bridge is a physics-based puzzle game featuring some of the most charming visuals and level design on the market. Generally I'm a fan of first-person shooters or RPGs, but the bridge is one of the most intellectually stimulating games I've ever played. The replayability is decent, as it includes mirrored versions of the original levels; this provides new challenge to old levels. The soundtrack is excellent and suits the game's unique style to a tee. Overall a very enjoyable game that's easily recommendable. "

												The Bridge is an abstract puzzle game, in both design and art style. The game itself has you controlling perspective and gravity to solve puzzles that play out in 360 degrees on the 2D plane, and the landscapes are modeled from the mathematical artworks of M.C. Escher. Given that the landscapes are made using real works of art, and his thick hand drawn style is applied to the game, it should come as no surprise that The Bridge is as good looking as it is. Aside from the puzzles and the style though, this game doesn't have much going for it. There seems to be something of a narrative trying to come out, but it is unintelligible and barely fleshed out enough to be too important. The game is interesting enough to warrant a look, but if you want a beautiful hand drawn 2D puzzler, buy Braid instead.			"

												TL;DR - A beautiful puzzle game revolving around a simple mechanic, with lots of content. A must-have for puzzle game connoisseurs.A great puzzle game with a simple but interesting mechanic. The art style looks absolutely amazing, and the puzzles themselves are well-designed. The impossible architectures that are in the levels are intriguing. It reminded me a bit of Braid, mostly because of the art style, but The Bridge's main mechanic, the rotation is original, as far as I know. There is also a time-rewinding mechanic in the game, so you can undo your mistakes if yu happen to mess up, which is a nice addition, since you don't have to restart the entire level in case you fail. There are many levels to play and collectibles to find, and after your first playthrough an alternative world is unlocked, in which you can play through more difficult versions of the original levels. I only had problems with 1-2 levels, the others can be figured out easily, or with a bit of thinking and planning.To sum this review up, The Bridge is a very ambitious puzzle game with puzzles revolving around a simple mechanic, and with an amazing art style. I'd highly recommend it.Edit: paraghraps			"

												A very nice game for puzzle-enthousiasts out there. It certainly thrives in originality with it's escheresque rules of geometry. Gameplay-mechanics are limited to a few dynamics that all revolve around the change or mere direction of gravitational forces. If i were to name a con, it would be that a lot of levels are solvable without really understanding the problem it sets out for the player. You basically just fumble your way to its solution. It wasn't untill the later levels, that the factor luck is minimised and you really have to wrap your head around the screwed up little universe that is the The Bridge. The game is at its best during those stages. When i finished the game in its entirety without resorting to any kind of walkthroughs i couldn't help but cheer for besting it. Yet i felt a kind of regret that as a result i am forced to leave its universe. You know you're playing a great game when you end up feeling like that.8/10 "

												Surprisingly dark puzzler.The levels in the game are split into 2 sets. First, you play through all the levels, then you play the ""mirrored"" levels which have extra things added to them which makes the puzzles much harder. It's a cool concept and gives the game some length by bringing the total number of levels ~40-50. In the puzzles, you can control which way the world is tilting and which direction your character walks in. By doing this, you have to get your character through a door which is the exit. All the levels follow an MC Escher type theme with impossible structures everywhere. Trying to wrap your head around the fact that the levels arent flat is one of the hardest things in the entire game. The levels starts out simple enough but then you move on to adding death balls, inversions to different colors, and veils which allow you to control the balls. The additional feature is the space bar which reverses time (Braid style) so you can fine tune your movements.The levels have a natural challenge to them as more levels get introduced. However, the last level in the main campaign has a ridiculous difficulty spike and the last two levels of the mirrored levels are insanely complex. The difficulty jumps but for someone who is really into puzzlers, you will love it. It's only 2-3 hours with me being terrible but it’s a good length for a puzzlerThere isn’t much of a story. You meet a dude and he goes through the doors. But if you read the plaques at the end of each set of rooms, you will get a sense of a scientist exploring a hypercube sort of deal (which is the mirrored). It's quite dark as each time you die, you get a message which depresses you. The music is creepy and adds to the atmosphere quite well. At the end of both the normal and mirrored edge, you try and cross a bridge... and stuff happens. I'm not sure what. But something happens. Overall, there is a story but I can’t make sense of it. However, it creates a wonderfully creepy atmosphereOverall, if you like difficult puzzlers, have fun. Otherwise, it’s not really worth your time for 10 dollars.			"

												Originality: 10/10 - Brilliant puzzle game that plays with surfaces, gravity, and mathematics in a way that I have never seen before. Not comparable to Antichamber.Gameplay: 9/10 - Clever use of grinning balls of doom, spaghettifying not-black holes, keys, sliding doors, and plain old gravity make this puzzle-by-puzzle game appealing. It could do with a little more explanation, though. The puzzles are deceptively simple in most cases, but nonetheless require a significant amount of brainpower. Don't expect to simply sit down and beat the game; breaks are mandatory.Story: 7/10 - You get doses of story at the end of each chapter, but there seems to be no way to go back and view them again, making it very difficult to piece the whole shebang together into some notion of what is going on.Interface and Graphics: 9/10 - The Bridge utilizes its own unique style of graphics, where black-and-white figures are drawn before you at the start of each level. The animations show stray pencil marks flashing in and out of existence around the characters, as if they are constantly being redrawn at 60 DPS (draws per second). The interface, and all text, all appears charmingly hand-drawn.Overall: 8.75/10 - Worth a buy, especially if you get it on sale. Not for the faint of mind. Breaks are highly recommended.			"

												Something all indie games should be. So I was browsing a back catalogue of bundle games, (and trust me, if you got a back catalogue, you are missing nothing -- a lot of these indie games are just bad) and found this game intriguing. So I tried it out. What an amazing game. A physics puzzle game is the best I can describe it. However, since I've enjoyed Portal 2 a lot, I've played about six levels in this game and then decided to write this review. I will praise its art style, mechanics, and very polished interface and mechanics, but if you own other physic/puzzle games like Portal then you're not missing anything extraordinary unless you are a fan of such games.

												The game is actually alright but somewhere near the end my progress was stopped due to a puzzle that was hard for the wrong reasons. Added with the fact that the gameplay eventually became trial and error, I just can't give it a good recommendation.The game became un-fun and I refuse to use a walkthrough to remedy my situation. Each level became a chore where turning the entire stage was mandatory. It also reminded me of the unforgiving last section run in Ducktales Remastered; it was near impossible to beat and if you had failed a few times you would have to run through a 5 to 8 minute stage with boss battles again. it ruined everything.At the end of the day, a game should be fun through and through. Of course it can get hard, that is fine, but it should be the kind of difficulty that shouldn't warrant a peek in walkthroughs. "

												Superb game.Surreal-logic puzzles, the result of mixing geometry and graphical perspectives and physics, makes this game a very rare and unique gameplay experience that you can find around there.*Interesting story; strange, ''esoteric sensation'', that unfold its way on metaphysical abstract concepts, on the least. *Good 2D graphics; very detailed art with nice black & white aesthetics. *The sound denotes decent quality as well; the background's music choice fits perfectly, creating an ideal atmosphere.*The puzzles are challenging enough, some more than others, that would make any puzzle solver reach it's conclusion; whom the total duration satisface its price.

												GNU/Linux compatibility: Very good. Only issue I had was with steam notifications about new items hanging the game. The same happened when trying to change the volume on Kubuntu (luckily you can change the volume in-game, which helps). It looks like some overlay issue. Achievement notifications did not cause the game to hang, so once I stopped receiving new random items, everything was fine.About the game itself:Good puzzles, but movement is slow, which is especially frustrating when you want to get all achievements and need to switch between levels (which requires moving the character around the main world).Level loading is also quite slow (~5 seconds).

												In the best way to put it, The Bridge is good. It's not a legendary puzzler, nor is it anything to brush aside. The Bridge has wonderful artwork, charming music, and a interesting story. But the level designs fall through after time. They become less of a challenge to solve and more of an art piece to admire and turn. Gameplay is also rather short. It might take you maybe one to two hours to complete the first world before unlocking the dark version of the game, which is about the same length. It's a very short game with not much to enjoy after. But once you start playing it, it's a delight. I do recommend this. Price is very fair, and when it's on sale it's a steal.			"

												The Bridge is a puzzle platformer heavily inspired by M.C. Escher's works. It's main feature is its crazy impossible space and really cool space manipulation mechanics. It also features some time-manipulation mechanic that reminds me of Braid - You can rewind time if you make mistakes, so there isn't really a ""game-over"" state.For the most part, solving a level is just a matter of figuring out how to navigate the weird space you find yourself in. That is not an easy feat since you can easily get disoriented by the impossible geometry. In a few levels timing your moves plays significant role too.There are 4 worlds with about 6 levels each. In each world a new gameplay mechanic is added making the game more complex the further you progress. After you complete the game, you can revisit each level in a 'mirrored' mode which features new and more difficult puzzles.Depending on your ability and on how much time you spend looking for hidden items and completing achievements, the game can probably take anywhere between 4 to 10 hours. It took me about 7; although I did use a guide to find in what levels each of the hidden items are located, I did take me a while to finish some of the harder levels.So, if you like puzzle platformers and enjoy M.C. Escher's works, you'll definitely like this game! "

There you’ll encounter various fascinating puzzles in tricky labyrinths.  Some of them will be quite easy, others might test your patience and even drive you crazy with perplexity, so the game definitely provides you with a decent thought-provoking time.However, it is also relatively short and you can get a slight feeling of vapidity due to the lack of story. Yet its gloomy atmosphere and unique art style absolutely make up for it.All in all, it’s an enjoyable experience that encourages you to think differently and a great treat for puzzle game fans.9/10.

												Better than Braid. It follows all of the same extremely niche genre tropes: indie puzzler with vague references to science and obscure written reward notes at the end of a series of puzzles that are much weaker prose than the author likely thinks. That all makes the ""plot"" less effective than it could be. It doesn't matter. What does is that this is a top notch brain tesseracht with limited time investment, simple mechanics, tough puzzles, and a lovely artistic vision.			"

												If you like the Penrose stairs illusion in the lithograph print Relativity of M.C. Escher you will love this game. It is simple to understand how the mechanic of the game work and the chapter progression always add something new as you progress. The music is very soothing and add to the whole enigma feeling of the game.  The sound effects adds tension and a sense of urgency... especially when you hear the sound of those rolling troll heads. The game mechanic allow you to rewind your actions pretty much like in Braid so mistakes are easily fixed unlike the puzzles themselves which add a lot of reward and felicity when you actually succeed.Of course you will get stuck more than once and you will have to figure out how this virtual rubix cube works to make it to the end.8/10			"

												I will review all my humble bundle games and see which is worth playing and which is not! Like a lot of people i buy H.B. games as a pack because i want some of the games, but not all. I will play for 5 minutes (or a litlle bit more) and give you my opinion on it. Sometimes the game will surprise me, sometimes it will be a total dissapointment. Just keep in mind this is my opinion only and is not an objective view of the game. You might actually like it!The review will be constructed into 5 parts:1. Game description (from what i've seen in the time i've played).2. Did i finish the game (YES/NO/Maybe in the future) and why.3. Pros/Cons.4. Final thoughts.5. RatingSo let's beggin...1. Game description:Puzzle game with an interesting twist. You control the world around you and the character. Your goal is to enter a door. Sounds like the most simple thing ever right? You are wrong. So wrong. The game ramps up the difficulty quite fast and it varies so much from level to level. I find that some puzzles take 1-2 minutes while on others I spent 10 times as much. The only problem is the difficulty in some levels  is not from the puzzle part of the level but from the hazards that kill you. You have to act fast to avoid them. Visually it’s nothing much. I would have liked a few more colors but I guess that was the idea, to look like a sketch. There is a small story and it is a little philosophical. I kinda enjoyed it.2. Did i finish the game? In the processI still have the game installed and I will finish it one day. The fact that sometimes I have to replay the level several times due to me being killed by the hazards is annoying. However I never felt like I was cheated by the game. I actually deserved that death because I didn’t  go the way the puzzle wanted me to3. Pros/Cons.PROS:- Interesting mechanic- Nicely designed levels- Interesting storyCONS:- Bland visuals- Annoying traps4. Final thoughts:I like this game despite the downsides mentioned earlier. If you like puzzle games get it. It’s nothing that will blow you away but it’s a nice game to sit back and relax playing a few levels between bigger games. 5. Rating7/10			"

												For me it's always nice to find a game that I at least would call a piece of art and in short this game succeeds in what is necessary imo: Adding interaction to the sum of all parts and after all being more than the sum of all parts. I say that as someone that is not particularly fond of puzzle games.Note that I have not played through the mirrored chapters yet, I guess there are no new pictures in the mirrored chapters but the puzzles will be more difficult, that's ok but I will take my time for this. Even without the mirrored chapters the game definitly is worth much more than the 2,- € I paid for it imo. Well, if you primarly are after solving as many puzzles per time unit as possible than this may not be for you, the game is not too short in my eyes though.The puzzles in the beginning are easy, additional puzzle elements are added on the way but the game does not get too difficult. Well, there was one puzzle that I solved without knowing why it did not work in the previous attempt and I got stuck a few times, especially in the last level of chapter IV, however this could also be related to an illness that makes concentrating harder for me, I also got stuck once in a level that I regard as easy after seeing the solution.The interaction is simple, you can walk around and also turn the picture which effectivly means you change the direction of gravity, you can also use an inverter if present in the picture but I leave it to you to find out what that means exactly. Together with all the other puzzle elements the resulting complexity of the whole game is fine imo.The music and sound effects are good too, at some point the music changed to be rather threatening which was a small irritation for me but overall it's not distracting.The puzzles get a 9/10 from me but I will not disregard the whole experience with a number, well, maybe the number pi if I had to choose.

												A fantastic MC Escher-esque rotational, physics-based puzzle game (with a sketchpad aesthetic)!			"

												The game have nice look to it. I can’t say much about the sound since I mostly played it muted. The story is a very small portion of the game and was for me uninteresting, even though I liked how they moved it forward through small portions of a journal. For more important things like the gameplay and puzzles I have more to say. The puzzles are good and the level of challenge increase mostly in a constant direction upwards. You spin the level (change the direction of the gravitational pull) to move you or obstacles. At some levels you can even change how the pull is for individual objects. This is cool and different. You can also change your character to a inverted version which has the opposite gravity pull the the normal. I do have some bones to pick with this game however. - A lot of the puzzles are more about timing rather than figure the puzzle out. - The do not use the visual illusions of the artworks close to enough. Mostly it’s just in the back/foreground rather than a part of the gameplay.- Half of the game is the same levels repeated but in a “hard-mode” called “mirrored world”. The levels here are harder and plays slightly different, but why not different level design with new artwork? They also tease you twice with having colour to the game. This should definitely be done for the whole mirrored world if you ask me.- The simplicity of the game makes most levels beatable just by spinning back and forth a bit to see what happens. This is not a big downside at all but it did take away some brainwork.- Even though I did get stuck sometimes (but only when I played it late at night balls deep in wishes for sleep) the game never made me feel smart for beating it. I do believe that if they gave you more freedom like letting you change to your inverted self whenever wherever, instead at specific spots on specific levels, it would be harder to know when and where to use it. However, a lot of levels wouldn’t work if that was the case. For words to end this miserable excuse of a review I would like to recommend it to puzzle fans. This is a different puzzler than most and worth the playthrough for the genres fans. If you’re not that kind of fan I would direct you to start with a more humorous puzzler like “day of the tentacle”.			"

												Piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game. Full of bugs and way too undeveloped. I'd rather use the money that I gave to buy this game while it was 90% off to buy cow turds and imagine that I'm a ♥♥♥♥ing farm. I♥♥♥♥♥♥on this game.			"

												A fun, but very difficult puzzle game. It requires brains, but also timing. I love the art style and I love the Escher-like painting structures. it's a game that requires you to think outside the box. I still haven't finished the game yet (I'm at Mirrored chapter 1).			"

												A nice callback to the early aughts, when everyone and their dog was putting out puzzle platformers made in flash, but with some new polish. The control scheme gives it a uniqueness that is so very, very rare in platformers, and while it does make the perennial pecadillo of a 'shadow dimension' mechanic -- the plain oatmeal of puzzle platformers that everyone recognizes and was played out back in the early aughts -- but combined with the gravity mechanics, it actually becomes interesting. The game even introduced a mechanic that I literally had not seen before in this sort of game.So yeah. It takes a while to get interesting, and 24 levels is pretty damn short, but it's definitely worth checking out.			"

												Play if you want to loose your mind. Nothing for people with light nerves. I personally reached chapter 4, after that, game gets difficult fast. Artwork and music are well done. A game not for me to complete, but maybe some one out there can take the challenge.			"
