												Pro - Its Dungeon Keeper all over again!Con - Its Dungeon Keeper all over again...Now, don't get me wrong, I love the original Dungeon Keepers. Love the humour, the creatures and minions. And when I learned about this game, I was thrilled! A new dungeon keeper?! Awesome! And when I first started playing, I was happy as the nostalgia washed over me...The thing is, this isn't 'Dungeon Keeper 3.0'. Its not even 'Dungeon Keeper 2.5'. Its 'What if we remade Dungeon Keeper 2 with new graphics and new names/creatures so we don't get sued'.  This, in itself, IS NOT A BAD THING. But if you played DK2 to death, as i did, then you will notice that it tries to be more of the same, and it doesn't always succeed. I do heartily recommend this game, as it was fun whilst it kept my attention (almost 9 hours). But it did only feel like I was only adding to the hundreds of hours I'd already put into DK1 + 2 - and as such, It was just more of the same for me. At the end of the day, it replicates the originals so well/much, that I may as well be playing the originals - something I haven't had the urge to do in 15 years. Yes, there are new mechanics added, but its like saying that adding a 'go faster stripe' to a car changes the car; It doesn't.Conclusion - If you've never played the originals, and think you might enjoy this, give it a go.- If you tried playing the originals, enjoyed it but the outdated graphics ruined it for ya, give this a go.- If you played the originals when they came out, loved them, and want more, give this a go.- If, however, you played the originals and want something MORE than an almost 20 year old game with a fresh lick of paint (however awesome it was) - might wanna give this a miss.

												TL;DR - One of your minions wants to get off Mr. Bones Wild Ride.10/10 would not get on.I could not recommend this game in its' previous release state. However, now I actually can. After its' 1.1 patch, the majority of what this game was missing in its release verison has finally been added.War for the Overworld, as a game, is...dungeon keeper 3. There really isn't another way to describe it. If Peter Molyneaux and the Bullfrog team were still around today, I feel the game we would have gotten would not be too far off from this. Are there flaws in this game? Obviously. Every game has flaws. But as far as managing to capture the feel of dungeon keeper and make an all-round fun game, this kickstarter title succeeds where higher-budget games such as the Dungeons series failed. With EA making no attempt to actually capitalize on a once great series, and in fact ruining it for a new generation by slamming a free to play business model that shames the series GREATLY (even paying off reviewers EA style couldn't keep dungeon keeper mobile's critic rating up high enough to appear worthwhile), it's nice to see we still have fans of the old game out there who want to see it made new.Am I rambling a lot on what Dungeon Keeper was? Yep. For those of you unfamiliar with what I'm talking about, this is a game where you manage a...well, dungeon, from the perspective of an evil overlord. Throughout the campaign, rather than being the hero who explores and brings death to dungeons, you build the dungeon and fight back against the good. You can accomplish this through the use of powerful minions as well as various traps and such that your enemy won't (hopefully) see coming, and of course a little bit of god power for good measure (*zap*). You have minimal control over your minions, so this isn't exactly an RTS and it sure as all hell is NOT an actions per minute game - in fact, trying to go all MLG clicky-clicky on this game would likely just hinder you more than anything else. Your control consists of picking minions or imps up and throwing them where you want them to be and...well, hoping they do what you want. You can lay down rally flags to get everyone's attention to a specific spot, but if you try to keep them out for too long you'll end up with a bunch of unhappy minions telling the flag to♥♥♥♥♥♥off and going to bed. You also have to keep them regularly paid with gold, which handily is also the resource you use for literally everything else. Fail in this aspect, and minions will just pack up shop and leave to go elsewhere.Map design is what made Dungeon Keeper and, as a result, War for the Overworld, extremely unique. There is not a lot of map when you actually get in - it's just a bunch of dirt, some impenetrable rocks, water, lava, maybe a chasm, and gold in the dirt. Oh, and your central dungeon core. Don't lose that...seriously. You have to dig out your own map, tile by tile, and lay down rooms in areas to correspond with what you want and your minions' needs - a lair to sleep, a slaughterpen to eat, a tavern to provide money for you and make people happy, a barracks to train, etc...and of course the arena where you can have minions fight to the death for no reason outside of entertainment. It appears to entertain the other minions to watch their brethren get slaughtered too...and of course, the other benefit to building your own map is deciding when and where to dig to place down traps and such, and if you happen to sight enemy traps...you can dig around them.By now you may think this is a twisted, evil game where everything is gruesome and terrible. And you'd be right and wrong. While you do play as evil, this is a very lighthearted game as the original dungeon keeper games were. Featuring awesome voice narration from the original DK's narrator, you'll find yourself often having a lot of fun just from hearing some of the things minions have to say, or the random (but amusing) pop culture references made by the narrator.And when you're done with the campaign, you'll find it is still very fun to play in skirmish or multiplayer modes. In these modes, you and up to 3 other AI or players will duke it out, each building their own dungeons and attacking one another for no reason other than ♥♥♥♥ you, my ground. Unlike the original dungeon keeper, War for the Overworld actually does a decent job of working properly in skirmish and multiplayer. While it was possible in Dungeon Keeper 2 to do the same, the game just didn't quite feel the same as it was very campaign-oriented. WFTO implements some new systems that help the game to work properly in either situation. There is also sandbox mode where you just build in a big, empty map free of gold or mana issues, and survival mode which is...honestly still being worked on and I have very little experience in it, but it's self explanatory.Overall, this game is easily worth your $30. Hell, go the extra $10 and get the $40 version just for the soundtrack if nothing else - the soundtrack is pure evil and outstanding and it fits PERFECTLY with a game of this theme. This kickstarted game more than deserves your money (after a rocky launch).GET DIS GAME			"

Early Access Review
								When the game first came to steam back in may 2013, there were only 3 different rooms to build, the ui buttons didn't work, mouse-wheel scrolling was broken, the ai was terrible, and there were no sound effects. As of early December, there are 8 rooms, the ui is fixed, scrolling feels normal, the ai is better, and the sound effects are great. -Not to mention they went back and remodeled a character because of negitive fan feedback. It's good to see this game taking shape. As for the gameplay? Well, Peter Molyneux declared it the spiritual successor to the Dungeon Keeper franchise, so there's that. It's a basic sandbox dungeon stratagy game that requires you to build an underground lair, collect resources, train minions, and defeat your enemy. Along the way you can build traps and defenses for your dungeon, cast various spells, and spend xp on 3 different skill trees. EA killed Bullfrog 12 years ago, so go spend $20 and pick up a copy you cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.			"

												-EDIT- This review was made when the game was freshly released, and from what I've gathered it seems that a lot of the issues I wrote about has been fixed. For now, just disregard this review, I will probably go back and try the game again in the near future when I find the time.Wait, for the love of god, wait with picking this game up.I have had my eyes on this game for a long time, since I loved the original DK games, and this one seems like it was going to stay true to the formula. I did, however, want to wait until it was finished, as to not get my view on it damaged by playing an unfinished product. I was glad when I saw it on the recently released list, because I had been waiting for it for a while.However, this game is very clearly not finished. There are placeholder texts everywhere, there's missing animations, and the UI feels clunky, sluggish, and at times unresponsive.The foundations for a good game are clearly here, but it should not have been pushed out of the door this early. It's very much still an Early Access game.So please, if you want to have a good experience with this game, wait until the game is actually, properly, finished. I cannot recommend it in its current state.			"

												Game itself is VERY fun.  Dungeon Keeper 2.0(less of a dark theme though, voice overs are good but a bit goofball humor)Initially there were alot of bugs/glitches but the developers have been releasing patches EVERY 2-3 hours, amazing, 7-8 patches so far+++++++++++++ support these guys, bug fixing at midnight on a saturday and releasing a patch.  This is how game companies should behave (SUPPORT YOUR PRODUCTS!!!!!)			"

												Let me say this game sort of defines why steam needs a neutral button and not just thumbs up/down.On the one hand I do love the game; but on the other I am massively aware that the bulk of my love comes from the nostalgia trip of how much I loved Dungeon Keeper (and DK2).If it were not for Dungeon Keeper I'm not sure I could like this game half as much as I do. I am keenly aware that this game was made by fans of Dungeon Keeper; and for what it is there is an amazing wealth of throwback to the game it is trying to emulate.Unfortunately it also suffers from everything you would expect from what is essentially a ""mod team"" that is trying to convert itself to an actual development studio. The amateur mistakes show through with poor game balance and narrow strategic layers that never reach the level of variety as the original DK's pulled off. The costs of spells, the speed of unit deployment, the limited number of strategies that the enemy AI is able to cope with; the list of cons is fairly long.Basically what the game ends up being is a very polished shell with Dungeon Keeper logos painted all over it but inside is just empty and hollow.To their credit this team also continues to expand on the game, and I'll admit there has been improvement over time. But the reality is that it's a very long time coming. For a released game we're still seeing things added that should have been in from day one (and that was years ago...).In summary this game is a labor of love from a devoted team trying to recreate Dungeon Keeper and if you are a fan of that old series and can afford to throw money in their direction. Do it. This may in the end be the only close successor the gaming world will see (at least in this decade). Just be aware that the game is heavily flawed and I'm not sure the dev team has the experience needed to ever make it as-good-as Dungeon Keeper really was, so we (as a community) must either foster them in the hopes they improve or just play it for what it is and cry over what's missing.On a side note if you have not played the originals; find them. Get Dungeon Keeper and Dungeon Keeper 2; they are available on GOG, and worth the effort. Despite the slightly aging graphics they are still fantastic games. Then come play War for the Overworld with us and pray it continues to reach for the glory of what Dungeon Keeper once was.As-is I'll continue to play War for the Overworld occasionally and hope the team behind it continues to learn and improve on it (which they have done for many years now, impressively for a team with no official training or past game development experience)			"

												This is the dungeon keeper clone that we've been waiting for! War for the Overworld is an attempt at creating a modern Dungeon Keeper. For those who are not familiar with Dungeon Keeper, it was a game released in 1997, where you played an evil dungeon overlord. You would build a dungeon with different  rooms that attracted different creature types, and you would use those to fight the heroes of the land and rival dungeons. Controls were indirect, you could not give orders to individual creatures, but you could pick them up and move them about, and you could use other means to make your creatures go where you wanted them to go, but unlike a regular RTS, you could not give direct orders. You could also not recruit specific creatures, but instead creatures would be drawn to your dungeon based on what was in it. War for the Overworld does not change any of this. At its core, it's basically Dungeon Keeper with a fresh coat of paint. Several attempts have been made in the past to make a ""modern Dungeon Keeper"", but most of them have, quite frankly, not been very good. As this game is so similar to Dungeon Keeper, there will be a lot of comparisons between the two.Graphics & SoundThe graphics in War for the Overworld is actually quite good for an indie game. The models are detailed enough, and the textures are also relatively detailed. It won't rival the latest AAA games, but as long as you don't expect that, it won't disappoint. The game also has a very cohesive art style, nothing looks out of place, despite the different creatures looking radically different from each other. One thing I would complain about is the game being a bit too dark. It's not a major issue, and a dungeon should be dark, but some more light would have made the game look more pleasing.The sound felt a bit weak. Nothing had much impact, and you don't get enough feedback from the sound to really feel like you're doing things. It's nothing game breaking, but it is one of the areas in which the game could stand to be improved.StoryThe story in this game is nothing to write home about. You're awoken and told about the emperor of the land, and that you should go and kill him. There's a bit more to it, but that's basically all you need to know. The story is basically just an excuse for ""go kill good guys"".Where Dungeon Keeper 1 played up the contrast between the good guys and the bad guys (that is, you and your creatures) for comedic effect, War for the Overworld plays it more straight, similar to how Dungeon Keeper 2 did it. Which one is better is a matter of taste, but I preferred Dungeon Keeper 1. The game is not devoid of humor, but it's not as much of it as in DK1.GameplayAs mentioned above, War for the Overworld plays very similar to Dungeon Keeper. Build your dungeon, attract the creatures you want, and then attack. Everything feels a bit faster in War for the Overworld than it did in Dungeon Keeper. Your creatures level up faster in the training room, claiming land feels faster and so on. I would say that this is an improvement. Unlike Dungeon Keeper, where you had to research the ""Call to Arms"" spell in order to attract your creatures to a certain point on the map, you have access to a similar thing right from the get-go in War for the Overworld.Going into enemy territory is a bit more dangerous than you might expect. You can't pick up creatures that are not on your territory, so if one is in danger, you'll have to use magic to save it, and hope that it is able to make it out of there on its own. And the game encourages you to use your magic liberally. You have a separate mana pool, and it is refilled quite fast, so using spells in combat is almost a must.Creatures are also handled differently than in Dungeon Keeper. Now you have two broad categories that can basically be seen as intelligent creatures and animals. Intelligent creatures will be this games counterparts to goblins, warlocks, trolls and so on, while animals will be things like giant spiders and other more animal-like beings. Intelligent creatures requires regular pay, can work in different rooms, and can use your training room. Animals will wander about, and the only rooms they can use is the portal that attracts them (you need to build this one, while the portal that attracts intelligent creatures is already on the map), an arena (this is how you level them up outside of combat, but they are damaged in the process) and the room they get their food from.If the game has one flaw, it is its difficulty, or lack thereof. While Dungeon Keeper was not a hard game, the only way you would realistically lose in that game was if you ran out of gold, War for the Overworld is even easier, giving you plenty of gold to spend, and far less to spend it on (training creatures, for an example, is free). Gold is used to build new rooms, and when it's payday (at which point all your intelligent creatures will go to the nearest treasury and take some money). Not once during the campaign did it feel like I was running short on cash.Final thoughtsWar for the Overworld is a really good game. It sticks really close to the Dungeon Keeper formula, but does a few things to speed up the gameplay. Is it better than Dungeon Keeper? Well, that's a matter of taste. I would have an easier time recommending this game, but due to nostalgia, I still think I like Dungeon Keeper a bit more. But anyone who wants to play a game like Dungeon Keeper, or who want an interesting take on the RTS genre should check it out. Just beware that the game still has some bugs (nothing game breaking, but they were common enough to be annoying). "

												I give this a solid 4/5 stars.I have played DK1/2 a LOT, including Deeper Dungeons.  All three have some things going for them, in DK1 I prefered that you could have monsters that didnt get along, hence the ""Your monsters are fighting amongst themselves"" whic also was a bit more strategic when i came to what ou turned in the torture chamber.2 made some nice improvements with traps, and not havign the game be quite so tempermental, excluding Bile Demons, overall a positive experience, with the exception of the broken cant bust traps when posessing anymore bug.This is basically DK3, negatives, ALL your monsters, or converted heros always get along, also there are a few creatures I really miss, but that happens in all strategy games that get a sequel.  Granted I will take the WftO Chunder over the DK1/2 Bile Demon anyday, on the other side of that coin, I will take my Dark Mistress over the Succubus. WftO did a bunch of small QOL changes that were nice but minor, I thought the strategy was overall pretty good, honestly the last mission where you go after Lucius was depressingly easy. All the talk about the game is too fast pased, I can only recall 1 mission where ti was a big deal, and it was pretty early on, where you get three waves of monsters who spawn and head to an exit smashing everything in their path, that took a few replays, before I learned, do it all with traps.  I think one of the reviews below talking about being surrounded by 3 was about the second to last imssion, it was rough at first but within about 20 minutes I figured out what I neded to do.  For DK fans who had problems with the speedier missions in WftO, I have to wonder how they beat DK2 Ambush (the sprint at 20 minutes by Lord Voss), or Smashing (Defeat Keeper Asodeus before you and he gets charged by the 2 elven groups mid field).  Ambush was blitz the map, and Smashing was a FPS posession charge.  Frankly the DK2 midgame mission ""Carnage"" or ""Interception"" was vastly harder than WtfO ""I'm surrounded"" mission.What I like:-Nostalgia-It is obviously DK3 with different names-HUMOR.... this game has the same humor as before.....infact on thelast mission I was pushing my guiys HARD through the end, and the assistant said ""UNDERLORD!  This is NOT a FAMINE simulator, feed your minions!"" I busted up.-Gameplay is good (has a couple bugs but nothing game breaking)-Story line was fun, and give a nice big middle finger to EA for cancelling DK3 when they bought Bullfrog in the very beginning.-Dev's are sticking with it and trying to keep new content coming.-Most missions let me build and have some fun, not just zerg stuff down and move to the next one.-Not saying it is the best straegy game ever, but it is just FUN!  Strategic enough, lets me build and be a schmuck like I like to in these games.-Enough differences to Rooms, traps, and monsters to allow some VERY different playstyles.What I didn't like:-Optomization waas not good, there are odd performance bugs everywhere that just shouldn't be.  Not game breaking, but not pleasant.-Interface could use some help, there are times you cannot click on a minion to save your life, you just end up instruction your workers to dig the area out around him, these problems are NOT shared with other RTS's I play.-Campaign was WAY too short.-On longer maps, it seems like minions forget how to take care of their basic needs, workers who went into the Foundry rage about hunger or sleep depravation but FINALLY leave and go to the Tavern or wander aimlessly in the dungeon not resolving what they were♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥about, at times it reminds me f strategy games in the 90s, when you had a not so reat system, you could see the AI get dumber as you went if your CPU load was maxed.  It kinda feels like that, which it should not here with a i7 Hex Core, and the game on an SSD.Other Thoughts:-This is **NOT** the traditional RTS, it just isn't, and that can be good or bad.  If you want something that has some RTS, some management, some god-sim in it, this is awesome.  If you are looking for your next CnC type game, or if you are a TS guy and you are looking for your next GalCiv or XCOM this is not the game for you.-WftO is a mush of a lot of strat and godsim games in one, with a solid dose of dark humor.-Overall happy with the purchase, beat main game, will play more, look forward to a MAJOR DLC, or WftO2.

												The short version is that War for the Overworld was a disappointment, sadly not quite worth the price. The longer version follows below.Now, at first glance, WftO seems like a pretty good successor to Dungeon Keeper. You've got basically the same control scheme, many of the same aesthetics(but not quite, that's actually one of the issues), even some creatures that are blatant expatriates from the former(in function and fluff, if not appearance), and after the first couple of tutorial levels, you feel pretty confident that THIS is finally it. Now you're finally getting a new Dungeon Keeper! The narrator even has some of the same cadence as the old one!Then you get to playing and... it just doesn't work, for multiple reasons.From a level design perspective. Does anyone remember those gem veins in the original DK games? They were a wonder on the rare occasions they showed up, because they meant you had the time and funds to build an ideal dungeon for once, set up all the traps and minions and rooms you wanted! Usually you were limited by time or space, sure, but it was a nice break from the norm. Contrasting with that, practically every level in WftO has a ""gold shrine""(essentially the same thing), meaning that economic woes are just... non-existent. Maybe for the first two minutes until you find the level's shrine(or several shrines), you have to juggle things a bit, or decide what to build first. But after that? Build away, the economy no longer matters. It's a shame.AI-wise, there are also issues. Minions are often too stupid to path to food, the treasury or even their own lairs. Put a rally flag on the far side of a door? Many of the minions will just walk into the door rather than attacking it to break through, requiring some annoying micromanagement.Performance? I don't understand how a game with graphics this relatively simple can start chugging because there are about fifty units on screen. Now, maybe the graphics are more advanced than I realize, but when 100+ unit battles are the norm for some of the later levels... why didn't they optimize it a bit better? I know it's not an issue of my PC being low-spec.Graphics... see, I don't mind any of the new designs. But they're more muted colours, generally smaller shapes, and harder to make out on the battlefield, meaning that if you want to target something specific in the huge scrums that result later in the game... good luck. You won't be able to. Hell, half the units you won't even be able to tell if they're IN the fight.Strategy... that's another issue. For a couple of reasons, chop during big fights. Slightly poor art design. It's hard to interfere precisely in bigger battles, even though the game gives you about a dozen spells and roughly as many brewable potions to do it with. But the bigger issue is that you basically never have to. You put down a ""rally all"" flag, and either your pre-set traps and your recruited minions are enough... or they're not. Usually, though, they will be, especially the traps. Once you've got gargoyles to back up your traps and a good choke points, no enemies will EVER get past them.I'm conflicted about WftO, a lot of the parts are there, but all of them just feel like they need some degree of tweaking, so that there's both a CHALLENGE and more meaningful gameplay. I feel like lower unit numbers, bigger resource constraints and slower action are required. So that it's easier to interfere, so it requires more thinking before you interfere, and so that you actually have a chance to interfere before it's all over.I also remember how Possession was a spell you were practically REQUIRED to use in the older DK's, at least a couple of bonus levels, and I think one main level, straight-up demanded it for victory, and outside of that, it could just simply be useful. The only time I ever Possessed a minion in WftO was so I could see what its skills actually did, because calling up info from the main overview just gave me skill names, not skill descriptions. And I feel that's pretty much a good description of WftO. It's got all these Dungeon Keeper traits, but it feels like the developers didn't understand WHY DK had those traits. Why did DK have Possession? Because it was a useful spell that was sometimes necessary for solving puzzles. Why does WftO have Possession? Because DK had it! And WftO wants to be DK, so it also has to have it! ...but they forgot the underlying logic that gives Possession a reason to exist in WftO.(As an aside on minion skills, it also feels like WftO minions in general have a lot less skills than DK minions had, and don't learn skills when they level up as much as they just gain more power, so high-level minions matter somewhat less)All in all... I can't really say this is a game I'm going to recommend. If you're looking for more Dungeon Keeper, it's going to be a bit of a disappointment unless you're REALLY jonesing. If you're looking for a solid strategy game, it's going to be a disappointment unless you're REALLY green to the genre and afraid of challenges.Maybe get it on sale, they're gonna open it up to mods, I think, so maybe some of those will make it interesting.

They have without fail posted every single Wednesday about their progress and what they are working on. The itself is constantly getting better but more important to me is how the developers have handled the ups and downs of this game. I can't wait for the finished product!

												This is my first Steam review, so i'll try to make it a good one; it might be a bit longwinded (TL;DR is at the bottom), but i'd like to make it as thorough as possible becouse the game and it's devs deserve as much.First off, my PC specs so you'll know what i play it on:• Windows 7 64 bit• Intel Core i5 4570 @3.20 GHz• AMD Radeon R7 200 Series, 2GB RAM• 8GB RAM My history with the genre I've played Dungeon Keeper 1 + The deeper dungeons & Dungeon Keeper 2 on multiple occasions & systems over the years.Being a fan of both originals, i was quite sad when EA first purchased the franchise and then made their intentions clear by releasing that mobile DK game... My hopes for the franchises' rebirth were only raised when i found out about a team of independant DK enthusiasts trying to make a true spiritual successor to the original games.I've followed the games' progress through it's kickstarter campaign and it's first appearance on Steam, but i didn't put any money in to it until it's official release.The initial releaseAs i'm sure some will already know, the initial release of WftO was a rocky one; as the developers explained[wftogame.com], the game had to be either rushed out with bugs so they got enough funds to polish it later or scrapped altogether, which i'm sure no DK enthusiast would like to see.I decided to purchase the Underlord edition anyway despite of the existing bugs, mostly becouse i had good faith in the devs; i guessed they wouldn't abandon their game after all the trouble they went through to make it in the first place; as it turned out in the following months, my faith was deserved.The current state of the game, as of patch 1.4 & Heart of Gold releaseI've now replayed the basic campaign twice and the Heart of Gold campaign once; by my second replay at patch 1.2 most of the bugs present at launch were fixed; by then also the performance had been improved notably.By purchasing the Underlord edition at the games' release, i got the expansion for free (which is awesome btw); now having the full WftO expirience, here's my personal list of pro's & possible con's (if they bother you, that is).PRO'S Imho the closest thing to a spiritual successor to the original Dungeon Keeper series you can find on the gaming market today, including the look & sound of the game (i'll get to the »feel« a bit later) the devs went out of their way to secure Richard Ridings (the original DK narrator) for the narrration of WftO and it definitely payed off – with audio being a large part of what made the DK games so good, just hearing his ramblings again gave me a lovely throwback to the good old days the developers started out as a small team of DK enthusiasts with a dream; they've shown their dedication and love for the game throughout it's inception as well as through the rough parts; they didn't abandon it while it was at it's lowest point but worked hard to bring it to it's current good state the artstyle & graphics are ofcourse more colorful and advanced than in DK, but that doesn't detriment to the games' general atmosphere; if you'll zoom in or even take a look in first person – another welcome throwback from DK – you'll find many nice details around your dungeon. the gameplay is largely – although not exactly – similar to DK; you dig out your dungeon, train your minions and do battle in basicly the same manner as you did in DK 1 & 2; ofcourse the devs also had to try and bring some improvements and »fresh wind« in to the genre, where the games' Sin system and some new map & campaign mechanics come in to play (more on that a bit later)  useful gameplay & UI improvements, some of which had to be implemented becouse of certain new map & campaign mechanics; stuff like the gamespeed slider, the Impasse command and the »Peace army« option integrated map editor and workshop support – you can make your own dungeon creations, share them and battle over them with other playersPOSSIBLE CON'S Many of the initial complaints were in regard to some of the original campaigns' parts being too »rushy« for a DK successor; indeed there are some missions during which you have to do certain stuff quickly, otherwise the enemy will win. But in the devs' defence, in the meantime most of those maps have been rebalanced and they also included the previously mentioned gamespeed slider, with which you can always slow your game down in case stuff should happen too quickly. Also, due to popular demand, the 4 new missions in the HoG campaign are much more akin to the original DK »explore & expand« playstyle. Becouse of copyrights, WftO isn't an exact DK clone/successor; for instance, you won't find Horny, Bile Demons or the Casino in the game anymore, although all of those have their approximate counterparts in WftO. Some of them understandably behave a bit differently here, which may turn off some DK purists, but if you're willing to overlook certain details or are new to the genre, you should have no problem with the differences. In combination with both points above, the overall gameplay feeling is mostly similar to DK but also distinctly different in certain areas and missions, which may again turn off some DK purists; if you have no problem with having some »fresh wind« in the genre or you haven't played the original Dungeon Keeper, you should be in the green. Although Ridings is the undisputed main star in the voice acting area, there are certain parts of the game, where the voice-acting is a bit underwhelming; the other voice-actors probably did their best to do a proper job, but there's still a chance you'll get the occasional cringe if you're succeptible to such things.  There are still some bugs, crashes and performance issues present in the game. As usually, some people expirience one thing and others a different thing based on their PC; playing the HoG campaign (1.4) on the PC i specified in the beginning, i've encountered one notable bug and two crashes, but the vanilla campaign functioned flawlessly for me even back in version 1.2. Based on my expirience from the launch up to now, i'd say that the devs are devoted enough to guarantee most of the current HoG bugs gone in the near future, but you might encounter a problem even so (send a report[brightrockgames.userecho.com], they definitely read them)That's about it; if you've made it so far, thanks for reading and i hope i could help you with my review.TL;DR - if you're a fan of the Dungeon Keeper series or you're new to the dungeon sim genre, i can recommend playing War for the Overworld. Although it is somewhat different to the DK series in certain parts, the overal playstyle, sound and look all borrow heavily on it, making it probably the closest thing to a DK3 on the current gaming market. The overall performance was stable on my rig; there are some issues and bugs present, but based on my past expirience the devs work dilligently on fixing them.			"

Early Access Review
								Dungeon Keeper fans: This is the game you've been waiting for.I have been playing Dungeon Keeper 2 regularly since its release in 1999. There was literally nothing else like it. Nothing that blended strategy, simulation, humor, god-like abilities quite like it could. Over the years, I have wished for a game that was at least similar. Something that could tap into that magic a little bit.I heard about War for the Overworld when my heart was breaking over the bullcrap EA pulled with the Dungeon Keeper mobile game (I don't own a cell phone, but if that game had been good, I would have probably bought one just for that, haha). Some dude mentioned it in the comments of an article about EA's latest mistake, and I flew over to Steam to find it (figuratively speaking, of course). I finally tried it today, and I have to say, I am surprisingly shocked as to how well they're pulling it off.This game captures that DK essence. This game is made by people who are as obsessed with the masterpieces that are DK and DK2 as I am. The developers have put their hearts and souls into this game. This much is clear because everything that Dungeon Keeper did right, it's here. Everything you loved is here. Some things that were glitchy about DK2 or just inconvenient are upgraded and/or gone (building prisons while your minions are walking through the area will no longer accidentally imprison them, for one example). Obviously, the game is not DK. Types of minions and rooms have been changed, as is necessary, I suppose. I thought I might find this hard to come to terms with (after all, the Dark Angel from DK2 is one of my favorite video game characters of all time, hence why I have a portrait of one on the wall behind me), but it's really not bad at all. It's even refreshing, in a way. I was actually excited to see new character types to play with and master. The visuals are stunning. There are bits of humor here and there. And either the voice actor they got is doing a ridiculously fantastic job of mimicking the guy from DK2, or he IS the guy from DK2. Either way, props. I very enthusiastically recommend this game, even in early access. Although the campaign is limited to a tutorial mission and one other mission now (plus four others, including a sandbox and a My Pet Dungeon because, well, YES!!!), the game is highly playable, and I can see myself getting at least 20 hours out of the state it is in now, but then again, I am a sucker for just messing around with a game and perfecting it. The average player will probably get 5-10 hours out of this or so in its early access state. But with active developers (just check the forums, if you want), you will be able to purchase an early access with the knowledge that your input does, in fact, count. If you like providing feedback on a game or being one of the first to play an awesome game, buy this. If you want to delve into this and play the whole campaign over the span of a few days, put this in your wishlist, because you'll have to wait a few months for that (early 2015 is the current estimated release date). Either way, you'll want to buy it, sooner or later. ;)			"

												Patch 1.1 and later saved this game.If you shelved it like me before the recent updates, you should give it another try. Pls.Performance is now great.The game feels more responsive and polished.The AI feels well balanced on a medium setting.Love the new 4 player maps, and cannot wait to see more (hopefully we get even larger ones).Want to see more dungeon skins and ability to change skin in options menu, not the pre game lobby.The UI and menus are now great.Before the update(s):I found myself unable to enjoy any maps, including story mode.I was put off by the overall clunkyness.The menus were terrible and the UI felt horrid.There was just an unpolished late alpha/beta feel.All of that was highly disappointing when spending a small premium (£29.99) for the Underlord Edition (£22.99 is the base price).I had indefinitely shelved the game.THANK YOU to the devs for their massive effort in not ditching this game in its horrendous 1.0 state, and working extremely hard on polish and bugs, it's now excellent.Whilst previously telling friends to stay well away, I now happily recommend it.I can now sit back with a coffee and enjoy zapping and splatting enemy minions who try to reclaim my dungeon.Devs have released several more patches since 1.1.

												War for the Overworld was a bug-ridden mess when it was first released, but I give enormous credit to the young, inexperienced development team that they stuck with it and did the hard work to fix their game even though the world had already written it off.Today War for the Overworld is incomparable to what it was immediately after release. As the devs have cleared the bugs out of the way and continued to polish the game underneath, a real gem has emerged with it’s own style.After giving up on War for the Overworld immediately after release, I went back a few months ago and had a blast, completeing the whole campaign. So far I’ve been loving the additions in this new Hearts of Gold expansion too.I encourage anyone who was turned off by the initial mess to give War for the Overworld another shot. It’s now a wonderful game in and of itself, but more than that the devs should be congratulated and rewarded for never giving up on their vision.			"

												You know... I WANT to love this game. Like most players i came from the old DK series and jumped on WFTO as soon as it was announced. I stuck with it through Early Access waiting for the final release. Now that it has been released and i have played through the campaign i am left with a 'is that it' feeling.The Campaign levels mostly relied upon rushes, there was none of the patient 'build, probe, attack and assimilate' of the DK series. This was more of a 'build a few rooms, cap out your army then rush'.Some of the levels required it, you could not beat them otherwise. The lack of thought needed to beat the campaign was a real turn-off for me.There were so many spells, potions and rituals that i had no need for.I basically beat the game with just 3 of the available defences (door, bombard and lotus trap), 3 of the spells (heal, lightning and summon imp) and the required Ritual in the last level. That meant that > 75% of the available buffs were unnecessary!The voice overs were often repeated with machinegun regularity and i wished for a way to turn them off.It is a lovely game (plagued by stuttering) and i hope the devs can change its course back to what they were clearly aiming for.At the moment i cannot possibly recommend it either for old DK players or new players.

TL;DRI surely recommend this game now after the developers put a ton of work in it since the initial release of War For The Overworld. Most problems during the initial release have been fixed and existing good futures have been enhanced for an even beter experience.Like all other reviews say, if you're looking for a Dungeon Keeper 2 experience, than this might be the game for you.The developers of this game have put a ton of work in it to make the performance better and the overall gameplay, by now I can recommend this game without any problem (even for low-end rigs).Back storyI've backed this game in early access on steam and have enjoyed it during the early access period most of the time. Since the launch I've started playing the game again and had,like a lot of other people, problems with campaign breaking bugs. At a point, it even felt like the release was more buggy and glitched than the early access version what actually made me sad seeing a great concept going getting thrown away. (I've been here before with Castle Story)But one of the main differences was that after a few days I noticed that the devs were putting out daily patches, what made me happy to see them putting effort in fixing it during the weekend. I've never played dungeon keeper (I've seen a lot of game play and play troughs about DK) but I enjoy the game a hell of a lot despite the current bugs.Positive Great art style Concept has been worked out great (Dungeon Keeper style with adding their own twist to it) Challenging campaign Lots of variety character and strategy wise Great voice acting and dialogues  Gameplay The long awaited Map Editor Steam Community workshop provides you with unlimited maps (comes along with the Map Editor)Negative Bugs and glitches like mentioned before Most game/gameplay breaking bugs are fixed Unfinished multiplayer (will be completed later on) Has a nice interface now (I didn't test the multiplayer myself) Missing information about buildings and characters (they get explained in the campaign) They've listened to the community and updated the information bannerI will update this review while the game keeps changingEDIT: Notification about game/gameplay bugs being fixedEDIT2: Version 1.1 update changesEDIT3: Version 1.3 update changes			"

												When War for the Overworld was released it was a mess with crashes, stuttering, bugs and performance issues. Over time the game has been patched, updated and stabilized to the point you can play it without any frustration from the technical side.The gameplay itself is, well, a Dungeon Keeper clone. In this management game you are tasked with building a dungeon, attract evil minions and eventually send them to destroy the forces of good. It is a decent game, nothing that will blow you away but it can be very fun at times.			"

TL:DR? See ConclusionThe game was given to me for review purposesINTRODUCTION:War for the Overworld is a real-time-strategy / dungeon management game which was developed and published by Subterranean Studios. The game was made possible through Kickstarter and seeks to establish itself as the spiritual successor to the original Dungeon Keeper series of games, going so far as to hire the same narrator from that series. The game and its devs were also praised by Peter Molyneux, the original creator of Dungeon Keeper.The plot is pretty straight forward and borrows heavily from the Overlord series' plot line where the player takes on the role of a newly resurrected evil overlord who seeks to rebuild his domain and take vengeance against the currently ruling human empire.PROS:+ Good artistic design that manages to capture the look and feel of Dungeon Keeper+ Nice graphics, specially for a Unity engine game+ Excellent voice acting from Richard Ridings (the Dungeon Keeper narrator)+ The game was able to preserve DK's gameplay while making a few improvements of their own such as the 'Sins' system.+ Skill / Tech Tree system that makes for several variations in dungeon builds (Sins system)+ Good sound effects and atmosphere+ Good variety of monster / minions with different skills and abilities+ Fun campaign maps and missions+ Fast paced action+ Constant updates and interaction by the developers with the community+ Good game timeCONS:- The tutorial missions does not cover a lot of the game's mechanics- The gameplay is essentially RTS but with the Combat / Minion control being woefully underdeveloped- Severe performance drops during late game situations: (specially when there are a lot of units on the map)- Tool Tips is lacking: For example, if you move your mouse over to the Spells Tab, It should show  something like this “Spells Tab (B)” so that the player immediately knows that its bound to the B key but it doesn't so you'll have to refer back to the Controls Menu to see which key is bound to which UI element. This is very inconvenient specially for a fast paced game like this.- First Person / Possession mode needs a lot of work: particularly, the fact that the character models of the currently possessed minion sometimes clip over the camera.NEUTRAL:+/- Demon hand: I know its part of Dungeon Keeper's legacy but it would have been nice to have an option to use the regular mouse cursor.+/- Story is predictable specially if you've played Overlord 1 and 2.CONCLUSION:GOOD GAME. War for the Overworld is certainly NOT Dungeon Keeper 3 but its the closest one out there. The developers are certainly passionate about this game and should no doubt be praised for making a much better spiritual successor with such a limited budget unlike that other game[www.metacritic.com] that should be buried deep beneath the earth and forgotten.--------------------------------------------------------- Like our Reviews?

Early Access Review
								I nearly♥♥♥♥♥♥myself when I heard that someone was making a spiritual successor to the Dungeon Keeper series.  Dungeon Keeper II stands as one of my favorite games of all time, and I still remember my disappointment when I heard Dungeon Keeper III had been cancelled.  After playing several beta builds of War for the Overworld, I think I can comfortably say that this game is the one I've been waiting for.Stepping into the game, I was amazed with what these guys have accomplished so far.  The creature and level design does sway a bit ""grittier"" than Dungeon Keeper, but it doesn't detract from the feel of the game.  The rooms are exquisitely detailed, which comes across especially well in the first-person view.  The creatures are also gorgeously and creatively rendered, and each unit is fairly easy to pick out among the throng of minions churning around your dungeon.  The interface is already fairly intuitive, with a few niggles here and there.  It can be difficult to select the right minion out of a crowd, and certain vital functions--the ""rally"" command, for example--can be a hassle to get to.  The game could also benefit from remappable hotkeys, or any hotkeys whatsoever, for that matter.  The devs have stated that hotkeys and remapping are coming in a later patch, though, so I wouldn't dock any points over it.The tech tree is extensive and well-done, with some solid improvements over the Warlock research tree from Dungeon Keeper II.  The tree is sorted into three ""veins of evil,"" with your cultist accruing ""sins""--research points, basically--which allow you to unlock ""aspects,"" granting access to new rooms, minions, spells, and rituals.  It's all pretty straightforward once you get used to it, but the tutorial doesn't do a great job of explaining how the tech tree works.  You can fumble about with trying to attract a specific minion, only to find out later that the minion's specific room and requirements are tied up somewhere in the Veins.  It's not a huge problem, however, and I'm confident the devs will add a better tutorial in the future.The campaign's still on the way, which is the part I was especially looking forward to, so it's impossible to give a solid score at the moment.  However, what the devs have accomplished so far is incredible, and very much in the spirit of the original games.  If you're a fan of the Dungeon Keeper series, or a fan of base-management games in general, I would definitely recommend checking out War for the Overworld.			"

												I loved Dungeon Keeper and this game has high potential. However despite being ""released"" it's far from that state and until it is finished I can not really recommend it. Full of bugs, useless Mini map, just feels very unfinished overall. Once those things are fixed it's definitely a recomendation,  but releasing unfinished games just has to stop.			"

												I was very very excited for this game. I preordered the day I became aware of it's existence. I probably sank hundreds of hours into DK 1 and 2 in my adolescence and every couple of years I play through them even with the terrible emulation of Dosbox. So when I fired up WFTO and saw that it had the best of everything I remembered from both DK's I was ecstatic, the voice of the mentor was back, and it seemed to have the same sardonic humor I could barely contain myself. Then I started playing.The game itself has the same dynamics of the originals. Carve out some rooms, beat some minions, watch the enemies impale themselves upon your floor spikes. But as you keep playing you realize this is just a shadow of what made the original DK great. There is little to discover (no special rooms to summon elite minions, no fun combinations of defenses, no fun things to do with posession) and you can win nearly every level of the campaign by building 5 or 6 beast pits and dropping a flag on the enemy core. In fact, through have the campaign that is exactly what you HAVE to do since defenses are practically worthless. I only found them useful in 1 campaign level. Usually the enemies will rush you so quickly you have no time to build defenses or train your minions and if you can withstand their attack you can immediately counter to win. If you do try and build up and turtle the campaign will just punish you with infinite waves of enemies that rush right passed all your minions to start banging on your core or with the flawless AI micromanagement. Where is the valiant freeing of prisoners? Looting the vaults? Why aren't rooms wrecked up and torched so they need to be fixed?I kept playing despite the campaign really not being my style. I prefer to spend some time crafting a world then crushing my foes but, hey, it's nice to be pushed outside your comfort area now and again. As you keep playing the rough edges of the game will begin to grate through your resilience causing frustration and agony. The UI is sluggish and the buttons small. I have tried to click the little cancel attack flag circle and burrowed through the wall of my base too many times. Paging through the laggy menus to lighting bolt a worker who is stuttering around my base as the AI simultaneously blasts 6 of my workers while dropping 30 minions onto the square they just took in my base is psychological torture.  Or sometimes the game lags so bad you just drop a flag where you need to be and go make lunch, coming back 30 minutes later to see you won while AFK (level 9). The final nail in the coffin causing me to uninstall my hopes and dreams of a DK successor are the bugs. Workers standing around doing nothing. Defense parts never being delivered. Walls never being repaired. Dropping an attack flag and watching my soldiers walk into a wall while my core gets demolished. Possession freezing my computer. The game is unplayable in Linux and poorly running in Windows. Probably the worst was when I beat the second to last mission (level 12) and the game just never ended. Apparently there is a bug where you can capture an enemy core without destroying it making it impossible to win. For the record this was patch 1.1.7 which was supposed to be playable. As of now I wish I could get a refund, my 13 hours back, and to wash off this disappointment.			"

Early Access Review
								This game touts itself as the spiritual successor of Dungeon Keeper, but it’s so much more than that. As an avid fan of the Dungeon Keeper franchise since the first release in 1995, I have been very picky about my “evil minion master” games. In all the years since Dungeon Keeper 2, no game has come as close to capturing the essence of what made the original as well as War for the Overworld. Not only does it pay a near flawless tribute to the old mechanics, it has added some very useful ones of its own. This, ladies and gentlemen is how you make a sequel. In its current state, there isn’t much to play aside form multiplayer and two skirmish maps, but with the release date only a month away and a big update just around the corner, there really isn’t a reason that a Dungeon Keeper fan wouldn’t bet this game. I never write reviews on here, but I couldn’t pass this up. This is the game you have been looking for. "

												Buying this game is buying a work in progress. I understand the many folks who were dissapointed that the game is 'unfinished'. The thing that keeps me in the dev's camp on this one is reading their posts. This is a group of little guys, who are being honest and forthright about what's been going on with them, why things are the way they are, and what they are working on for the future. This isn't EA or Blizzard with obfuscation and double talk, this is by the fans, for the fans, and that kind of real honesty is uncommon in both gaming and life in general! So, to the game. They have masterfully captured the 'flavor' of DK. I have enjoyed the mechanics of the different rooms, and figuring out the spells, rituals, and potions. The graphics are good, they favor the old game without looking dated. I'm playing often, but not constantly, as I enjoy coming back after patches and seeing how they are continuing to put polish on things. Personally am highly looking forward to more Skirmish maps, particularly larger ones! If you like DK, buy this game, and learn to love the progress and the game as is. If you like God mode games, and the idea of being Bad for the first time, well, come give evil a try! ;-)			"

												Wow there's so many negative reviews, what's up with that ?I'll grant that the game has some negative aspects, not the least of which are :- minions sitting idle like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ instead of training- minions watching arena instead of training- minions stockpiling defense parts instead of training (please introduce a toggle in that room)- minions not going to defend automatically during enemy invades, and instead requiring a rally flagWith that being said, the game is very mature and I have no regrets buying it back in the day whatsoever :- map editor with steam workshop or local support- scenarios- OKish campaign with voiceoverThe humor isn't DK2-level but there's still some and it fits nicely.I was quite surprised when the voice (who the hell is it anyway ?) told me ""2 of your minions say they want to go mid... or they'll... feed ? feed what, each other ?""My only regret is that vampires are such a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to keep fed -.-Well, that, and the lack of support units.I'd rather have no potions and instead have healing/buffing units in lieu of a stupid melee.

												Feels almost like dungeon keeper 2 and with a little bit of tweaking it will be a really nice DK2 alternative. There's still a lot of bugfixing to do though, but the developer is patching the hell out of it. So have no fear.			"

												The Dungeon Keeper successor we deserve. The game is great gameplay wise with familiar mechanics mixed with a well-needed improvements to the formula. New unit types - beasts - add a bit of strategy to the mix and the addition of potions, constructs and the Veins of Evil tech tree make for multidimensional gameplay. Unfortunately, the release version is riddled with (fortunately minor) technical issues which should hopefully get ironed out in the coming weeks. Still impressive when compared to other indie crowdfunded games which usually fail to deliver. Very good, if still a little rough around the edges!			"

												I loved the original Dungeon Keeper games. It was just simply FUN to play the bad guy. However, technology carries on and even Dungeon Keeper 2 with it's support for 3D accelerated graphics still looks extremely outdated now. It's still fun but can be a hassle to get running on modern computers, especially if you want widescreen resolution options.Because of those issues I wanted a modern remake. I first heard about War for the Overworld (WftO) years ago. When it came out for early access I bought it plus a copy for my wife because we loved playing the originals together. I was extremely disappointed in just about every aspect of the game. I knew it was early access so I waited.I tried again months and months later. It wasn't really any better, everything felt wrong, nothing clicked. At that point I basically told myself I'd be been burned on another early access game. For some reason I decided to look at the reviews yesterday (7/27/2016) for the first time in over a year and I noticed people saying it was vastly improved. I had serious doubts but I re-downloaded it anyway because I wanted to have my modern remake!The devs should be lauded and praised! After releasing a sub-par product they CONTINUED to make improvements to it despite the bad reviews. This game is now truly what I wanted it to be and even more than that, it feels like a true successor to the originals even down to the voices and gameplay! Last night I played the tutorial (which wasn't available last I played) and then played a skirmish game. I may end up putting all my other games on hold to play this!You guys rock!!tl;dr - Devs release sub-par product, get a huge public backlash. Despite that, they continue working and now have a I game I am seriously proud to own and play!!			"

												War for the Overworld: The Kickstarter that succeededThis is a short honest review that addresses the good and the bad about this game in its current state. I waited until official release to play, so I have no beta-bias or bonding with the developers.THE GOOD:-The game feels and plays like Dungeon Keeper, for real. Let's be honest, no game has come close to the DK experience in over 15 years... until now. -The game truly feels like DK3, and not just DK-2015. Not only are all the core elements of the DK experience in place, but new concepts have been added (contructs, sins, and the tavern for example). -The visuals are nice, the music is great, and the voice acting is amazing.Remember the primary voice actor in the DK games? Well, they found and hired that same guy to play his role again.-The developers have announced that new content is under way, both in the form of paid and free additions. The fact that two patches have been rolled out within 24 hours of the game's launch tells me that the developers both care about the game and are in dire need of some sleep.THE BAD:-The game needs polish in certain areas, especially in regard to the first person ""possession"" mode. Don't get me wrong, the game overall is polished, but there are lots of minor tweaks that will allow it to fill the shoes of a game with twice the budget.SUMMARY:In its current state, War for the Overworld is a fun experience that is worth double the asking price. With additional polish, this game might just surpass its predecessors.			"

												After 4 months, I'd say the game still needs some more time before you buy it.It IS a good Dungeon Keeper game in terms of the gameplay, however at the moment - the Campaign is woefully designed and is not a fun Dungeon Keeping experience. It is a zerg-rush from level to level still riddled with bugs and poor design choices that apparently aren't going to be addressed.In larger levels the game will stutter horrendously every 2-3 seconds, it won't crash and you /can/ complete the level, but it really does ruin the experience. To clarify I'm on an i5, GTX 970, 16GB RAM.Multiplayer is dead due to the poor release decision with the game not being fully finished. That action alone has killed the potential community for this game. Additionally there are connection issues that probably pushed more people away.It's a shame really.9/10 for Gameplay5/10 for Performance.3/10 for Design Implementation.6/10 Overall. Buy a few months from now when it's actually finished.			"

								Editing this review since it's been quite some time...Many games have coined themselves as games like Bullfrog's Dungeon Keeper but very few have ever actually lived up to the name. War For The Overworld lives up to the name and then some.I still play the original DK I & II (still have the discs, whoo) and WFTO is leaps and bounds more than I expected it to be when I first bought EA.WFTO is the first game I had ever bought EA to and I have not been disappointed at all. The Devs have been great at constant updates to the game. They have a lot of dialogue with players on their forums. It's great and what EA should be for other games.This game, from when I first bought EA, has become so much more than I expected. It still has that great Dungeon Keeper feel and look. If it weren't for the different name / company, I would swear this to be Dungeon Keeper III.If you loved the original Dungeon Keeper games, I cannot recommend WFTO enough to you. I promise, you will NOT be disappointed.			"

								Do I recommend this game now?  No, it's still very much in development.  Dungeon Keeper, as a concept, needs to have as many parts working as possible.  Some games can function as a Minimum Viable Product, and this isn't one of them.  So if you need something to play RIGHT NOW, I recommend looking elsewhere.  Did you play Divinity Original Sin yet?  It's superb, go play it.With that said, this is shaping up to be *wonderful*.  The art style, narrator, everything about it just says ""Dungeon Keeper 3!""  They clearly didn't take the money and run, ala some other kickstarter dev teams, and instead are really pouring a ton of love into it.I have little doubt that this will be a great game on release.  So if you feel like preordering it now, then have at it, your money won't be wasted.  But that said, there is absolutally no harm in waiting either.  Add this one to your wishlist and pick it up once it's done!			"

												I would like to highlight devs guts here !This project started as a kickstarter that I baked (as a Dungeon Keeper fan). It was far from finished and balanced when I first bought it and many things were lacking. I didn't played it much because of rythm flaws and lack of content.The devs didn't abandon their game and kept improving it with big and free patches.Now they included gameplay mutators that let you change nearly every single  major gameplay rule in the game. They explained that mods were a big no-no because of unity plus the architecture (as it was their first big production).They added a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of content too (survival game-mode, free dlc, etc.).So yeah, thanks devs, it cheers me up that the industry still has some devoted guys like you !Definetly recomending this game !

												Despite having finally been released from early access after nearly two years, it’s hard to see where all the “early access” quality assurance efforts have gone. The game remains a buggy and poorly paced mess.As far as I can tell the game is about strip mining your dungeon, as there is little obvious incentive to construct corridors, rooms and doors. Wall demolition is practically instantaneous, so there is no time cost to be saved. Strip mining also seems necessary to improve pathing (nothing to get stuck behind). In contrast to demolishing walls, however, trap setting is painfully slow, despite having numerous foundries, so there’s no encouragement to spend any time thinking about subtle traps and dungeon layout. Furthermore, each door and trap appears to have a maintenance cost that reduces your overall available mana pool, so there's a perverse disincentive to building any dungeon structures at all.I’ve yet to crack mission four due to either game breaking bugs or poor pacing. My first game was abandoned because, despite having taken 90% of the map, my flow of minions completely evaporated and I was left watching the one or two I did have lasered by the AI. My second attempt at the mission lagged out, with around one screen refresh every 20 seconds or so – a problem in other maps, although one the game had previously recovered from after a minute or two.Game boot and load times might easily be the longest of any of the 1300+ games I currently own. It’s a trivial point, but given the elongated load times I spend a lot of time looking at the loading screen, emphasising how bland and amateurish the loading screen looks.The giant evil hand pointer is vastly too large, and it’s consequently difficult to target precisely, not least because you’re hovering above an isometric 3D plane and it’s often not clear whether you should be clicking on the base of the 3D terrain block or the top of it (which might instead result in selecting the adjacent block instead).Pathfinding is poor, and minions repeatedly get “lost”, often stuck behind single objects completely out in the open. For example, I had to rescue a mob of about 8 units bouncing off a spawner, despite there being two clear paths on either side. Units often run out of food or don’t get paid, presumably because they can’t route to food or cash, despite half my dungeon being micropig spawners, taverns and treasure.The minimap is largely worthless, with no clear signaling about where an attack might be coming from, and little attempt to distinguish rooms, enemies, minions, etc.Ultimately, the game seems primarily a fairly traditional, uninspired RTS; spam barracks (monster spawners or whatever) and rush enemy - he or she who builds the most barracks (or barrack-like spawners) fastest wins. You are basically forced to have all your units running around in one mass mob due to the single rally flag, so any kind of subtle tactics are out.There may be a good game under the surface here, but after five hours of perseverance I have yet to see it.edit: I have now flirted with skirmish mode because I desperately want to give this game a chance, and I can see that there's a little bit of complexity here be unlocked, at least as far as research paths. The campaign is the tutorial however, and as the campaign is borked I'm finding skirmish mode to be a little too overhelming to take on for what looks like a fair bit of trial and error to get anything out of. And to be honest, without a campaign to get me hooked, sandbox mode was always going to be a bit too open-ended for my short attention span.			"

												This game harks back to the good old Bullfrog days for those who can remember as far back as Theme Park and Theme Hospital to name but 2 titles from said alas former software house. While there are plenty of familiar voices and creatures for those who, like me, loved the original DK1 and DK2 games this game owes its existence to, there are also a lot of new elements and creatures to keep even the most hardened of dungeoneers on their toes (or fingers?) It’s basically a VERY long awaited DK3 so think original DK with much better graphics and a few different enemies and creatures and your pretty much there. Good stuff!			"

There are placeholders everywhere, gamebreaking bugs, including one entir elevel where the core mechanic is buggy and broken. This game is not at a state that it should be to be considered a release. When all of your tooltips still have placeholders in them, there is seriously something wrong.Has great potential, I can see this being very fun, currently 7 missions in and it could become great once fixed. Wait a couple more months to see if the game has been fixed, until then, stay away.			"

												This game succeeds in replicating all of the fun we once had in the dungeon keeper titles.  Unfortunately that is where the problem with this title is as well.  I would not so much say that this game isn't recommended.  It just is not worth the price that it currently goes for.  When this goes on special (75% off at least)- take it.  It does have replayability in exactly the same sence as the old dungeon keeper games had - that is to say, doing exactly the same over and over again (because it was fun).  For me, this doesn't translate so much in modern gaming.  Further more, it was a massive surprise to learn that coop wasn't available for the campaign.   The campaign itself is rather easy and very short.  Skirmish and sandbox modes are pretty much just free for all bash - ups being made moderately fun by the swathe of different map designs out there.Does this game succeed in what it sets out to do?  Absolutely.  It brings an old, nostalgic experience into modern times.  That in itself begs the question - do you buy this game or get Dungeon Keeper 2 to work on your current os?  The latter wont cost you any money and all you sacrefice is the graphics.Technically this game is a disaster.  It chews up pc resources equal to something double its size and depth.  The graphics are pretty, particles are sweet and animations are ""okay"" - yet this beast eats up more resources on both my pc's than just about anything I have.  I'd go so far as to suspect that there may be some serious memory leakage going on or just not very clever design.Again, this game isn't all that bad but I can find very few reasons to recommend it based on its current price.  As someone who played dungeon keeper for years, this game could hardly provide me with any reason to do so beyond 5 hours (that is how long it took me to complete the campaign).   Mind you, it appears the average playtime for the campaign varies between 6 to 12 hours, so do not use my time as the average.  Some of us grind harder than others :)Coupled with the lack of any kind of intelligable innovation, the technical presentation of this title is atrocious.  Something ""appearing"" of this quality should at least be half way better designed.  I'm not sure if it is bad resource management or perhaps bias towards more mainstream hardware combinations.  What I can say is that between the group of friends I play with, all of us experience this kind of issue where the game is just hogging an inordinate amount of resources.  Things like this can be polished out with further tweaks from the developers whom appear to be quite active in community engagement (although, i would note in a very quetionable manner not befitting PR).Multiplayer:Coop campaigns are not existing yet.  It doesn't look like they will either.Multiplayer is stock standard player vs player or player & player vs AI (this is what they deem coop - beware those steam tags).  The game devours resources so you can imagine what a horrible experience multiplayer becomes with 4 players on a large map.  That is, IF you can get the game to work on multiplayer.Multiplayer requires you to download their little guide (or just go read the resources) so as to unblock the required ports and the likes.  Yes folks, we are talking peer to peer multiplayer.  Not only is this problematic for a whole swathe of players to set up, but (do i need to say this really?) it is NOT SECURE.  Not recommended (dont take my word for it - use google).In closing,The game is one of those ""could have beens"".  It could have been great, it could have been really fun.  And, hey, it still is for a few hours.  But not at that price.  You can buy 4 good indie games for the same price that would each provide you four to five times the play time.  Thus this is purely a title you'll invest in out of nostaliga and nothing else.  Guaranteed.My recommendation:Buy it on special!			"

												As it stands, this game was absolutely NOT ready for a full release.The game is still riddled with many bugs and problems, including poor pathfinding, units ignoring rally flags, and severe UI lag.While the campaign content does seem to be finished, there are still ""placeholder"" cutscenes.The skirmish and multiplayer mode might as well not exist, as they are completely barren. There are only three small maps available, and the lobby menu looks like it was designed by a novice scipt kiddy.All in all, this game was rushed to release way, WAY too early for its own good.DO NOT BUY until all bugs and issues have been dealt with.

												Update April 11, 2015:THE memory leak has been fixed, but the game has such poor performance across the board that the game is unplayable. Still crashes. Still many many bugs and unfinished things. I am way too frustrated trying to play through the broken, unfinished stuff with awful performance.Beating the final ""boss"" doesn't even make sense in the campaign. Maybe there's supposed to be some more cutscenes that explain it that aren't finished/added yet? The overall story is very poorly written.The campaign is very short, only extended by game crashes or not being able to load game saves because of a ""gc too many threads"" error. I'm guessing they beefed up the garbage collection to help with the memory leak but caused another bug in the process??I can't spawn heroes from the hero gate in the ""My Pet Dungeon"" level. I guess they didn't add that functionality yet? Also, I can't get any more of the errr experience points? So I can't unlock all the things. It's just so buggy. There's no real reason to play that level :/I do not call this a ""spiritual successor"" to Dungeon Keeper because DK1 & 2 were actually good whereas this is not. It is not worthy of such a name or comparison.Visuals: Poor. Low poly models and blah textures without any kind of shading (lighting effects and whatnot) on them. Environment art is better than the character art, but still doesn't feel that great.Audio: Meh. They got the original DK voice actor, but he doesn't sound as good as I remember him being. He used to have a deeper more sinister or demonic voice. I miss that rumble in his voice when he said ""Keeper"".Gameplay: Poor. Campaign mission design is weak. Just drop your flag on the enemies heart and it's over. Or get rekt by the AI while you're (graphically) lagging out.Do NOT buy this game. Your money is better spent elsewhere. I kind of wish I could get a refund :/-------------------------------------Original Review April 6, 2015:I recommend NO only because the game was released in a very unfinished state.There's lots of placeholder text.Multiplayer lobby is broken.Part of the ""Possession"" spell's tooltip says that attacking and using the unit's abilities doesn't work yet. (It doesn't)The first level bugged out for me. I killed the group of dwarves in the island but the objective never updated. I probably used the rally flag too many times or something. I don't know. I had to restart it and carefully follow the instruction and then it worked.Straight up hard crash on the 4th level. It just finished the intro bit about how I have beasts and I was moving the camera around and mining stuff and building things and then suddenly the screen turned white and everything was unresponsive. Had to hard reboot my desktop.I can't complete the 4th level. After reaching the other keeper, everything gets super choppy and eventually hard crashes my computer. This time with a bright green screen instead of white screen. I'm thinking there's an extra hard memory leak in it :/Also, the textures aren't that high res and the geometry feels very low poly for a game being released in 2015. Maybe they're trying to really get that Dungeon Keeper 2 feel and visuals. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯Once the game gets patched up to how it should have been when it was released, I'll reevalute this review. I know the devs are trying hard (multiple patches per day since release), but I just can't recommend the given product right now.			"

												I love Dungeon Keeper Gold and was excited for the release, but sadly I was rather disappointed. The game if far too buggy to recommand quite yet, and personally I preferred the style of DK1 over DK2, which obviously seems to have been the main source of inspiration.Nevertheless, here's a list of noteworthy bugs, issues etc. I encountered while playing the campaign:- Options. No settings for controls, especially mouse. Also the graphics options are slightly limited.- Cursor. Its size and the animations, often make it difficult to click precisely. It's also a bit laggy at times.- UserInterface. Most tooltips contain a lot of unformatted placeholder data. Some of the buttons etc. are a bit too bulky (Add UI scaling option?). Sometimes clicking the buttons won't register, or they're otherwise a bit unresponsive.- Performance. Frequent lag spikes after a while, and in the bigger levels the game begins to slow down quite notably.- AI. The minions act just plain stupid at times. Ignoring enemies right in front of them, fleeing while having plenty of health, stuck somehow unwilling to attack while in combat, imps selecting task far away when there's stuff to do right next to them, and the list going on.- Voiceover. The periodic taunts get annoying really fast. Having a very limited number of variations and starts repeating pretty quickly.- Pace. For whatever reason, the game seems a bit sluggish.- Map. There is no fullscreen map and the minimap isn't really informative enough.- Crashes. Some stability issues. Nothing recurring or gamebreaking yet.- Glitches. Some of the 3d models get stuck on the user interface. Such as while holding a minion, dragging the cursor over the minimap.I'll check back later and edit this review to reflect on the game's state at the time.Next I'd like to do a little comparison for those that might deem it helpful. As said before, WftO is far closer to DK2 than DK1, what's the difference. Well I certainly can't break it all down here, but here's some things from the top of my head.- Mana. DK Gold used gold for everything. - Imps. In DK Gold they were unlimited, limited only by their increasing price.- Graphical tone. DK Gold was darker, grittier and in general more sinister.- Overall feel. With verything combined, the music, the visuals, the narration, the jokes and the gameplay, in my opinion DK Gold had far superior athmosphere.- Language. Apart from the occasional taunt and the narrator, there was no real language. Now, for example the cultists speak and in plain english.- Voiceover. It's great to hear a familiar voice, but it just seems too cheerful and cheesy.- Upkeep. In DK Gold imps and traps require no upkeep.- Statistic. Such as the mood and task of minions, was clearly modelled after DK2 rather than DK Gold. Especially the combat log in DK Gold was invaluable in making sense of the chaos. No such feature here.- Walls. In DK Gold, fortified wall were indestructible, except by a special spell, making quick land grabbing and fortifying of key locations, an important part of the strategy. Also walls could not be recovered once dug out, forcing you to really pick and choose.- Handling of minions. DK1 didn't add any penalty to manually moving minions around, nor was there a limit to where you can pick them up from as long as were alive and not in the enemy's custody.These may seem like minor details, but put together they drastically affect the gameplay and the overall feel. I'm making this point, just in case you were expecting more DK1-like feel rather than the DK2 that this game currently has.TL;DRDo you prefer?- DK2: Wait for patches, and buy the game.- DK1: Wait for patches, consider carefully.

However, I've just redownloaded it today and what an amazing game this has turned into!  Absolutely love the direction and the new gameplay mechanics!  Runs infinitely better now too, although theres a small freeze between menus but gameplace itself is seamless (also delay/freeze on posession).  I highly highly highly reccomend this game.			"

												I previously played War for the Overworld way before it launched. At the time it was pretty buggy and unbalanced, so I wanted to leave it a while before fully judging it. The team had a pretty rough launch, it seemed but having given it a go again recently, I'm really pleased with how much work they've put in to the game since then. They've clearly worked very hard to make it as close to the original Dungeon Keeper games as possible, in all departments. Style, gameplay and soundtrack all feel very familiar but with lots of new twists and gameplay features. It very much feels like a spiritual successor to the original games.  It's also really clear to see how they've listened to feedback from the community and worked on improving the game continuously for such a long time after launch. It's a thoroughly enjoyable experience, and it's only more likely to carry on improving. If you're a fan of the original Dungeon Keeper games, I'd highly suggest picking this up.			"

												There have been a lot of comments about how buggy / unfinished this game is. Currently, I have to agree. That said, the Dev's are pushing out patches like ther is no tomorrow! Almost every day since launch, there has been a patch with noticeable gameplay improvements. At this pace I have every confidence that the dev's will get the game to where it should be within a week or two.In short, If you liked DK2 as much as I did, you should deffinitely give this game a go! It is by far the closest thing to the DK series that you can get your hands on today, and manages to carry the soul (Richard Ridings) of DK into a great dungeon management game of today. "

												It's good but there's a few things that need to be improved.What I missed the most from the DK games were all the little details that were put into creatures' personalities and traits. For example, you couldn't have spiders and flies share a lair because they hate each other. Bile demons hated skeletons because they're fat and skeletons are skinny so they wouldn't work together. A level 10 demon spawn becomes a dragon, a tentacle only comes if you put a lair next to water. There are DK ersatz characters in this game, like a succubus instead of a mistress, but they're not fleshed out much. I do like how, for example, the Auger is a slow creature, so you have to think about the layout of the rooms he uses so he doesn't have to walk too far, but most of the other creatures are attract and forget, which means you don't have to be particularly good at designing your dungeon. You just build things and wait.Fights don't have a lot of strategy to them because all of the creatures feel the same. The ghost in DK1 for example, was a weak creature which could reflect magic and blow away enemies using wind, so you'd use that creature in certain situations. The bile demon was AOE, the warlock was ranged healing, the mistress was a kiter, the hellhound was for picking off runners and imps, the orc was a tank. There's not much of that here, you don't really need healers because you generally have so much mana that you can just heal creatures yourself. The creatures' offensive spells all feel the same. Everything feels bland and overpowered.The lair and treasure room don't attract creatures and their shape doesn't matter, so you can just slap them down anywhere and forget about them. Boring. Make them do something.The world map in DK1 was really cool, the way it was hand drawn and changed from good to evil over the course of the game. The one in this game isn't as interesting.Still it's a good game and all but they need to take another look at DK1 instead of DK2 and see what made that game good.			"

Reward these actually care about your purchase developers and yourself by adding this game to your stable.			"

												Full disclosure: I bought in during Early Release, however I did not play the game extensively until 1.0.This game is, by and large, a deep spiritual successor to the great Dungeon Keeper of old, complete with the same narrator in the background, along with the witty humour and dungeon base building concept.It is brought to the modern day with a more modern control scheme, graphical fidelity, and delivery. If you've ever been a fan of base-building games and/or wanted to be the bad guy, this is your game. Fan of the DK of old? Its back, baby!+ Great successor and spiritual remake of Dungeon Keeper, down to the narrator V/O and core mechanics+ Expands on the formula by ading new minion types (with different mechanics rules), minion behaviors, and artifacts that add new abilities+ Looks great, feels just like a Dungeon Keeper game, and even sounds right, complete with the minion V/O you can hear from time to time.- Release jank, and lots of it. No doubt it'll get fixed, but as I'm playing this right as 1.0 has hit, its evident.- Performance and stability issues, from crashing on exit, to FPS slowdown when a lot of worker minions are spawned.- (AT RELEASE, will likely be fixed by the time you read this) No Skirmish or Multiplayer Lobby working yet, as they've had to remove them to fix showstopper bugs.- Sudden difficulty spikes that can run away from the player, particularly the Dwarven survival campaign mission.- Options menu feels a bit bare- ""Possession"" mechanic, whilst its in the game, feels just as janky as the original Dungeon Keeper one, complete with odd camera POV, lack of feedback on weapon swings, and when being damaged.

												The Dungeon Keeper has come....er, I mean the Underlord!Back in the day, I was a HUGGGEE fan of Dungeon Keeper, that game was my jam! When Dungeon Keeper 2 came out, I of course got it, played it, beat it (many times) and then after enjoying the end cinematic, I patiently yet excitedly waited for DK3!Well, long story short and of which I'm sure a few of you can relate, DK3 never came and turns out Bullfrog closed up shop and with each passing year, DK 3 became a pipe dream, but one I longed for.Many years later, I was on Steam and I saw War for the Overworld pop up and I did some reading about it. It was meant to be a spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper and even received endorsement from Peter Molyneux himself and they had even secured the original narrator from the DK series!Now, I had also played the game Dungeons by Kalypso, which was also created and meant to be a spritual successor to DK, but honestly that game sucked and I was massively let down, so when I saw this I was excited, but cautiously skeptical! I ended up purchasing it during early-access and at the time, I liked it a bit, but it wasn't so great, yet I could acknowlege that I knew it was only Early-Access and just to wait until release to render final judgment. I waited. I waited a very long time and it was starting to get to the point that I thought the devs had abandoned the game or something happened, I dunno, ya know those things happen with some early-access games and I was scared it was happening to this one.Anyways, I ended up ignoring it for some time, even after it officially released, but once I finally started playing it.......these developers.....they brought joy to the child in my soul, they did it, they nailed this on the head! THIS is what Dungeon Keeper is, they successfully harnessed the look, the feel, gameplay of Dungeon Keeper but at the same time, making the game feel unique enough to be something else entirely! I could not be any more satisfied and happy with this game, I waited many, many years for Dungeon Keeper 3 and while this game has a different title, it's more than good enough for me!10 out of 10, easily!

												Sure at release its only 95% there, but who cares. Its clear the effort and attention to detail thats gone into this, everything thats missing is coming soon and I believe them because they've delivered on everything thing else so far.I understand there can be financial difficulties for a small team to develop a game but they havenm't let anything like that effect the quality. The menu is a little buggy at the moment but as of 1.0.3 I'm not having any crashes and haven't encountered a noticable bug in game for the first 3 missions of the campaign. It really is a true to its roots remake which I'm really enjoying.I don't say this as a fanboy (or any other childish lable) for the devs but just stop complaining and give them a bit of time to polish it round the edges, its far more stable than anything Ubisoft or EA produce on release day and people flock to buy their half baked games. I have been burned by early access before, I made the mistake of backing Spacebase. Its uplifting to see a dev makes some promises and then really stick to them, and yes it took a while but all good things are worth waiting for. I haven't opened the game for at least 6 months and the improvements are phenomenal.I hope the shortsighted reviews of some impatient people/kids doesn't damage this games reputation. I know i'll be enjoying it anyway.			"

												(SUMMARY: Great potential, asshat launch. DO NOT BUY UNTILL ITS FINISHED)(Elaborate review)ITS ARRIVED and your super exited to finally be able to buy that brand spanking new car you've been practically drooling over for the past few years. You throw your money at the car dealer with such force you break the sound barrier, and you still manage to speed off in the car before his face is turned into Queen Elizabeth shaped paste. (Britfag)You have an amazing drive for 30 minutes until you notice the car has a few notches on the dashboard, then you realize the dashboard isn't the real dashboard its actually a spare part used as a ""placeholder"" until the real dashboard is installed. That doesn’t phase you though since your so stoked to finally be driving it after decades of waiting and your slam your foot on the accelerator to try and recapture your past memories of racing... promptly snapping it in half since the real accelerator is also still being manufactured. Wildly you skid into a brick wall but not before the car, almost seconds from collision, breaks down entirely. You wouldn't accept a half finished car, or a half filled coffee so why a half finnished game?_____________________________________________That’s basically the game for me, ages of waiting and being given this chunk of pleasing yet unfinished code bundle is tantamount to a slap in the face. LETS BE HONEST! if this was ANY OTHER game we would be outraged at paying full price for this.  If not for its reputation, the nostalgia of playing DK again and the travesty of EA we would be seeing negative reviews across the board, with possible 2/3 stars from those that only played the functional parts of the game. I could list hundreds more problems but I wouldn't have enough time left in the day and previous reviews detail them already. Dont get me wrong, i LOVED the game for the first few missions and put up with the unfinished mechanics and mood-killing placeholders but when teh campaign collapses and you find out that every other function of the game is also non-functional or gamebreakingly bugged, I start to think whether that 20 pounds was better spend on some quality alcohol for the night and WFTO left in the wishlist until further notice.

												[Version] v1.3One of the main reasons I purchased this is because I was a MAJOR fan of Dungeon Keeper back in the day. I loved the series and played it a lot as a kid and always remember it being one of my personal favorites.When I started playing this one; all of the memories came back and it was a great feeling. The ability to play a game that dated to my childhood, and for it to be updated with more stuff than what was available before; especially multiplayer. They did a good job of keeping to the way it was remembered back in DK 1 and 2, as well as adding some more unique features in that keeps it entertaining. The graphics received an over-haul, and it seems to perform alright on almost any modern machine  (I can also get decent FPS from my laptop if I close out everything else running - mind you the laptop runs 16GB DDR3 RAM w/ AMD graphics). It does get sluggish quite a bit as you build your dungeon, even on a pretty high-end desktop. Changing the graphics settings from Ultra down to normal or even low sometimes still doesn't fix the sluggish frame drops that you'll receive. The game needs more optimization which I hope they start focusing on.The music keeps to the theme, and the sound effects are great. The only sound I do miss, is the mistress that entered your dungeon from having the torture chamber (the crack of the whip and the mmmm lol). The original announcer is back, along with the funny jokes and commentary that anyone who played the DK series loved.I only wish that the multiplayer support was there a bit more. I attempted to search for an online game last night, and I found one server total which was a 1v1 match and was full, so I just went back and did a skirmish with the CPU. The community aspect could be a thousand times better, and right now it is almost next to impossible to get anyone else in an online match unless you are playing with a friend.Hopefully with more updates, this game becomes extremely popular. It is showing a lot of promise, and has great potential. Keep up the good work, and thanks for bringing me back to my childhood.Performance: 6/10Audio: 8/10Gameplay: 7/10Community / Multiplayer: 3/10Regards,RichardYouTube: IAMRichardT			"

												I'd just like to say - this game has exceeded expectations I had. I loved Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2 and this game does not disappoint. It's not simply a clone of those games but actually creates many new fantastic elements such as the beasts and the beast den. I love the amount of detail and effort that was obviously put into creating a convincing and thriving dungeon. It was so enjoyable to use the prison->torture chamber for conversions and use those converted minions against the enemy. It has been a while since I fully finished a Steam game's campaign but this is one I stuck around for!			"

												Although the game was an unplayable mess at its original release, War for the Overworld has become an impressive and fun successor to the Dungeon Keeper series after Patch 1.1.  It truly felt like I was playing the next logical step, or Dungeon Keeper 3, if you will.For those uneducated and/or unexperienced in the Dungeon Keeper series, War for the Overworld is a strategy game where you play as the Underlord, the master of a dungeon that you build from the ground up.  You dig out the earth surrounding your dungeon core and designate what the tiles that you have dug out are to be repurposed for.  Barracks, lairs, torture chambers, prison, sanctuaries, traps, and many, many other rooms are available, all of which have their own unique abilities that they add to your dungeon and most of which that bring in new creatures to serve you in crushing the competing underlords and those pesky human armies that seek to reclaim their land from you.All in all a great game and one that I highly recommend those fans who have been waiting years for a legitimate sequel to the Dungeon Keeper series.

The development team has been actively improving it.Heart of Gold made it even more fun to play. Being able to steal gold from your enemies, turning them into statues, and the sentinels are amazing. The voice actors are hilarious. Richard Ridings has the voice of the God, or rather the Devil. Fantastic job well done Brightrock!

												I bought my first boxed copy of Dungeon Keeper in 1997, so I've been waiting for this game for 20 years, and boy am I let down. Brightrock Games created some beautiful graphics, fun units, & hilarious voiceover... but managed to blow it all. They may be great artists, but damn they are inexperienced and inept level designers.  For starters this is a game that allows you to build and ""manage"" your own dungeon full of creatures and features. But the developers tie your hands in a way that you can't enjoy the game. Most levels aggro swarm you with an endless wave of enemies before you've had much if any time to prepare, there are timers and countdowns everywhere, and zero chance for exploration, creativity, or casual play. Basically the only way to beat many levels is watch a YouTube video, and copy some streamer's exact moves playing super fast, otherwise you will not have the cookie cutter level solution viable in time before you get swamped by enemies. It's really sad. The dungeon is full of some great graphics and funsy little things to check out, but if you get distracted or sidetracked for 15 whole seconds, then you will likely have to re-load your last saved game because now you are fatally delinquent against the impending spawn wave timer. There's just A LOT of game that has gone to waste because of the way the Lead Quest Designer set up all of the missions. TBH it's not even that fun after the first few levels, because you start to feel so rushed. I never get a chance to play around with new units because the mission timers are so short, and because they withhold most of the ""advanced units"" until late in the game. I think I'm on level 12 or 13 and still haven't even had a chance to create that Vampire unit I hear so much about. Perhaps by the time it is summonable, I will be on the last mission, and have about 1 second to actually play with it, in between endless swarms of enemies as I battle a ticking clock!... Lame. This re-iteration of the classic fails in allowing you to enjoy what I think made the originals great: the chance to completely get lost in your dungeon following minions around, tinkering with minor room features, and just plain getting lost in your thoughts as you immerse yourself into the dark ambience of your own personal dungeon.

												UPDATED 6/18/2015 v.1.1.5What comes in this $30 full release game:A 13 level campaign of varying stability.  I was forced to watch a boss lie prone in his room for three minutes with my camera slow panning around as the advisor and him took turns repeating the same lines and working their way down the queued up announcements.  Then I was defeated by his reinforcements while unable to act.  Stability will probably improve and developers have hinted at more campaigns in the future.9 two player maps, 2 three player maps, 9 four player maps for local skirmish and multiplayer usage.  Will almost certainly increase.Functional AI'sFunctional Multiplayer now.Graphics and UI is mostly functional and responsive now. Apparently some machines will use their integrated intel GPU instead of their better GPU when playing War for the Overworld, which requires system changes by the user to fix.  Unusual, but will probably be fixed.A long list of promised future content which gets shorter every time I check it.  I'm still curious as to what happened to a co-op campaign or playing as the light followers on release.  Perhaps these went the way of their original Dungeoneer build.  May be added later.War for the Overworld follows a similar formula to Dungeon Keeper and Dungeon Keeper 2 in being a god-mode (watch from above, unable to issue direct commands to your units) real time strategy game.  Build rooms to entice specific creatures and provide services for them and you by proxy, and then lead them on a dark crusade to do whatever it is your dark heart desires.Unlike its Dungeon Keeper compatriots, War for the Overworld takes a faster paced, Starcraft-like approach which focuses less on watching and catering to a small number of elite, well trained creatures and more on building and using the perks of a massive dungeon to amass large numbers of minions quickly.  Followers will blur together and become nondescript as dozens of them stampede around the dungeon, and there is little time or even reason to watch your underlings go about their business due to the constant necessity to always be expanding and building.  This is especially true since the maximum unit cap is extremely generous and imps (your workers) work at light speed.  Matches turn into a breakneck race to see who can build the most rooms with the most equipment to lure the most creatures in, which results in most of my play time being focused on issuing dig commands and building rooms instead of on the many other (often much less useful) tools they provide.I'm probably a little jaded due to the half baked release, but overall, War for the Overworld is decent but not quite good in its current state.  The game's pacing feels off, as most of my time playing is spent digging and building random rooms instead of enjoying whatever other charms War for the Overworld may have.  It will probably get better over time as the developers have expressed their devotion to improving the game and releasing new content, which may make it worth the price tag in the future.  War for the Overworld is worth buying for extremely hopeful fans of the genre who want to support this project or if it's on sale.			"

												This is not a worthy successor to the Dungeon Keeper franchise. The parts are all there, but they're either faulty or shoddily put together. Even if you're an RTS or Dungeon Keeper fan, ""War for the Overworld"" will be an exercise in frustration and annoyance.First and foremost, the game is lacking in terms of presenting the player with useful and sometimes necessary information. What can this creature do? How strong is that creature? What skill will they get and what do they do? What can the heroes do? Who knows? I certainly don't, because the game never bothers to tell you. I've played it for over 60 hours and have no idea of the relative power levels between creatures in the game. Not that you really need a balanced army or anything, but it'd be nice to know what your guys can or can't do. In Dungeon Keeper, you knew bugs were crap, bile demons were badass and that mistresses and vampires could wreck most things in 1v1. Here, I have zero clues what my gnarlings can take, what beasts are good or what the chunder actually does. No clue whatsoever. Just mass creatures and call to arms to their base, then hope for the best.In terms of the story itself, you've been relegated to the role of underling to the narrator, who's the main character of the game. He's the one interacting with the overlords and heroes of the game, he's the one telling you what to do and he's the one setting the agenda. You're just along for the ride. Now I know how my imps feel, always getting told exactly where to go and what to do. Maybe you can find enjoyment in that, and if so then this is the story for you, but I couldn't. I want to be the main character in the game I play.The game is horribly optimized, to the point where I can't tab out and back in without it grinding to a screeching halt and you need to restart. I've been able to play Starcraft 2 with the highest settings, skyping and having a browser up at the same time without performance issues. I've played Crusader Kings 2 grand campaigns with no real issue. I've played Grey Goo and Planetary Annihilation without it killing my computer, but War for the Overworld is slow and sluggish. It's incredibly slow and sluggish. You will also run into a lot of lag-related issues ingame, like the fog of war not dissolving when you explore, your creatures losing their focus and just standing around like idiots, creatures seemingly starting to teleport all over the map or even creatures starting to ghost (by which I mean they stand still and you can hover your mouse over them to see their info, but you can't interact with them because they're not really there, but the game just hasn't updated their location, so you're stuck with their ghost for a couple of seconds before the game eventually rectifies this). You're also going to see visual bugs, like creatures freezing mid-animation. You can also run into visual problems where the minimap doesn't load, where the UI doesn't load or where certain rooms and backgrounds won't load, so you're stuck with black nothingness in the middle of your dungeon.Lastly, the game starts to suffers from increasingly heavy UI lag, where you press a button and sometimes need to wait for a couple of seconds before it actually interacts. Sometimes you have to press a button three or four times before it actually gets pressed. In stressful situation, I don't need to tell you how annoying it can be to try and reposition your creatures whilst casting spells and fighting your own UI and the game's lag.The AI doesn't work. In Dungeon Keeper, you told your imps to do something and eventually they'd come around to finishing it. Not so much in War for the Overworld. Your imps will start a diggin task, stop and run to the other side of your dungeon, stop again, run to a random room and turn, run and chop once at a gold square, run back with the handful of gold, start reinforcing some random wall for a bit, then stop and run back to the original position and claim a square or two before going back to digging for a bit. It's beyond frustrating. At first I thought I just overloaded them with tasks, but no matter how little you give them to do, they won't ever do it faster or more efficiently. I tried maxing out the number of imps, but it made literally no difference. You keep your five original imps, but just ignore them and do everything yourself. It'll save you time and headache. This is a kiss of death for a dungeon building game, in my opinion.Imps are not the only ones with a severely lacking AI, though. Some creatures won't ever do what you tell them to, ever. Beastmasters will not train in your training room unless you stand over them and cast spells to force them. They won't fight in combat more than occationally, instead going to the back of the fight and walking around in circles. You will also have creatures that get so sleepy, hungry and are so greedy, that you will never see them do anything but beeline between their beds, the tavern and the pig pens, trying to satiate their desires.Sometimes, when the game slows down too much, the AI stops working altogether, and you will have to restart before fighting any battles. This is because your creatures won't actually fight, the AI can't use any skills in this state, but will opt to stand around, walk back and forth and sometimes losing and regaining the call to arms flag trigger.Finally, I need to bring up the one way you can control your creatures in this game when not standing on your own lands, the call to arms flag. Sometimes there will be areas in the game where your call to arms won't work. You place it like always and everything seems fine, but your creatures will suddenly lose interest and walk away. It's beyond frustrating.In conclusion, I recommend against getting this game. Don't buy War for the Overworld if you're a fan of Dungeon Keeper, because this is such a poor substitute you'll be pulling your hair in frustration. Don't buy it if it's on sale, it's not worth a dollar of your money. It's not fun. It's not challenging. It's buggy, it's simplistic and it's been done before and done better. The AI doesn't work, the UI is slow and unresponsive, the story is not even revolving around the player and you'll play the game from beginning til end without ever having to learn anything about it. Just go through the motions, call to arms in their base, rinse repeat. Do yourself a favour and play something else.			"

												Was debating pulling the trigger on this one for a long time and finally did so. I heard that the release was rough and so I gave it some time to get fixed but with the Doom wait wiping me out, I needed something new.In a nutshell, game is amazing if you enjoyed DK2. It's not perfect, but the devs are extremely active and dedicated even now and there is always new content and modes coming out. Plenty to do and see even now.If you can get around the downsides like mediocre ai, a few performance issues and one or two overtuned or frustrating missions, highly recommended.			"

Sometimes it just crashs. I guess if your PC is more powerful than mine this shouldn't be a problem.- Not enough different rooms for my taste (but that's what DLC is for)All in all I recommend the game, especially for DK fans.

								 After a a lot of time in beta stage, this game launched in a pretty good if unpolished state. A few bugs here and there and dodgy optimization from time to time where my game froze for a few moments before resuming normally.  If you want to wait for a bit before buying then it's understandable since there are a few buggs plaguing it but this game almost perfectly mirrors the Dungeon Keeper of old and since the devs have such love for the game then I and you should be sold.

												The whole point of the ""Dungeon Keeper"" genre is to have the time and dungeon space to build up sneaky traps and defences, and only then let the goodly heroes wander haplessly into your carefully constructed dungeon. Then you laugh as they fall to your devious trigger-trap combos. (remember those?)This game attacks you within seconds of the game starting, breaching your marshmallow-tough walls from all sides, ruining the whole point of the game.You can't build an effective dungeon because there isn't enough space and there are more holes than a swiss-cheese in the dungeon soil so you can't build rooms.It is not supposed to be a frantic click-fest!They have totally broken a game whose genre is all about designing traps and slow careful exploration.The other main game mechanic of ""Dungeon Keeper"" was creeping about, picking off enemy scouts without raising the alarm, and carefully expanding your dungeon without the goodly heroes ever noticing your progress until it was too late for them.This game mechanic has also been destroyed by WTFO, which is now all about the enemy AI attacking immediately, and heading straight for your dungeon heart in an endless torrent. Yes, they implemented the 1st person posession spell, but now there is no reason to have it as there is no sneaking about to do.I even waited until they got as far as Ver 1.3 to let all the bugs get ironed out, but that was a mistake too. It is still very buggy.The devs have spent way too much time upgrading the graphics of Dungeon Keeper, whilst missing the whole point of what the game is supposed to be. As a result it is very pretty, dialogue is great, and yet the easy-bit, the gameplay, is totally absent.I didn't want a shoot-em-up game, I wanted a dungeon-design game and I feel ripped-off.Don't waste your money.

												TLDR: It isn't ready. It feels like it still in early access or in early beta. Needs to be patched and updated for a more polished product before I can recommend this for purchase.While I have played the game for a few hours now (only the campaign mode), I can say I am not sure what I have played. The UI just feels like a mess to sort through and the mouse button feels floaty and out of place. Missing text or substitute names (like ""Prop: Tree 101""...not a direct example) for most objects in the game. AI seems to be functional is some places and missing in others. Goblin workers run in place sometimes, priorities of what you want the workers to do seems random, and even most minions (to include the NPC enemy's units) can walk on liquid surfaces like Jesus. Now there are some creatures that can bypass liquid areas with float/fly and that makes sense, but I don't think a dwarf or soldier in heavy armor has the ability to do that. There seems to be alot of information missing for the player as well. The tutorial will say certain rooms to need to be 3x3 or etc to function, but never show or remind you later when hovering over a room to build. More lack of information comes from how much food or gold is needed for their upkeep. It also doesn't tell how many units your dungeon can hold or build or even how long it takes to build said units. For instance, I built 100,000 gold worth of room called Beast Den. It does not require much space and I built it above recommended specs. In terms 100,000 gold for one room is quite a lot, but I am not what benefit, if any at all, that gave me. (To note I did build the structure over multiple areas, but still above recommended specs in each place). It seemed the creatures didn't become more powerful or spawn more frequently. They would just spawn a guy every minute or so and thats all I could really tell you. Even if I spent a more reasonable 5000-7500 gold, it seemed it was the same spawn rate and same amount of creatures given. It just doesn't make sense to me...and that is the common theme in the game.Nothing makes sense there is such a lack of communication of information from the game to the player. And when the game tries to relay information it seems to be done poorly. Nothing about this title suggests to me its polished or ready to sell as is. I remember launch being a month ago and I waited for patches and etc. The same bugs and lack of polish can still be found today.For all those applauding this game for being a great example for how early access games should be released, I think you should do a double take and remove your rose tinted glasses for a new Dungeon Keeper title.The game isn't ready for sale and needs more polish. It is a shame that they released it in such a poor state as I haven't covered the still missing features like skirmish mode. I hope this doesn't turn out to be another cash grab early access game where development is abandoned later.  "

Lengthy and varied campaign mode for single player experience.  It's Dungeon Keeper.Pros: It's Dungeon Keeper.  Also, no microtransactions.Cons: Emulates its source material a bit too well.  Units are still guided more than controlled directly.  Targetting specific units in a horde can get tricky.Recommended to: Fans of Dungeon Keeper.  RTS fans who enjoy the base building more than the combat.  Gamers who enjoy city/town development games looking for something a bit darker and more dangerous.			"

Early Access Review
								Being an alpha it is rough around the edges and expect bugs/force closes, though the game has a lot potential to be as big (or even bigger) than the previous Dungeon Keeper games from the legendary Bullfrog Productions (who also did Theme Park and Theme Hospital). Which the War For The Overworld is a spirtual successor to because of Bullfrog's closure and EA's acquisition of the rights to the Dungeon Keeper name and franchise.For all the games in an alpha/beta/pre-alpha state that I am backing currently (about 7 titles, 5 of which are in Steam's Early Access section including WTFO) this is the one I am most excited about and despite the fact there have only been 2 alpha releases out so far in the ""Bedrock Beta"", I am happy with the work so far.If you are unsure about the game is and what it aims to do, try Dungeon Keeper/Dungeon Keeper 2 because what have I have played so far is almost a vertabim copy of the gameplay and themes from those games (which is a good thing) varying only in monsters, textures, music and names of different rooms and objects.The Kickstarter showed a lot of promise (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/subterraneangames/war-for-the-overworld) and I really regret not backing it, but I am happy with the progress being made so far. In only 2 builds we have 2 maps, 4 of the core rooms, 2 spells and  working which is pretty impressive so far. The developers are very commited and every Wednesday post new content on their dev blog about how the game is progressing. Lastly, if you want to buy this game get it from the official site (https://wftogame.com/preorder.html) using the Humble Store widget (from Humble Bundle) by doing this you get a cheaper price, the developers have a bigger cut of the transaction (PayPal are meant to have the lowest transaction fee) and you get a DRM-free download from Humble Bundle on release.

												Dungeon Keeper was one of my favourite RTS games ever when I was younger. It was so unique, and the gameplay of building your own dungeon and filling it with minions and traps was ever addicting. A third Dungeon Keeper was never released, but for all intents and purposes, War for the Overworld is the Dungeon Keeper 3 we were all waiting for. With some new rooms, new minions and new features, it feels like a true successor to Dungeon Keeper that only improves on the flaws of the older games. And it even has online multiplayer!!For those who have no idea what I'm talking about, War for the Overworld is really fun blend of dungeon management sim with real-time strategy, and it makes for some insane fun, especially if you're looking for something a little different from your standard RTS faire. Come get the game and play with me! I don't have enough friends to play this awesome game with.			"

												As an Early Access title, the game seemed very cool... As 1.0 release, it fails. * No keybinds (ever heard of an RTS without keybinds?)* mob AI is buggy. they get lost, stuck against walls, ignore flags, etc* massive memory leaks, which cause the game to seize up after about an hour. * Multiplayer and Skirmish mode broken on release day. This game needs another 3 months in beta testing at least, then it could be absolutely glorious. The 1.0 version is decent for alpha release, but it SUCKS as a release. Remember the NES console games? when you shipped out ROM's, ie, no updates possible?   That's how good a 1.0 release should be.			"

												I have to say I am very pleased with the evolution of this game.  Being a huge fan of The bullfrog's Dungeon Keeper series led me to purchase WFTO.  Knowing that this game was unfinished when I bought it led me to have some early reservations as I have been burned before on other unfinished games.  But the crew that developed this game has been extremely professional and has an ear to the ground for consumer complaints.  They have been very good at fixing and polishing their product which I have to say is a breath of fresh air in an industry that has turned from making great games to churning out substandard content in order to make money and decrease risks.  I hope they continue on the path they are on and look forward to seeing what they come up with in the future.  I believe that this game is one of the best in its genre which is saying a lot seeing as these type of games are dying out.  Big name developers watch out for these guys.  They are doing it right, and they didn't charge an arm and a leg to do it.			"

There are some bugs, but i have played a couple skirmishes, and some of the campaign. I haven't come accross anything game breaking yet. DK fans will find this to be a worthy new DK with a bit of a fresh spin to the old gameplay, compared to the abomination's of the phone dungeon keeper (EA you screwed yourself on DK fans for that one) and also Dungeons (biggest dissapointment I have ever bought) War for the overworld definitely has potential, it just needs some more polish which I am sure will come in the near future.

												WftO is a true spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper series (don't confuse with Dungeon Keeper for mobiles) - it superbly reproduces best and most notable qualities of both DK & DK2 and enriches them with things we've missed in both original games - freedom of choice of how things should be done. Switching from previous installments to WftO is seemless and seem to be natural, as nothing UI-wise is dramatically changed.Now, I know that it's not just yet finished and far away from finished (especially when it comes to multiplayer part), but for the price it offers just enough to keep it playing.Also, I get a huge boner from Richard Ridings mentor vocals every time I run the game.

												I REALLY wanted this to be good... sadly, I was hugely dissapointed.This is DK2's stupid, violent little brother... not the successor to Dungen Keeper 2. The maps have almost zero creativity. Most of the time you can not even build a chain of rooms without indestructable blocks stopping you from setting up a decent functioning base. The beauty of DK2 was the gameplay. Building you base, levelling your minions, gently probing the defenses of your enemy and  destroying your enemy a piece at a time. This game has NONE of that! It has next to no tactics or strategy involved. It plays the same way every time...Build some rooms... defend, defend...Zerg. Build rooms... defend, defend... Zerg.  The gameplay has all the subtly of a runaway train. The voice acting is great, but it VERY quickly becomes annoying to the point of frustration at the constant yelling at you. Because all the game does is send enemy units to attack you, in every scenario... and almost constantly.  I purchased this on sale... and am SO glad I did not pay full price. Even so, I still feel ripped off.			"

Early Access Review
								War of the Overworld is basically Dungeon Keeper 3 (except the people who originally made it stopped at 2)Personally, I loved the Dungeon Keeper series and was sad to see it die. However, I am now very heartened by the Beta of WOTO. It's basically Dungeon Keeper, only so much better. There are about a dozen room types, which I have yet to get to grasp with, as well as an impressive selection of spells that do everything from reveal parts of the map to freezing the ground. What I also love is the voice acting is very similar to Dungeon Keeper. The guy who does the Keeper sounds appropriately evil and the heroes sound equally pius, making it so much more satisfying when you kill them.. =)However, the game is still a Beta. There is a tutorial, which explains the basics (there really needs to be an advanced tutorial as well) also, I found it hard to find the flashing tiles on some of the tutorial actions. Perhaps if you centered the screen over the tiles as the event triggers, this would be easier.There are only 2 maps, however, there is a sandbox mode, which I look forward to exploring. Unfortunately, it crashed at the climax of my first game, however, that may be due to my OS.Anyway, as long as the developers get this thing to full version, it will be freaking awesome. Given that all of the room design seems to be done (although I have yet to fully observe what all the creatures do and thier various states) making the maps should be pretty easy.Oh, there is one thing that distinguishes it from Dungeon Keeper, there is no hilarious CG cutscene at the beginning.I would like to vote for one, if possible.. =)I would give it an 8/10 and it's only a Beta.. I can't wait for the full version.			"

												I've written two reviews, one bad over the bugs and glitches, after a few days when they fixed many bugs I deleted that and wrote a good one. I removed them both for this one.I am completely and utterly enraged by how the story develops and ends and even if there will be a DLC to twist the plot somehow, this is utterly inexcusable.This of course is accompanied by my struggle (yes, struggle) against the game-breaking bugs, memory leaks, crashes, freezes, save-corruption and many others.SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERTRight, so by mission 10 or 11 you are starting to realize that the disembodied voice is not your helper, but rather your master, as opposed to being a tyrant, you're just an executive clerk doing whatever your strong and powerful masturr is telling you to do.This is reflected by the fact he repeatedly tells jokes ""If your minions ask for your superior, tell them I'm taking a nap."", by the fact he apparently ""controls the aether"" hence controls you, by Mira saying you're his tool and by him calling you ""My Underlord"", as if a pawn of his. And, by mission 13's outro, which will be elaborated further next. Unlike the intro video sequence where you might mistake to think he found your presence and revived it, he is in fact your master.Alright, that is a bit crappy - but not story-breaking for me.Oh, but then comes mission 13. The final mission. You besiege and break through the last hero compound in order to butcher the emperor himself. Pretty neat mission, 3-4 optional objectives - a bit of a droll but wrapping things up knowing the world is pretty much doomed by your hand and will be ripe for the taking by you makes it worthwhile.You breach the inner chamber, kill off the emperor's guards and the emperor, but then MAJIQ! his corpse disappears and then proceeding sequence loads you into your home realm, your main core, where the wretched scum just pops out of nowhere while that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Mendechaus (w/e his name) says how he found a new pawn and how you're no longer of use to him and that sort of generic crap, then you die.tl;dr Game over.No conquest, no ""cliffhanger"" for an upcoming campaign in the overworld, no outro depicting how terror and misery have struck the goodlies. Not even a chance to fight. Just sit there and watch how the pompous moron just kills you and tyvm for playing. How your campaign ends with a defeaning silence of helplessness. That's the antithesis of being a Dungeon Keeper/Underlord.I've fought against game-breaking bugs, I've triumphed terribly long loading-screens and save-destroying bugs (wall tiles changing nonstop causing FPS to drop to 5 on a mission vs 3 enemy Underlords)... This is the last straw. This game has the mechanics of its spiritual father, Dungeon Keeper, but not the essence. Maybe multiplayer fans will rejoice in this, but in that case, GL waiting a couple of months until that function will be released properly.I've uninstalled this game and hopefully this review will be noticed so other people won't feel cheated like I do.edit: spelling			"

												I wrote a bad review of this a year back. After coming back to give it another shot I'm going to write a sort-of good one.Firstly, they've fixed a lot of the issues I had back then (UI issues like the call to arms dot being a tiny thing that was hard to click on, total lack of useful mouseover information, massive glitches)Secondly as I got further into it I started to appreciate the thought that has gone into it. And particularly the new mechanics that weren't in the original dungeon keeper. A lot of them make sense when considered, like seperating the DK1 horned reaper ""strong creature thats hard to keep happy"" and DK2 horned reaper ""endgame summon monster"" into two seperate monsters, the vampire and titans. Or giving a means to assign creatures to the peaceband, so they work instead dropping everything to following the call to arms spell. Smart.(Tip for anyone coming from DK1 and 2: Dont try to build 5 x 5 rooms immediately like you used to be able to in that game. Theres so many rooms and less space to build them in so its worth planning what you need for the level and starting with a 3x3.Also I highly ecommend you slow down the game speed, which is a stock option thankfully.)But it still has one MAJOR issue though, the difficulty curve. You're either storming though the level fairly easily or you're hitting a brick wall (level 4 with its unending waves smacks you out of nowhere after a fairly easy first few levels) it really lacks the twists and surprises that Bullfrog designed levels had. Pretty much every level has an infinite gold seam, so once you find that, you dont have to budget anymore. Plus you have the option of gold potions, turning your enemies to gold, a spell that literally just gives you gold for temporarily mana etc. Its too many get out of jail free cards. Again in the old bullfrog games they werent afraid to occasionally lock you out of some of your abilities, to force you to change strategy. Maintaining a dungeon is really easy since creatures dont fight internally anymore, not even converted hero units. I dont think I ever once had creatures complaining about food even with a 3x3 pig farm feeding a massive dungeon. Lava only seems to sort-of burn creatures, and plenty of them just dont care anyway. I got the stone bridge well before ""how do I cross this lava"" ever even became a problem I'd thought about solving.DK1 and 2 you could NEVER rebuild earth. So once it was mined you were exposed for good. Here you get a spell to do that easily. See where I'm going with this? The game gives you a bunch of abilities, maybe too many abilities, but rarely tests your brain with them. The two suddenly-actual-difficult levels where I had to actually think and strategise were the ones I enjoyed the most.It adds up to a fun DK flavoured novelty, but one without an engaging challenge. If steam had that option I'd give it half a thumbs up.			"

												These developers earned my trust.They did everything they promised during kickstarter, they are quick to fix issues and 2 years later they are still actively developing the game.I love to see a game such as Dungeon Kepper 2 made with contemporary technology.A must if you loved DK2 or DK1			"

												Day 1 patches addressed the issues I had progressing through the campaign. It was definitely a mistake not to release more of the campaign into early access so it could be properly tested, but they addressed it in a timely manner. Remaining issues are just nitpicky and it's a solid game at its core, closest thing to Dungeon Keeper anyone's put out in well over a decade - and the team behind it is really passionate about the project, which gives me a confidence I don't find in many games released in an unpolished state that it will actually be fixed up right, and have free content updates piled on to make up for the shaky release.

												So to start, I am a HUGE fan of the original Dungeon Keeper's and still play them today, yes nearly 20 years later I still play DK. You could even go as far as calling me a fanboy of DK, as I LOVE it. I miss Bullfrog, Damn you EA.So with slight trepidation I purchased War For The Overworld. And all I can say is WOW. This game could easily be a successor to DK2. It stays true to the Dungeon Keeper theme, Minions, Heroes, Traps and Doors, Spell's and all the rest of it too. Literally. It also has some nice additions.The Music feels just like it should, the atmosphere of the dungeons feel like it should, its just awesome, awesome and, did I say AWESOME.War for the Overworld in my opinion is a superb game and easily qualifies as DK3. I simply can not recommend this game enough.			"

												War for the Overworld serves as the spiritual successor to Bullfrog's old classic Dungeon Keeper 2. It features plenty of the relic's features, while introducing plenty of new ones to keep it fresh and interesting. However, the game do not feel complete. It spent plenty of time in Early Access in a beta phase, letting people play and help the developers find bugs and issues. Between the crashes, lag spikes, odd resolution choices (like no 1280x720 for example) and memory leaks, War for the Overworld could have used a few more months in the Early Access cooker to iron out some more issues.All in all, in the state that game currently is in, I am not going to recommend this game.Sorry, Subterrainean Games, but if you raise an old DK2 veterans hopes and end up releasing a bug riddled mess as a ""finished game"", you are going to end up with negative feedback.

You can see from all the negative reviews having the devs wanting to know more about the bugs so they can fix them, and this is CONSISTENT and QUICK.

												Have supported this game since early access, and its amazing how far its come.Pros:> A true spiritual successor to the dungeon management games of yore> Interesting rooms and features totally unique to this game add a ton of complexity.> Skill tree progression is really good.> Plenty of unique minions!> Lovely graphics> Developers are incredibly open, honest and dedicated> A ton of updates since launchCons:> Needs a few more weeks in the cooking pot before it can be considered a finished game, with multiplayer and skirmish features working properly. However, the developers are actively addressing issues and personally I'd rather see the game release not quite finished than get cancelled due to lack of funding.> The posession system needs a lot of work right now, hope that this is addressed down the line.

												Summary (TL;DR):+ True to the original Dungeon Keeper recipe+ Fantastic graphics, sound and animations+ Additional mechanics are fun, but feel natural to the genre+ Challenging and rewarding gameplay+ Return of an old familiar friend (the mentor from DK)+ Frequent updates from an invested developer- Minions lack style and personality- Minor bugs, however, not game-breakingI was a huge fan and hold many fond memories of the original Bullfrog Dungeon Keeper games, so seeing a ""spiritual successor"" to them made me raise an eyebrow. As many may already know, a handful of developers have tried to recreate the magic that Bullfrog crammed into the DK franchise.. they all failed miserably. However, these guys, swearing fealty to the original successful formula had a crack at making a worthy successor, and by god, they made it better.What they have created is a maleficent and joyous game which remains true to the style of the DK franchise, however, with the addition of a couple of other game mechanics and room types. What is surprising in this case is how natural the game mechanics fit, the developers have clearly given a lot of thought into exactly how these extra mechanics can fit without disrupting the experience or alienating old players of the DK franchise. As a result, the additions make it stand out on its own as its own game and not some mere clone of DK2.The game itself is beautiful to look at and smooth to play, hearing the return of the old DK mentor was a nostalgic and welcomed addition. However, if I was to be picky, I would criticise that some of the minions just do not have the charm, style, nor variation that the DK franchise had. Additionally, the minion character models seem to be of a lower quality than the rest of the game, whether this was done for optimisation, I'm not sure, but I did hope for better.Many others have reviewed that the game has many bugs, I would partly concur with this. While the game does have a few bugs, I found that none were game-stopping bugs, just very minor niggles such as menu responsiveness. I take my hats off to the developers who have seemed to be updating the build like crazy trying to iron out some of the issues (we've had 2 patches in 24 hours of official launch at the time of writing).Would I recommend? Yes, definitely. If you are a seasoned DK player eager to find a game that fills that evil chasm in your heart, or a casual player looking for a fun yet challenging strategy game, I would wholeheartedly recommend this War for the Overworld.Developers, if you happen to read this, two words I'd like to say: ""Good job!""

												I'm not a professional reviewer, but I wanted to add a positive review to this game (to help you with your buying decision, and to support the devs)...I've been looking for a Dungeon Keeper replacement for years (and so have a lot of people, clearly). Its one of the only games I've taken off work to go play :)At first, in my search, I came across SpaceBase DF 9, which the developer (Doublefine - not the maker of this game) decided to abandon to make another game, effectively cheating us out of our money... Then there was Maia, which there is still hope for - but it seems to be dwindling...War For The Overworld launched quite buggy, but launched after the above-mentioned titles. I had performance issues (they're all gone) and some game-breaking bugs (had to restart the campaign a couple of times - simply because the end of a mission couldn't be triggerred anymore; everything works perfectly now).Subterranean Games really came through... Not only does War For The Overworld capture that old Dungeon Keeper atmosphere, it nails the gameplay WITH positive additions - and I personally respect the after-purchase patching support to improve the game. These guys are obviously passionate about what they made, and they are working hard, even after release...In short: If you're looking for that old Dungeon Keeper vibe, with new additions that actually improve on it... BUY THIS GAME :)(and like a previous reviewer mentioned, throw in a tip if you can - let's support the good guys for a change)			"

								Everyone saying this will replace dungeon keeper just because of some similarities.. or to get rid of them and make way for this just because you've played the others over and over. YOU'RE WRONG! Yes this is a great game in its own respect and i do really like it but it's far from any replacement or will ever get as much playtime by me. If you think that well it's all on opinion anyway, I can always replay dungeon keeper and Keeperfx for those who know what that is.This game is also more like dungeon keeper 2 rather than dungeon keeper which by my personal experience and preferance I always favoured the original on just about every level of things that can be judged, yes the graphics were maybe slightly better in an arguement but again my personal opinion was  that I liked the original better.Anyway back to it, war for the overworld is a great game in its own respect and i would say is worth the money to anyone willing to find a good strong dungeon management strategy game to fill that gap on their stack of games. The graphics are great and in general it has a nice look about it, can be a little confusing to start off with but should be quick to pick up with many things to help you learn as you play. At its current state they have a few playable feautures and such in game but no solid set down campaign yet as that'll be one of the last updates released, some of the updates may be slow and not seem to do much but each is always improving the game and pushing it closer to its end goal. If not to buy the game now then it'd be good to add to wish list or keep an eye on for when this game hits full release, For sure it's going to be a hit if not already.War for the overworld is not dungeon keeper. War for the overworld is a new start for a new game by new people for the people.			"

												Though it is said that this game is not finished, thoughs people would in some sense be right yes WFTO is still being worked on. HOWEVER i've not seen a team work quite so hard in patching and dishing out new content AND keeping the overlords up to date with the goings on in the void. I can see great things from this game and is a pretty good remake in short and you'd be a fool to miss out! All i can really say is i wish there was more depth in the look and feel of your dungeon. I'd like to see more minions working in different rooms and the rooms be more interactive and have more decorum. I want to see fallen foes looted and their goods sold to others for money in a black market room and the like! All in all they are off to a good start but i'm feeling more Bad than a pure evil Overlord from the dark planes of the void hell bent on power and killing all before me, let them be hero or otherwise!

												After Dungeon Keeper II, this is a real disappointment.  It's poorly designed as a strategy game.  Due to ridiculously short timers, you are expected to build an army to crush a fully organized enemy (or three) while defending yourself from a constant onslaught, with minimal resources and starting from nothing.  There is close to zero dungeon management aspect to it, because you have neither the time nor resources to build your rooms, train your creatures, or research spells.  Atmospherically, it feels a bit like DK2, but redesigned for a higher end platform by someone with no understanding of strategy or dungeon management.  As a result, it's an experience the hyperactive will enjoy, but the thoughtful will find sufficiently frustrating to delete.			"

												Dungeon Keeper was a fantastic game and I applaud WFTO for picking up the gauntlet that had been discarded for far too long.The game is what you make of it. Dont expect to be fed Blizzard/Square Enix/EA, boundary pushing extravaganzas.This is a game made by serious fans of the genre for the enjoyment of everyone.What's even more commendable is that it is still evolving and being expanded into something more feature rich and polished. The developer has demonstrated a dedication to WFTO and listens to the community.So yes it does require a few more tweaks to some features, but these minor details dont outweigh what is already there to be enjoyed. I will be clocking up many more hours and building many more dungeons. "

It's still (as of 6 April) pretty buggy, the doors, shrines, traps, etc don't have any hover descriptions (it shows Prop ID's, but no real description of what you're looking at), there are a fair number of visual glitches, and overall the game really feels unfinished. I knew it was going to be like that at the start so it doesn't really bother me, but it's something to keep in mind before you go to buy it.			"

												I held off getting this game for awhile because I figured it was another cheap Dungeon Keeper knockoff. Now that I've played it I can definitely say that it's a worthy successor to DK2. More than just a graphical upgrade, with the addition of quality of life improvements like Warbands and Impasses, useful spells like Replacement Earth, and new mechanics like rituals, alchemy, and titans, War for the Overworld is actually a nice improvement over the Dungeon Keeper games, pretty much fixing all the things that were annoying or hard to manage while still adding new complexities and strategies. Skirmish mode and multiplayer make a welcome return as well.Some people report that the game is buggy, but I have only run into a couple small glitches, mostly in the form of minion animations that don't look quite right.

												Always been a fan of Dungeon Keeper and I have high hopes still this game will deliver once the developers have gotten over their initial launch.  I think a lot of people are under the impression this game is ready to play right now but in reality this is still a solid work in progress so you should expect to face some problems.Outside of the launch issues there are some gameplays critiques.  The AI is not the most intelligent, generally i found it easy to fool or work out what triggered a certian event to progress a level forward so i had more time to build up an unbeatable force.  In end i managed to complete the game in less than a day without too much effort.  So sadly i got a bit bored of this by time i reached end, seemed all too repeatative.In comparison to the oringal DK games however I think they have got the interface and general balance of characters down to a tee.  The traps and potential options on dungeon layouts etc make it more interesting than it has been before.I reckon the multiplayer will be real key to this games success, if the can get that right then this will boom, but sadly i would be concerned that they will be able to address enough of the current performance issues before interest is lost and then who would be left to play multiplyer anyway?All round i think its a fun game and really enjoyed strolling down memory lane, but if i was new to this game id be highly frustrated by no wand probably thrown it out the window and never looked back.  Lets hope new gamers can be patient enough to see this game be the success it deserves.			"

In coming months they will add further function, as well as an amazing array of content.Do you like silly remarks from your disembodied advisor voices? Then you're in for a treat.

The veins of evil sucks, as it has no depth to it in the slightest. Even tho its the same dude narrating, the scripting just doesn't feel as naturally evil as the DK series.some really good ideas here, but none of them fleshed out or polished at all. People will say its because of small dev team blah blah, but i play and have played a lot of path of exile, GGG prove that you can be small and still be good at juggling business with craft.Looks ok, plays ok, but i wanted so much more from this than a DK wanna be :(stick to the originals			"

												Unlike most of the reviewers for this game, I am not a frothing Dungeon Keeper fan, so I have reviewed this one simply as fan of RTS games.  Because all I have at stake is the game's technical execution and replay value rather than a holdover chubby from 1999, I cannot recommend War for the Overworld unless you get a massive discount.  This isn't to say I didn't have some fun with it.  The game is a hodgepodge of things that have been lovingly crafted, mixed with bizarre design choices and bugs that make it hard to believe only one team worked on it.  The story mode is lengthy, and  I never finished the expansion because the game has an absolutely **itty ending that left a bad taste in my mouth.  You have to understand this game has basically zero chill and loves to throw you at the wolves as soon as possible, and for all that work the ending is garbage.  They could have addressed it in the Heart of Gold DLC, but instead they had you play a completely different (though thematically appopriate) underlord.  The UI was alright in a functional sense, though if it was possible to switch tabs using hotkeys, the game gave no indication of it.  However, I feel inclined to point out that it lags terribly as a result of some past ""upgrade.""  AI pathing is functional, at best.  Your minions have no problems roaming to different areas of your base to meet their needs, but they also have a wide aggro.  Frequently I found the odd minion engaging in battle in some other part of the map (not the roaming fliers) when they were supposed to be at home.  They also didn't seem to have problems walking through lava in later levels, damaging their own health in the process when there was a perfectly good bridge nearby.  Sloppy.  Workers deserve a special shoutout.  When not digging out areas you designate or mining gold deposits, there's an array of automated tasks they will engage.  The problem is this process is not bug free.  They typically claim every tile they can, including enemy tiles much to their own detriment, but sometimes they also get ""hung up"" on certain tasks.  I once found all my workers dancing back and forth over a single tile like a bunch of idiots because they couldn't figure out how to claim it.  Other times my crypts were full of dead bodies, and my workers got caught up in picking up dead enemies - and setting them back down again, repeating ad infinitum.  The worker rally flags also do NOTHING when they're stuck like this.  For a game that tried to automate a lot of basic tasks, there's a painful amount of babysitting these little ♥♥♥♥♥.   ""Controlling"" your units is done via rally flags.  There's a special peace flag to keep certain units from responding to the rally flag calls, and later on when you'll want somebody at home to keep torturing prisoners or making trap parts, you'll have to manually place them under this flag.  Certain other groups get their own flags, like Titans, beasts, or summoned undead.  You can make more warbands if you like with their own flags, but truthfully the game just doesn't need that much micromanagment.  While you can place the flag on specific enemies to prioritize targets, your troops will generally ignore all enemies on the way TO the flag, which means if you want to be smart you have to obsessively place and re-place the damned things for optimal combat.  Population control is a mystery.  No, really.  Building your base is essentially setting up work areas for specific types of units, who will show up using an algorithm that is never explained to you.  In theory, the capacity for each work area should determine how many of that unit you get, but it never works out that way. One bug that really stood out to me was technically the last story mission.  The enemy sits inside a magical barrier, which you can do a ritual to remove for thirty seconds.  The enemy is supposed to send waves at you, but he can't pass through the barrier either.  I played for thirty or forty minutes, wiping out side objectives, wondering why everything was so quiet.  When I finally dropped the barrier to attack the main base, a flood of enemy troops ignored ALL of mine, who had been instructed to go into the base and were thus trapped inside when the barrier went back up, and they marched straight to my dungeon core and destroyed it.  I eventually solved the problem by overbuilding, but I really shouldn't have had to do that. I found the banter of the units (and prisoners) entertaining.  The narrator, Richard Ridings, has a voice you never get tired of.  The units and environment had lots of visual details - though the whole game hogs resources so badly your computer will lag for a few minutes even after the game is closed. I did have some fun - really.  But the broad and sweeping nature of the flag system for unit control, along with the bugs and various imbalances (I cleared the toughest map by throwing down disposable and temporary Frost Weavers and having my workers simply take all the enemy's stuff) really minimize the replay and strategic value, and those are two cardinal sins for an RTS game.  Unless you're a Dungeon Keeper fan, pay 15 dollars for the lot of it and not a penny more.*** Special edit to respond to the developer *** Hey Noontide (Lee),The fact that it's an indie game surprised me, because I thought the quality was rather high for such a thing. :)  My comment about there seemingly being different teams was mostly about consistency.  Some things were so well-done, and some... were not.  The wandering minions thing happened frequently.  I think it had something to do with the layout of the base, and they were simply latching on to enemies far from the dungeon core.  I don't really have any other explanation for it.  I did know about the Impasse flags for the workers, and I didn't use them.  I might say it'd be simpler to not have workers claim every tile they can automatically, to make it a manual process instead, but really your solution was just as simple as mine, if not simpler.  The workers who were stuck on one tile were eventually dispersed by clearing an adjacent un-mined wall tile.  Them obsessively fussing over bodies when crypts or prisons were full however was only solved by creating more of one or the other, and that's a pretty serious bug.  The problem with obsessively placing and re-placing rally flags due to a lack of an ""attack move"" mostly is that it's a type of busywork.  Simple deletion of the flags does not make troops head back to base.  MANY times I found my minions whacking away at enemy doors and such instead of coming home, sometimes further engaging battles until their deaths.  Conceivably, to fix that, I would have to place a rally flag inside my base to get them to ignore everything.  Overall it's a little cumbersome.  Perhaps attack-move should be a separate flag?The population tool-tips explain a lot.  Some of it sounds esoteric, but most of it sounds interesting.  However, being unable to determine the population or composition of the army makes implementing specific strategies unnecessarily difficult by a wide margin.  At this stage you simply have to hope you have enough units, and hope you have enough of the right type to counter the enemy.  Given that it's almost an RNG formula for your army, the relationships between armies are impossible to examine.  Things do seem to pan out anyway, and that's part of the problem.  You just sort of build and hope for the best, which isn't enough meat on the bone for any strategist, and ultimately resulted in the thumbs down.  Having said all that, I wish your team the best of luck, you have a decent little gem here and I hope you continue to improve it. :)			"

												Really fun! I didn't really play the original dungeon keeper games, I think I was too young to appreciate them, but I really enjoy this a lot! It does indeed seem like it should still be early access, there are plenty of bugs and the tooltips don't really explain what everything does.The campaign does slowly introduce you to new features and mechanics, but if you stop playing for a while, then go back to it and forget, you are left to Google how everything works because not every thing is intuitive and there's nothing to help you in game.This is more of a 'god' type RTS (like Black & White) where you don't have to micromanage every little thing your units do. Just provide them with what they need, give them basic orders from time to time and they are kind of self sustaining. My kind of RTS! :)			"

								This game brings me back to Dungeon Keeper. Ah, how I loved those games. I was so excited to see that War for the Overlord is a game using not only the same mechanics, but even Richard Ridings, who's voice is like liquid sex evil. There are a few things I disllike, but it's based in on the fact that the game is still in Beta. There's not really a storyline developed for play yet. There's no multiplayer (Comming Soon™). The few maps that you cna play are really limited in resources.I know these things will get developed and ironed out as work is continued. It is that hope coupled by the warm and evil feelings of nostalgia that led me to buy this game. Don;t worry if you haven;t played Dungeon Keeper 1 and/or 2. It's really not necessary. But I can promise you, when this game reaches it's full potential, I believe it will outshine those other dungeon management games. "

												Genre - Fantasy Dungeon Management/RTSI played the original 'Dungeon Keeper' and add on pack to the end back in the day, enjoying them greatly. I bought a game called 'Dungeons' on Steam a few years ago and was dissappointed. It played more like 'the Sims - Dungeon Keeper'. When I saw this game was out and saw a high proportion of negative reviews I had low expectations. However, with a 10% discount and free DLC and some positive reviews I gave them my money and booted it up, with fingers crossed. Oh I am so glad I did!This is the Dungeon Keeper clone we have been waiting for. It stays true to the original game whilst adding enough new stuff to keep it fresh. Also this is just an early build with active work taking place, but it still plays great. The game mechanics work here and I didn't realise how important the RTS element was, making the game more competitive and challenging. True you don't really design a dungeon for adventurers to explore (Sword Coast: Legends will allow you to do this I am sure). You are basically an evil master who encourages minions and sets the hordes against your foes, sometimes stubborn Dwarves and other times your similar skilled brethren. The game plays at a fast enough pace so you don't get bored. I have already gone back to previous campaign missions to chase missing achievements as they are all so much fun. I still have the final two campaign levels to go, and am looking forward to my free DLCIf you are a retro gamer who enjoyed Dungeon Keeper you should like this game; if you are into Fantasy and RTS games you will enjoy this game and if you are both you will LOVE this game!

												Despite some infuriating aspects I really enjoy this game.It is Dungeon Keeper reborn for a new age and I love that. Im also a huge fan of the added complexity and depth introduced by potions and the construct system for example.The game is being constantly updated and that always seems to help. The version im playing now is VASTLY superior to the one I played in 2013.One of my biggest frustrations has always been and continues to be the combat. Its. SO. Frustrating. Whther you're trying to claim one tlie only for the AI to drop their entire army on you or not being able to really tell which of your minions are good at what in combat so you resort to just throwing them all at an enemy. I like the units but the more esoteric naming leads to a lack of transparency in the power of certain units DK kept its classes relatively simple for a reason, while I love the creativity of the new creatures, it doesnt strike me as a good idea game design wise.The other biggest frustration...and this is just a horribly bad design idea all round as far as I can see. Is that you can no longer pick your creatures up if they are not on your territory. This has led to me having to slap my creatures to death on mroe than one occasion as there is a lot of creatures that roam freely into enemy territory and will stay there....fighting....until they die....giving the enemy creatures free experience. When killing your own creatures becomes a valid strategy....something has gone horribly wrong. I can understand it being there for Multiplayer, but in Singleplayer its just annoying.Im marking it as recommend because I do love what theyve done and what theyre trying to do. And I have confidence in the developers to fix issues. However my experience with the game is mostly frustration due to the combat at this point. Other reviews mention the frantic pacing and the lack of time available to actually....keep a dungeon, this does hold somewhat true in places, particularly the main campaign. And I think this issue is exaspartated by the frustrating combat whenever a foe is actually encountered.Thats my only issues really, fix up the combat to be a bit less ""throw things at them"" and let us pick up our ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ creatures when in singleplayer. When it comes to updates maybe the developers should focus less on adding new game modes and fixing fundamental issues that - in my opinion - have existed since day one. And this is a very personal thing to me....but I loved the slight colour tinge/grade on the dungeon in Dungeon Keeper 2 and Id love to see that in WFTO, something that makes it less....brown.Apart from those (not insignificant issues). Yeah. You can have a lot of fun with this. I do :p			"

								I waited long before buying this. I've watched the development from day 1, tested the ""unofficial"" version and finally decided it's time.Considering i spent literally lots of hundreds of hours in the Dungeon Keepers, and adding the confidence, commitment and love the developers show for their project, i can safely predict what this will become: GLORIOUS!It looks and feels almoust identical, except the modern graphics of course. Well, modern is not quite right. It still looks dated, but not compared to that old original DKs. Well does that matter? HELL NO! It's more than adequate and gameplay > graphics!Although WFTO tries to clone DK in every aspect legally possible (even the ""...has entered your dungeons""-voiceover had exactly the same melody) i've notices some minor additions that won't change gameplay but makes it more fluid. Like different rallies for workers (YAY!) and warrios. Or a flag to forbid workers to dig there (YAY!) or groupings (YAY!).Why reinvent the wheel? It already was perfect.Sure, a recommendation based on a tutorial and a sandbox is quite risky (as there is not much of a campaign here yet), the basic gameplay-skeleton looks and feels ""right"".THIS IS THE SUCCESSOR WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR TOO LONG!Even if it does not add much new things, it revives one of the best game/gamplays of all times. Although i still play DK2, this will end an era and start a new.What about Dwelvers? They're damn brilliant too, and even a lot cheaper. But they're having a different approach. Taking the master and bringing in their own vision. This is totally fun too, but it's not DK3. Not visually and not gameplay-wise.Get then both if you can!If you can't, get this one if you prefer the ""darker"" original gamplay and get Dwelvers if you want some creative fresh ideas added to an already superb gameplayconcept.tl;dr:You're into RTS? You like a game that does not take itself damn serious? You're quite fed being the ""good"" fighting the oh-so-bad? Give this one a try! But only if you think this will really suit you, otherwise WAIT until it's done! Without the campaign you'll stuck with the sandbox. The campaign will decide it's final faith (and multiplayer of course).Alternative? Except the masters itself, there is only Dwelvers. Maybe ""Dungeons 2"" (time will tell). Besides there are no games (to my knowledge) that come even close to this gameplay and fun. Period.			"

												TLDR: Buy the game if you loved DK1 and / or DK2. If your new to the ""franchise"" buy it still, you won't regret it, especially if you love dark humour and room building.As many others have written, this game brings the tear for nostalgia running down your cheek when you launch the first mission. The Dungeon Keeper and DK2 aspect of this game is there, the room building, even the imps have the same animation. I was so surprised how close to the ""old thing"" it was, and how well the old games bugs and glitches were fixed.As I said, it's quite the nostalgia trip.One thing to note though, and I'm sure the devs of this game are aware and trying to fix is that this game has a minor memory leak on longer sessions. Approx. 6 hours in you'll start to freeze lag etc, but is easily fixed through killing the program and starting again, just remember to save your progress. :)One thing that I'd hope is that this game would somehow intertwine the story of where DK2 was headed, as the story was awesome, even though the animation was crap in todays world. But I did feel like the story did somehow intertwine a little with DK2 and DK1 especially.Another request for the developers is the lack of Windowed Fullscreen mode :) "

												I am so happy. Back in 1997 when Dungeon Keeper was released it changed the gaming landscape. I played it so much and even more its sequels. It was so powerful, immersing and eerie that even a decade later my kids loved playing it and feeling the addiction flowing.Sadly, even the best of things get abandoned and hardware obsoletes. How hard I tried, at some point the game would no longer start. Life continues and legendary play transform into good memories.And now -- without even knowing any suggestion of existence -- I found this... Effectively ""Dungeon Keeper - Remastered"".I played it and I feel the continuation of where I was left in my memory. And it has so much more. Even the atmosphere has become better. I showed it to the kids and they raided my system not willing to surrender it under any circumstance. Devs, thank you so very, very much! "

												What's to say about it that hasn't already been said? It's the spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper. It's got all the same qualities, has an interesting balance between traps and spells, but it doesn't seem like it has enough to be... 100% perfect. The potions are useful but to me don't add enough to the experiance for the price. The traps are great but they're decently mundane. I miss the boulder traps that kill everything, I miss the doors that actually look like doors. Maybe something to add in later renditions of the game? Hopefully. For now, give this a try if you love Dungeon Keeper, it feels like it, it looks like it, it plays very well if you have an up to date computer, and there's the benifit of more comming out in updates.

												The game was almost everything i hoped for, the graphics brought me back to those golden days of sitting and playing DK2. The gameplay is pretty polished and works like a charm. I miss a bit more content, but that is on its way.The game is also a bit memory intensive still, but i would attribute that to optimization issues and nothing more, the game is after all still early in its release and i have confidence that the problems will be fixed.I would definetly reccomend this game to others.

												This is a wonderful and loving return to Bullfrog's Dungeon Keeper series and brings it right up to date. I have played the first 5 levels and enjoyed them immensely.There are some path finding bugs, but i have not had crashes and slowdowns reported by others. With further releases it can only get better.Easily worth the £20.			"

								Very good base and beta of the game, finsihed the current 'short' cmpagain and cant wait for more!*REASONS TO PLAY*-If you liked dungeon keeper 1/2 (not EA one)-If you like being the bad guy and kill the 'heroes'-Like to stragtegically build a defense to destroy people-Scary beats and evil wariors and such-Like RTS games-Likes being an evil god in control of his own minionsGamemodes:*SURVIVAL MODE* Anyway, I feel that the survival gamemode is too lag-intensive, also there is not enough time to rebuild your defenses and stuff, I had to toggle infinite gold and build midas doors to support the super lag intensive waves of dwarves, ember spirits, behememoths, pigs, and as such, also, I was like how is a person who does not us ethe debug menu survive this? As if they DO break through the doors, kill all your monsters then you die, wait unless your NOT supposed to survive until wave 20 :P my com almost crashed. Anyway fun gamemode! Makes it feel like a tower defense game with endless mode xD*CAMPAGIAN*Want more! I want to kill more goodly heroes! well I felt lazy in the 2nd episode of the campagin and spawned juggernauts in the core xD. Well, enjoyed the story and how its a half tutorial while strategically positioning your units to destroy the enimes miserable forces, feels so good to swarm them and they die in seconds, also currently there wasnt any sort of time limit to the campagian so far so I liked the casual feel to it.*SANDBOX*Ah, my favourite gamemode, you should know why. Play this gamemode if you want to experiment dungeon builds, also if you dig the wrong block you always have the replacment block, so dont worry, buidl your desired dungeon!*MULTIPLAYER*Well... havent tried it yet due to bad internet, sorry []Pros:-Like dungeon keeper-Nice graphics-smooth gamplay(For me)Cons:-Early acess, not much to campagain just yet-Some glitchy pathing here and there-Sometimes monsters just derp out or run in circleOverall:This game is still in early acess, so don't really expect that much, but really excited for the whole game and expect this to be another sucess like dungeon keeper!7/10			"

												Multiplayer was the only reason I bought this game. Turns out it desyncs very often. Also seem to be using alot of bandwidth - it starts lagging really bad when there's some units in the game (10 minutes in). If you consider buying this game because of the online multiplayer, I would reconsider as it is very poorly implemented.Finding an opponent is impossible if you are solo.. you need to have a friend to play with or find someone random on a forum somewhere to organize a game because trying to find a lobby in game is not an optionSingle player campaign review:Dungeon keeper was a success because of its humour .. this single player campaign was really boringfix multiplayer and this game has potential			"

												Finally! A game that does the Dungeon Keeper spirit proud after so many failed attempts by others! This really is the equivalent of the much beloved DK series that I was a huge fan of when I was a little girl/young teenager. It did take me a bit to get used to the UI and general game changes, and it could use some minor tweaks and fixes but nothing jumps out at me as a major issue that can't or won't be fixed, I don't know of any game, including the original DK games that didn't have some issues. It's not 'exactly' the same of course but close enough to make it great!To me the couple of minor issues I did run into/noticed were a non-issue to me and I felt didn't take away from the gameplay in any significant manner. The developers are as passionate about the DK series as the player and it really does show! It's evident that they're on top of trying to fix the issues left and I just can't recommend this game enough times!			"

												This review is as of April 6th. If you are looking for the next Dungeon Keeper, this is it. However as of this review there are still many bugs and ""placeholder"" items in place. Normally I would give a thumbs down because of this but I am willing to give the dev's a bit of slack here. However I would reccomend waiting a few months (Summer 2015) if you want a fuller, less buggy package. I however couldn't wait and jumped in the fun, but buggy pool.Pros:*Nice Graphics*Excellent Voice Acting (yay Richard Ridings!)*It's actually Dungeon Keeper!, not a tower defense, nor a Electronic Arts pay2win skinner box!, But straight up Dungeon Keeper!*When it's working correctly, its pretty fun!Cons:*BUGS!*Missing multiplayer/skirmish (as of April)*Placeholder items here and there7.5/10 (as of now)I could see it easily being a 9/10 or 10/10 when its patched & finished.

								""This is the Dungeon Keeper I've been looking for, in your face EA Mythic""Seems more promising every couple of weeks. Of course the experience won't be exactly the same as DK otherwise EA would sue their asses off. The game does have almost everything DK had, just changed slighly, like chickens to 'micropiglets' haha. Still needs a lot of polishing though, like possesion or the health flowers/shield above creatures.It includes a lot more content than you think it would have, like potions which you can drop on creatures or a flag to stop your imps claiming land you don't want to access yet. There all these useful things that you wish you wanted in the original, and I like that. If you convert heroes, they appear evily corrupted, like the Juggernaut has dirty and bloody looking armour, or the Priestess get's a messy dress with red glowy eyes, such small thing make a difference, I love it.It is annoying that people kinda look down at this game because you don't have the classic cast like the Horned Reaper and the fact this was a kickstarted game, but it's not from EA, it's from developers who long time wanted to bring back DK, and it is very promising.tl;dr game is DK with more features and modernisation but needs even more polishing.

								Dungeon Keeper was a blast and if, like me, you have played it recently, you'll see how far ahead of its time it was (or how little we have progress in gameplay). The only things that give away its age are the visuals and the clunkiness of the UI. So, when I purchased WFTO I was expecting improved graphics and a modern streamline and responsive UI. This is not (yet) the case.Aesthetically it's quite ugly and would feel right if it had been released in the 2005.The interaction is dated, zero feedback loop, sluggish and unclear. On a sidenote I wonder what prompted the devs to chose a 3D mouse cursor instead of a 60 fps hardware cursor, at least if the game lags, give user real time mouse.The game is labelled as a beta but plays as an early alpha so be warned.Like its predecessor, this game has great potential so I hope to see a lot of polishing in the next few month.

												Ths is the true spritual successor to the Dungeon Keeper series -- all the way down to the same voice actor for the announcer!   However, the system requirements are so high (or perhaps it's a lack of optimization for mid-range systems?) that the game becomes unplayable on larger maps.  I *VERY* much want to play this game four dozens -- perhaps hundreds -- of hours, but can't even continue the campaign without a substantial system upgrade to bring it into the stable 20-30FPS range.   It's 5-10FPS on large maps for me right now.  Maybe next year?So in summary:  If you have a high-end system, PLAY THIS GAME!  It's like DK3 would/should have been... lots of new toys, traps, and depth. "

								This is a bit of a difficult one. Do I recommend War for the Underworld? Yes.... and a tiny bit no. Yes because what is there is great; I know there are a lot of people talking about this being the best of its type since Dungeon Keeper, and without a doubt they will be right. However the ""no"" part comes because there is still work to be done on it. This said however, I have to say that the devs are listening to what people are saying, (this is not true of all early access games), and they admit that there is a way to go to fulfill the potential that this game offers.The gameplay is just what I was hoping for. There are areas that need to be polished, the graphics need to be optimised and more demons would be great. Both of these are targeted for work, the list is available on the steam store page.The demons are lovely; the graphics are just right, the lighting is perfect and this gives the feel that you need for this type of game. To complete an action, be it destroy a wall or lay a flagstone, takes time but this is not too long and I don't think too quick either. Multiple workers will flood into an area if there is plenty of work to do and tackle multiple jobs. This means that you are not haging around waiting for stuff to happen; always a good sign.Am I happy with the game? Yes, most definitely. Could I be happier? Well, I suppose so; once the graphics are optimised and there are more demons and rooms. That said, I know that this is an early access game and I am not playing a game that is finished. I am playing a game that is in development and is actively be developed, unlike some other early access games. Will you enjoy it? If you enjoyed Dungeon Keeper and have missed it then yes, buy it now. If you  enjoyed Dungeon Keeper and have missed it but want the polished, optimised game so you can get on with building your own little underworld then perhaps you should wait a bit longer. But I have to say that I am glad I am in at this stage for this game; some of the early access games seem to be a way of earning extra cash for the developers who have no intention of producing a finished product. I am pleased to report that I would be extremely surprised if this is one of those!!!!EDIT:The latest update has added better optimised graphics so that is one of my comments being looked at along with new minions and rooms, what more could someone ask for? So far I am right about the developers caring about this game. Every week we find out what is happening with the game and, unlike some early access projects what they talk about is then actually acted upon and implemented. What more could you ask for?			"

												If you were a fan of the original Dungeon Keeper games you NEED to play this game. Never mind the name - this game IS DK3 through and through. I just picked this up on the Summer sale 2016 and cant stop playing it. I had been longing for another Dungeon Keeper game but sadly Bullfrog closed its doors  many years ago. Another company came out with Dungeon and Dungeon2 and were an ok attempt to make something similar but were just lacking something that the Dungeon Keeper games had. War for the Overworld brings it and then some and is a true homage and continuation to a great series. They even got the original voice actor from the first two DK games to narrate.

												I renamed a shortcut of this game to ""Dungeon Keeper 3"". Because that's what it is. I waited for Dungeon Keeper 3 for a decade, and wasn't disappointed in WftO in the least.It has the same core mechanics, the same dark humor and even the same voice actor for narration, while adding new elements into the mix, such as very nice visuals, new creatures, new rooms, new spells (+ rituals, really OP spells which cost no mana, but have to be channeled in a special room first), new story and sins system (think of a skill tree, but with rooms/spells/constructs instead of usual skills).Also, there are skins for dungeons. And they all are amazing.			"

								Awesome game based on the original EA & Bullfrog classic Dungeon Keeper, It's great how it's kept almost all elements of the original DK classic, Game play is simple and easy to pick up however as it's still a beta it's quite buggy and laggy, It freezes alot and controlls often stop responding. However this game has huge potential and I'm looking forward to the full release due this year			"

												[Review written for 1.3]Short Review:Engaging RTS / dungeon management game where you get to play the bad guys.Negative reviews are primarily concerned with WFTO at launch. Game is fully polished and well-optimised now, which makes for a much more enjoyable experience. Worth the full price, extremely worth during a sale.(Very) Long Review:I backed this during the Kickstarter crowdfunding phase, and was an avid fan of DK1 and 2. Bias confirmation confirmed, but this review is as objective as I can make it.OverviewWar for the Overworld is the spiritual successor to the cult hit Dungeon Keeper, a series by Bullfrog (later snapped up by EA - which is why DK3 never. ;_;). You play as an 'Underlord', a wibbly wobbly non-corporeal being that seals its essence in a Dungeon Core (the room you start with in every game). Lose that and you lose the game; protect it at all costs.But in order to enact your will (and defend said Core), you gain access to an assortment of rooms, The Good - You're the bad guy!- Very polished. Backers and early buyers remember the... fiasco that was WFTO's launch (although they did explain why it released the way it did, which was understandable); it's come a long way since then. Virtually all bugs have been fixed, many quality-of-life features have been implemented/improved and the optimisation is much better.- Unique. Although a successor to DK, there's nothing else like this on the market at the moment. WFTO isn't a carbon copy of DK either; it has its own fantasy, creatures and ideas (most notably, Potions and Rituals). - Build your own Dungeon. One of the major attractions, you can build your Dungeon however you feel like (within the constraints of the map terrain, of course). If you want a massive open-plan ground, meticulously divided rooms full of doorways and corridors, then you can do it. (A more recent addition was Wall prop efficiency; to offset the fact you have less building space, rooms with reinforced walls will operate more effectively.)- Playstyle variety [outside of the Campaign]. Every game, you'll start with no abilities or rooms unlocked, spending Sins (points) in a three-column Tech Tree to unlock stuff. You can rush for a specific tree's Titan, or you can spread Sins across all three trees. That said, I don't think it's perfect (see below).- Entertaining. With Richard Ridings as your Mentor (the same VA for the DK Mentor) and the dark, tongue-in-cheek (and occasionally just plain silly) humour, it'll catch you out once in a while.That, with the excellent(ly awful) voice acting for the good guys makes for fun outside of the gameplay.The Bad- Hotkeys. Hotkey support was enabled a while back, but the lack of visibility is a significant issue to learn hotkeys, especially if you're trying to micro combat / efficiency. Could easily be fixed by displaying the relevant hotkey in ability tooltips.- The AI. It's alright, but once you get to grips with the game, it becomes a lot easier to fight against. Also, there's no difficulty mode for the campaign; although the early missions are newbie-friendly, the difficulty curve rises quite significantly, particularly if you're new to this genre.- Hidden / unexplained mechanics. Following on from the previous point, the game introduces many additional utilities you can make use of. That in and of itself is a good thing; the lack of introduction and usage of them isn't great. There's still a few rituals and potions I never make use of, while others are pretty overpowered for their investment. There are user-written guides that provide in-depth explanations, but it shouldn't really be the place of the community to tell you how something functions in the first place.- Meta playstyles Lack of depth to Tech Tree. Having tested a defensive strategy against Master AI, I can confirm that defensive strats do indeed work (Avarice + WDs, all I'm saying), though I can't see them being as effective vs players. Nevertheless, Although there are options and optimal choices do vary from map to map, I still feel more could be done to promote tech / build diversity. Possibly passive buffs (and nerfs?) for certain units when you invest into certain trees, or passives that only activate from speccing into multiple trees to complement your playstyle.- RAM usage. I have 8GB RAM (DDR3, meh clock speed), but on larger maps I will start to lag; it's still playable, but everything goes slower and commands won't always register. For optimal experience you'll want 12 or 16GB, but it's fine on small/medium sized maps.ConclusionCongrats for getting this far!Overall, I would strongly recommend picking this up (especially if it's on sale, but the devs definitely earned the money asked). Many of the negative reviews were released at launch, present issues that have since been addressed in virtually all cases. Most of the bad points are fairly minor, primarily to do with communication and visibility.Yes, it's not Dungeon Keeper 3; but that's fine. I personally believe it's better that WFTO is its own game, drawing inspiration from DK but not trying to become it.			"

												To all you ex-Dungeon Keeper 2 players looking to reignite your love of the game....Buy this game! But beware things are a little different this time.....At first, I was weary of the deviations from DK2 (of which there are many), and wasn't exactly sure if I liked it or not, but over time, I've come to believe this game is actually an improvement on the original.Pros: +Relive DK2 fun in a new and challenging way.+Map editors+Great game mechanics (skills trees, mana locking, sanctuarys etc.)+MultiplayerCons:-Relentless AI (surely this can be toned down?)-The add crash or glitch (particulary on multiplayer)The single player is great fun, and a great way to learn how the new game functions. My main grievance is just how relentless the AI is. It really is ridiculously hard sometimes. Features such as mana locking and skills tree seem annoying at first, but you begin to realise that it's a mechanic that actually makes gameplay far more enjoyable in the long run.For me the multiplayer is the best (and sometime worst) part of the game. This is the closest I've come to reliving those glory days of LAN'ing DK2 with friends, so I can't recommend this game enough for this reason alone. My main frustration comes from the odd crash when a large battle starts (which lets be honest, was far more regular on the orginal DK2). The game is far less geared toward defence (compared with DK2), so rather than lengthly stalemates, games can be won/lost within half an hour or so.In short, this game is will delight those familiar with DK2, but will still provide a new challenge with it's tweaking on the mechanics. There are still the odd glitches which need to be ironed out, but these are few and far between, and don't effect the overall enjoyment of the game. "

								War of the overlod is a dungeon builder game. You play on the side of the evil dungeon master, cultivating your dungeon to bring new minions, and run the ""heros"" back to the surface.If you have ever played the dunfeon keeper series of games from the 90s. This is as close to a remake as you are likely to find.I have been waiting a long time for a game to give a similar feel and am excited to see how future development shapes it. It is already showing a huge amount of potential and could be the start of a new dungeon building series to rival the classic.			"

												A unique RTS that focuses on you building your dungeon and making sure its balanced, provides food, bed and other needs *cough*VAMPIRES*cough*  for your army of minions. Sounds easy but as the difficulty ramps up and more is added to the mix you may end up with somthing like three of your own animated gold statues that you built and trained turning on you because you cant afford the gold to keep them running, oh yeah there are enemies too.Its an RTS game with a twist. Your minions act however they see fit. You may influence their decision, but outside of the posession spell and the banner that says ""Attack Here"" you and your opponent have little to no direct control of any outcome in this game.For everyone who was a fan of the 2 dungeon keeper games this game is not only inspired by it but pays tribute to it many times, and thats just within the passive dialogue. Great game, Every bit as good as its predecessors but with more stuff.By the way. In this game. You are the bad guy. :)			"

								Review updates on 26th Dec 2014 :  the latest patch provides 3 campaign maps to play , a lot of improved texture on rooms and creature animation in general , with almost fully functional unit combats and rooms, the game is shaping up into an amazing dungeon management game that screams with the 'DUNGEON KEEPER SEQUEL ' vibe  . If you are fans of the good old bullfrog games such as theme hospital, theme parks, DK , you will be absolutely in love with this game , which I would suggest you get this game right now to support the developers .  Else you can wait for the full game release which is currently scheduled to be released in early 2015 Was a big fan of the dungeon keeper series , can't tell you how excited I am when I heard about this game . Missed the chance to pledge for the project on kickstarter , the moment it released on Steam I got it right away .    The developers of the game are really hardworking , they have updates on the game quite frequently and new information every week and often hold live stream sessions on twitch.tv to answer questions from the players .  They are really passionate about the game and its that enthusiasm you had to admire .  Throughout all these times , I have seen massive improvement in the game, from  barely playable stage to fully voiced tutorial maps , dozen of rooms to build and constant improvement on the creature A.I  . There aren't that many of maps and stages to try out yet , but every penny I put on the game is very worth it . Most importantly , you get all the DK vibes from the game !			"

												Great game. Especially fun if you like the Dungeon Keeper series. It felt like ""Dungeon Keeper 3"" to me, which I really consider a compliment!Pro'sReally brings you back to the good old days, playing the bad guy for once instead!Very original strategy game, trying to attract creatures based on certain roomsTakes many good ideas from the Dungeon Keeper series and improved on them or made quality-of-life improvementsConsCreature spawning mechanics and dictating which creatures you get are two things I still don't understand. Certain rooms attract certain creatures, but which ones spawn and how many you can get max etc. confused me all the way up to the endThere's no ""priority list"" like in games such at the Settlers where you can force certain actions to have priority over other. For example where to bring defeated monsters (to the crypt, or the prison for.. other uses? :D ).It felt easier than the Dungeon Keeper series. Then again I was younger when I played that so it could've been due to that, too.I would've loved if the game had even more rooms and ""forces"" you to decide on a certain build, like focussing on sorcery, invest heavily into beasts, conversion of enemies, traps & alchemy, or just raw muscle power via the training room. Right now you can do everything really well and I often ended up trying to challenge myself by picking one. All in all, an awesome game!			"

For those who love DK1&2, this is an amazing remake with it's own twist.  I did find the campaign good, but felt a little short.  Looking forward to seeing upcoming DLC, maps and mods and hope we don't have to wait too long.I would definately recommend this game to everyone who love the DK games.

												This is Dungeon Keeper 3.It retains the charm and familiarity of the original games; you tag the earth, imps mine out rooms, a host of evil creatures are attracted to your dungeon, plenty of heroes are killed (or tortured) and the always welcome tones of Richard Ridings (the mentor from DK1 & 2) will once again guide you on your way to conquering the underworld.Only there’s more of everything this time around. More creatures to attract and convert, more rooms, more traps, and the addition of potions, rituals and constructs. There are more game modes alongside the main campaign, including crucible mode where you can fight endless and increasingly difficult waves of enemies, there are sandbox and scenario levels (and you can create your own in the map editor) and multiplayer and skirmish levels.And the developers are still working on more, pet dungeons have been announced and are going to be added soon and who knows what might come after that.

								Early access done properly and a game that is respectful of it's influences. Regular updates, assets and game play done to the highest standard. This is one of the few games on Steam I can recommend picking up early. However, I wouldn't recommend playing it early - what is there presently s very solid and produced to a high standard, but developing a game properly takes time and this is more of an investment in my eyes. A game that is shaping up to be fantastic but due to a focus on doing things properly and promptly as opposed to just quickly, functionality is still lacking compared to what the final product should offer. That said, patching and updates are both regular and frequent and what is already in place is very enjoyable and picking it up on the cheap now is a definite good call.If you enjoyed Dungeon Keeper - and who didn't? - this is well worth your cash-moniez.

												HelloAs someone who liked the old dungeon keeper games, when I saw this game go on kickstarter I was very excited about it. This genre of game is unique in a sense that you are the evil. You build a kingdom but you cannot control those who join your cause and your style of building defines what archetype of mobs join you. I must say that for a game that has just released it is to be expected to have a slightly buggy experience, however in this case there really are bugs everywhere. The game feels unfinished. When you open up the menu after installing and click multiplayer the first thing that prompts up is, this will be patched in. The same happens when you click survival mode, and when you click skirmish there is a shocking three maps. The only fully functional mode as of right now is the campaign. This was already a huge letdown, minutes after finishing my download.I didn't let it phase me and I went for the campaign. Now from the very start I ran into bugs and problems. As a former dungeon keeper player and with many games behind my belt I have a good idea on how to play games. Now this is very important because the tutorial is horrible. They barely scrape the surface of what buildings do, there is no explanation what so ever how the controls work. I was unable to move my camera, had issues with targetting. You'd figure okay, I will read the tooltips but frankly, there are no useful tooltips anywhere in the game to be found. Mostly there are placeholders from an early alpha build. ""shrine prop siege"" doesn't tell me what it does? The big thing for this game is the micro management of the buildings, however there is no explanation on how the sizes of your exhibits have to be in order to recruit units. The props are invisible. And you can slap units but there is no real talk on how it affects efficiency. So I went in completely blind. Now the early campaign maps are fairly easy, straightforward objectives and simple tasks. With no time pressure that is good. The only problem is that you cannot build anything else while you have a certain task. Build a X on this tile. Then you cannot continue to do what you were doing, it forces you to do something specific, some of the cutscene 'talks' appear to be unskippable and this is just tiny annoyances everywhere. I pushed onward, in a quite bad mood now. And then I encountered many little bugs. I summoned a vampire, it went mad. Started killing my units but I had no idea how to fix that. Everytime I cast a scouting ritual my pc froze up completely. Now I have a really expensive modern pc less than two months old. That is just bad scripting. Lag, delay and crashes occurred regulary. I had units bug into the wall and frankly no idea what half of the spells, flasks or shrines are for. The possesion spell, which was a huge thing, is completely broken.So yes. I did finish the campaign. It took me roughly 12 hours. I only had to restart one map which I failed on my part. So through the buggy experience I can say that the campaign has a good design, it is versatile and interesting. The small storyline has a funny plot to it. But its so dissatisfyingly short, and the experience was a chain hindrance of little problems that I can't say I fully enjoyed it. There was no map that was challenging in the entire campaign and by the time most buildings and plots are revealed you are done. I then decided to take on the AI in skirmishes just to see what the full experience would be like. Considering I hadn't had that strong opponents in the campaign. Now I took on every AI setting on master, they were challenging. So I will say that the game definatly has potential. It is fun in design, fun in concept and I'm sure that with some more patches and content this will be a good game. For those who have seen the totalbiscuit WTF video, what he says is very true. This game looks like it will be worthwhile, in 6months or more to come. As of right now, I cannot recommend this game. I personally found it fun, but I am dissapointed in what I consider a premature release and I hope the developpers will put effort into this game, and make it great. As I think it can be.			"

Well go ahead and tap right into their skulls! Admiring the detail the developers have clearly put into the various dungeon rooms from up close is a feeling no other game can replicate for me, a particular reason which makes the franchise as a whole so unique.I would buy the game twice I'm that happy with it, but I'm broke and have no need for a second copy therefore I will not be doing that			"

												Look and Feel of Dungeon Keeper, blah blah, as you can read in numerous other reviews.Game occasionally slows down, seemingly when the AI is trying to cope with the players tactics (or the lack of it), but no crashes or game-breaking bugs here so far.Given the rate at which the Developer pumps out Patches, I am not worried about the game becoming ""finished"". The game sure needs more polishing, especially in the technical areas, to have it run smoother and less resource demanding, but despite that it´s fun ...and that´s what counts in the end, eh?Big plus on the voice acting side, the atmosphere while playing is fantastic, really nostalgic. I´d say buy it and enjoy it if you liked Dungeon Keeper and the likes.			"

												So far, this game is mostly what I hoped it would be. I waited until the bumpy release to buy it, and so far, I haven't run into any bugs other than an occassional spike in lag when I use the ritual which reveals the whole map at once for ten seconds. The art is mostly pleasing, though I tend to like how the hero faction's theme was designed more than the standard Underlord theme. The game so far does a good job at introducing you to key concepts without making the tutorial seem dull, even for an RTS/Dungeon Keeper 1/2 player like me. The campaign can be challenging at times, but a little easy at others. As of now, there are few skirmish maps, but there will be a patch soon that will supposedly add quite a number of maps, which has me pleased. The best thing, though, would be to release a map editor to conjoin with the steam workshop or something so that the game makers can allow the community to create their own maps. For personal tastes, I like and have a hard time accepting this game at times. I like how diverse you can make your forces on the campaign, but limiting things in skirmish maps based on technology (Sin) trees seems silly in the sense that if I play long enough, I'd like to have access to everything available, rather than be limited in what I can do longterm. Along with that, I have a problem with the types of available creatures in the game- nothing seems to be like an ""end-game"" level creature other than the super-creatures, which you can't upgrade or train at all, and you can only ever get one. While I LOVE the hero units because I like the idea of having my own super minion, I'd like for the ""1"" on their HP flower to be a non-number icon, or to allow the supers to level to 10. This would clear up confusion like how I had when I spent a massive amount of time on XP potions in an attempt to level up my Eternal minion. Continuing on this creature-focused section, I think there should be more ""high-end"" creatures. Right now, the best creatures at the further points of the Sin tree are mostly casters or support-type creatures. The exception to this are the Shadow/Bafu, which in all honesty are not THAT beefy (I'm thinking Black Knights from DK2), and are difficult to train since the Beastmasters can't train the creatures as quickly as some of your intelligent minions can train. To be fair, though, it seems that the beast talent path is designed for aggro strategies, which means their high-end units won't be that incredible. The neutral tree basically only offers casters, which are all nice to have at times, but they don't offer a real frontline other than with the horde of ghouls your Necromancers can build up over time. That being said, the necromancers themselves are incredibly vulnerable to well-placed lightning strikes from your opponents, which can make all of the hard work from your ghoul farming go to waste in a matter of seconds. The defense tree offer the Augre, which is as close to a true tank of a non-super minion. Even so, they are not exactly what I was hoping for. What I hope for in the future, is an addition of the variety of creatures in both theme and purpose. Right now it seems that the main design of the creatures is ""beast/beast humanoid,"" with a couple of demons and a human and a couple of undead for spice. While I love the addition of the beasts and all, it would be great to have more ""dark humans,"" demons, and undead to accompany the beasts abd beast-men.~~~~~~TLDR:Pros:-Keeps the Spirit of DK2 gameplay-Campaign has good pace for the most part-Few Bugs now-Gameplay is mostly funCons:-Rocky release-Lag when using a very specific ritual-Lag if you keep the game runing on the main menu for too long (occasionally)-No map editorWould be cons if they weren't being fixed:-Low amount of Skirmish Maps (adding more soon)-Bugs in Survival Mode (fixing soon)Personal Preference Stuff:-Creature diversity seems to be off (Too many beastial types and not enough demons/humans/undead/other)-Narrator sounded better as a snide aide/friend (DK2) as opposed to an arrogant, omniscient demon god-The narrator can be hilarious at times-The voice acting on the enemy dungeon lords is very good at times-The graphics are pleasing			"

												I have been seeing alot of negaite reviews for this game, so I decided to post one that I think is fair.The first question I will answer is if I recommend this game to others: Of course I do. I have supported this game for a long time and watched it grow. If you are looking for a dungeon management/ rts like game, then this si the one you should get. The voice acting is fantastic. Some of the quotes in the game caught me completely off guard while I was playing, for instance he says, ""You did buy this game right?"" while I was taking forever to clear a campaign level. Also, the AI in the game has a great range for all skill types. You can put it on easy as you learn the game, and there is even a specific AI that was built, which opperates in the rules of the game, that is near impossible to beat. Thus, there is challenege for all players. I have just finished my forst 10 hours of the game and I cannot wait to put many more in.Now to talk about how everyone is complaining about the bugs in the game:Yes , there are some bugs in the final release and not all modes are fully functional and in prototype phase. The game is fun to play now, reguardless of bugs. Also, the dev's for this game are amazing. It has only been out for a day and there has been 4 or 5 updates in fixing to fix the bugs. Yes, some people are frustrated with the bugs, but I feel as if the game is very enjoyable even with them. Some features like survival are still in prototype and will be fully functional in the near future. I wanted to comment on the fact that I have played the survival prototype and it works very well as is.  Overall, this is a fantastic game and it was worth the few years wait in order to enjoy this game. The dev's are great with their community and I see them respond in the forums daily. Do not walk away from this game just because of a few bugs. Buy it, enjoy it, and tell others the same so this game doesn't die due to others throwing a fit over a few bugs.			"

Early Access Review
								Has lots of potential - it's the closest match to a real Dungeon Keeper successor (compared to all the travesties that have attempted it so far). But this is most definitely early access, there's a single small level, a tutorial and a sandox mode - so while it's playable, there's very little actual game here considering the price tag. I'd hold off until there's more actual content before shelling out the cash.			"

												Avid Dungeon Keeper fan, started playing it just 6 years old. I've owned this game since it first dropped on the workshop, I've followed it's progress throughout, occasionally launching the game to have a quick peek then waiting till it was done. Finally let myself play the campaign now I figured it would be polished enough months after release.Bugs, just bugs everywhere. First impression, stutter before the menu loaded, then the button disappeared whenever I hovered over them, then when I finally manager to change screen resolution I had to force shut the application and restart to get it working again. On load the second time menu items white checkerboard everywhere, glitching and lagging into the campaign menu. I so want this game to be good.Into the first level, seems fairly okay, dialogue lines are being repeated randomly, adnimations are a bit wooden, but whatever, nostalgia overload - graphics are pretty awesome and Richard Ridings sounds awesome - I could see it being stellar. Second level, well I had to play the first one again for whatever reason, but when it eventually loaded the first condition of with selecting a ""Vein of Evil"" couldn't be done because it wasn't an option on the panel, trying to exit the game I had to force quit because once again the menu wouldn't load.I can't believe after a couple of years this game is still unplayable. I've seen how much work the devs have put in, but I just get the impression it launched too soon (maybe for cashflow reasons), and it's several revisions in and still pretty unplayable, at least for me.I want this game to be good, guess I'll check back in after another few versions to see if it's sorted yet.

												- Minions ignore commands.- Minions get stuck and just stand there.- Sounds come and go.- Walls are meaningless.- Spells are missing or broken.- Bugs steal precious time away from timed achievements.- Minion AI pathing is almost always the in wrong direction.- Increasingly choppy/stuttered/lagged the more you play.  Requires restarting the game often.- Just rush the objective to win most of the time.  No strategy involved whatsoever.- Bugs bugs bugs.Hideous disappointment!  The only thing in this game I would compare to DK, is the idea.  This is yet another unfinished game pretending to be a release.			"

												Finally a game that gives me that sweet sweet feel of Dungeon Keeper and Dungeon Keeper 2!  The developers really hit the nail on the head with this game!  They've capture the mechnics that made the dungeon management game genre really fun and bring it forward into 2015.I had purchased this game the moment the bedrock alpha became available and I've played it on and off as it was progressing.  It was amazing to see the game grow and mature and then finally to to have the full game catch me off guard and be pleasantly surprised that ""my little baby"" had grown up.  The campaign is fun and definitly scratches the itch for single player story driven game play.  I very much look forward to continuing to get hours of enjoyment of this game.If you loved Dungeon Keeper game from yesteryear and you don't feel that the other offerings in the genre lived up to the promise, consider War For the Overworld.

												i was a huge fan and put many hours into Dungeon Keeper. that being said.. i love what's been done so far, but MAJOR elements (imo) are still missing. you need to be able to beat your minions into doing things they'd rather not. you need to be able to lock them in a room and have them keep working in fear of more beatings, even as they starve to death. like a good minion should. it may seem harsh, but this is the mind set every good dungeon keeper should have.i only got 4 stages or so in so far.. but none of my knocked out creatures are being dragged back to their beds to heal. i can't toss creatures i don't want, right back out the way they came in.. in hopes of getting a different creature etc.i can't hand feed those worthless little ♥♥♥♥♥ as a reward or to keep them working. i can't bribe them with riches either.all in all though, i'm really glad this game was made.. though hoping certain things are added, i've had fun playing it.

												Actually the best Game-Replacement for everybody who played Dungeon Keeper 1&2. Bought the Gold Edition without watching Reviews and didnt regret it.  Its just a little bit different as Dungeon Keeper with locked Mana and Tech Tree's which is Fun when your into it.Graphics are pretty good 9/10 (in my Opionion the Graphic in the Trailer Video looks like a 5/10 but w/e) Gameplay also pretty clean no Stutters or Lags on Ultra settings... maybe with maxxed out Creatures and when the Game goes on for like 3 hours straight but can't say anything bout dat.Map Editor : extremely easy Map Editor which is a bit bugged atm i feel, when you want to Mirror Corners it does not everytime copy the exact same Door Positions or even missing the Doors & some Traps but nothing too dramatic.(would appreciate a fix on when you wanna scale the Level from spawned Minions from 1-10 that you disable Scroll in/out or something or make the Arrow larger or something. That annoyed me the most when you want to scale the Level and scrolling down to level 10 and scrolling out the Map or clicking the tiny arrow and want to drag it down but it just simply dont want work)Survival Mode : Great Feature, actually my Favorite. Can't say too much about it cause its atm a Prototype. Played it some Rounds, but only reached Wave 11. Really hope that youre later be able to play it COOP or even make your own Survival Mode Maps with Map Editor.33 Hours Left on Summer Sale.Must buy for Dungeon Keeper Fans.Definetly worth to buy for 12€ (SummerSale) even if you never played Dungeon Keeper before. You can get the Underlord or Gold Edition afterwards. But i would advise to just buy the Full Bundle if your interested in this game, then you dont need to buy the other Editions for the full prize if you enjoy the Game.			"

												This is the first time I've bothered to post a review.I didn't play this game at release when it was said to have a lot of problems - I bought it this past weekend with the news that patch 1.1 fixed a lot of issues.Quite simply, I loved it. I never played dungeon keeper as a kid but I picked them up and played them a bit a few years ago. I loved the concept but the age of the games made it a little difficult for me.If you're looking for a modern dungeon keeper, get this. The devs have worked hard to put it right and in my mind they've succeeded. I really had a blast bingeing through the campaign and I intend to keep skirmishing for some time. Looking forward to trying out the survival mode too.			"

												I put off buying War For The Overworld for a very long time, principly because I believed there was no chance in hell it could live up to the legend that is Dungeon Keeper.I was sure it would just be a cheap imitation of a classic game with no original thought or work put into it, just ideas and concepts stolen from Dungeon Keeper, reskinned to look ""original"" and packed into a half baked game not worth its price.Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥was I wrong.It's pretty damn great. Some minor problems concerning visual glitches and momentary freezes but otherwise it lives up to the reputation of Dungeon Keeper. The only major problem I have with War For The Overworld is how Mana works, I much preferred the mana system in Dungeon Keeper 2 where you are rewarded with a faster mana income from aggressive expansion but leave yourself vulnerable to attack. Sadly there is little strategical advantage you can get from amassing a large mana pool because there isn't a ""quick"" way to get it.The Developers clearly knew what they doing and what they aimmed to achieve with this game, and they succeeded in leaps and bounds. There's more than enough new concepts and game mechanics to make this title stand out from it's inspiration as a true spirital successor.Well done.			"

												Hello,This game really kicks in after the 4th campaign mission; at least for me it had a very good first impression, than it went to ""omg, they did it like 40 times more complicated compared to the original Dungeon Keeper"" and started hating that (during the first missions they teach you all about constructs/defenses/spells/rooms/creatures/orders, even the creatures are divided in beasts and other kinds and it all feels like they complicated everything and they often give you not only all these news but special ""rooms"" you will not see in the next levels anymore, so I let you guess how it felt compared to DK that really comes easily in your hands), but really you need not more than 4 levels to feel that you somehow understood everything, that you somehow are starting getting more fun with these ""defenses"" that you ever had in DK, that you somehow love the possibility to re-create walls for a huge gold's cost, you recover the first impression and these little details do not bother you anymore and a few even kicks in perfectly to improve it.Also the graphics and animations are so improved from the first time I playied the alpha (a few hours and than I waited till now, when the majority of peoples informed it was fine and I also reported and helped witht he last bug which they resovled the day later I gave them the steps to reproduce it directly in this steam forum), this really seems completely on AAA level.I feel this really is the 3rd DK, I only miss the old creatures for now, but I'm still at 1/3 of the campaign and I still need to meet so much, but I already feel that I jumped the worst obstacle in liking this game.

Early Access Review
								Edit (12 June 2014): Since version 0.4.2 the OS X build and the Linux build are working well again! The game is also much more stable as it was when I wrote this review. The developers now also actively involve the users of WFTO in testing the game; they now often release previews in which the newest features and fixes are available at a seperate beta-branch at Steam. WFTO also works well if you have a low-end-machine, so don't worry about that. And if it does not work right on your low-end-machine; the developers will do more optimatization to WFTO in the comming versions, so it even runs faster as it already does! :)This will maybe be even better then Dungeon Keeper; it now has a lot of rooms, many characters and very nice graphics. The 20 euros are worth it! The developers give everyone even acces to pre-beta, so you can test the newest content and maybe even report bugs to help the developers finisching this game ;) They publish at least once a week news on their main website about the development progress and answer a lot of questions on their forums. Never saw that kind of developers with so much humor! :)They have fixed many bugs and crashes in the last months; I can surely say it's playable, you will sometimes maybe see a tiny little bug or a very rarely crash (got a few ones so far,) but you can play the levels like a charm. WFTO even contains a debug mode and debug console with which you can mess around with the game :)There are known problems about that you can only play an old version of WFTO on Mac OSX at the moment, but this is not caused by WFTO itself; it is a bug at the Unity side and the Unity team is working on resolving this issue for everyone, so you will probably soon be able to play the latest version of this game on MAC OSX soon! See here for more updates on this: https://forum.subterraneangames.com/threads/488-osx-version-of-the-game-is-not-up-to-date.4981/They are still working on polishing the UI, AI, graphics etc (but you can play it very well at the moment!). But it's worth to buy it now already and help the developers to finish the game, but the game is now also a little bit cheaper then after the release!!! Grab your chance now and get this game Keeper/Underlord!			"

								Dungeon Keeper was in a class of its own. While I am unsure as to whether or not this game can live up to its predecessors, it will no doubt come close, in light of the content I have already seen. It still gives you that feeling of badass and divinity, aswell as expands upon what Bullfrog originally wanted, such as the Veins of Evil, giving you the ability to buy rooms and spells and such. While it may be merely a skeleton right now, it has the potential to become a powerhouse, and perhaps even its own series of games.			"

												Any fan of the Ol' Good Dungeon Keeper series MUST play this game.Anyone who have waited for DK 3 MUST play this game.The developers have brought back what DK series were shining at, and brought everything back with the original playability, with crisp gorgeous HD graphics.The original evil concierge voice that was in DK2 is here, with occational fun punch lines during play - although they tend to repeat what is said not 5 minutes ago.The graphics and in-game props are almost similar to that of DK2, along with the same pickaxe holding hand. - But in higher polygon count and higher texture quality, and the devs. have managed to have the feel of DK series.The game play goes same, from the ol' trusty imp slapping, lightning spells that fries whatnots, to that of 5X5 tiles which bother those with OCDs (like myself).Well made, well played.

												As others have said: I really hoped this game would be good, being a huuuuge Dungeon Keeper fan myself. But even after roughly a year, and patch 1.5, it still feels very buggy and incomplete. I just finished the campaign and feel somewhat dissatisfied...The game is ambitious, as it comes with a big load of extra tactical depth - at least in theory. It has the Dungeon Keeper feeling but in many many occasions it does not feel thought-through, as there many many features (potions, contructs, creature types, war bands, rituals etc etc) that just rise and do not shine because the gameplay is too hectic and chaotic. Eventually you'll just zerg-rush anyway.E.g. after 13 (short) levels I still have no idea what the abilities of 95% of the creatures do, since the only way to figure them out is the use the (very very clunky) posession spell - which unfortunately is completely useless apart from that. I used basically only two or three out of the dozen potions/rituals/contructs/defences, simply because I didnt have to (and there was no space to develop a strategy anyway, since there is hardly any time to dig, explore and plan) All in all, It feels a bit like a dry and chewy Kobe-beef steak: At some point there were the perfectly right ingredients, but they did not manage to create something great out of it. Which is a pity			"

												Before we even get in to gameplay - I feel I have to point out just how much time and effort the dev team have put into this game since the days of early release. When the game first came out in beta - touted as the spiritual successor to DK2, it was full of bugs, glitches, frustrations and was pretty unplayable.Fast forward to now, and we have what's basically a different game to when it started; with huge patches, and now an official expansion pack. What a journey - and I have to give credit where credit is due to the developers, in regards to their time, effort, and the way they've interacted and responded to the community feedback.The game itself - in my opinion is everything we could have hoped for, if there ever was an official DK3. Updated graphics, new (very inventive) units, spells, skills; but of course all the original charm of the series we love, including the voice work! :)Really enjoying playing this, and presume I will contunue to do so for some time. To all fans of dungeon sims - don't hesitate. I don't think you'll be disappointed! Welcome back Underlords.			"

												As someone who absolutely loved Dungeon Keeper 2 back in the day, War For The Overworld does an awesome job of bringing you the same experience, but in a much more modern and better looking package. Single player campaigns are fun, but are not much more challenging than the single player campaigns from DK2. Skirmish options are great however, and hard AI actually means HARD. All in all, this is a definite must-have for people who were fans of DK2.			"

												Very happy with Dungeon Keeper Complete Edition aka 'War for the Overworld'. The original games had some clunky feeling to them that is all smoothed out in WftO.  Voice acting sounds the same, units seem more responsive and there's more to do. With a couple patches and an expansion still coming out, this game is a full Early Access game success with backer promises being fulfilled and surpassed.If you ever wanted to play Dungeon Keeper again, or if you ever missed out on the DK series (and I'm not including anything Electronic Arts poo'd out) then this is the game we've been given to replace that need.Thanks Brightrock / Subterranean Games!

								Not quite like dungeon keeper, but its the closest thing to it. Unfortunately, that's not the developers fault and to be honest I'm impressed they managed to get this far. EA is to blame, if you didnt already know, as to why dungeon keeper is no longer a major game in our modern age.  I have been keeping a close eye on this project for some time now. I must say when it comes to getting that evil dungeon master fix, this game delivers and more. I look foward to seeing what they do next and wish the best for them, I remember a time where I wished that someone would do something to revive my childhood game and these people have delivered. For that I thank you, truly its one thing you have given back to me, and I'm sure to many fans, of the dasterdly dungeon master known as Dungeon Keeper.			"

War for the OversoldAfter sinking 10 hours into the game, I feel versed enough to textualise my 2c. Early Access and the like are quite clearly labelled which this game ""was"", now well past there official launch and 8 hot fixes later, it still very much is.The UI is cluttered, unusable in parts, I've not checked if there are keyboard shortcuts to offset this, but largely I don't really care - I have a mouse I want to use it. That's how I play (badly). There is a masse of technical text when hovering over just about anything, I am fairly confident some of this is to be masked. But it already should have been before the ""exit"" from Early Access.Little quirks soon become very annoying, the narrator loves to remind me that my Tavern is too small. Hats off you're probably right narrator, if I'd actually built a tavern. If not the tavern then micro piglets, yes that large football pitch sized pig farm is too small. Parts of the campaign are pure frustration, any amount of play testing would highlight this. It feels neglected, where I would argue the large appeal of a DK spirtual sequel would be the campaign. It is for me at least. Impasse flags disappear causing all sorts of problems trying to stop minions expanding too far - the whole point of the impasse system. I'd love it, if it worked 100%.I wrestled with L7 to be met with a very easy almost boring L8 which seemed bug as I killed everything in the map and no end game was triggered. My enthusiasm to try that one has twindled greatly. And was the triggering mechanism for me to write this review.Summary judgementAt it's roots this game has a great feel to it, reminding me of DK and DK2 but bringing little extras to the experience. Unfortunately all the good is drastically out weighed by small problems such as bugs or balance issues/AI, they all snowball into one and leave me feeling beat up about the whole thing.You cannot release a game from Early Access in such a state, it's just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I cannot say I will be following any further titles from this development studio.  "

												I really wanted to like this game. Being a big fan of what it's trying to mimic, Dungeon keeper 2. It falls short in every aspect that made the other game great. The base building in the campaign is severely restricted, indestructable blocks everywhere. It's way too fast paced, especially compared to what it's supposed to be the spiritual successor of. It has far too many gimmicky functions that just makes it more complicated than it has to without adding any fun to it whatsoever. The narrator talks constantly, to the point where you want to strangle him. A plus though is that it's the same guy who voice acted the mentor in DK2 just that he is now incredibly irritating instead of helpful and witty. You might like it if you have nothing to compare it to but if you're a fan of DK2 and you're expecting a DK3 you'll be disappointed.			"

I hope the team become the next Bullfrog group but this time keep going. Looking forward to buying expansions in the future.Give this game a couple of patches and it will be smoothed out. its just released 1.0 if you check out most games that get release now adays they are patched a few times in the first few weeks. due to the vast wealth of variety in P.C's and problems from this.              these guys cared for this game and it shows , its not a kickstarter rip off like most people are getting conned on .

												'Dungeon Keeper'. Yeah. You can't escape the fact that this is the game that you buy if you wanted a Dungeon Keeper 3 (or a decent DK2).  You will typically start the game looking for a creature portal, building rooms for sleeping, eating and training, and finding the starting gold vain. Nothing new there.But this game stands strong in it's own right. Obviously, it just isn't quite DK. Hating it for this seems to be a hobby for many fans. But the game deserves to be treated as though it stands on it's own: and it certainly can. If DK had never existed, this game would be hailed as an innovative marvel. Instead, it is simply a fun, workable game using the same formula. An early example of a nice little innovation is the Tavern building: Minions will pay some of their wages back to you for cooked food and beer, but you need to keep it stocked, giving an interesting strategic choice. Things such as this give the game a feeling of depth without making it micro-manage hell.The game is worth the money. You will have fun playing a dungeon-building strategy game. It is not DK. Get over it.			"

We all want to look at new games with a fresh pair of eye and give it a real chance, but we often would compare it to DK2, and we would forget the things that plagued DK2 (crashes, improper resolutions, etc) and remember it as AMAZING! With this game, I think these guys have done an amazing job, they TRULY support their backers and players and this game is an amazing piece of work.			"

												First off, great work Stubterranean games! I've been a backer of this project from its inception, and other than the occasional 5 minute bout every six months to get a feel for how things were coming along I've all but avoided every piece of news about the game in the hopes that I wouldn't spoil myself for release.I'm a long time fan of the Dungeon Keeper series and fondly remember as a 10 year old sinking entire school holidays into figuring out how to deal with digging into clusters of level 10 Samurais. Dungeon Keeper has and always will have a place on my hard drive alongside many of the Bullfrog classics, back when Peter Molyneux could keep up with his big ideas. How the mighty have fallen! Anyway my review ;It's no secret that this game is a spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper, and while I want to keep in mind that it is it's own beast and I shouldn't directly compare for the sake of biasing myself, inevitably, and inescapably, this is something that will be part of this review. Thankfully whether that's right or wrong, WftO in my opinion has nailed the atmosphere extremely well. The background hum of dank dungeon corridors and the deep, thumping beat of your dungeon heart, alongside your insidious sounding, witty assistant has thrown me back to my schooldays. Dungeon design itself I have mixed feelings about. There doesn't seem to be as much of an incentive to place down traps or dig your dungeon out in areas to encompass rooms and a necessity to mine out entire areas to make use of the tiles you get is apparant. I feel like the actual map sizes don't compliment the number of rooms given particularly well, even if the rooms themselves are well thought out in terms of theme and function. Something as simple as converting particular rooms and their functions into room addons may be able to accomodate this where it makes sense - The Sanctuary's functions placed in the centre of a library with an expensive altar for example, or unlocking an arena pen to attract your Beast Master which you could then place on the grounds of an expansive and somewhat barren Beast Lair to fill it out. I would assume at least for the campaign, fiddling with map sizes would require a horrendous amount of work, so combining rooms with a usefulness that seems somewhat saturated would possibly be a good direction. Some rooms feel a little empty and as a whole the sheer number of room types doesn't translate well to the room you tend to have on each map.The maps themselves from a campaign standpoint are well thought out, the variation of mission types is welcome and I'm glad as it brings a particular flavour to each map which allows you to apply your creativity in different ways. Dungeon planning was always a big part of Dungeon Keeper and I feel like the variation offered in each map is similar enough to give you that ""lets get to work, I got this"" feel, without making everything too samey and keeping you on your toes somewhat.My biggest gripe is creatures and battle. I have found myself a few times leaving rally flags sitting up against an enemy keeper after all but wiping each other out, resulting in a 30 minute long battle that pumps every level 1 spawn on either side into one place until something ever so slightly tips the balance. It doesn't feel decisive enough to be satisfying, as does the level increases for each minion. Level 5 and 6 creatures feel somewhat irrelevent, especially when you consistently go up against them in the campaign with swathes of level 1s, and having a level 10 creature doesn't have that feeling of acomplishment that DK had. There is a feeling of overwhelming higher level units which again is not a good thing - I just feel like something is missing when it comes to how satisfying this is. I feel like more emphasis should be placed on the power of each level and battles should feel a little more decisive, in return I'd welcome a higher difficulty although I understand if some people would be put off by this.Another couple pointers is the minimap. More clarity would be helpful, as would a little more intuitiveness in regards to what's going on where. And the hand! The actual reference point is lost on the hand and I really feel this needs redesigned to better handle some of the UI. The rally flags on the left for example require pinpoint precision to the point where the concentration to do so successfully is immersion breaking, and I regularly find myself missing torture racks when I try to drop heroes, even when it feels otherwise.Bugs I don't particularly want to go into - Every time I check my downloads on Steam there's another massive patch and I'm quite happy to hold off negativity regarding this (which other than a restart of a map due to a broken ritual doesn't bother me. If you're playing this kind of game specifically to win the map you're on then I suggest you sit back, relax and enjoy letting your creativity run wild instead!), but it's nice to see so much work getting put into addressing issues that other players may have a harder time dealing with.All in all, WftO is a great spiritual successor to DK, most definitely one of the best, you can see from the outset that the team really understands the intricacies and have most definitely made it their own while paying homage. I love to see what happens next and all in all I'm very satisfied with backing Subterranean.Whether you're an old player or new to the whole concept, I suggest you take a look, regardless of whether it's for nostalgia or just for a new experience. I hold DK in a VERY high regard and consider Bullfrog part of a golden age which wasn't swamped by corporate fatcats, and true creativity was something to be welcomed and encouraged. I'm very happy to see a dev team capture the essence of this in a way that really pays homage to the concept as a whole. A modern DK has been a long time coming and I'm glad to say it's almost there. Just a little more work Subterranean, a touch more clarity and you got this.Keep up the good work, you won over a venerable Keeper!			"

												Pfffff okay, here goes.I played Dungeon Keeper 2 almost non-stop for an inconceivable amount of time. After which, I wondered if they were going to make a Dungeon Keeper 3. I was elated to hear that the answer was ""yes and no"". There would be a Dungeon Keeper 3, but it wouldn't be *called* Dungeon Keeper 3.This game lives up to and surpasses my wildest expectations. It's fun, comical, challenging, and intense. This studio did an absolutely incredible job on this game, and I highly recommend it.That being said, you should be prepared for a few bugs and glitches, at least at the time of this review. I am quite certain that they will get everything resolved at some point, but at the moment I've had to handle a few hair-pull worthy issues. At one point, when hitting the ESC key to save my game, the game froze and eventually crashed on me. In another instance, two of my minions appeared to be stuck in a lake. They were wandering around in circles incessantly, clearly befuddled by why their master had abandoned them. Not to worry, though. A quick spanking or three sent them back on their merry way.Overall, I highly recommend this game. I paid 36$ for the Underlord Edition and do not regret my purchase in the least, despite a few hiccups that are presently in the game.			"

												While this is a better spiritual successor to the Dungeon Keeper series than it's competition, it's still launched in an inacceptable state. Just because we're in a time where it's possible to patch after launch, it doesn't mean it's fine to launch a game full of filler text, rampant bugs and incomplete content with the excuse that they're patching constantly. To add salt to the wound, I bought the upgrade only to find out absolutely nothing of the upgrade has been implemented yet. Regardless of how good the games Subterranean Games creates are months after release, I'd think long and hard before purchasing anything from them in the future.			"

												War for the Overworld is essentially a Dungeon Keeper 2 remake with a heavy emphasis on blitzing your enemy. At this point, I have made it to level 12 and have yet to actually enjoy making a dungeon as the game has kept me locked in with impenetrable rock and busy fending off attackers from minute one. I tried out skirmish mode in the hope that it would allow for more relaxed dungeon building, but yet again, the AI focused solely on blitzing my dungeon core before I even realized I had to unlock every room in my tool panel before being able to use it.If you loved Dungeon Keeper 2, and you love blitzing your enemy then this game is for you. If you loved Dungeon Keeper and enjoyed building dungeons, then Dungeons and Dungeons II are more your style but they are still entirely different games.Pros:Fairly Evil NarratorDK2 styleDark HumorCons:Blitz heavyDK2 Style InterfaceToo Much Impenetrable rockEnemies can dig through your walls "

												Core game is a pretty good attempt at a ""Dungeon Keeper 3"". Closer to DK2 than to DK1 in atmosphere, graphical style and gameplay. Core campaign is lackluster, level design is mediocre and it's very easy. Expansion campaign, however, is enjoyable and well thought out. It's short though, just 4 levels and still too easy.Monster abilities are not well presented and monsters have a lot less character than DK1/2.Balance wise vampires are too strong and leveling is too easy.Multiplayer is completely broken as clients crash after 20-60 minutes into the game. Defenses are too weak, you're usually dead if you lose a fight in multiplayer.Summary: This game is like DK2 for me, it's a good game but doesn't capture the same feeling as DK1. I recommend it but if you're buying it to play with friends then make sure they patched the multiplayer bug first.			"

												Updated ReviewI tend not to like games that stay in early access for 2 years as this one did then gets released unfinished. It defeats the point of early access in my book. It is now July 2015, 4 months after War for the Overworld was released and it finally has enough Skirmish maps to make it worth playing in single player. An update to Unity 5 seems to have improved performance too.It has enough units, powers and spells to keep most dungeon keeper fans happy, and it brings enough of its own tricks to the table so it cannot be accused of being a straight forward clone of the old classic. If it has any problem it is that it has too many rooms and monsters for most maps, you will find your self without the room to the build them all. So your going to have to choose what you want and what you do not want.Previously I recommended this game but only just, stating a lack of maps and other unfinished features meant you would be left waiting to play it because it was not finished.Also, previously, I said 7 out of 10 on metacritics user score was about right, it is now at 7.3 and rising on metacritics because the game is finally playable. In it is current state it is worth about an 8. Though the campaign pretty much sucks with its timers and shows a distinct lack of imagination, mind you so do the new maps. What is it with devs these days and their symetrical maps ?Recommended.... finally...			"

												Love this game, feels like the next ""Dungeon Keeper"" which players of the originals will notice the little nods to its roots.+Plenty of content+Home Realm (Build at your leisure and unleash waves of enemies)+Humor+Variant Underlords (Each once has a different look to it and the workers)-Fast paced-Skirmish maps included are small-Short CampaignThis is a great game, but I spent alot of time playing DK1 and DK2, and the way WrtO differs seems to be in its pace, more so in skirmish against AI, the thing I enjoyed about DK was the slower pace, once you got past the tutorial levels you would normally start on one huge map which you had to spend time gathering gold and leveling up your minions, where as this one kinda forces you to play fast and with limited space, so theres no extravagant massive rooms you can build since you really need to use the space you have effectively.The units themselves are very nicely done, but once again it lacks the content DK had, so if you dont know, on DK you had to manage your minions, and by this I mean there wasnt just a single minion per room so for instance in DK if you got a Fly and a Spider, you would normally have to try and keep them in seperate lairs because if they bump into once other when they arent training or using rooms they would attack and try to kill one another, this presenting a challenge if you wanted to keep both but served as something you really needed to keep an eye on, whereas in WftO there is just one type of minion per room and a empire version, none of your minions conflict everyone gets along very nicely.Now the ""Vampire"" unit I do like very much, having to keep a steady supply to keep them appeased and in return you get a very powerful unit, so here im going to refer to DK1 and you can proberly guess I mean the ""Horned Reaper"" which was the games icon, which the Vampire unit itself is a nod to, both units need 3 units sacrificed to get one in return, whereas the vampire just needs food to stay happy, the Horned Reaper, well he was undeniably the strongest unit in the game but came with the biggest price, if you held him for to long he got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you slapped him he got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if he was bored he got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and he would begin slaughtering your own minions for the damn well fun of it, and a level 10 version of him would wipe out most of your minons, which would make you either decide on building a seperate mini-dungeon and lock him in it til you was ready to fight or having to get rid.Refering to the pervious point there was the ""Temple"" room, which you sacrificed units to make ones you needed or the Horned Reaper, but it served a second function, any creatures rebelling or Horned Reaper going on a rampage you could drop them on the outskirts of this room and they would pray and calm down over a period of time, now when they rebel in WftO you pretty much have to take them down, I could be wrong but at this present time I cant see anyway to calm them down, showered them with gold/food and they still wont revert from rebellion status.All in all the thing about these games is feeling like the bad guy, and DK did that great, WftO goes down the same road but doesnt give me that ""Evil"" vibe, aslong as you have food and gold, all your minions will hold hands and slip to battle, but here I am just remembering how much I loved DK, this game gets frequent patches and updates so who knows, maybe it will end up that way, but it is a great game and the closest ive seen to being a ""Dungeon Keeper"" for a long time  and is definatly worth playing, more so if you loved the DK games. TL;DRWftO is a great game, I ♥♥♥♥♥ and moan about how much I miss ""Dungeon Keeper"".  :D			"

												So I've never played Dungeon Keeper before but have been hearing how great the game is. So I've played Dungeons 2 and have enjoyed it a lot and found the idea and gameplay intriguing. But reviews from Dungeons 2 also point to War for the Overworld, so I check this game out as well, since a recent Steam friend made a review of this game. Both Dungeons 2 and War for the Overworld are two entirely different beasts. Sure, they both try to follow one theme, that is, managing a dungeon, but the way both games play is completely different and is a matter of preference. I really recommend both games, but Wars for the Overworld is heavily focused on the dungeon aspect of the genre, very gritty, dark, but abnormally delightful. Wars for the Overworld is a little more serious than Dungeons 2 which is not a bad thing. The game is VERY polished in my honest opinion. AGAIN, Steam reviews are lying to me, I see all these little nit-picking and negative claims yet when I play the game it feels fantastic. You can tell there was a lot of work put into this game, and being a player who has no experience with Dungeon Keeper, I can safely say I like what this game has to offer. I've always glossed over all sorts of dungeon builders because 1) they usually aren't my thing, and 2) they are usually old and outdated games that will have too many technical problems to run. That is not the case with War for the Overworld, this is a very much a polished and stable game. Again, I have a decent rig, but this game surprsiingly runs well on my computer, so all those announcements and news of optimization by the developers is beliveable as the game is very stable. When I first viewed the screenshots I was worried that I would not be able to run this game because it looked gorgeous. In-game they are even better, and feel that this is a very good product. Something I held off for a long time because of all the bad games I've run into that have been released in 2015-2016, and marked this off something that was bland or uninterseting. Turns out I've been missing out all this time, and if you are reading this review, then yes, you are missing out on something good. This is a great game, I highly recommend you give this game a try.			"

												*revision*Patch 1.1 took care of most of the issues that were keeping me from enjoying the game; i'm having quite a bit of fun now.  i appreciate the continued attention to this game and i can now honestly recommend it!As with most people who own this game, I'm a huge fan of the Dungeon Keeper games and was looking forward to this one.  In it's current state however, i cannot suggest this game to anyone.  Clearly unfinished, this game has too many glaring issues;-terrible AI-glitchy/slow UI-crashes-walls/ dungeon setup becomes useless as fortified walls break down easily-Campaign levels are short in supply and lack difficulty; little strategy is needed to blow through all 13.WFTO has alot of potential but seems as though it was rushed to release once the developers hit the halfway mark.  With some tweaks and updates this game could easily be worth the $30 price.  At the moment however, I regret purchasing this game.			"

								I have been waiting for sooo long a new Dungeon Keeper (3) and this is the game, even if it is not the official license.Dungeon Keeper 2 was my favorite game, and this one is good,BUT this is not optimised at all and the game is hardly laggy, there are only 1 map with a story and ennemies (lot's o' but still), 1 tutorial map which is also buggy, there are a lot of graphics bugs, AND finaly there are 3 sandboxes without ennemies.But you have to know that this is a very very EARLY ALPHA TEST GAME !!! DO NOT EXPECT ANY FULL CONTENT, because there are not for now.Thus I LOVE Dungeon Keeper but this game is not full yet,  and know that I understand that ( even if they had 14 years to make this game ).

												It's Dungeon Keeper 3....and it's AWESOME!The good:War for the Overworld is Dungeon Keeper 3 in all but name! Richard Ridings (of the original Dungeon Keeper games) is back voicing the mentor, telling you to get building glorious dungeons to house your minions. The Empire is banging on your dungeon doors and you need all the help you can get.This all add's up to a lot of fun than fans of the original Dungeon Keeper games never thought we would see again all because a small but very solid dev team Kickstarted this game and I'm so very glad they did.There has been a constant stream of patches and interaction from the devs since I purchased the game and to be honest, they are putting big comapny names to shame in how fast they are to respond to issues.The bad:The game is still a bit rough around the edges and unfinnished in parts. Certain parts of the game have yet to be finnished fully (such as skirmish mode which is to be added later this year) and there is still a lot of ingame tweaking done by the devs. Save games can also be a risk as a quick patch can render a save file unuseable (though thankfully it only means restarting a level). It's also one of those games where you'll find yourself binge playing through the whole thing if you're not careful.So..should you buy this game? Most certainly. The main campaign is finnished and multiplayer works. The unfinnished parts are just..extras. It's great fun and it's one of those rare titles where the devs are acctually doing what they say they will do.Now get to work Underlord!			"

								When this game is finished it will be a great game. Unfortunately, at the moment, there is not much actual gameplay. A solitary single player mission and a few sandbox maps will give you plenty to get an idea of what the game will become. Just not a whole heap to do until then. Worth getting imho if you are happy to be helping fund the development, but if you expect a lot of game for your money don't get it now. Wait for a little more development.			"

												This game was originally started by people with a lot of heart, who had bitten of way more than they could chew in the year after their kickstarter campaign. And yet even when things seemed to go completely bust they persevered for the sake of their love for the game and their dedication to the community. And after a rocky release this has seriously paid off. This game deserves far more (online) players than it already has and can be considered complete enough. If you are familiar with either RTS or strategy management games you'll be able to learn this very quickly.For some actual reviewing:- A good story and a fun single player campaign.- Fleshed out game mechanics with good balancing.- Precious humorous gems provided, mostly by the beloved voice actor of one of the major characters. He has a voice men would sell their souls for.- Balanced and potentially pretty competitive multiplayer.Very much recommended!			"

								Great game, but 32 bits users beware, the current version of the game will not run on 32 bit systems, they should of had another patch on the 12th Jan to sort the problem but as of yet no sign of it. The game will work if you choose to opt to use a previous version, but the game will not work since the new patch, it will load up but at the main screen you will just see the main screen nothing else to start the game.Other than that if you like games like Dungeon keeper you will love this game, the new update brings a lot more to the game ( I have not played the new update as yet due to 32 bit problem ) We are told on the forums that they have sorted they just need to send the new update to steam.For the price you cannot go wrong, give it a go you wont be dissapointed.

												I am a very big supporter of this game and all that was the original Bullfrog studios and Dungeon Keeper gameplay. I feel this game is really an exact replica of the forgotten game. There is not much innovation to the gameplay and for me that is ok. The original had a great setup. The biggest issue that it brings is manipulation to the game balance engine. It is constantly being tweaked and I have great faith in the development team to keep it that way. During the early betas from when I donated to the Kickstarter, the game has come a long way. I am very happy with this purchase and regret nothing. 3.5/4 stars. same gameplay same music same fun as the original series. everything that dungeon games have been copying since. Slight unbalance to the game engine that is getting patched religiously.			"

												Being a Fan of the old Dungeon Keeper games from way back when might make me a bit bias when it comes to this game. It is exactly like those classic games that i dearly loved playing when i was growing up. Theres nothing more satisfying that slapping imps until they explode for no other reason than to simply do it. Because, your the bad guy, what do you care what other people think? but the raw perspective of this game is what i enjoy. build your dungeon, fight the hero's be the bad guy for once, and just enjoy the raw destruction you wrought. It's a great way to destress. (slapping imps really helps with that too. just sayin.) If, you've ever enjoyed games like Tropico, Sim City, Ceaser, and at the same time, enjoy a good old fashion RTS combat system. This is your game to play.The only thing this game is really missing is the hillariousness of the Original Dungeon Keeper games. Also where's my Casino Tile? I wanna make my minions gamble all the money i pay them away and refill my coffers the old fashion way.			"

												Short version:Pros:-Same voice actor from the original Dungeon Keeper and Keeper 2, Mr. Richard Ridings, who does a great job!-Looks like a Dungeon Keeper game-Gameplay generally feels like a Dungeon Keeper game-Play the ""bad guy""-Dig out a dungeon and stock rooms to attract creatures and then attack the enemy-Torture Chamber is fully operational-Devs are patching bugs and paying attention to player requestsCons (at the time of this review):-Some features are not available yet (sandbox mode & multiplayer)-Creature path finding can be somewhat haphazard-Rooms and creatures do not have enough detail about what they do (still calls things ""prop x"")-Possession can be difficult to control and once in possession mode no clear explanation about the controls-Memory Leak? Game tends to slow down a lot over the course of playing and occasionally crashes (devs stated they are looking into solving this problem)War for the Overworld is a refreshing change in the standard RTS genre given that you build a dungeon and attack the ""good guys"". As many know, WftO is the spiritual successor to Dungeon Keepers 1 and 2. This is the game I have been looking for since finishing DK 1&2 in 2000 (15 years!). I am sincerely happy that EA has allowed Subteranean Games to create this clear clone of the Dungeon Keeper franchise.Do not get me wrong, War for the Overworld is not just a facelift for Dungeon Keeper 2. It does have it's own story if you are a plot addict like me. However, the look and gameplay feels just like DK2 on the surface, but is a bit buggy with path finding which I expect will get ironed out. If you have been looking for another Dungeon Keeper look no further and pick this game up since it is what we wished that ""Dungeons"" was or ""Overlord 1&2"" were. It is certainly worth the $30 USD (half of what EA would charge if they made it, and it would not be as good) even though it does have some flaws as detailed above. I expect that these flaws will be polished away with a bit of time since these devs are extremely devoted to supporting their product and are enthusiasts themselves for the Dungeon Keeper series.Buyer with a low-end system beware (i.e. less than 8 GB RAM and less than a Quad Core processor running at 2.0 GHz) as this game is somewhat CPU and definitely memory intensive which manifests itself particularly during battles. I know this because I recently had to upgrade my system to run smoothly (I was capped at 3.25GB RAM and it bottlenecked my Quad Core AMD Phenom II @3.2GHz processor). If your system does not meet the minimum requirements, either upgrade or expect slow downs, stability issues, crashing, and even unplayability during gameplay, and don't downvote simply because your PC cannot handle it (I see this too often).All these things being said, I cannot recommend this game enough. WftO is exactly as advertised with regard to being the spiritual successor to DK 1&2. I played this game when it was in early access and enjoyed it then and now even more. This is the only game that I have ever been happy with after purchasing in early access, and I have purchased a fair few.  "

Early Access Review
								At the moment I DO NOT recommend this game. However I see it's potential and over time I can recommend it. There are probably more cons so far than pros. Constant bugs, HUGE fps issues, no save, no multiplayer, only one mission. I know that the developers plan on adding more missions, a save, a multiplayer. However it has been over one year sense initial release of the beta and we still see no improvement BESIDES UI changes and more rooms/creatures. If you are a Dungeon Keeper fan you will love this game however I think you should wait till they properly finish this game. There are so many bugs and fps spikes its ridiculous and game breaking. (not sarcasm). At times every creature including your imps will freeze and do nothing, i tried all i can to get them to move. I picked them up, i slapped them, i controlled them, and they still wouldn't move. Also, once you build a large dungeon and have an army the lag is ridiculous. Even if you can handle skyrim on max settings you will have issues with the frames reaching a max 10 frames if you're lucky. However once you start a game you should have a solid 30 frames or more. Final Verdict: Save your money, get it upon release. To many bugs and problems at the moment.			"

If you're a DK1 and 2 diehard fan, you can most likely ignore these flaws (Like me)If you're not, give it a patch or two before you buy it, mostly because it isnt done yet.

												I like the faithfulness of this game to the original. They kept the flavor of the original game, making it easy to make the transition. So far as I could tell, there's all the same elements of the original game, dungeon building, room optimizing, cheating your minions out of their pay, slapping and torturing them, etc. There's also some very good new features, like control groups and invisible-fence-for-imps, that were missing from the original. The graphical update makes it a very nice looking game, although by no means cutting edge or demanding. This does mean, however, that the game is not much of a change from the original. There's no radically new gameplay, just some tweaks, a graphical update and a new story. Also, the minimap is unnecessarity pixelated, and the game uses so much memory! It uses 2.5GB more memory than Tomb Raider 2013, and about 1GB more memory than vanilla Rome II. I can't imagine what all that memory is used for, since Rome II handles more units and has better texture. Given this and some other reviews, I'm inclined to think that optimization is not very good, and systems with slower/less RAM will stutter due to paging issues.			"

												As a game concieved in opposition to EA's embarassing handling of Dungeon Keeper, aiming to recreate the series before it's (mobile gaming) demise, War for the Overworld is pretty much exactly what you'd expect it to be.Conceptually, asthetically and mechanically, War for the Overworld is a like for like facsimile of Dungeon Keeper. Many of the rooms and creatures are nigh identical to their original counterparts in terms of function, being distinguisable only by name and appearence. (For example, Imps are now Workers, The Dark Mistress is now the Succcubus, the Workshop is now the Foundry).This also brings me neatly onto War for the Overworld's first problem. The art direction lacks the imagination and character of it's forebearer. Everything looks and works like Dungeon Keeper, but less interesting. The UI is also enormous and clumsy to use. Like every other part of the game, it attempts to mimic Dungeon Keeper; but Dungeon Keeper's UI was never very good in the first place.The biggest problem War for the Overworld faces, however, is it's often cripplingly poor performance issues. This should not be a technically demanding game, and on launch, runs perfectly. Sadly, usually at around 30 minutes into a session, things start stuttering and spluttering to a horrendous degree, rendering things unplayable and requiring a restart to rectify.I also encountered a couple of instances where campaign progress was blocked due to building related bugs, although these were also fixed by restarting the game.Now that I've gotten the bad things out of the way, onto the good. War for the Overworld does not EXACTLY mimic it's source of inspiration. The major innovation it adds is that of Beasts. Unlike your minions, beasts cannot work in your rooms and will not flee from combat, allowing them to serve as early game fodder to keep your dungeon secure as you build up better forces.Sound is also a high point. Ambient dungeon sounds and minion noises are all excellent and the hiring of Richard Ridings to reprise his role of narrator adds to the ""Dungeon Keeper-y"" feel of everything.All in all, War for the Overworld isn't as good as Dungeon Keeper or even it's slightly inferior sequel. I would argue that it's still worth picking up, though. Both for the ease of getting a Dungeon Keeper fix without having to mess around with DosBox or Compatibility modes and also just to support the passionate efforts of the Dungeon Keeper fans who made it.

												Now, there's a decent amount of people who have played Dungeon Keeper and Dungeon Keeper 2 who also grabbed this game. I am one of those people. I LOVE the DK franchise.  Anyways, going to try not mentioning DK/DK2 from here on out. Well, until the end, anywayWar for the Overworld is a dungeon building and managing god game.  You create your dungeon, create rooms, get minions, and level them up to get an advantage over your enemies. You create room, traps, use spells and Constructs. Depending on what you like and what your playstyle is, you can use or keep from using certain rooms or minions in sync with your playstyle. Hell, you could go all turtle style on your enemy if you wanted to. This game also gives you a decent amount of defensive structures you can use, but from your limited resources, you won't be able to spam them all over the map. Which wouldn't be fun in the first place. Imagine a game where the enemy has turrets ALL over the map. Personally I'd just give the person a win and leave the current game. :PEvery game/movie/series has cliché's. This one is no different in that aspect. Lies, deceit, hero(es)/villain(s) gone batshit insane, plot twists, manipulation, 180 degree turn in personality, and so on and so forth. The usual. Though you can still get genuinely surprised by plot twists. Hell, I can see them coming miles away, and still get surprised. Must be the way the plot twists are handled. This game breathe new life into the dungeon creating and managing-genre, which were severely lacking since the before-mentioned franchise. Which is kinda sad, as this type of genre is very fun. Now, this game was officially released on the 4th of April, 2015. Personally though, I feel as if this game is kinda still in the ""just came outta beta"" phase, where they add content, fix bugs/glitches, etc. I love free stuff. Hell, even if it's paid DLC(as long as it's cheap enough) I will most likely buy it, though free DLC/content is always welcome, especially for this unpolished gem of a game. In maybe a year and potent and efficient polishing, this game could and will be a lot more than what it is now, and even more worth the money I spent on this unpolished-so-far gem.Now, onto pros and cons:Pros:+ Fun to play+ Real Dungeon Keeper(2) atmosphere, and graphics to match+ Hilarious voice acting (Love ya, Richard!)+ Very good camera options+ AI is fully capable of tearing you a new one+ Large creature/minion variation+ Can train minions/creatures to max level+ Infinite in terms of different plays you can do+ Pretty fun campaign, though not exactly jaw-dropping+ Did I mention voice acting?+ Cool soundtracks+ Devs are talkative AND are both responsive and positive with feedback you give them+ Updates are scheduled and released and regular intervals, unlike for some other games I know+ Very interesting map designs+ All kinds of different map tiles, and how you interact with them+ The devs and a lot of us are passionate about this genre, and are huge fans of the Dungeon Keeper franchise (Omg, I mentioned it, please don't hit me)+ The mouse is a hand, which truly every evil Underlord(Keeper) needs!Cons:- Lacking in terms of campaign duration- Not possible to change difficulty for campaign- Can be a bit difficult at times to select a minion/creature, or even simply hover over it to see status- Lacking multiplayer/skirmish maps- Only 4-players max currently, hoping/wanting to see more- Missing tooltip for when selecting AI's during skirmish, what their preferred strategies are, etc.- Seems laggy at times- A tad lacking in content, but this will come in time- Better minion/Creature overview is lacking- Kinda hard to select tabs at times because of small UI buttons (Rooms, Spells, etc.)- Some of the mechanics in the game are poorly described/explained- The mouse is at times hard to use, as the ingame hand you play with is a bit weird in terms of unit, room and environment interactionConclusion:This game is good, fun, and catches the DK/DK2 type of gameplay. It's not perfect. Nothing is. But if you are thinking spiritually, this game could one day become the spiritual successor of Dungeon Keeper 2.Anyways, this is my short review of War for the OverworldCheers,Yakamaru			"

												As a huge dungeon keeper fan I was very excited to see a game produced which is clearly a huge tribute to an amazing classic. However at the time of first looking at this game it had mostly negative reviews, so I stayed away. Checking back recently I noticed that suddenly the reviews were hugely positive, with people praising the developers most recent updates (1.1 and 1.2) and saying the game was now polished and worth playing. Due to the Halloween sale I picked it up to give it a try. I am not disappointed!This game takes all the things that made dungeon keeper great and maintains the legacy. It felt so familiar to me that it was like playing dungeon keeper all over again. The campaign has some challenging levels to keep you on your toes and a great entertaining narrated voice over (From the same voice actor that did DK2!!) A small gripe I have is how insane the AI is, on skirmish they somehow always end up with 3-4x as many minions as you within minutes. I am not sure if this is because I suck or because the AI is just mentally good but it does make my desire to get all the achievements a huge challenge! Overall this game is very polished and any dungeon keeper fan should try it and love it! One thing I have noticed which makes me incredibly supportive (Supportive enough to write a review, which I have never done before) Is that the developers listen! every review I check the developers have commented saying that they will work on that, they seem to genuinely care for the player base, which these days is a rare thing! So Kudos devs for listening to players and actually acting on it! You have a happy customer from me and another positive review. Keep it up!			"

												Old Review: For anyone who has a love for the Dungeon Keeper games of old (not including EA's recent disgustingly obvious cashgrab with the Dungeon Keeper game for iOS) then this is the game for you.  They even have Richard Ridings doing the narration as he did for DK1 & 2!! It's like Dungeon Keeper all over again but without the soul sucking presence of a corporate publisher involved to make it suck with their stupid marketing surveys. Awesome!So I finally got around to playing the official 1.0 release of this game that launched back in April? I think, and I have to say that it feels pretty good to know that my original review during its time in SEA still holds up to the last twenty-ish or so hours of gameplay I've experienced in the past couple days.  Even though I've yet to encounter something that even comes close to the awesomeness of the Horned Reaper character from the original DK series, WFO is definitely the DK successor I've been wanting since my obsession with replaying DK2 ended so many years ago. One negative point brought up in the more critical reviews that I've read so far stated something like there were too many spells, rituals, constructs, etc and that they themselves only needed one or two spells to complete the game so every other option they didn't use at the time was considered to be unnecessary content.  I agree that there are a lot more options than there ever was with the previous DK series but all the same, I find that having a lot of variety helps the replay value of the game.  As much as I hate to say it, I do think that the narrator is a bit too chatty some times and as much as I love Richard Ridings from the DK series, it did get to be a bit much at times.   Yet all the same, I can't blame the developers for wanting to get as much mileage out of the legacy asset of RR's voice as they possibly could because so much of the DK vibe comes from his voice alone.So anyway, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the Dungeon Keeper series or to anyone who thinks the game looks interesting because it is really well done and I find myself easily losing hours while playing, which is exactly what I would expect from the spiritual successor of Dungeon Keeper.

												This game has a lot of potential, but in no way it is ready to be released. As much as I love DK series and this being a spiritual successor of it, I absolutely cannot recommend this game to anyone until it is at least playable. I remember playing an earlier release, and I thought that with the newest patches, at least some of the game breaking issues were fixed. On the contrary, new issues have been introduced. This time I cannot scroll left or right, so I have to use the silly WASD to move around the map. Some cutscenes freeze, such as the one about shifting bond in the fifth level and disable scrolling altogether. Have you guys actually tested scrolling? Was this part of your QA items at all??? Shame on you for using paying users as testers where it should have been your job in the first place. At least now textures do not flicker when you reload the game and the gameplay does not come to a grinding halt. Please test your product before releasing it.			"

Still needs a little bit of fine tuning (just bugs) but they've done well with the look, sound, the famous voiceover guy is back :D campaign is cool and some really tactical skills in the game now. Can cause some crazy RTS chaos. Soon to be a multiplayer lobby apparently.			"

												This game brings back all the nostalgia from the good old Dungeon Keeper 2. It's close to release and the developers seems to be very determined to give their customers what they want. I've done my research and i'm safely putting my faith in Subterranean Games. BUT, it hasn't been released yet so i need to give you the present news of the game. There is little content and no finished campaign.You still have skirmish and a new mode (Survival) that you can enjoy but it isn't enough for 28€ in my opinion.The gameplay is coming out as fairly finished. I've encountered one or two crashes and maybe a few glitches but it's nothing that ruins your game completely, just minor obstacles that are easily fixed.I do hope that i will see more minions, buildings, spells and traps. Even though i feel that the current situation with your variety of building is enough i do want more. It may or may not be the way i want it to be but i'm going to recommend it. I think you should wait until the release of this game and see where it stands though. But as i said, i have faith in these developers (something that doesn't come easily these days).EDIT;The game has finally been released and the full campaign is open. However, the game still contains alot of bugs and a few unfinished touches. I'm sad to say that it wasn't ready for release just yet. They are releasing ALOT of hotfix patches though and that makes me a little happy. Since the release they've already released about 7 hotfix patches and that's great but it also gives you a perspective of how many bugs there are to be fixed. These 7 patches fixed alot of bugs but there are still alot more to be done! I would still recommend that you all wait a month or two to see where the game lies and how smooth the gameplay is.			"

												This is a great game!I tried WftO right around release and was disappointed with how it turned out. I was hoping for a true successor to Dungeon Keeper and this was not it at the time. This style of game seems plagued with hit-or-miss difficulty that's either far too easy (Dungeons) or far too hard (WftO at release). There was a case to be made that WftO went too far into hardcore RTS territory and lost touch with what made the DK games so appealing. That's besides the lack of polish, bugs, and scores of QoL issues. The devs are responsive, however, and have worked incredibly hard to turn their initially flawed game into a real gem and it shows across the board.If you are worried that this game doesn't support the slower, meandering gameplay of the old DK series, don't be. The satisfying gameplay loop of slowly building up your dungeon until the layout is ""just so"" then using a variety of cool toys/minions/strategies to attack the enemy or draw them into traps is present in spades. There are faster-paced more demanding modes for those that enjoy that too.Which is another point, there's a LOT of content here for a low price. There are several modes favoring different gameplay (aggressive or slow), mutators to customize game behavior, numerous campaigns (normal, my pet dungeon, heart of gold, crucible) and even if you exhaust all of those, there's still a skirmish mode and a near-endless variety of Steam Workshop maps (thousands!). And that is excluding the upcoming AI revamp and one more large content DLC due this year or early-next.I bought it strictly for single-player (no intent to MP) and I cannot recommend this product highly enough. It's the new Dungeon Keeper!A few feedback points for the devs:- I was unable to start standard campaign without opening ports, the map was unresponsive to a click that would normally take me to mission lobby. This appears to be a known issue and was resolved online, but it may leave an unpleasant first impression.- Increased enemy variety would be great, Empire seems like it would wear thin after a while. It's not a dealbreaker but would be nice. Maybe even some neutral creeps, mini bosses, or areas where you can hire/build neutral units (if you control the spot, like an altar) would be cool.			"

Introduction/Foreword:I am one of the many (or not so many? Dunno...) that owns this game since the Bedrock Beta so I can tell you pretty well some negative and positive things about this game, but mostly negative....First and foremost I must admit that the guys at Subterrenean Games are working hard and passionate, however there are - as mentioned before - some very negative things that destroy the enjoyability of this game for me and will probably also for you...About the Bedrock Beta:The Beta was actually an entire mess, there was almost nothing that actually really worked it even crashed regularly and gameplay lagged as hell...So that what was actually called a ""beta"" was actually a public alpha version, but this wouldnt be a major problem if Subterrenean wouldnt have rushed the game out.At release:The game has been hastly released with alot of bugs from the ""beta"", apart of the lack of optimization for systems other than the developers.  The next disappointment was that who purchased the underlord edition didnt got everything as advertised. The soundtrack for example was missing and there was also no advertised guide. The soundtrack was added later (you buy something but you dont get the product you paid for...), dunno about the guide and I also dont care anymore...After release:It took approximately 2 major updates (1.1 and 1.2) and several minor patches before, so that the game could be called ""somehow"" - and only somehow - a working game.The latest major update (version 1.3) with a retrospective view:Well, at release of the game (version 1.0) I've first started playing the single player campaign of WFTO, however I gave up on playing the SP campaign because the campaign wasnt very balanced apart of the bugged necromancer mission (I think that was level 8...).With 1.3 I was thinking about to give the SP campaign a new try, but before I wanted to play-test some skirmish matches against the AI because the long-awaited map-editor was also released with 1.3. That was a good chance to try both things...After creating my own map and playing it I've noticed a bugged minion and worker AI and a major slowdown of the FPS. I was really hoping with patch 1.3 that such performance and AI flaws would have disappeared but they didnt. Since the Bedrock Beta there were performance and AI problems. Of course they appeared less with every major update but the latest problems in 1.3 are enough for me, my patience is literally exhausted - especially if you go through this since the Bedrock Beta, sorry Subterranean but I'm fed up from this...To the ones who are thinking to buy this game (read the above and now read the below pros/cons):Pros:+ Richard Ridings as narrator+ Gameplay is almost the same as in DK1/2, although a bit faster than in the predecessors+ Sounds effects and sound atmosphere are very well done+ The AI is very efficient (but also see Cons)+ Different salutations by the narrator (Richard Ridings) at game startup, depending on the real computer clock+ Beasts are well chosen and animated+ (Patch 1.3): Map editor with mirroring functionCons:- Minion leveling isnt well balanced, there is also no visual difference between a lvl 1 minion and a lvl 10 minion except the number stating the minion level... a level 10 minion could really need some anabolica that should lead into a visual difference...- The skirmish AI is very efficient but NOT very smart, the skirmish AI is good in going on your nerves but if you counter the skirmish AI it doesnt really know how to handle this situation.- The skirmish AI doesnt use nor place any defenses (doors/traps)- The skirmish AI doesnt use/activates artifacts- I disagree on certain regular minions in regards of their look (chunder f.e. rather looks like a ugly thin toy and not big fat bad♥♥♥♥♥like a bile demon) but this ""look"" topic is a matter of taste...- There is almost always somewhere an AI bug destroying the enjoyability of this game and which also often leads into performance issues, although the campaign might be unaffected by this because the campaign is rather more scripted than based upon the skirmish AI...Conclusion:Let's sum it upBedrock Beta = Paid Alpha which was also known as Steam Early AccessWFTO 1.0 - 1.x = Paid - almost have it working stable but still being a - BetaWFTO 1.x - ? = Final stable release... (ETA?)All what I wrote sounds very negative but if you are a passionate DK 1 and/or DK 2 player and you still dont own WFTO you should get it in a sale. People that are interested in this game but never played a dungeon game like Dungeon Keeper before should wait maybe for the next 2-3 major updates. I will however start up the game again when the next major patch (1.4 maybe?) will arrive but until then I dont have the desire to start playing it again...			"

												WftO is definately a great spiritual successor to the DK series. 1.0 release does have bug issues, and the game does need a tad more polishing. But it's a very solid game, certainly keeping true to the DK gameplay with its own additions.Like most steam games, the people who dislike will have gone through all the negative reviews to upvote them but the majority are positive.Once the devs fix up a few bugs the negative reviews will be mostly invalid.

												I'm torn on this one. The game very much evokes the memories of Dungeon Keeper, but at its core it's an RTS that hasn't kept up to date with modern RTS innovations. I don't care about rotating the camera or, in honestly, zooming in and out. What I really want is a way to select and group minions by dragging over them. As it stands, the interface gets in the way of what could be an otherwise fun game.The primary voice actor is fantastic. The graphics are sufficiently pretty. It's just too cumbersome to be _fun_.

												I tried this game back when it was Early Access and it showed some promise. Decided to revisit it after release for another look. Well, I have.This game is so poorly-optimized as to be unplayable. The UI lags about 2-3 seconds behind your interactions with it. The tutorial level told me to cast the ""Call To Arms"" spell, which the UI didn't even present to me. (Then a few seconds later, said, ""congratulations!"" as if I had managed to cast it.) Things like casting a recall spell on a specific minion are virtually impossible, as they move faster than the UI allows you to cast.Despite setting the game to open fullscreen, every time I run it it draws a huge 1080p-sized window *inbetween* my two monitors. Why would it do that? Why would ever want to play a game that way?Keyboard keys won't work for scrolling the map. The only way to scroll the map is by sticking the mouse to one edge of it. This might be a setting in the UI, but I didn't want to spend the 26 minutes it would have taken to navigate to the options screen.In addition to all of that, this isn't Dungeon Keeper 3. It's just an exact clone of Dungeon Keeper II, only very slightly more high-resolution. You might as well just buy Dungeon Keeper II on Gog.com and play it instead.			"

												Ok,Ok, let's get a couple of things straight. First of all i have heard that this spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper,however I wasn't even born then;but i am a huge fan of management games and the RTS genre so i hope this review is unbiased with no nostalgia influencing the review.So what are the good points of this game? -Lots of content including spells,defences, rooms and so much more!-Great graphics-Chilling voice acting, mainly in the campaign-Minions are interesting with a good variety of abilities and character models-Huge tech tree-A variety of maps in the campaign-A variety of missions in the campaignOk, now for the cons-Buggy as hell-Pathfinding is stupid. Oh im sorry minion, walk through the ♥♥♥♥ing enemy dungeon to mine out one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wall-Oops, got a bit angry there... possession spell is poorly done-campaign is just one big tutorial-No maps what so ever outside of the campaign. (Make one where it is just large with no stone Mr Mod-maker)-Feels unfished-No multiplayer... really...soz 'ard I can't 1v1 u m9 wiv ma MLG rallie flagz.-overpriced for what you get.So in conclusion, War for the Overworld is unfinished, i would recommend it in the future when it is properly patched, but in it's current state i would not buy it unless it is on sale or you really, really want it. However it shows promise and could be 10/10 IGN when PROPERLY FINISHED!!!			"

												Like any Dungeon Keeper fanboy I was excited when news of this game reached my ears. Here was a promise to pay homage to a favorite game of mine from when I was way younger, a game that has had few of its like since it came out.This is what I expected: A dungeon building simulator where you build your lair, gather minions, train them, build defenses and then storm the opposition. To say that this is not what I received would be a lie but the thing is the game delivers things so clunkily that all enjoyment is simply sucked out of it. Yes, you do build your own fully functioning dungeon... assuming you can figure out the actual mechanics of the game, that being the logistics behind the rooms and how the minions interract with them. You can have lots of fun reading through half finished tool tips and placeholders and see if you can make sense of it.You do employ a workforce of diabolical minions... but again the game is not exactly forthcoming on details on how they function inside your dungeon and in combat which leads to cluster♥♥♥♥ combat scenarios in which you just pile your guys together and hope they come out on top.You do conquer realms and bring ruination to your enemies... but through a story that appears to be missing half of its cutscenes and animations and this is assuming that the game doesn't crash or go through constant memory leaks.I guess you could say that this game delivers everything that was expected, but it is done so badly that all the fun gets lost behind somewhere. There's a lot of good ideas here but the game doesn't take its time to explain how they work and some ideas never get used at all. "

												Like several other reviewers I´m put off because this can hardly be called a strategy game anymore.Yes, the developers were extremely unlucky with their campaign, Heart of Gold and lots of Steam-workshop-levels are much better.But the major problem for me is that fighting Empire is just boring because it´s always the same. Gets worse if you encounter lots of traps: They don´t do much damage, but it takes you ages to get through if fortified with Ramparts. Personally, I just send my Archon there to destroy them, do something else and take a look after an hour or so how my attack goes. How about more trap damage and less resistance?Dungeon Keeper 1 was fun for me when I played against a good AI-keeper because different to Empire other keepers could surprise you. You had to be quick to get rooms, neutral creatures, gold etc. without letting your defences down. Of course, the Dungeon Keeper AI was just♥♥♥♥♥♥ But you could write a skript with events for each map to determine their behaviour, ressources and to let them respond to your strategy. WFTO doesn´t give you any of those possibilities. The AI will always try to dig to you and attack you, even if it is seriously weaker than you. No chance to set it to ""builder"", ""defensive"" etc. So it´s always the same: Rush to train your creatures, build rooms to get good fighters, wait to retaliate the first attack and then destroy your opponent. Very boring. Might be better if you played against 2,3 or 4 AIs, but I´m already glad the game runs more or less on my brandnew (!) system if I play against 1 on a medium map (basic system requirements far more than matched). The developers obviously didn´t want us to be able to turn off at least  some of the most ressource consuming features like light effects, smoke, distortions... So be really careful: Unless your computer was made for gaming and is rather new, you won´t be able to play at least two third of the maps here on Steam.But even on these small or medium maps the game play isn´t much fun. Personally I think it´s a good idea to have Siege Shrines that allow you to dig through enemy walls if you´re playing with Replacement Earth. Otherwise it would be really frustrating. But I simply don´t understand why you and the AI are able to dig through walls even without, provided a little time. And it finally gets totally ridiculous if an Underminer, a low (!) level construct, can wipe away enemy walls in quite a range. So just don´t bother with fortifying your dungeon, it isn´t worth anything. It´s arm-as-fast-as-possible and clash, no other way of playing possible.Building a dungeon is fun because of the nice graphics and challenges provided by the terrain. For me it´s the part I like best in WFTO. But I haven´t discovered DK-Features like ""Lair Enemy"" which forced you to build your dungeon differently according to the creatures you get in order to avoid deadly arguments. Would have been really nice to have Food Enemies, Tavern Enemies and so on instead of always building the same standard-dungeon. What ever happened to Sorcerers killing Imps so you had to place your Library really carefully?Different to DK you have more possibilities of micro management here, but I can´t really handle them: If I place a Cultist in the Sanctuary to pray for gold so I can build faster, it will often simply return to the Library and I only lost research time. Maybe I´m doing something wrong, but I finally gave up trying.Creature management is the next big issue that puts me off. Lots of different creature menues to choose, but no possibility to have the classic-DK-menue where you had an overview what your creatures were doing, who was idle and who fighting. Sometimes I´m unable to pick creatures from the menue if they are fighting. Earth tiles under the buttons get accidently clicked all the time. Impossible to keep creatures in your Hand of Evil while you perform other tasks. Absolutely no idea what to do with angry creatures: In DK I could put them into the Temple to cool down. Tried to give them gold, but my Hand of Evil is always in line of sight so I mostly miss. Couldn´t see that much difference if managed though. Now I just transform them into gold (most times accidently transforming innocent creatures around as well due to very laggy gameplay). So there´s no real motivation to level-up my creatures, it´s easier to replace them if needed. Therefor I finally gave up playing with Vampires, too: Bad enough that they kill your valuable prisoners if you´re not quick enough (or gameplay laggs too much), but I can´t find a way to keep them occupied without Guard Posts, so they always start feeding on my other creatures - and they complain all the time! No total number of creatures (own and opponent´s) to tell you if it would be wise to attack. Or to give you an idea how big your army is, because in big maps they do not all respond to rally flags. Even on small maps I can´t flip through my different creature types (due to laggy gameplay?): Menue always simply jumps from the first to the last creature. This way I can´t really play with Beasts because I can´t pick them up for the Arena.And, of course, no battle menue. The only thing to give you an overview while fighting in DK with the possibility to cast spells directly on specific targets. So now just hope you´ve got more creatures, send them to battle and pray to the Gods of the Underworld. Strategy? No, action seems more important. Lots of screams and lights and keepers trying to desperately hit enemies with lightning-bolts without any success because the game jumps more and more frames. How about hot keys for spells also? At least that would stop the screen from scrolling all the time you try to cast a spell and the game already lags like hell.In several posts the developers tell us that the game is so ressource-devouring because of all the waypoints your computer has to calculate for creatures. So it definitely was a good idea to have heroes not always heading for your Dungeon Heart but simply staying where they are. But on the other hand the developers take any chance from us to reduce possible paths - f.e. by making walls indestructible without a Siege Shrine or by my most favourite trick in DK: Build a Temple- or Guard Post-tile directly next to water or lava and the height distance will be too big for non-flying enemies. That way you can (provided with Lava or Water Traps) even create one-way-roads.  So how about a Step Construct?And if you want to have really thrilling competitions with other keepers instead of one big battle you should give us the opportunity to fight several small battles at once to weaken the opponent. WFTO goes a step into that direction by introducing shrines and Titans. But the game needs much more of that! Make a Titan Shrine as the only place where players can summon a Titan. Make shrines that greatly expand your mana or increase your mana regeneration. Make rooms that cannot be built but must be discovered. And then give us back the old Invisibility Spell for our Imps, so we can annect and instantly sell all these valuable rooms if not guarded by creatures who can detect invisible enemies! That would be a way to really bring DK into this decade. And, last point: What was the idea to make dungeons  almost completely independet from gold? Nice to have rituals and spells for gold in the beginning because they really speed up building your dungeon. But training creatures should always cost gold! Only then is there a chance to starve out your opponent. Only then you are forced to keep digging into new regions instead of just staying at home to build only Beast Dens and throw your beasts constantly into Arenas.  Obviously the developers expected very different things from a DK-remake than me, but I couldn´t find out what exactly, apart from impressive graphics and sounds. Looks to me like they had so many ideas that they lost their golden thread.			"

												If anyone has played Dungeon Keeper or Dungeon Keeper II and enjoyed it, just get this. It is Dungeon Keeper in everything but name. It feels like it, it sounds like it, it probably smells like it if I could smell it.Everything in the game looks and feels just as you'd expect it to, and thanks to a Kickstarter stretch goal, Richard Ridings (The Mentor in DK1 and DK2) voices your dungeon announcer in this as well.Couldn't ask for a better spiritual successor. It scratched that 16 year itch.Also, the developers are very active in the forums and seem to genuinely care about what the community thinks, respond to questions and take suggestions to heart. Can't ask for better behavior. From what I hear as well, Patch 1.1 was a HUGE improvement over 1.0 and fixed most of the issues people had with the game previously.As JonTron would say; Ten outta ten, ten outta ten, hundred outta a hundred, best game, best game!

												It's not called DK3, but it plays very much like what I'd like a DK3 to be-- rather than some pay-to-win mobile thing-- and there's that voice again, congratulating you on your evil deeds and chiding you for not killing the forces of good rapidly enough.  Welcome back, Keeper...I mean Underlord.Anyway, I've played thru level 6 under 1.1.6 without any significant issues.  The only thing I noticed offhand was that there is a pretty major pause at the start of some levels before the voice intro starts up.  Speaking of pauses, I want the 'Pause' key or 'P' or something to do a pause-- the esc menu sort of works, but you can't scroll with the esc menu active.Graphics quality with all the shiny enabled is looking pretty fine, and the performance seems solid-- no problems holding a steady 60FPS at 2560x1440 @ 60Hz resolution.  Wish I could zoom out a little more, though, or perhaps I'd like the UI elements around the edge of the screen to be a little smaller and not take up as much room.			"

I feel the state of the game is great. There was no bugs that I ran into while casually playing the game which from previous comments during first release seemed to be many but they all seemed to be patched (Thank you developers and community for this). I was afraid that the game would just be some cheap attempt to remake this game that I loved so much but the developers have really gone above and beyond to make it feel like DK with the voice acting and humor. Definietly did not regret spending the dough for this game, I cannot wait to finish the campaign and whatever else they have in store!			"

												I bought this game with high expectations and hopes. Not only it didn't betray them but it even surpassed them! I would give it 10/10Before talking about the game first let me tell you that I'm one of the most hardcore strategy players (skip this paragraph if you don't want to read it). I've played AOE, AOE II, AOE III, AOM, Rise of Nations, Rise of Nations: Thrones and Patriots, all General games, WC III, WC Frozen Throne, The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth, Total Annihilation: Kingdoms, and pretty much evey strategy game online and on the phone. I've also played a lot of Tower Defense and similar games. I'm not trying to show off here but rather say I've seen what the Genre has to offer. So when I say ""high expectations"" I mean really high.This game offers a definitely unique experience. You can command your armies like a true Overlord, you can lead them into battle like a true leader or you can play tower defense with your enemies! LOL. But maybe you are into sneaking games and stealth operations: No problem. Just hand pick your few elite companions and take the enemy forces down one by one. But be careful not to think of your troops as mere npcs because they might make mistakes and they need sleep, food and good pay!This game's big difference with the other games I've played in that it lets you play however you like with an army as big as you want and for as long as you want but more importantly, you can play as the BAD GUY! There is almost no other game that lets you be the bad guy! But not in this game. You are literally a Demon Lord who is attacking the dwarf and human nations and wiping them clean out of existance. I mean I personally kept some of their talented sorceresses by making them an offer they couldn't refuse in my torture chambers, but you can kill them too if you felt like it. But after you've conquered the human kingdom and finished the Heart Of Gold DLC, you won't get bored cause there are countless player made maps you can try and the game updates regularely.Edit: I almost forgot. All your creatures can Level up! They gain more hp, mana and abilities as they lvl up. This is also something you don't see in a lot of games. WC III and Battle For Middle-earth had it too but only for hero units.			"

												Truly this game is the Dungeon Keeper successor we deserved. The gameplay is fairly good, dungeon management easily rivals the original DK games and the creatures interesting. There are issues, obviously. If you're not running an outright BEAST of a computer you'll likely be unable to run the game at all, and controlling your minions is always an issue in god games. But otherwise this is a clear ""Hell yes"" from me, go buy it. What're you waiting for, Underlord?			"

												I found this game to be a lot of fun, and the Narrator, voiced by Richard Ridings of Dugeon Keeper fame, strikes the exact right tone for sarcasm and personality.There are actually quite a wide selection of beasts and minions for you to direct, all with their own unique role.The unlockable themes are worth pursuing, even though they are merely cosmetic changes. My favourite so far is the Arcane theme form the My Pet Dungeon expansion, but I think that Rhaskos' theme is worth getting.The DLC is worth getting. Heart of gold is an exploration based campaign and My Pet Dungeon adds 8 distinct sandbox levels.The problem with this game is that the main campaign tends to fall back to endless waves of enemies assaulting your dungeon and can be difficult for those with a more patient playstyle. The game does try to present these levels as something different each time. In one endless wave level, you have to reinforce an already breached dungeon before the waves begin, and another has you defending a second overlord from about 300 enemy minions. Ultimatley though, both levels have you attempting to outlast the timer.Overall, I do reccomend this game, but not for the base campaign. I am going to point out that I'm about half way through the main campaign and have about 70 hours of game time for War for the Overworld at this point. That's almost entirley down to the DLC and sandbox modes. The humour is very much apparent and the devs are still maintaining the game and listen to feedback about it. The campaign may feel rushed, but the DLC campaigns have the opposite feel and are the most fun I've had in an RTS for years. "

												While I generally think this game is a thumbs up, I can't say I am entirely happy with the level of polish... or lack there of.It truly feels like a sequel or spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper 2, but seems to lack a little of the heart that went into that title. It has a similar sense of humor, but maybe a bit more drab than the old DK franchise. I can see that the devs loved DK and wanted to make this as close to that concept as possible, but in too many places it falls just shy of the potential.The old Dungeon Keeper games had some bad bugs in them that made them almost inplayable at times and unfortunately this game does follow that same trend as well. That being said, the devs have not given up on this game and appear to be trying to fix, improve, and expand on the game months after it's full release, so here is to hoping this game gets enough love from both players and devs over time.All said, it does feel like Dungeon Keeper 2.5... I just wish it had felt more like Dungeon Keeper 3. But still a fun game and if you want to try something new or something old that feels new again, give this game a try. Worth a play.			"

												I read many many reviews about how this game was just riddled with problems, which was disheartening for me, as I really wanted to see a great succssor to DK2.  When I saw the game on sale for a reasonable price, I decided to give it a go and I must say i was not dissapointed.  After playing the tutorial map it felt i was back playing DK2 with new minions and some great new features that were lacking from DK2.  One of my favourites is the ability to STOP those dam imps from wondering into enemy fire and it not costing you mana.  I haven't played very far into the campaign, but so far I am really enjoying the experience.  The developers have managed to capture what was so fun about DK2 and add some really useful features to the mix.  I can highly recommend this game as of today!			"

This is both a pro and con I feel however since it is not entirely polished and one could argue these new features are to the detrament of the game as a whole.However i feel its a well done game in it's own right and deserves a 7/10.

												The great thing about this is that it is very similar to Dungeon Keeper in its basic design, but with some graphical updates and new stuff to play with. There are some minor refinements, like that the campaign never requires you to use the first-person ""possession"" mode. It's fun, and could absolutely pass for a sequel to Dungeon Keeper, so it's reasonably worthwhile if you liked Dungeon Keeper. And it supports Linux, which is the reason I bought it.However, it also has a small number of significantly annoying issues.There isn't that much content! As you can see, it took me 33 hours to complete the game and DLC, and I play slowly and restarted several levels. Maybe the multiplayer is good, but I have not tried it.Compared to Dungeon Keeper, the level design is a little bit rough with respect to discovering what you should do. In several levels I had to restart multiple times because there was some point on the map I was supposed to rush (because the scenario becomes unplayably hard past a certain number of minutes, so there is no time to  e.g. train minions) or NOT rush (because doing a certain thing causes every enemy in the level to pour down at once, or because it gets your minions wasted when the particular level provides no way to replace them), but no way to discover this without screwing up. This reduces the fun somewhat. The levels play significantly smoother in ""Heart of Gold.""A Dungeon Keeper game doesn't need an amazing plot, but this still suffered from writing issues. The ""plot"" was so overbearing and lame that I'd rather have just played the scenarios without any plot, and I did not find the humor up to the Dungeon Keeper standard. To be clear, I enjoy dark humor. It made the game embarrassing to play in the room with other people and if I knew a sequel had the same writing, I probably wouldn't buy it.There are also way, way too many confusing and irrelevant messages in-game, kickstarter in-jokes I guess; they feel almost constant and they are distracting and sometimes misleading. I really would have liked to be able to skip all that. The cutscenes aren't really skippable and it would have been nice to be able to check the text from these like a ""mission briefing"" instead of being forced to sit through the really slow pan-arounds (which were more annoying for the performance issues). This would have been less of an issue except that the content of the cutscenes was so lame.And there are some performance issues, nothing unplayable, but the game can get pretty choppy even on a fairly recent video card. I found myself avoiding the ""reveal map"" ability because it made the game unplayably slow.			"

												Wow love this game me and my dad use to play DK 1 and 2 alot and we were disappointed with Ea's Mobile DK 3 (i never played it but DK going mobile made me a bit sad).  We both had some pre-hype for this game so i went out and boaught two copies (1 for me and 1 for my dad) we both are pretty satisfyed with it.  The only thing i didnt like was the end and how there was no way to avoid it in the campain mode.  I do really like the flavor of everything and this is a reallly good throwback to the DK days as some of the levels are simular.  I do wish there was a larger campain or multiple campains (i know about HoG but i want more like playing each underlord in thier own campain).  Thier are a few glitches here and there but its still enjoyable and playable.  But one thing i miss about DK is Horny but the Archon was a good replacement.			"

												While I generally think this game is a thumbs up, I can't say I am entirely happy with the level of polish... or lack there of.It truly feels like a sequel or spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper 2, but seems to lack a little of the heart that went into that title. It has a similar sense of humor, but maybe a bit more drab than the old DK franchise. I can see that the devs loved DK and wanted to make this as close to that concept as possible, but in too many places it falls just shy of the potential.The old Dungeon Keeper games had some bad bugs in them that made them almost inplayable at times and unfortunately this game does follow that same trend as well. That being said, the devs have not given up on this game and appear to be trying to fix, improve, and expand on the game months after it's full release, so here is to hoping this game gets enough love from both players and devs over time.All said, it does feel like Dungeon Keeper 2.5... I just wish it had felt more like Dungeon Keeper 3. But still a fun game and if you want to try something new or something old that feels new again, give this game a try. Worth a play.			"

												I found this game to be a lot of fun, and the Narrator, voiced by Richard Ridings of Dugeon Keeper fame, strikes the exact right tone for sarcasm and personality.There are actually quite a wide selection of beasts and minions for you to direct, all with their own unique role.The unlockable themes are worth pursuing, even though they are merely cosmetic changes. My favourite so far is the Arcane theme form the My Pet Dungeon expansion, but I think that Rhaskos' theme is worth getting.The DLC is worth getting. Heart of gold is an exploration based campaign and My Pet Dungeon adds 8 distinct sandbox levels.The problem with this game is that the main campaign tends to fall back to endless waves of enemies assaulting your dungeon and can be difficult for those with a more patient playstyle. The game does try to present these levels as something different each time. In one endless wave level, you have to reinforce an already breached dungeon before the waves begin, and another has you defending a second overlord from about 300 enemy minions. Ultimatley though, both levels have you attempting to outlast the timer.Overall, I do reccomend this game, but not for the base campaign. I am going to point out that I'm about half way through the main campaign and have about 70 hours of game time for War for the Overworld at this point. That's almost entirley down to the DLC and sandbox modes. The humour is very much apparent and the devs are still maintaining the game and listen to feedback about it. The campaign may feel rushed, but the DLC campaigns have the opposite feel and are the most fun I've had in an RTS for years. "

												This kickstarter game project is set out to make a game that will hopefully be a successor to 'Dungeon Keeper' by Bullfrog Entertainment.  It has even been given the thumbs up by 'Peter Molyneux'.The aim of the game is to build up your dungeon / minions and conquer the other dungeons while playing in a top down view.. or FPS if you have a possession spell to take over one of your minions.If you want an idea of the game concept then I'd recommend checking out ""Dungeon Keeper"" (not Dungeon keeper2) and then imagine it revamped to today's graphics.Edit: The game is still being updated with multiplayer now working (occasionally buggy)  and a map editor expected in the future, however right now there is the campaign mode and 'extra' unlockable themes which you can change the look and feel of your dungeon.

												A solid 7.5, maybe a 8I really liked the game, it captures most of the spirit of the original Dungeon Keeper games + some improvements and that alone is a feat that any indie game should be really proud. I was pleasantly surprised, because Im a total fan of the series.If I dont give it a 8 or 9/10 is because the ""sim/soul"" part of the game is still lacking compared to all the other things. The creatures are different in appearance and some even in combat, but what about personality's? In the DK games you had the bile demon wanting tons of food, the dragons lots of gold, spiders hating flies, wizards wanting silence in their library's, dogs fertilizing your cementerys etc... Those things not only made you think about how to place rooms or witch creatures try to summon for X or Y lvl, but added a lot to the feeling of your dungeon being ""alive"" and populated by creatures with desires and/or uses for non room activity's. The other thing is polish and pacing, but that is probably easier to fix with feedback and the experience the devs already gained by making the game. All in all, its a really good game that can be recommended to any DK fan.			"

Posted: June 20, 2015
												(Scroll down for pros/cons/verdict)I grew up playing dungeon keeper 2. My step dad originally introduced me, and I was immediately hooked. ""It's good to be bad"" was the game's slogan, and it held true to that. The third title was never released because bullfrog was aquired by every gamer's favorite company, EA. So when I heard EA was making a mobile dungeon keeper game a while back, I was interested, but extremely skeptical. Turned out to be freemium garbage as I expected. No dungeon keeper for like 15 years and you decide to bring it back as a cashgrab shell of its former self? Classic EA. There would never be another great DK game, or so I thought.Then I found out about WFTO. An independent group of people making a new DK game. Again, I had my heart crushed and stomped on before, so I was skeptical. When I first read reviews, it was from before the game's 1.1 patch, and they were rather mixed. Bugs, glitches, memory leaks, etc. I veered away at the time, but still checked up on it occasionally to see how the developers would respond. Over time, I started to notice that the developers were totally ontop of♥♥♥♥♥♥ They were working hard to fix everything, and genuinely seemed to care about making a true successor to DK2. I became more interested and waited for it to go on sale.When I finally purchased it and played, I was hooked. I played till like 6 in the morning. This totally felt like what DK3 could have been if bullfrog were still around. They even got the original announcer! It was easy at first because of being a DK2 veteran, but eventually started to challenge me a bit more. I got my  handed to me a couple times on level 9 (Belmourne's pass) and had to start working out different strategies. I played nonstop and got to the final level in about two days, which I could not complete because of a glitch. This was pretty annoying, and I messaged the moderators on their subreddit (/r/WFTO). They were quick to respond and said it would be fixed. A couple days later, they released a patch that fixed everything I had trouble with, and I was able to complete the game in about 15 hours overall.For those unfamiliar with the series, you play as an unseen and omnipotent underlord. You manage your dungeon from a top down perspective and carve out rooms to attract minions to your lair. You use these minions to wipe out the humans (or other underlords) kind of like an RTS. I have to state though, that this is not a traditional RTS. You do not have to micro tons of units, instead you place a flag and all your minions will rally there. They use their own abilities too, so again don't let your bad micro skills stop you from buying this. You can set up defenses, fortifications, cast spells, rituals, and create constructs. There's a ton of different ways to succeed. Once you've eliminated the campaign objective or the human/cpu player's dungeon core, you win.PROS:- Original Announcer from the old DK games - Funny- More content than DK2 - Countless ways to go about winning- Gameplay is unique from other RTS- Take control of a minion and join the battle in FPS mode- Satisfying to build things- Developers genuinely care about game - Multiplayer (Fight with or against your friends)- Campaign, skrimish, survival, sandbox, plus multiplayer. 5 Modes boys.- More content on the way- ChallengingCONS:- Ending is awkward and unsatisfying at the moment (They will fix)- You may run into a glitch or two (Again, they will fix)- Little pricey- AI still needs a little work (AI won't build traps or defenses guarding their dungeon core, so you can just send all your units directly at it and 90% of the time you'll win. This is mainly a problem in multiplayer/skrimish.)OTHER:- You might have to mess with the graphic settings a bit to get it to run smoothly- To host a multiplayer game may require port forwardingVERDICT:If you played the old DK games and liked them, I highly reccommend this. If you want a taste of the gameplay before you're sure, go get DK2 and play a few missions of that. While the campaign is great, I also reccommend getting a friend to buy it and trying out multiplayer.8/10.			"

												To reduce War for the Overworld as a simple intellectual property reskin  or modernised rehash of dungeon keeper 2 would completely undermine just how much further this game goes. The core mechanics, style and thematic approach undoubtedly are outright DK (imitation is flattery after all) even going to go so far as to use the same narrator, but a new gamut of bestiary, rooms, traps and mechanics are not only well thought out, but offer an invaluable greater range of depth to strategic gameplay and variety in playstyle. Most importantly though this game is just downright fun to play, whether you are playing casually, or meticulously masterminding your next misdeed the game just exudes a character that positively rubs off on you.

												A true successor for Dungeon Keeper 2 :Cons :No more romance between Mr. Skeleton on the electric chair and SM Mistress :(Pros :Everything is here (exept for the cons) and more.You can even work in your workshop when you possess a monster of that workshop which is a nice feature for me because it increases the sense of being a real creature in your own dungeon (compared to DK2).You can also use all skills of the workers, even teleports.Others nice ""new"" features :- Full detail about workshops/workshop props/creatures to know how they are, what they are currently doing, how well they are working and why (nicely done)- Huge tech trees ( a lot to unlock and discover )- A lot of units with no overlap in term of character design and type- Titans- peace groups- Potions- Sanctuary for potent spells- Restricted areas for workers- workshops build boxes for the traps and you can take them yourself to finish the traps			"

												So, now that WftO has had a few months to cook after its disastrous (and incomplete) launch, what do we have now at version 1.1?Well, if you're looking for a Dungeon Keeper 3 that actually works this time, WftO is now it.  The game takes the premise of its spirtual ancestor, and expands it with new units, tools, and various other goodies.  Not all of this is for the best, however; many units and tools still feel underdeveloped and underbalanced.  Again, however, WftO now stands out as the best and the brightest of the DK-alikes out there (although, with Dungeons 2 as its only real competitor these days --with maybe KeeperRL as a very distant 3rd -- that's not saying much).+ Tried and tested Dungeon Keeper gameplay with its own spin.  That's the biggest plus right there.  After many patches, the dev team pretty much nailed what makes the DK formula special.  This single plus pretty much covers up for the game's myriad sins:- Campaign needs another pass.  One big quibble is the way that new units and tools are dumped willy-nilly on the player, with no warning or explanation, as the campaign progresses.  DK made sure that new stuff was properly introduced -- and necessary! -- at the end of each campaign mission.  WftO doesn't.- Poor use of all this new and different stuff in the campaign.  You get a lot of different toys and units, but you will not end up using some of them at all in the campaign.  (See: stone bridge).  This may be useful when playing multiplayer, but it's just clutter in the campaign.  Even read a book that cries out for better editing, for elimination of dross and a better focus on what is important?  WtfO needed a better editor, as it were.  There's just too much redundant stuff in it.  DK2 stripped away a lot of DK1's units and tools, as was the better game for it.- Much more MP focused than the DK games were.  WftO was evidently created by folks who thought DK's MP was the high point of the game, which is arguable.  As a result, you get less of a contemplative, polish your dungeon to a high sheen gameplay in favor of... zerg rushes and click-click-clicky around the map.- I was wondering if the devs were trolling me when I ""won"" the game.  Abrupt and unrewarding to say the least.  Not as bad, say, as an old NES game that just displayed ""CONGRATULATIONS"" on a black screen, but close.- I hate timed missions in a game centered on building stuff.  The campaign has a few.TL;DR: WtfO is close, but not quite, for those who waited patiently over the decades for a DK3.  It's definitely still worth a shot, though. "

												So this game has taken a lot of stick since its initial release in 2015 and I took a risk and funded Subterranean Games towards the games development. Why is this review positive you might ask? Well the game was initally buggy, very buggy but heck any new game is bound to be littered with flaws and funding companies to work on the game and iron the creases out is something I have not regretted.Over one year on and this game is a fantastic renaissance of what the old Dungeon Keeper series used to be. Personally, its everything and more to what I would want from a follow up to the DK Series. Its clear that the developers love this game and have lived solely to make it work for us the players. Any review that mentions bugs or glitches, please let me assure you I have come across none in the recent months of playing and I believe they have been resolved. A fantastic follow-up to a fantastic game series with a devoted community and great developers.			"

												Where do I start with this game? Ahh, yes... YOU ARE AN EVIL GOD! One of the best RTSs that I have ever played. Everyone has a secret evil side, some less secret than others... but that doesn't matter, AS LONG AS I GET TO HEAR THE PAINED CRIES OF MY ENEMIES AS MY MINIONS SLAUGHTER THEM ALL! The narrator is definitely my favorite character, he is hilarious. The best part of this game, besides being evil, is that it is an RTS that feels like it isn't an RTS, you actually have minions that need taking care of, they eat, drink, sleep, work, fight, and get paid (and get tortured). You literally have to control your own society, while fighting the empire. Plus, in my opinion the campaign gets incredibly difficult as you get to Mira's Dungeon. I will not inform you who Mira is, because that could be a spoiler. There is really only one thing that I don't like. Every other Underlord is completely useless, they don't do anything except mutter giberish. I won't get into too much detail as that could also be a spoiler. Overall 9/10.			"

												A sort of spiritual sequel to the Dungeon Keeper games. The good ones. Very obviously made by fans of those.When I say 'obviously made by fans', I mean that the route it has taken to grow past the limitations of its ancestors is more like you'd expect from someone who wants more fo the game, not less of it. It adds options. So many options. Like, wow, man, that's a lot of options.It's on the verge of feeling badly cluttered, but manages to avoid this. Instead, it feels like your dungeon is more fluid and adaptable.If you liked DK and DK2, you will probably really enjoy this game. If you never played them, then this game will show you why you sometimes hear those older games spoken of fondly.			"

												I began following and supporting this game early on, as I'm a huge fan of DK2 and really wanted a newer, better ""DK3"" to play. While initially I let the game sit in my steam library, it's finally at a point in development where I would rather play WftO than DK2! The game is amazing and is only getting better.Same humour as the original, same fun campaign style. Latest patch actually made WALLS USEFUL, which was a huge issue for DK2 fans. Multiplayer is a bit unstable ATM, but still a lot better than any CIv games.If you enjoyed DK1+2, and want something similar, this is the only game I've found that will satisfy that itch!EDIT: After having beaten the second campaign in their new expansion pack ""Heart of Gold"" I feel like this game has developed into something greater than DK1/2. I can't recommend this game enough. If you're a fan of DK2 you MUST buy this.			"

Answer these questions with yes or no to see if it's a game for you:- Do you like torturing your enemies to recruit them into your own ranks and send them fighting their own brethren?- Do you think it's appropriate to slap your minions around your dungeon to speed up their work?- Do you think that itsy bitsy micro piglets are the right way to stop underworld hunger?- Do you characterize with some kind of higher being, e.g. a god? Loving, caring, just in a twisted kind of way?If you can answer these with a rightful YES, then go buy the game. If you're a Dungeon Keeper fan this is a must have.The developers are a quite small team but have delivered a high quality game, even though it is still a bit rough about the edges a few days after the release i'm sure these things will get patched up quickly. The price may look hefty at first but is ultimately rightful, as the game offers tons of quality content and delivers it in a fun way, especially if you dig the dungeon keeper ""it is good to be bad"" humour. However, you may want to wait until the price drops and more content is delivered / patched.			"

												This is very reminiscent of Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2, which are arguably the two greatest ""Dungeon Creator's"" of all-time.  In fact I would say that this is a pretty blatant copy of it, if the series hadn't been out of print for 16 years.This is one of many series that Electronic Arts killed when they started buying up companies and then metaphorically salting the earth where the more quirky popular series once grew.  Bullfrog had Populous, Magic Carpet, Dungeon Keeper and Syndicate.  Origin had Ultima, Ultima Underworld and Wing Commander.  Heck, they even killed their own Mutant League Sports series when they became a ""serious company"".TL:DR - WftO is a lot like Dungeon Keeper 1&2, this is a good thing and thank God someone brought back the classic gameplay since EA sucks at pleasing fans of classic titles they own the rights to.

												This game was freakin' amazing. If you enjoyed the Dungeon Keeper games you'll really enjoy this. They improved on all the things you wish had existed in the previous games. They kept true to a lot of your favorite things too. Even if you only play through the campaign once, your money is not wasted. It's a really great strategy game with some fun brain teaser levels. I beat it in a weekend and now I can't wait to take my friends on in the multiplayer. Really appreciated all the detail they put into it. Very well done!			"

												WFTO is a loving tribute to the great Dungeon Keeper games - but it is sadly somewhat undermined by some technical problems. Bugs and erratic framerates abound. Still, the indie developer behind the team has been honest and forthright about the problems and is continually working hard to patch and correct problems. For anyone who has been dreaming of a successor to Dungeon Keeper all these years, this is a very good option. The developer has my support because I want to see this game patched up and perhaps an even better sequel one day.			"

But let me just say how deeply impressed I am with the developers.As a massive fan of the Dungeon Keeper franchise I am over the moon with this game! I picked it up a few years back and played around with it a bit, and I was pretty confident in the game despite there only being a dungeon heart and some imps. I have and still am having great fun with this game and cannot stress enough how much I reccomend this to other players, it is EVERYTHING Dungeon Keeper III would of aimed to be, and would be proud of!

												First of all I'd like to say - IGNORE THE METACRITIC SCORE!!!! It's only the score that it is because people started leaving reviews before the game was finished and before the 1.1 patch was released. This patch has been a complete revelation!I know what many of you are probably thinking as you trawl through the reviews left for War for the Overworld......""I thoroughly enjoyed the Dungeon Keeper games and I'd really hope that War for the Overworld would live up to my expectations, given that it's not exactly cheap"". Well, as a long term Dungeon Keeper fan (I'm 28 now and played it daily when i was a teen, including a few play throughs as I've gotten older), I can assure you that you won't be disappointed. I actually felt quite sceptical when purchasing this game, simply because I enjoyed the original Dungeon Keepers games so much. I often hype up something in my own mind to the point where it will probably disappoint, but I've been very pleasantly surprised. This is about as close as you can get to a Dungeon Keeper 3. I think the creators have done a really great job of keeping just enough of the old Dungeon Keeper vibes to satisfy the DK fans (for example the resemblance of many of the units in the game - The 'Workers' are clearly Imps, the 'Chunders' who love to work in the workshop and have the ability to 'fart' as a weapon (much like my girlfriend) are Bile Demons and you also get a female unit that loves to torture your enemies in the torture chamber.....remind you of anything (except without my old favourite spell lightning). Your creatures still need to eat but have moved away from chickens and now prefer micropiglets, and some of your old favourite spells are still available like being able to create more workers, being able to reveal parts of the map for limited time, and also the 'Call to Arms' spell has a 'Rally' option too. I think what's really great about War for the Overworld is the fact that the developers etc have taken great care to only change or remove elements from the DK games that actually work to improve this game. Does anyone remember in Dungeon Keeper how if you had enough gold, you could build an unlimited amount of traps and doors all over your dungeon, while you sat back and used the sight of evil spell in conjunction with the lightening or cave in spells to kill all of the enemy units? yeh you can'y do that anymore, you now actually have to think a bit more and strategy plays more of a part. Your mana pool is actually now split between the number of workers you have, the number of traps you have and any spells that you wish to cast. This means that you have to find a balance between those things because you have loads of workers, you wont be able to lay any traps or cast any spells, alternatively if you have loads of traps, you won't be able to create many extra workers or cast many spells. This was a welcome addition to the game because it's makes things more challenging, but not too difficult. The graphics are nice and crisp, even if the frame rate can take an occasional hit on a very busy map (nothing that'd bothered me too much mind), the sound effects are very good and actually quite funny in terms of the things you hear your creatures randomly say, and there's more than enough content to keep you playing for a while with multiplayer, the campaign and a survival type mode. Overall I've been really, pleasantly surprised by this game and what I also think is great is that the developers are really looking after it when it comes to releases/patches/updates. They regularly make sure that they respond to requests from people in terms of improvements etc and they aren't just light touches either. When i first got the game, I felt a little sad that your workers aren't able to level up. After a few days they'd released another couple of updates which added the ability for workers to level and i noticed they'd fixed EVERY other minor bug that I'd experienced. You get exactly what you'd want and would expect from this game and the aftercare provided by the regular updates etc. It's fun, challenging, addictive and you still get to feel very nostalgic if you loved the original Dungeon Keeper games. If you never played those games and are instead just contemplating buying this game - do it, you won't regret it. Graphics - 8/10 (for what it is, i think they're great)Sound - 9.5/10Gameplay 9/10 (With several game modes and the fact that each time you play you can change your style - you'll come back to this time anbd time again)Overall - 9/10			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Good evening Underlord, it's paydayI loved the classic Bullfrog Production Dungeon Keeper series, except the disaster of the ""game"" which is Dungeon Keeper Mobile. The basic premise of Dungeon Keeper was to build a dungeon and try and survive the human scum and I've always wanted a modern remake of the classic game, and thankfully there is, War for the Overworld!The game is mostly the same as the Dungeon Keeper series, you order your minions to build a dungeon and train your soldiers and such to prepare to attack the enemyThe graphics still too is mostly the same as the Dungeon Keeper series, as a matter of fact, there isn't any changes between the Dungeon Keeper series and War for the Overworld which is a shame as I excpected some new game mechanics to be introducedAt first, the game ran like poop, but after a while, the game ran well and I have no complaints with the AI although many people complained about the AI before I purchased the game so it seems as if the developers patch the game regularly and fixed the issues many people complained about before my purchase of the gameAnd of course, the original voice actor from the Dungeon Keeper series makes a return in War for the Overworld!War for the Overworld is a good game but for people who played the living hell (no pun intended) out of the Dungeon Keeper series, there isn't much difference between this game and Dungeon Keeper but for people who like strategy games then this is the game for you!Now Underlord, get back to work! RECOMMENDED :)  THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY! (What's this? :- Like some games get ""Best Game of 2014"" or ""Best Indie Game"", etc... So I have decided to make my own!)  "

												What a disappointment, and I really wanted to love this game. Forget about building your own dungeon, and designing it by carefully searching for gold and working out how much you can afford a room to be. Nooo... Instead, spend hours in pre made dungeons designed by the developers and do nothing as your minions slowly unlocks the maps through prepare tunnels. If you think there is chances to build... noooo... All the rooms and almost all the levels are already carved out for you, with no space left to make it your own. And... If you think that maybe later it will let you build your own dungeon... Not really... Instead play a necromancer stuck in the dullest maze known to man as you walk around collecting minions that has no ability to dig. It's like the makers of this game found it so fund to make dungeons that they decided what we as players wanted, was to play in THEIR dungeons. Don't waste your money This is not the game you are looking for.			"

												So first off: There are al lot of bugs and a horrible UI yeah. But this game and the people creating it are not comparable to EA or UBI as really big developers. You have to rate the process of this game just different then when it would be released by the two companies mentioned. It feels like Dungeon Keeper and this is something a lot of games wanted to accomplish but never did it. The engine itself (Unity) is still not very well performing on some systems yeah. But when i purchased this game in Alpha-Stage then there a huge steps and good steps forward since then. Sure it was a failure to release this version this early as 1.0 final build but guys... People who are creating this game are more like people like me and you are, so just give it a little more time and be patient. If they keep up the quality and speed of improving this game, then ill be sure this is the new dungeon keeper we all wished for. Just be fair and supportive, they deserve it.			"

												Games as close to being Dungeon Keeper as I've seen in a game lately so those who think its Good to be Bad (atleast on occasion) should look into this one.I also wanted to add:1) This game has some (for some) game breaking bugs (I don't seem to be as badly affected)2) The devs are working as as fast as possible to fix #13) If you can't deal with the above then delay your purchase for a few months4) IF you dont mind helping to find other bugs/issues buy now and play through what is available5) If you want to rant about the game being unfinished... don't bother it seems others have ""Been there, done that"" just read their reviews.I am by no means a ""fanboy"" however I do enjoy dungeon keeper(esque) games and this is as close as I have gotten in RECENT games.  So come in where it's good to be bad or what for a bit and see how the devs fix things.  Your choice but personally I'm tired of the people being so negative, yes the game was pushed to early but still.  They are trying to deal with the issues as they come up without creating more in the process.			"

												First of all, this game does still have some bugs.  If buggy games bother you a lot, maybe give it another few weeks.  The devs are working hard, and they're making a ton of progress, but they're not quite there yet.That said, this game is to Dungeon Keeper 2 what DK2 was to DK1.  If you feel (as I do) that DK2 was a drastic improvement over DK1, you're in for a hell of a ride with this game.So many improvements to what, at it's core, is the same system.  Take traps/doors, for example.  In DK1, they would build whatever they wanted, then you could place it.  Kind-of annoying, since they would produce all the low-level stuff first, so if you wanted, say, a Steel Door, you'd have to wait.  Then, in DK2, you could place a door/trap, then they would get to work on it.  Definitely an improvement, since it didn't waste resources, but if you didn't currently have a place that you knew you wanted a door/trap, your workshop workers would just be slacking off.  In WFTO, they finally solved it.  Workshop workers build generic parts.  When you place doors/trap blueprints, your imps bring those parts to where they need to be, and after enough parts are brought, the door/trap exists.  It doesn't waste anything, and it's perfect.Everything in the game is like that.  They took a look at the systems in the DK games and said, ""How can we make this better?""  They've done a remarkable job.  Researching rooms/spells is done through a sort of ""skill tree"" so you can spend your research points as you wish.  You can fill back in places you don't want dug out; one of my pet peeves with my DK dungeons is when they could be ruined by intruders, and now you can fix what they did.  There are all sorts of entirely new systems, like alchemy, constructs, and rituals, each of which have a different purpose and interesting uses.All that, and I'd already be willing to pay more than the $30 MSRP.  But you know what else they decided to do?  Write a plot.  DK1 basically had none.  DK2 had a bit of one, but it was always, ""Do the thing, this guy's trying to stop you from doing the thing.. yay, you did the thing!""  In this game, I'm only halfway through the campaign, and I'm already wondering what's going on and questioning the motives of certain characters.  Did you ever expect a DK-style game to have you questioning a character's motives?  I sure didn't!  It's a blast.So yes, I'd recommend this game, even in its very-recently-launched state.  Like I said, if bugs bother you a lot, give it a bit more time, but if you're willing to forgive a bit (and if you played DK2, you should be; that game was never 100% stable) then you should just pick it up now.

												***70***Decent game with tons of bugs. Should be better in a few months. (I hope!)Game is technically in an early release state because the company needed money to prevent themselves from going under.Plays like a faster version  of a Dungeon Keeper ""like"" game but missing a lot of the essence and character of the Dungeon Keeper series. Plenty of creatures and rooms to play with. Dungeon building itself is wasted because the opponent can knockdown your walls and go around traps very very easily. Missing the impenetrable walls that DK had once your minions reenforced them.  "

												I was a massive fan of the original Dungeon keeper, so i was really excited for this when i heard about it, and i am really enjoying it.Over the last couple of weeks the game has been hugley fine tuned and a handful of additional features added or existing ones built upon, so the comments saying the game is not finished, are misleading.The game is being polished and maybe two or three additional things added here and there, which i think people are mistaking for...""ITS NOT EARLY ACCESS AND THEY'RE ADDING♥♥♥♥♥♥STILL...OMG""....Ignore those people, it's fine tuning and one or two additional things being added to bulk up the game, but like any game, actually watch a video or two on it, read the updates to see how regularly things are happening, and make your own decision.10/10 would spark a potential backlash from the ""Not Recommended People Again""=)			"

												I have tried a lot of hopefuls to the dungeon keeper throne over the years. Overlord, Dungeons, Impire; they all had their charms but none were quite what I was hoping for and I REFUSE to buy Dungeon Keeper 2 from EA after they butchered the whole thing. I was really timid about going into this game because I had been disappointed so many times before but I have been greatly impressed by this game, it has filled the hole in my heart.It's really easy to jump into if you've played other dungeon games, the skill trees are an interesting addition that makes multiplayer matches more dynamic. With the beast den, potions, constructs and rituals it feels like a genuine spiritual successor to those classics.The one and only complaint I have is the lack of a dragon-like monster. When I was a kid I always loved to craft a dungeon and populate it with like 30 dragons. Huge scaly firebreathing besties make everything better! who knows though, might be added in future DLC or something. XD...maybe a skin for the Auger, that would work! Now I have to look into moddingOkay I'm just rambling now so I'm gonna cut it here. In Conclusion: War for the Overworld is awesome and you should play it!			"

												Absolutely wonderful single player campaign I just wish it was longer, however I still felt completely enthralled and satisfiedright until the credits started rolling. I haven't had much experience with the multiplayer as the lobby seems to remain fairlybarren but the few matches I did play part in were heartpounding and suspensful.  I don't think its worth the price of $32 especially noting how short the campaign was, but it was still so enjoyable that I can happily give this game a thumbs up.Get this game. do it. stop reading reviews you now know its worth it.

The only real gripe I have with the game now is that there is no way to fight/spawn enemies in Sandbox mode, which makes the whole idea pointless. Its like playing Sandbox mode in Roller Coaster Tycoon but not allowed to have quests enter the park. The game is still in beta, so hopefully this will be added in soon.			"

												It looks like Dungeon Keeper, it sounds like Dungeon Keeper, but it doesn't obey your dark will like Dungeon Keeper.One of my favorite things of the Dungeon Keeper series was actually building the dungeon, fortifying it, training my host of evil, and THEN attacking with it.My least favorite thing in War for the Overworld is that it forces you to play the game at its pace, and doesn't allow you to dictate the pace of the game based on your own tactics.  You are often facing a ticking down timer, or faced with an AI opponent that has a fully built dungeon and starting minion compliment that happily bum rushes directly toward you within five minutes of the level loading with no reguard for its own level 1 minions.This means that for most of the campaign you're distracted from building your dungeon by having to deal with a constant horde of weak pointless minions constantly trying to make a bee line to your dungeon heart.  On most maps, save for the one the game specifically expects you to create them on defenses generally feel pretty worthless as well, not like you'd even have time to build them on later missions anyway since the game just devolves into planting the All Minion/Beast flags down and spamming heal monster as fast as your mana can support.I also don't like how once the AI has decided it is going to attack you, there is basically nothing else to do except deal with its suicidal tendencies since it somehow always magically has a full host of minions to keep pouring into your territory, no matter how many you seem to kill/capture.  You can't drive them back and take a breather to let your minions sleep, eat, and get back to their tasks like performing rituals, converting prisoners and raising the collected corpses.  Your only choice is to keep an unrelenting drive directly to the dungeon heart even as more enemy minions run their little level 1 legs into your minion ball.If I'm not mistaken, Dungeon Keeper had a finite minion pool available on each map, and each portal would only allow a limited number of minions through.  When a minion died, it was gone for good and not available to either you, nor your enemies any longer.  This is what made portals matter, prisons, graveyards and torture chambers vital and scavenging pits so annoying.  It also ment you could slap the ever loving♥♥♥♥♥♥out of worthless creatures and kill them (or sacrifice them in the temple to make something better) so they wouldn't be constantly taking up a slot a better minion could be filling.  This also ment you could win a war of attrition as long as you killed more than you lost.Still, I don't hate the game.  I just get frustrated with the way it makes you play it.  I wish Steam would introduce stars instead of just a Yes/No.  My feelings on the game aren't that binary.  But I guess at the end of the day I'd still say it is worth a try, as long as you don't go expecting pure Dungeon Keeper out of it.			"

Dungeon TycoonI read this game had a rough start with many bugs, balancing and UI issues.I can assure you that it is not the case anymore (it seems 1.1 and 1.2 patches solved most of the issues). Sure, it's not AAA polished but it runs quite well and is really fun to play for DK nostalgics or people looking for a fun dungeon-building/god-game/RTS hybrid.Pick it up right now if you've spent the last few years looking for a proper Dungeon Keeper remake.Wait for a sale if you never heard of DK but like strategy games.

												War for the Overworld is the closest game you'll get to Dungeon Keeper 3, until EA decide to do something great with the property.It shares many similarities to the classic Bullfrog games, but with a lot of bells and whistles (spells, potions, devices etc), giving the game depth and better control over your army. If you want to play a great ""Dungeon Keeper"" then you'll love this game. The humour is there, possession, torture chambers, workers -- everything you loved.The campaign is pretty good. *Most* of the missions were fun, but some were either too easy, or boring. I don't think it reached the quality of the Bullfrog titles unfortunately.Pet Dungeon seems pointless without the ability to spawn enemies. Skirmish and multiplayer are fun, thanks to the SIn ( level-up ) system, that gives you different ways to play and try out. Imagine a RPG tree system for your rooms and abilities.Some technical problems; nothing game breaking, or causing the game to crash, but you might see weird stuff happen occasionally.If you want another Dungeon Keeper experience then buy it and enjoy. If you want a strategy game, you might find the games rough points distracting.			"

												Anyone who likes Dungeon Keeper, is more than likely going to love this game. I remember when War for the Overworld had maybe two rooms and one or two creatures, and there really wasn't much to the game. After owning this game for over two years, and coming back to it after it's grown and matured more, and to be honest it has grown and matured a hell of a lot over two years, but it has shown phenomenal promise I'm not sure if the devs are going to call the game finished, it feels great, but doesn't feel 100% finished. I do hope that in the future Mods will be a possibility, as they could do a hell of a lot for this game. I've been playing the Dungeon Keeper series since the first DK game, and this game definitely qualifies as a spiritual successor. TL;DR best money I have spent on a game that brings back a lot of nostalgia, even down to the voice of your advisor. The only thing the game is missing, is full modding support, if it had that then it would be on a whole different level than Dungeon Keeper.EDIT: I should add that I do understand the devs decision to pull mod support for now. Unity doesn't make it easy to mod on their engine as you would need to build the mod tools from the ground up. At this time, something like that would more than likely cost more than it's worth.			"

												Yeah sure it looks and plays close to Dungeon Keeper but it goes off the rails way to fast. There is no time to enjoy setting up a dungeon one must always be moving to attack or defend or die for not doing so. If the makers really cared.. and I don't think they do from prior comments I've seen.. they would put in difficulty options so the game could be slowed down. Buy this is you want to go. go. go.. but if you want to work on developing a killer dungeon this game is not for you. So glad I keep a spare computer from 2000 up and running so I can play Dungeon Keeper 2..  .Really hope they give the option to slow down the game speed so it can have more enjoyment... Going to have to see about hacks and cheat codes when they are available.			"

												It's been what? 15 years since dungeon keeper 2? I really wanted this to be a worthy sucessor after bullfrog was torn apart, but instead we get something reminscent of it, picking up one or two jokes from the DK twins (micro piglets).The game itself works, but the dungeon keeping charms are just painted on - and they rub off quickly.Compared to the desaster that was dungeons 1 & 2, this is closer to the original series, but it's still not understanding it.Where you struggled in dungeon keeper to design your rooms for maximum performance using halls and hallways, you tear down everything in here until you happen accross a gold dig to fill your pockets - and the game suffers for it, as frame rate drops are happening all over the field.It seems the devs want you to make one huge hall, as the pathing system is really the worst part. Whereas the enemy goes straight for your heart whatever you do (often times right into stacked traps) as if scripted, your own hirelings are too stupid to find doorways and start complaining: No money, no food, no sleep, etc.The premise and promise is there, but the parts are too rough around the edge and won't fit together right, always feeling crooked and angled.Nostalgia is a hell of a drug, but this game will make your trip down nostalgia lane a bad one- you're better off going through your storage, looking for that CD with the red frog on the label.

												I'm trying my hardest to have fun here but it just doesn't have the same magic as the originals did, which I played immeditely before starting WFTOThey tried to make the narrator humerous like the older games but they seem to have flandarized him and made him more cartoonishly evil than something actually menacing. The designs of the campaign levels I've played as well as some of the sandbox/skirmish levels felt very restrictive, so I never really felt like I was having fun building the dungeons. In DK2 I felt like I was slowly creeping out and corrupting the land, my dungeon growing organically.WOTF ends up feeling more like a standard RTS than a base-building/management sim that I liked in Dungeon Keeper. It's not terrible, but it's also not what I was looking for.			"

												A spiritual successor to the Dungeon Keeper series, War for the Overworld is everything you could have wanted and more! It does not try and reinvent the wheel, but instead keeps things as similar to the original as possible while adding some of their own (and community’s) great ideas. The initial release had several bugs - some major, many minor - but the team is currently hot fixing like crazy and improving the game immensely every day.Some people have complained about the state of the game upon release, and although their opinions are not without merit, it should be said that the team that brought you this game is a collection of DK fans. A team who loved the series and wanted to bring the franchise back to life and have worked tireless to do just that. They do not have some large studio behind them – just us, the community. And I actually see that as a good thing, lest we get a horrid game like the Dungeon Keeper mobile game that EA released!If you were a fan of DK then this game will satiate that burning desire to imprison heros before you torture them to death, slay princes and their kin, mine gold to stuff your coffers, and recruit evil creatures to your dungeon all in an effort to rule the Overworld!Richard Ridings: “It's great to have you back….Keeper.”			"

												This is most certainly THE best attempt at following up on Dungeon Keeper 2 in an attempt to create the long sought after DK 3 which many of us had waited for.  You'll slip into a nostalgia coma as soon recognise every single component in this game from your previous DK experience.  They nailed it!  But this is also where the problem comes in.The game is a graphically pleasing, humour-filled remake of DK and not so much a sequel. Sure enough there is a bloody good load of newly added components, such as the titan creatures and a ""leveling"" scheme which allows you to unlock traps, rooms and the odd creature using points called ""sins"".   Heck, they even have the original voice-over from the old DK games! Nostalgia overload.  The campaign is ""alright"" and provides you with around 9 hours worth of gameplay - less if you are just one of those gamers who nail-it fast.  I completed the campaign a day after I bought the game and then, you are stuck with very few options.  The sandbox modes are pretty much blank maps with infinate gold that allows you to quickly dig out enough space and place all of your dungeon rooms and summon all of your creatures - provides you with around 30 minutes of entertainment.  Multiplayer is an excrutiating experience.  For those of you who have been playing games outside of steam's DRm, you'll remember those horrible tech nightmares where you had to go and mess about with your port settings, enabling UPnP on your routers and so on - the days we all thought were long gone since steam (and other DRM's) provided a platform that negates this.  Well, in the spirit of nostalgia you may well enough enjoy that experience in this game again.  Multiplayer is stock standard, once you get it working.  Play against other opponents and squash them.  Whether it is you and a mate vs the AI (the developer's definition of Coop...if you can believe that) or whether it is two of you vs two other dungeoneers - all modes we should be fairly familiar with.The actual coop which was hinted at during the kickstarter, though not reached, also seems to be not in the pipeline for the near future.  Now this does not mean it is off the table entirely, though it doesn't look to be soon.  The expansion, ""Heart of Gold"" (released two or three days prior to this review) adds about 4 - 6 hours worth of play in a campaign, some dungeon visuall candy for multiplayer and the odd spell here and there.  It's not an expensive expansion and therefor the little content can be quantified.  Overall, the game's base price vs what you get for it is not good at all.  This is the kind of game we should be looking for during steam specials.  You will barely get a weekend's worth of playing from both the game and its current expansion and multiplayer is unlikely to entertain you for very long if you get past the uneccesary setup hassles.  In summary:They absolutely succeeded in providing a nostalgic experience in the spirit of Dungeon Keeper. No one can compete.However, the game falls horribly short in providing an entertaining experience for more than an approximate 15 hours worth of play (more, maybe, if you really really like repeating the same actions). No Coop (and mplay coop 2v2 does NOT constitute coop at all).The game's development does not seem to be entirely finished and there ""appears"" to be some level of new content being planned.  This may very well be a boon to the current state of the game.  Though, if not getting this title on a good special I would suggest that you seek out the most recent reviews of newly added content on our usual trusty sources (i.e IGN, Gamespot, Gamasutra, Cooptimus).

												An enjoyable spiritual successor marred by bad performance issues.I have a system with a GTX980, i7-4790K, 16GB of RAM and I have this game installed on an SSD. On the later campaign maps my FPS drops to 16-30FPS depending on my zoom level, changing the graphical settings does nothing but even if it did it still wouldn't be excusable. I get a better frame rate on Witcher 3 with most of the settings cranked up to max for goodness sake. I'd absolutely love to recommend this game but if I'm having these sorts of issues with a system such as mine I dread to think how this game runs on less beefy systems because even my fully expanded Pet Dungeon is averaging out at 20 FPS.Here's a quick list of things that stuck to me after playing the whole campaign in one sitting:The good news? - It's practically Dungeon Keeper 3, if you've played the previous games playing this will be like riding a bike.- Richard Ridings is as good as ever. - They absolutely nailed the sound design.The so-so?- Greater degree of micromanagement:- I really don't like how doors function in this game, there's no 'only open for my minions mode'. You either keep it open or lock yourself in.- Prisons offer a greater variety of choices but it's always a manual process as to what you do with them. If the developer insists on these not automatically turning into undead like before there should at least be a means to auto-allocate them to the torture chamber, crypt or turn them into gold.- Imps and traps are tied to a limited mana pool, ultimately limiting the number you can have of either but this also means too many imps affects the number of traps you can create and vise versa. Not only that, imps don't seem to get any sort of speed increase as they level up.The uh-oh?- Aforementioned performance issues.- Campaign is seriously lacking variety. Albeit, there are some call-backs to the sort of thing you'd see in DK1&2 but there isn't much of a sense of exploration and it's sorely lacking in surprises. You won't be running into ball traps or neutral rooms in this game. The maps also often feel a little cramped in regards to how much space they're offering you to build rooms of an acceptable size of quantity.- Unit balance seems all over the place and level 10 units feel weak. Battles seem to be about whoever has the most amount of units regardless of level.- And then there's some somewhat niggling issues like your minions getting upset and leaving a fight (or ignoring NPCs altogether) because they want to get fed or paid. I was warned that my minions were starting to revolt on the final level simply because there was such a prolonged period of fighting before you were granted the opportunity to send your minions back home.I really like this game and want to see it become the DK3 everyone wanted but it still needs some serious work. I certainly don't regret my purchase but these shortcoming need to be noted. If you really want your Dungeon Keeper fix but already played DK1 and 2 to death you still might get some enjoyment out of this. The core is all there, it's all the ragged edges that need smoothing out.			"

												Greetings, dungeon keep...err, I mean Underlord,I had been playing Dungeon Keeper II for a couple of decades when I heard about this game by chance, back when it was still bare-bones early access.At the time I bought it mainly to get some money to the devs in the hopes that they would actually produce a worthy sequel to the aforementioned Dungeon Keeper II and not just take me and the other early accessers money and run laughing into the hills. So I played the bare-bone version when I bought it, felt a bit ambivalant about it and then as the months passed I forgot completely that I even had it. Until now that is!So, coming back to the game now that it is more fleshed out, has a couple of campaigns and is generally a lot stabler I must say that I'm really enjoying it. It still has its issues but I cant tell if thats my now somewhat decrepid computer or the game itself; Units occasionally just freezeing in place and not doing anything being the most common and annoying problem. Other than that, it looks good, feels good. The narrator is spot on. The art direction pretty interesting and yeah, I suppose over all it just feels like I'm playing Dungeon Keeper III.Now this last part is both high praise and a bit of a negative critique in one; DKII set the gold standard for dungeon management sims so the fact that this delivers the same albeit somewhat updated experience is awesome. To an extent.Yes there are more mechanics to enjoy such as in game research, alchemy and rituals but it still feels almost like a reskinned carbon copy of DKII. Almost. Although maybe that's what they were intentionally going for. I havent read the dev blogs or anythign but if that is the case, kudos to them. They really nailed it. It would have been nice to see a tad more ambition but ho hum... Still, this is by no means a damning indictment of the game, just an observation. I wanted a spiritual successor to DKII and I got one. I haven't tried any of the other Dungeon Sims that has been cropping up recently so I can't compare.All in all, an enjoyable game to sate my inner dungeon architect. Because that's the most fun part right? Designing the actual dungeon and making it look all nice? Building up ingenious defences and watching the good guys crash and break against the bulwarks only to be dragged unconcious into the dark echoing interior to never see the light of day again, yeah?Well, it is for me in any case; in game as well as in real life... Erm...I may have said too much. Dungeon? I know of no dungeons, officer......Bye!			"

												I have waited with playing till major patch and version 1.1.15 out now in July, as an all time DKeeper/Theme Hospital player, what can I say after 5 levels of playing:- fruitful successor of DKeeper/Theme Hospital/Evil Genius games for both old fans and new people who likes strategic/management games- very nice up to date graphics, visual and audio effects - very atmospheric game - you will feel the decay and staleness of damp hallways as much as coziness of warm fireplace within your tavern- I have found no glitches, placehgolders or errors, game is stable and much less resource hungry than 2 months ago- cant stop playing, as the campaing is damn catchy - turtle/haste as you wish, spend half an hour with researching every single map corner or start fighting right from beginning...- next iteration of Dungeon Keeper as it should be - all those old good things with more options due to new potions, rituals, wall replacemets,...CHECK FOR YOURSELF, youre not gonna be disappointed!

Which the only fix I've found is a uninstall and reinstall (which is anoying as this is shaping up to be an epic tibute). Characters need work, maybe videos (like the original).This is the best followup to the Dungeon Keeper games (& 3 that never was).			"

												If you are like me and have been waiting for a third game in Bullfrog's masterpiece Dungeon Keeper series then this is the game for you. They left no stone unturned when developing this and even went as far as getting the original narrator in on the project! The mechanics feel natural, the progession feels natural as far as acquiring rooms and such, even the units operate similar to how their counterparts did in the original series. Subterranean Games did a fantastic job continuing a series in spirit with a game i've been wanting for 16 years.			"

												It's Dungeon Keeper under a different name. Very much the real deal. Needs some polish on the UI, but otherwise it is completely authentic Dungeon Keeper, right down to your narrator, voice oozing with evil, occasionally cracking in and saying in utter disgust, ""one of your minions has started a union!""Give it a go, support the developers. It seems that it's still being worked on even now, and with the quality and variety of what's here that's only good news.			"

												I can't really review that this is a great follow up to its predecessor as it seems to just fall a bit short.  The campaign is a bit lacking and feels rushed not even giving time to introduce the plethora of new spells and abilities. While expanding abilities and rooms etc is great it almost felt as if this game was overly complex compared to its previous incarnation. Pros: -Love the concept and series, kept to the original-New modes of play and better multiplayer-Reworks appeared well balanced (wasn't just a reskin of the original)Cons:-Rushed campaign lacking content (finished it in less than 15 hrs and that was going very slowly)-Coimplicated interface, lots of clicking with not a lot of shortcuts.

Early Access Review
								This game refers to the oldies who had the privilage to play dungeon keeper 1 and 2.It is still on its early developing stages so don't expect a fully fuctional game.It has 5 stages if i remember the developer are updating once a week , they do hell of a good job here.To those who is saying don't buy etc etc , stop whining , it said clearly before you buy it , that the game it is on early stages of developing , with out reviews and the forums the developers can truck bugs they have missed and correct them.This is what early access really means.Can't wait for full release , i 'm and old DK + DK2 player my self. Was about time someone release the 3rd part (even with different name) . Was waiting looooooong time for this. Go Dev's we're behind ya mates , give us Dungeons , show us what old school games was about .Recommended 100% it worth its money trust me.			"

								Well in it's current state it's a worthy follower of the Dungeon Keeper series, still early on but the general gameplay you can try out closely resembles Dungeon Keeper.Dig tunnels and build rooms, dig some more to find more gold so you can build even bigger rooms and manufacture traps. Just to end it by destroying the opponent(s).I look forward to the day it's finished.I haven't seen any bugs or performance issues yet, so that's another plus aswell. "

												The game is pretty good, I really recommend it. Because the game has like alot of features, and once you complete Campaign, you can also play with bots in skrimish mode, or go to sandbox to play some certain developer-made scenarios and maps with no objectives. Play with your friends or other people in multiplayer, and dominate them with your Dungeon core skills. And play survival mode which is still a prototype. This game is really good. The only problem I have with this game is the AI, if your aren't ust to strategy games, you'll have lots of issues with the AI, but when you've been playing strategy games and other type of games that are similar will have entertained for hours, days and even months. Overall, this game is fantastic!			"

												The spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper II is not without it's faults, but compared to anything else in the market, or the heresy that is Dungeon Keepr Mobile, it has no competition.The hands off approach will turn some people off, but if you wanted to try a modern Dungeon Keeper-esque title, this is the one to get.

												Dungeon Keeper was my most favorite game of all time, and I've been waiting a little under 14 years for the sequel that never came, until now that is.I'd recommend this game to anyone who appreciates the older, finer games that were common place a decade ago.-Edit-Now that the game has been fully released, I'll give it my 1.0 day 1 launch review. I'll review it again once there is a more stable patch.This game captures Dungeon Keepers essense without question, it is everything you can expect from a Dungeon Keeper sequel and more. It's unique style sets itself apart and is a breath of fresh air, but you cant help but think you're playing Dungeon Keeper. For this I can give the abiance, theme, gameplayand atmosphere no less than 11/10Now onto my problems with the game.The game feels very rushed, the skirmish mode is limited to 3 maps, limited to 2 players with a smallish map with little to it. It seems like they are placeholder maps, and it's not like the sandbox map is a small as the skirmish maps. I feel like for launch, 3 small sized 2 player maps doesn't cut it.In multiplayer, it is extremely buggy as the minions don't fight each other properly, the game is prone to crashing, I noticed when destroying another players dungeon heart, damage doesn't appear to be dealt either.The campaign is very prone to FPS drops, no matter the persons computer specs. It first appears in mission 3, or in any game where the enemey can attack your dungeon heart, as for whatever reason that drops FPS to unplayable levels, That isn't the end to the FPS drops as from mission 4 on, FPS drops are common and on mission 4, happen right at the end as you're mousing over the inhibiters and shrines and for the rest of the game once you have vision of that area.These will all be patched so I will edit this post once it has been fixed, but for those expecting to buy this game and play it over the weekend, this post is to warn you that the game is having a troubled launch as most games do.

Posted: October 27, 2014
												War for the Overworld has now been officially released with a story campaign I can play through and the love the devs have put into this project has become apparent.It's messy around the edges and could be perfect with a bit of tidying up, but here's my re-review for you:War for the Overworld has successfully put itself on the map as the best dungeon ""god"" simulator we've had for a long, long time. It is incredibly similar to Dungeon Keeper (so much so that I keep struggling to call it otherwise in my Let's Play for it!).Now, when I first re-opened the game, I was again annoyed that everything seemed a bit bland and grim around the edges in colour. A strange criticism for a game surrounding evil overlords, but one worth adding. I did however have a personal fix for this. One that I haven't had to utilize in years, outside of a horror game. I adjusted the gamma ... though I did so by a whooping 60% brighter.I can now see the detail the devs have put into some of the blocks, the rooms, the gold veins, the walls and more. It's a very, very beautiful sight to see and one that brings back many memories to the old DK games that WFTO was inspired by. It just seems such a shame that the darkness level is so off that I needed to adjust it by that amount to see the gorgeous detail (something I haven't had to do on any other game in my library or console, since Resident Evil 5 on the 360!).Would I recommend WFTO to an RTS friend or a friend new to gaming?As of this re-review, yes I would.Summary of Pros and Cons:Pros:Art team have worked incredibly hard on their designs, with only a few feeling ""rushed"" or in need of improvement. To perfect this, I'd recommend a DLC release of additional textured skins for monsters. Allowing players to see their succubi with the more traditional tail, wings and hoofs demon look, or the Cultist with an entirely different robe/without hood (take DK2's hero creatures and do one better, especially if you're charging for it!)Spells very potent and powerful, though mana caps left me feeling like a kid waiting for their pocket money (even with a limited amount of workers and traps!), as mana slowly trickled up again. It's a tough balancing act I suppose, though I'd rather cast more harmful spells with less damage, than a more potent one, waiting for the resources to do so. Dungeon Keeper 1's charging spells did a very good job of that, giving you additional options to take on your foes.The sound effect team have done an amazing job, leaving me without anything but praise in that department. Music wise, we could use something a bit more noticeable from time to time, with the most notable bit of ambience that comes to mind, being the beating of your dungeon core. Maybe have a track that brings more epic to large scale combat?Traps are simple, but effective and the rate at which they're constructed is lovely. Constructs are a beautiful addition that allow for a great deal of variety when planning both your attacks and defences and bring in a truly unique mechanic to the familiar game play style we have come to love.This now feels like a suitable replacement for the game-play style of the Dungeon Keeper games, though it has also put itself on the map with unique mechanics only found within WFTO.The animations that are in the game look very nice and flow very well! This is a bitter sweet bit of praise that I'll elaborate on in the cons section...Cons:Certain lines of dialogue appear time and time again and just aren't bold enough in their dark humour to be as funny as the standard we've seen before. The Cultist is constantly testing my patience and leaving me to consider home schooling my workers, simply so that I can hurl the cultists into the torture chamber, due to lacking a suitable means of gagging them. The narrator is especially bad for this, with introductions nattering on for far too long, quips being far too frequent and notifications severely needing a ""Toggle Vocal Notifications Off"" option.It's not that I don't appreciate him telling me that a Gnarling has entered my dungeon, but at times it almost sounds as if he's telling me ""A Gnarling has picked his nose and flicked the snot. Just thought you should know."" some things need a verbal notification, whilst others could do nicely with a quick icon to let you know.Animations! Where art thou? I want to see the creatures roaming idle around my dungeon, DRINKING in the tavern or playing darts! I want to see the creatures walking about exploring the halls, or performing a unique idle animation to give more character! You have amazing animators on your team, so I cannot stress how much this would add to breathe life into your key actors, the monsters themselves! Picking up minions, dropping them and by ALL THAT IS EVIL, give them a unique and satisfying reaction (for us ;) ) to being slapped!The right click is not being utilized as well as it could, and it would be nice to see a grand overview of the mini map, akin to DK's right click to enlarge and snap to location. Breaking out of possession should be a right click motion. You need to be given the ability to maim your enemy as quickly as possible through the eyes of your beast, so again, ""Attack"" should be your default ability upon possessing a monster.Placeholders. Ladies and Gentlemen, you know this is absolutely unacceptable for a fully released game, though I have no doubt at all that this will be updated in time.I now consider WFTO a fun game to play, that has delivered quality for the money I originally paid way back when. If you are sitting on the fence about buying this, I would say go for it. You will find a fun game full of love, though one that is currently in a late state of Early Access.Old negative review below:The contents below are from my previous experiences with WFTO which was originally a ""Not Recommended"" critique. I still have a critique to give, but I would recommend this game to a friend in its current state, even with a very cheeky release from Early Access.Prior to editing this 153/266 people (58%) agreed with the contents below, for an October 2014 Early Access review.""This review is written as a review from an early access point of view.This game will attract people in pursuit of a way to sake their Dungeon Keeper cravings, but unfortunately the execution of War for the Overworld just seems very off to me and I'll try to explain why.The art style carries something that isn't all that unique considering its inspiration here, though inside the game it sadly follows the horrible dark pallet of muddy browns and snot greens. The original Bullfrog games carried a lovely sense of character behind their cartoony characters with a mix of gritty in there, though the monsters featured in War for the Overworld (Monsters being the most critical desired feature for this kind of game), all lack a true sense of personality and shine, with none of them really standing out and saying ""Hey look at me! I'm a really epic looking creature! I'm the funny creature that hits like a tank!"", it just feels lacking here.I bought the game very early on and have logged on progressively overtime to inspect the updates. After what seems like a year now, the updates have been far too slow and lacking in real momentum, especially considering the price tag and how early this early access game arrived.This game carries a positive review score currently, though from what I've seen of them, quite a few of these reviews are posted with the hope and praise that this game is the next Dungeon Keeper.Sadly, at the time of writing this, I believe this game is not a viable replacement for your evil sandbox and doesn't seem like it will be any time soon.""

												Just finished the main campaign.  This was so so so buggy when it was first released a year ago, but the game has since matured into a really great DK clone.  If you gave up on it back then, I urge you to give it another try.  I'm dubious about the ending to the main campaign, but I thoroughly enjoyed the game without reservation up until that point.  My one other criticism is that a lot of the levels involved tight time crunches that prevented me from spending time on my favorite part - building the dungeon.  But again, that was just a quibble.  I had a lot of fun.			"

												For those that played the old rts Dungeon Keeper series in the 90's this game was greatly inspired by it. It really shines as a fan inspired Dungeon Keeper and I really enjoyed playing the game. Thankfully these guys are keeping this type of rts alive. The Overworld devs has been adding and patching this game since it was released early and im glad that its now reached to a full on game. Glad I had the chance to add to the kickstart when they announced back then. I would fully recommend getting this if your a fan of Dungeon Keeper. Already got a gift copy to send to a friend.  Definitely a must buy when you see this on sale too. I can't wait for more updates and dlc for this game.			"

												*** NOMINATED FOR A STEAM AWARD 24TH November 2016 ***I purchased War for the Overworld Underlord Edition + Early Adopter Bonus (Early Access) on 22/08/2014.I put off playing until this month as I wanted to support the development and wait for a more ""polished"" game.Following is my review of my experience playing from start to finish (Avoiding spoilers and game play guides).I have been building, customizing and using personal computers and consoles since the late 80s.My system is:AMD FX 9370 Eight-Core Processor @4.7GHz32GB PC2200 RAMSamsung 850 EVO 250GB SSDWestern Digital Black 2TBPowerColor R9 290 4GB GFX CardRunning x64 Windows 8.1 EnterpriseStarting the game I found loading times to be a bit long.Once starting to play the experience was good.Each level progression was as to be expected and offered a more robust enemy, however, each level up to and including level 11 took no more than two attempts to finish. The hardest level from my experience was level 12. I took sometime to complete this level with at least five attempts being racked up.The final level was very easy. In fact too easy. The only reason I took more than three attempts to complete it was due to a bug that stopped me. This bug persisted through game save and load and system restart forcing me to start the level over on two occasions.The ending was disappointing. Leaving me, and others, to think the end cut scene was glitched. (I no longer believe this is the case).Bad:Loading times are long, especially when launching the game I often had ""Program not responding"" dialogs pop up. After clicking wait for program to respond the game would start.Lag, Lag and more Lag! The game lags a lot. Especially when big battles are happening.Still buggy in parts. Even though the game is now considered a ""Release"" product.AI can be very stupid. Good for us trying to beat it. No so good for over all game enjoyment.Sometimes mid battle you are healing or zapping trying to protect your core and.... ARRRRR.... A cut scene as a new minion enters your dungeon with no way to skip the bloody thing.Good:As a fan of the Dungeon Keeper games and having spent many, many hours playing them this game does not disappoint and keeps to the spirit of the DK sieris.Despite all of the ""Bad"" above the game is still well worth buying as I am sure with refinement via patches this will fix most of the issues.Bottom line:I would recommend this game if you are a fan of the DK games or if you are new.I score this game 7/10. (This is because I am a fan of the DK games and can over look the issues I had).I hope the issues are patched and if/when they are the game will be much better.			"

YouTube™ Video: War for the Overworld - Heart of Gold: The Review

			War for the Overworld - Heart of Gold: The Review WFTO: 7/10 | HoG: 5/10 Wanna know why? Watch the video. Be sure to drop me a link in the comments section to your own reviews so I can watch and give...		

When WFTO was first released I was really excited but having played it I was left a bit disappointed. But since then, the game has just gotten better and better with a lot of love and care from the developers, new features and bug fixes all totally free through patches, whereas most games would release them as DLC. So it goes to show that Sub. Games really care about their player base to give them some pretty monumental new features without asking for a penny. (I'm talking about The Map Creator, of course).It came as a surprise to me that the Heart of Gold Expansion arrived, it's something that I wasn't expecting at all and I was more than willing to pay the very reasonable fee for this content and I certainly wasn't disappointed, Heart of Gold gives access to some pretty cool new features along with a new campaign of 4 maps which pushes the story forward, this time playing as Kasita (A Dungeon Master you defeated in the Original Campaign), which had me bouncing with excitement.The new campaign is fun and challenging and well worth the money. I really look forward to the Next Expansion... Though I still don't quite understand what the heck happened at the end of the Original Game and indeed why ""Daddy Pig"" turned on us... Very confusing!All in all rating for WFTO: 7/10			"

												Well. Where to begin.To start off, i played dungeon keeper 2, never really dungeon keeper 1. I LOVED dk2. Absolutely played the hell out of it.Obviously i cant play that anymore, so for ages i looked for a worthy successor to Bullfrog's games.This game will do.You can clearly see they've been inspired by the dungeon keeper series.You start off with your hand, a dungeon heart that you need to protect, and some imps. With your hand, you can mark tiles for your imps to dig and claim for you. Then you can make rooms into the space you've dug out like a library, a lair where your minions rest, or a pig farm where your minions can feed on succulent pig flesh (They make such a satisfying splatter noise when you eat them), or a workshop where certain minions can build traps and doors to guard your dungeon.As the game progresses, you get access to more rooms like the prison, torture chamber, graveyard or Sanctuary. You also unlock more defenses and spells, giving you more options during battle, planning your dungeon or keeping your gold up to level.The campaign by itself is pretty decent, here and there are a few bugs the devs havent fixed yet, but nothing game-breaking as far as i could tell. I would also recommend the Heart of Gold DLC pack for another campaign, as that one was also nice to play, and adds a few extras.Campaign however, is not the only thing you can play. You can skirmish against other Underlords, with AI that you can ramp up or reduce the difficulty of as you please, there are sandbox maps where you get a dungeon heart, lots and lots of space to build and dig and roomify as you please, with an inert hero portal and controls for it so you can choose when you want to have heroes banging on your doors.There are a few things that require adjustment, but i wouldn't say they make the game unplayable, just a bit annoying sometimes. Overall i'd say this game is a solid 7/10. Not as great as i had hoped, but it's not bad. Not bad at all. "

War for the Overworld is quite obviously the true successor to Dungeon Keeper 2.War for the Overworld perfectly captures the feel of Dungeon Keeper as well as standing up on its own, regardless of the clear ties to the classic title. It feels good, it plays good, it is good. AI is balanced and provides a genuine challenge. Story Mode expertly blends compelling gameplay with teaching you the game step by step. At the time of writing, I haven't personally tried multiplayer, but if it is as good as the rest of the game, it's good.I don't know what else to say. With EA being, well, EA with the original series, this is your next best thing. And it is an excellent second option.Plus the announcer for both Dungeon Keepers is the same for this.A masterpiece. 10/10 Asmodeus sent me an inbox.			"

												I have not had the time to play the game a whole lot yet.  What I have seen so far I really like.  I have played all the Dungeon Keeper games of old.  I do miss ol'Horny and the mistresses.  I realize that they can't do those for legal reasons, but it sure would be great.  I also miss the cut scenes from the original that came up between the scenerios. They were hilarious and gave the old games great charm.  But back to this one.  It is well worth your time and effort.  You can tell these guys actually care about the old Dungeon Keeper games.  I for one think they have done a great job so far.  Are there things that could be added  -- sure.  Are there things missing -- sure.  You have to not only give them time, but they also have a staff to pay.  Great games are not free and this one was started on a shoe string and has been done about as well as could be.I recomend this game for anyone that likes RTS's with a twist.  And for all those DK fans out there -- This one IS WORTH it.			"

												War for the Overworld is a really well-implemented and polished reimagination of the original Dungeon Keeper games. The game is really good at keeping the gameplay and feel of the original games while improving both the UI and certain aspects like army management. The game features a solid campaign and tons of rooms, spells and other mechanics for the player to explore. Personally, I think the game might even have too many mechanics. You constantly unlock new stuff and I haven't felt the need to use most of it. While I generally like the game, there is one HUGE caveat, which is the ending of the campaign. I will not spoil it here, but I've never experienced such a cheap and annoyingly expansion-baiting end in a game before. It left me feeling really unfulfilled. Nevertheless, the pros outweigh the huge con in my opinion. If you've liked Dungeon Keeper, you'll enjoy this game. "

												Greetings, dungeon keep...err, I mean Underlord,I had been playing Dungeon Keeper II for a couple of decades when I heard about this game by chance, back when it was still bare-bones early access.At the time I bought it mainly to get some money to the devs in the hopes that they would actually produce a worthy sequel to the aforementioned Dungeon Keeper II and not just take me and the other early accessers money and run laughing into the hills. So I played the bare-bone version when I bought it, felt a bit ambivalant about it and then as the months passed I forgot completely that I even had it. Until now that is!So, coming back to the game now that it is more fleshed out, has a couple of campaigns and is generally a lot stabler I must say that I'm really enjoying it. It still has its issues but I cant tell if thats my now somewhat decrepid computer or the game itself; Units occasionally just freezeing in place and not doing anything being the most common and annoying problem. Other than that, it looks good, feels good. The narrator is spot on. The art direction pretty interesting and yeah, I suppose over all it just feels like I'm playing Dungeon Keeper III.Now this last part is both high praise and a bit of a negative critique in one; DKII set the gold standard for dungeon management sims so the fact that this delivers the same albeit somewhat updated experience is awesome. To an extent.Yes there are more mechanics to enjoy such as in game research, alchemy and rituals but it still feels almost like a reskinned carbon copy of DKII. Almost. Although maybe that's what they were intentionally going for. I havent read the dev blogs or anythign but if that is the case, kudos to them. They really nailed it. It would have been nice to see a tad more ambition but ho hum... Still, this is by no means a damning indictment of the game, just an observation. I wanted a spiritual successor to DKII and I got one. I haven't tried any of the other Dungeon Sims that has been cropping up recently so I can't compare.All in all, an enjoyable game to sate my inner dungeon architect. Because that's the most fun part right? Designing the actual dungeon and making it look all nice? Building up ingenious defences and watching the good guys crash and break against the bulwarks only to be dragged unconcious into the dark echoing interior to never see the light of day again, yeah?Well, it is for me in any case; in game as well as in real life... Erm...I may have said too much. Dungeon? I know of no dungeons, officer......Bye!			"

												Are you feeling like a sad imp, unlike the proud Underlord you should be? Are you missing your piles of gold and minions to slap? Do not hesitate any longer, as worthy servants have toiled hard to ensure that you will have a new world to conquer. The original underground might have fallen under a terrible management, but this new world offers both a familiar kick of the old and a slightly different take on the whole slaughter, pillage, punish and so forth gig. Nostalgic feelings may arise from time to time, and you need to be aware Underlord, that your memory often serves a bit more gold on the old world than what it actually had. Speaking of gold, the effort the creative minions have placed into this is utterly incredible. Forced by the cruel constraints of reality, that often works better than any torture even you lord could imagine, they still persevered. From placing their hopes on the gold shrine known as Kickstarter, to working overtime in order to get things done and done right, their dedication and love for you Underlord shines true. I recommend that you give them some extra meat for that. I hear that anyone can be made into a great meal. As you embark on this new adventure of conquest my Lord, I hope you'll notice my familiar voice and enjoy what you have been waiting years for. Give it an honest chance and don't let the past be your guide. The Overworld needs a leader and he doesn't have time to weep about his lost dungeon.Welcome back Underlord, your kingdom awaits!			"

I have had this game as an Early Access user and yes I got stuck, like any normal person would. I left it for a while and came back to it. Really enjoyed myself with this game. Possible improvements?

I really didn't think this game would require such high specs.So now I have revised my review and changed it to ""I would RECOMMEND this game"", with the condition that the pc specs need to be high enough (Windows # 64 bit + 8 GB of RAM + decent GPU). IMO this game is definately fun, I just wish I had a pc that has high enough specs to play it. :)			"

												So, some mixed feelings on this one. It doesn't drop the ball hard and it had the potential to. There have been a lot of attempts at making games like Dungeon Keeper and many of them failed. War for the Overworld doesn't fail so much as I feel like they could have done more.Mostly, the campaign is a bit short. Took me 20 hours and a lot of that was me choosing to make things harder for myself than I had to. Ending is a bit weird, but seems like they're setting themselves up for DLC.			"

												First of all:Game is buggy as hell, Yes I am not hiding it! I cannot progress pass thru campaign due to game breaking bug, also I had another several other bugs that are game breaking  (PLEASE fix these before focusing on other stuff such as MP) Performance issues are there, For example you are unable to play the game for 2 long or build 2 much before game starts to have Degrading Preformance so much that its almost unplayable.Game Enjoyment? Quite FUN! If they fix all the bugs and preformance issues then I guess the game would be awesomeif they were to add an AI you could play against it would be more fun. (Currently The AI feels stupid is the best word I can say) Features, Lacking yes, but fun? yes till I you mastered them then the game feels typical RTS game where you must find the fastest way to start up a dungeon (APM is another word)Gameplay. So far I had fun but I have to say I would wait a bit till they fixed and polished the game ...otherwise I STRONGLY recomend it....			"

												For people who know (and love) Dungeon Keeper:WFTO is in my opinion the first worthy sequel to the DK-games from Bullfrog, BUT it is A LOT like DK2... the gaming-feeling is almost the same and the rooms arent very different. I personaly prefered DK1 over DK2 and therefore my expections where maybe a little high, cause I waited about 12 year for a game like this.But like I marked, i recommend this game. because it is still a really good game (like the DK1/2 where long before) and i have to admit, that there were some good and new ideas, which improved gameplay a litte (like the ""replacement earth"" construct, which allows you to add a tile of normal earth, which is a dream for perfectionist like me).I have stil one thing to complain about: the campaign is WAY too short!! 12 lvls... c'mon... for experienced players it will take you about 10-15h...

												One campaign, a look through the level editor and a rapid check of the multiplayer later, can I truly give this game a honest review ? Oberon help me, let's do this.WFTO is a labour of love, a game that was born from passion rather than a desire for money.It is the kind of experience that might be less polished than other games (the game could use a ton of bugfixes), but every inch of the game has been crafted with passion, and you've got to respect that. But there's a lot to say about this spiritual sequel to Dungeon Keeper.Graphically, the game is superb, and more importantly, it's memorable ! From the colorful rooms, to the dark creatures, down to the little details like the awesome logo (can't keep my eyes off that logo, it's pretty !) or the achievement icons, this games looks great. Kudos to the art team.Musically there isn't much to discuss, the music is very discrete, but the sound design and narrator voice more than make up for that silence. Too bad after 20 hours all I wanted was for him to shut up, because he never stops talking. Campaign is solid, a good tutorial that suffers from some ridiculous difficulty spikes at times. I rage quit some missions multiple times because some rival underlord's actions are very random and they won't behave the same way every time.In the end, this game could potentially become a worthy successor to DK/DK2, but it still needs some fine tuning and polishing. In terms of content, there's more than enough to keep you busy for months, but I don't really feel compelled to return now that i have finished the campaign (which is still something only 10% of the playerbase has done, so hurray !).Wait for the developers to iron out most problems, wait for it to go on sale, and grab yourself a copy of War for the Overworld.

												It's Dungeon Keeper under a different name. Very much the real deal. Needs some polish on the UI, but otherwise it is completely authentic Dungeon Keeper, right down to your narrator, voice oozing with evil, occasionally cracking in and saying in utter disgust, ""one of your minions has started a union!""Give it a go, support the developers. It seems that it's still being worked on even now, and with the quality and variety of what's here that's only good news.			"

												A very good remake of Dungeon Keeper.  Nice graphical and UI upgrade over the original.  Building your dungeon is fun. However, this game suffer from the same flaw as the original, namely uninspiring combat.  You just pick your minions, drop them on the invaders and then hope for the best.  The rally flags aren't very useful, they could be improved by having one for each creature types.  Possession mode is still the coolest feature you'll never use.  Finished the main campaign in about 18h, mostly playing on easy (50% speed).			"

												One of the few game based Kickstarter projects I've backed and which have delivered. WFTO is an enjoyable game, with great audio and visual's, and is a worthy spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper. With caveats.DK2 remains one of my favourite games, but WFTO can't quite match it. With DK2, I am content to spend a very long time building a dungeon, training my forces and then annihilating my foes. WFTO on the other hand wants you to speedrun the levels as fast as possible. Combine that with some really poor performance problems, I ended up shelving the game for a very long time, only picking it up again recently to finish it off. (Also, as a sideeffect of being forced to ""rush"" levels, the game feels bloody short).As a Kickstarter backer, one of the perks I received was a custom dungeon skin - I have never even seen this as it doesn't apply for the main campain. Assumably then it applies to multiplayer (which I'm unlikely to play) or sandbox, which I'm likely to try once or twice. Plus, the game offers bonus skins for unlocking speedrun achivements. Not that I have done these, but again I don't see the point of custom skins if you can only use them in limited places.That's all my opinion, so may be different for you. I hope the expansion is a little more laid back though.			"

												Overall quite a decent game, though it isnt as good as the original Dungeon Keeper, i find it suffers the same problems as Dungeon Keeper 2 contrasted to the first one, with abit too much of humanoid-creatures as oposed to the monster-freakshow that used to be the first one, though i've enjoyed myself somewhat with it, and and in of itself would probatly recommend it if you're into the genre of Dungeon-Management or Theme-Hospital/Prison Manager type games.Negative, Major Irks.-Realy dislike the need to have to ""Recall"" your minions rather than picking them up heads off when they're off friendly terratory, especialy given the AI's tendacy to want to wander off without anything encouraging them to do so, and this point is what takes 1.5 points straight off the bat off my score, the recall-function is clunky and annoying and not very user friendly or nice-feeling when you have to swap to a panel (to spells) to even do it.-I miss, the hand actualy HOLDING your creature and watching some of them flail about within it's grasp, and feel like it's a loss of a dark-humor thing.-Lack of Hardware Cursor Option, the ingame ""cursor"" seems delayed and swaying and isnt very smooth to controll.-7.5/10.

My CPU is more than enough to handle this game and doesn't go anywhere near capping even during these odd little hiccups, but that's a minor annoyance rather than a dealbreaker.The original War for the Overworld campaign gives you several hours to play with and acts as sort of an extended tutorial, which may disappoint some but I'm happy to say that with 1.4 and the first expansion ""Heart of Gold"" there's more for you to do with fewer restrictions. A couple new mechanics are added in as well, so it's more than just an added campaign.I highly recommend War for the Overworld on its own merits, but don't expect a traditional RTS as it's more of a god game.

												Pretty fun game. I really enjoy the atmosphere and the narrator is fantastic. Certain parts are fairly dumbed down compared to what you would expect in a typical RTS, but I don't consider that a bad thing (in fact I would say it works great in this kind of game). Your minions are mostly automated and will do their jobs and train themselves but as the underlord you can of course micro them as much as you want. I also find the idea of you as the dungeon master having a mana bar as a resource to cast spells, build defences, and hire workers pretty unique as well. Now that's not to say the game doesn't have some problems. Even though your minions are autonomous they are sometimes kind of stupid and don't sleep, eat, or get their paycheck quick enough and you'll often get messages that they're unhappy. This can usually be solved by just clicking on them and dropping them into the area they are lacking in but I don't really think you should have to do that when you don't have them assigned to anything. The worker flag is kind of irritating too because you can either force all workers to work on an area (sometimes I want like  2-3 still working on the other side) or you can let them decide what to prioritize and sometimes they'll just dig walls or run off to another task instead of placing all the floor tiles down while I'm waiting to make a room. Note that this may just be me not being good enough at the game to figure out how to assign workers properly.The economy system is kind of wierd too. You get unlimited gold from workers mining these ""gold shrines"" which are big rectangular boxes. I think if maybe gold acted like mana where you could mine a big chunk of it, but it wouldn't start recharging until you stopped mining it for awhile it might be better? I'm not sure. This isn't really a major complaint but it's something I dislike. Overall, the game does have a number of issues, but nearly all of them can be overlooked or are very minor. I do highly recommend trying out War for the Overworld because it does feel really unique to play as an actual bad guy for once. The gameplay is solid and so far the campaign has been a very enjoyable experience.			"

												I haven't played Dungeon Keeper in more than a decade but as far as I'm concerned this is the spiritual successor that definitely fulfills a niche that needed filling. The narrator has that wickedly eeevil sound, most of the maps are challenging, and the game is just plain fun. Initially I was frustrated with aspects of the interface and AI but after getting into the game a few levels then going back to the tutorial, I realized I missed a few things that were covered that were integral to playing. Some areas of the interface could use some polishing, like the war flags on the right (which in my opinion should be easier-to-click inlaid icons) but once you learn the keyboard hotkeys they stop frustrating you. The deveopers also seem to take an active interest in responding to the community and they're regularly putting out patches so thumbs up there. I'd say the biggest gripes I have is an inability to pause or slow the game; I'm not sure if you could pause in DK or DK2 but it just seems sensible that this should be an included function with rushing maps that have timed waves. I also wish happy minions would follow your build instructions in the order they were assigned rather that engaging in what seems random instructions. You have a wave coming at you in 2 minutes and they've decided to reinforce walls in a useless room rather than dig out the dirt. While you can specify an area for them to focus on, this function doesn't always work nor does it rate high on my useability scale.I should also add that I've experienced no performance issues whatsoever and the game runs like a dream on my i7 with nvidia GTX 970 with all settings maxed.

												This game is incredibly enjoyable and really captures the old Dungeon Keeper spirit, while adding a few tricks of its own.I avoided the rocky, buggy launch at the start and have come in a bit later into the game. Boy was it worth hanging back, as the recent review score shows (81% as of writing this)The expansion is great, the campaign is fun (better then DK2 I would say as there's an emphasis on variation between missions) and the old sandbox and skirmish maps are there. What really made the old Dungeon Keepers stand out was the player made maps. Getting PCGamer magazines as a kid with the disks that contained the odd extra map, or downloading them achingly slow off of third party websites on dial up, all that fun. I'm glad to see the workshop in action to allow some great player content.I cannot recommend this game enough if you're after a real successor to DK3.			"

												Heart of Gold was a good example of this games engine working well and trying to be it's own game, breaking away a bit from the shadow of Dungeon Keeper. The level designs and challenges fit the mechanics of this game much better then the original game and I highly suggest people give it a crack. That said I feel this game still has a little ways to go. I am eager to see another fully fleshed out campaign and I hope they bring in a few more features that were missed from the original dungeon keeper game mainly your attachments to certain units.

You build a dungeon to attract minions, these minions help you achieve the mission objectives.I have played through all of the base level missions and just starting on the heart of gold patch.  Overall, it is a very fun game, with alot of nostalgia for those who played DK but like DK it can sometimes be tedious.  Overall very good.			"

												I love this game, at first it was abit buggy (earlier versions) and with every patch they make this game better and better. There are still bugs yes but this is still in ALPHA/BETA and honestly I think they are doing a great job. They fix bugs more or less instantly when you report them and constantly add new content or improve old content to give it a better design via listening to users in the community. You know DayZ? Five years and only added one car and two new weapons? Yeah not these guys. Serious fans of the DK series and do their best to make this game the best it can be.Also if you do want to speak to the developers we have a Discord chat where the QA team and Development team are online constantly and always talk to the community in real time. Good luck finding another game with these kind of guys behind it, interact with the community, listen to you, and actually respond. I wish all developers were like these as they are so in-touch with their fan base.These guys/girls are a fine example of exactly how to develop a game from ALPHA and keep your community strong and enertained, and bring in new content very very regularly. Abit of effort and hard work - Well done to you guys, a shining example of how it should be.			"

												Good, modernized version of Dungeon Keeper. The game has some flaws and is badly optimized, which can result in bad performance even on newer system configurations. The campaign is a good introduction into the game mechanics and often missions can be done in many different ways. The missions later on in the game will often appear undoable at first but once you understand what mechanic or concept the devs tried to teach in that mission/lesson, it will become a lot easier (good work on that). The campaign is a little short however and the story is generic at best. Great voice acting on the advisor which in my opinion is often a little too serious.You can tell that the devs have tried to trim the game for competitive multiplayer, which is why the game feels a lot more hectic and microintensive than DK. Unfortunately it is hard to find a multiplayer match, due to the lack of players.			"

												I have to echo the lion's share of the complaints on here, ""What is with that ending""? I mean I understand what it's trying to communicate, but it's just so inadequate.That being said, I loved Dungeon Keeper and this is more of the same. There seemed to be a little more in the way of help in Dungeon Keeper but once you ease in to WFTO you'll find nuance that never existed in the old catalogue. I will forever miss the comedic cut scenes between levels in the campaign of DK II but we can't have it all, can we?I do find umbrage in the way AI is handled. Specifically, I find it a little unbalanced that the computer players can produce the enitre contents of their dungeon in under a second while I have to slowly rally my troops or click them, ten at a time, to the desired location. This is especially frustrating in later levels of the campaign or when playing master difficulty in Skirmish mode.My glee returns however with the addition of new spells. Some of which feel spectacularly more sadistic, such as turning enemy captives into gold statues. I do like the new shrines and I am honestly one of those folks that wanted to see the ability to add walls.I don't see myself wasting as much time with this one as I did with DK, but is that because I already played DK? Is it because the content isn't there quite yet? This remains to be seen, but for now, A Solid Buy.			"

												Review date 2016/01/03, version 1.3, Win OS, only 36 hours under the belt. DK fanboy. 7/10 if they fix the stuttering.It really does feel like you're playing Dungeon Keeper. It has a somewhat more serious tone than the originals, whether or not that's a good thing will be personal preference.They're apparently already working on patch 1.4. There are few issues  as far as I can see that would negatively affect the gameplay - the only one really that got under my skin was the stuttering on the larger maps. Decent graphics & music creates a nice atmosphere. The game is more fast paced than DK2 - I'd recommend setting the game speed to about 60-70%My single player experience : The first half has a distinct DK1 feel to it, while later on with the bigger maps it plays more like DK2.  The campaign was a little short for my liking but I would happily buy an expansion to extend that playtime. Some levels are pretty challenging while others are too easy.Minions : A lot of people didn't like that you had so many ""human"" minions in DK2 and I feel they have a nice balance here. When you upgrade your beast lair and build a fighting pit, you get 4 different types plus beastmasters who whip them all the way to the pit so they fight each other for xp, the beastmaster also gets xp from this. You have 2 rally flags, one for beasts and one for all your minions so you can use your beasts to ward of small groups without interrupting your minions. Beasts don't collect wages, just the beast master.Undead : Personally I like the way they handled it. Vampires are created by making 3 sacrifices and having a ritual charged. They eat live prisoners. Corpses from the battlefield, torture chamber & prison (after a vampire feeds or they they lie there too long because the prison is full) are taken to the crypt where your necromancers raise them as ghouls (skeletons) who then permanently follow the necro that raised them. Prisoners eat the rats and will not die in your prison.Potions : A new feature where at the cost of some gold you create potions to be used similar to spells. Build an alchemy lab to attract crackpots who will brew them for you.Another absolutely great new feature is the ability to create dirt blocks. In DK2 I'd often lose an hour of play because some dwarf decided to tunnel into my dungeon and I would restart the level. How I wish this was a feature in DK2.			"

												I always wished for a sequel to the Dungeon Keeper series.Now I hoped to have found it.In itself it is very similar to the Dungeon Keeper games.Yet I either was wearing my nostalgia glasses, or this game is lacking the certain something.I cannot quite put my finger on it, but War for the Overworld did not really tie me to the computer like DK used to.Forgetting DK War f.t. Overworld surely is a decent game.It might be confusing to get into, but that is no problem if you play the campaign and stuff first.All in all I can say:If you came here looking for a DK sequel, go and try the game out. After all you can refund it.If you stumbled across it without knowing Dungeon Keeper, you found a well made strategy game that keeps unfolding itself more and more the bigger your dungeon becomes.

												OMG!!!!! after playing this for just under 40 minutes two words and one number perfectly describe my feelings on the game, Dungeon Keeper 3, It's not just like Dungeon Keeper it is Dungeon Keeper anyone who is a fan of Dungeon Keeper 2 will enjoy this game and to anyone who isn't a fan of Dungeon Keeper and isn't sure about paying the full price for it at least get it on sale and try it out. Also I have now renamed the shortcut on my Desktop to Dungeon Keeper 3 :)			"

												I did not play this game in Early Access. My impression is based on the current release. This game has everything I loved about the Dungeon Keeper series and has its own take on things like skilltrees for unlocking building/spells. Yes, you still can possess minions in this ""spiritual successor"" and take first-person control over them. The building-your-own-dungeon aspect will be familiar to anyone who has played the series this game is inspired by.The finishing touch is Richard Ridings and the excellent narration that gave the original Dungeon Keeper its charm. I haven't played much of this game so far, but I'm 100% enjoying it. If you're looking for a modernized take on Dungeon Keeper this one is a buy.			"

												At first War for the overlord, looks and feels like dungeon keeper. But its not.The campaign is sort of fun…. But then the game unravels.With the AI having near perfect micromanagement. It feels like you’re playing a Korean RTS pro ever time.  After the 4th o5 th time of trying a level you realize that doing your choirs would be more fun. The Enemy AI has near perfect micromanagement.  I don’t know about you but my idea of fun is not to fight the hardest enemy from day dot. This gets very frustrating and takes the fun out of the game.It’s so close to being good but it’s so far at the same time.Not sure if the game is finished. But I do know the AI needs to be fixed and maybe add some difficulty levels for people who like to play games for fun. 4 out of 10.Good effort add some fun and difficulty modes you would get an 8			"

												I really like this game.  It's more complicated than Dungeon II which I also really like.  I do feel that the tutorial in Dungeon II campaign is better though because it explains each little item as you go.  War for the Overworld does not do this.  For instance on Level 7 you really need to build the bombard traps and lots of them but the game does not teach you that you need foundries to get toolboxes to build defenses.  I had a lot of defenses but none of them were building so I had to watch a video online and not only did it show me that you need foundries but that you can pick up toolboxes and put them directly on the defenses to speed up their building.  The game also did not teach me how to use the screen that lists all your monsters and click on it to pick up guys.  I learned that from watching a youtube video.  On level 7 I found the lack of gold to be my biggest obstacle but using blood money and a big prison and turning all their guys into gold statues did the trick.  Infinite gold basically.  Actually it might be level 9 where you have the gold problems looking at my notes.     One problem I have with the game is that moving around on the screen does not work well with the mouse.  In Dungeons II the mouse moves around on the screen really well but in War for the Overworld you really need to use the arrow keys instead.  It works really well with the arrow keys.  Another problem is the game is a bit dark and so it's harder to see the screen.  I understand underground is supposed to be dark but I would really appreciate a little more light for visibility.  Overall the game does a really good job in that you have many minion choices from Succubus to Vampire , etc.    I guess I should be writing this review from the perspective of advertising to someone who has never played a game like this before.  In that case you build a dungeon to defeat the do gooders that come to destroy your dungeon.  You do this by carving out rooms in the underground and then putting things in them like vaults to store gold, Barracks to attract    low level monsters, Prisons to put enemies in, torture chambers for Succubi to convert them to your side or turn them into Ghosts, Beast chambers to attract beasts, etc.  Then you build an army out of these creatures to attack your enemies.  You can also use traps and doors to slow down the enemy or kill them.  All in all this is a very good game.			"

Posted: January 23, 2016
												I was really looking forward to this game, as a fan of the Dungeon Keeper 2, and held off buying it earlier on because of the bad reviews regarding how buggy it is. In it's current form, it seems quite playable besides the odd bug (I found on the last map, minions couldn't find food or their bed if my dungeon became too large, even despite my attempts to keep the layout simple.)In general, I have to say I'm disappointed. Being named ""War for the Overworld,"" I expected it to actually follow on from the DK2 storyline and actually be a war for the overworld. However, the campaign just seems like a stale revamp of the original. There's any number of directions it could have been taken in and I was expecting new and exciting content, a new world, new storyline and new characters. The game just seems like DK2 with a new skin though, and little tweaks that just come across as a either a lack of imagination or, more likely, a lazy attempt to avoid copyright violations. If the developers were trying to honor their predecesor, that's one thing, but there just seems to be very little original content added on to what has been copied.I found the start of the campaign a bit tedious, given that the 'tutorial' is built into it, and I'm sure other old players remember enough of how to play to just want to get straight to the meat of it. Unfortunately there wasn't really any meat at all. The levels were very much in line with those from the previous game and the ending felt very anticlimactic and disappointing. There were no quirky cinematics and even the humour, which the previous game was iconic for, falls short of the mark. I'm not as much of a fan of PvP as I was in Dk2, and I'm sure if you are, you'll get more out of this game than I did. For those who prefer single player though, don't get your hopes up. The game just doesn't have any replay value as far as I'm concerned. When I finished DK2, I felt like playing the campaign again straight after. With WftO I finished the campaign and just felt like kicking the game into the corner and never looking at it again.There was also a lot of talk about adding new content to the game, but I haven't seen much at all. There are some new maps to play on but most seem to be coming from the the playerbase and are of course completely disconnected from the storyline. The updates are mainly bug fixes with the odd new (and boring) spell thrown in, and of course character skins (which you have to pay extra for.) The updates are also very slow for what they are. The one good thing I can say about this game is that the graphics are pretty decent. But given the time between now and when DK2 was released, you'd expect better graphics anyway. However, if you were to offer me this game as it is, or DK2 with updated graphics, I'd rather pay for the latter. No competition. There's just far too much lacking from this game for it to be labelled a ""spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper"" (according to Wikipedia.) I can appreciate if the developers have a lack of experience in game development or lacked imagination in making this game as a tribute. But what really irritates me is that they seem to be more focused on peddling merchandise than giving players a decent gaming experience. They took a scrapped gaming idea from another company, failed to fulfill its potential, instead opted to copy its predecessor and even failed to do that, and then took months to release patches to make the game playable because they were probably too busy focusing on their merchandise. It's pure money making by playing off the success of a far better game, that they had absolutely nothing to do with.TLDR; This is Dungeon Keeper 2 with better graphics but lacking in [dungeon] heart. If you haven't played DK2, buy it instead. If you have, buy something else that supports developers with more imagination (usually at a lower price too). And if you bought or are planning to buy one of the character statuettes on the WftO store, you need to take a long hard look in the mirror and ask yourself ""What the hell is wrong with me?""			"

												I was really looking forward to this game, as a fan of the Dungeon Keeper 2, and held off buying it earlier on because of the bad reviews regarding how buggy it is. In it's current form, it seems quite playable besides the odd bug (I found on the last map, minions couldn't find food or their bed if my dungeon became too large, even despite my attempts to keep the layout simple.)In general, I have to say I'm disappointed. Being named ""War for the Overworld,"" I expected it to actually follow on from the DK2 storyline and actually be a war for the overworld. However, the campaign just seems like a stale revamp of the original. There's any number of directions it could have been taken in and I was expecting new and exciting content, a new world, new storyline and new characters. The game just seems like DK2 with a new skin though, and little tweaks that just come across as a either a lack of imagination or, more likely, a lazy attempt to avoid copyright violations. If the developers were trying to honor their predecesor, that's one thing, but there just seems to be very little original content added on to what has been copied.I found the start of the campaign a bit tedious, given that the 'tutorial' is built into it, and I'm sure other old players remember enough of how to play to just want to get straight to the meat of it. Unfortunately there wasn't really any meat at all. The levels were very much in line with those from the previous game and the ending felt very anticlimactic and disappointing. There were no quirky cinematics and even the humour, which the previous game was iconic for, falls short of the mark. I'm not as much of a fan of PvP as I was in Dk2, and I'm sure if you are, you'll get more out of this game than I did. For those who prefer single player though, don't get your hopes up. The game just doesn't have any replay value as far as I'm concerned. When I finished DK2, I felt like playing the campaign again straight after. With WftO I finished the campaign and just felt like kicking the game into the corner and never looking at it again.There was also a lot of talk about adding new content to the game, but I haven't seen much at all. There are some new maps to play on but most seem to be coming from the the playerbase and are of course completely disconnected from the storyline. The updates are mainly bug fixes with the odd new (and boring) spell thrown in, and of course character skins (which you have to pay extra for.) The updates are also very slow for what they are. The one good thing I can say about this game is that the graphics are pretty decent. But given the time between now and when DK2 was released, you'd expect better graphics anyway. However, if you were to offer me this game as it is, or DK2 with updated graphics, I'd rather pay for the latter. No competition. There's just far too much lacking from this game for it to be labelled a ""spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper"" (according to Wikipedia.) I can appreciate if the developers have a lack of experience in game development or lacked imagination in making this game as a tribute. But what really irritates me is that they seem to be more focused on peddling merchandise than giving players a decent gaming experience. They took a scrapped gaming idea from another company, failed to fulfill its potential, instead opted to copy its predecessor and even failed to do that, and then took months to release patches to make the game playable because they were probably too busy focusing on their merchandise. It's pure money making by playing off the success of a far better game, that they had absolutely nothing to do with.TLDR; This is Dungeon Keeper 2 with better graphics but lacking in [dungeon] heart. If you haven't played DK2, buy it instead. If you have, buy something else that supports developers with more imagination (usually at a lower price too). And if you bought or are planning to buy one of the character statuettes on the WftO store, you need to take a long hard look in the mirror and ask yourself ""What the hell is wrong with me?""			"

												As a huge fan of the original Dungeon Keeper series, I was estatic when I learned about War for the Overworld. The developers made some hefty claims, but they delivered. From hiring the original voice narrator, to the look and feel of the game, this game is spot on. The minions have a lot of character, although some are sorely missed (I'm looking at you Mistress and Horny), the updated gameplay and smooth controls more than makes up for it. For anyone considering this game, if you have a sense of humor, and enjoy any combination of stragegy, god-sim, or slapping imps, this game is definitely for you.A+			"

												Have been playing this for a few hours now and have not encountered any show stopping bugs. Some unfinished touches still lacking but in the end it is a really good end result from such a small dev team. If you liked that good old Dungeon Keeper you'll most likely like this as well. It is good the be the Underlord. Two thumbs up.			"

												Overall Rating = 8.5/10  This game will remind you of Dungeon Keeper almost immediately, and does a good job of keeping things fun and interesting, but it does need more content and polishing.  However, it is still worth the purchase right now, and I'm convinced the development team is dedicated to improving the gameplay and world, especially after reading their state of the game updates.  Give these guys a chance, they really ""get it"" and aim to please all dungeon keepers out there.  I mean... underlords! :)What really needs improvement?-Large scale battles on large maps like the Campaign map ""The Kenos"" are still choppy.  The game seems to be very RAM intensive on larger maps, so efforts to correct this are very highly recommended.  I have a very high end machine with 32GB of 1600 DDR3 RAM, i7 Quad Core 3.6GHz, and 2x GeForce 780ti's in SLI, and it was choppy for me.  Most likely this has to do with how the game handles memory/processor usage.-Possession combat is wonky currently.  It's hard to really control the attacks, and you can barely tell if you used one of the creatures abilities or not.  The animations are not prominent when you attack during possession.-Need more reason to possess a creature, as currently it doesn't seem to make any difference in combat whether you possess a creature or not?-Not sure if heros or evil heros are implemented or not, but that would be a no-brainer for possession mechanics, assuming it will be in the game at all.-When building structures like pig slaughter, lair, barracks, etc.. it would be nice if there were visual queues that helped the player visually understand how much bigger their barracks needs to be to increase the army size.  If i build a 3x3, and I have a 10x10 slaughter/lair, maybe when the user mouses over the barracks, it shows them what they are missing by just having a 3x3 barracks?  You get the idea, even if maybe I used the wrong structures in my example!What would be nice to have?-I think the game needs a more elaborate sound track/sound effects, as while there is music, it's not dark and dungeony enough for my taste.  I like the current feel of the game, goofy and dark, just continue that theme with more dramatic music during attacks from dwarves, or the discovery of artifacts.  While it's cool to hear the guy say ""You have discovered an artifact"" maybe a prominent noise specific to artifact discover would be nice, because you tend to tune that voice out after awhile.-I'm not sure if there is a hotkey system, but if there is, make it more obvious via the tutorial.  I'd rather bind things to my own hotkeys menu, especially the rally flags for minions and beasts, and reveal fog of war ability, lightning ability, etc.-Add more randomness to digging blocks of earth.  Maybe occassionally I discover a trapped worker from a previous underlord, or a passageway to another area filled with secrets (that appeared as ROCK via reveal fog of war), or stout dwarven enemies, or neutral merchants that sell potions, whatever.  Fog of war should not be able to tell you everything you need to know before digging - add that element of surprise, as it makes the overall game mechanics of digging itself far more interesting.-Tooltips could use improvement, as when I first started placing blade lotus and defenses, it was not immediately clear to me via the game's user interface, or mouse over tips, that I needed a Foundry to provide the defensive parts to my structures.  It would be nice to recommend building a Foundry, similar to the suggestion above about adding more visual queues to gameplay/building for ease.The Final Verdict?Overall Rating = 8.5/10-This game will be great eventually, and right now it is still very good.  If you want to wait for a more polished game in a few months, you can because the development team is determined, but this game is already very playable in most cases, and is a lot of fun as is.			"

												simple-if you loved dungeon keeper you will love this.  It is basically dungeon keeper 3.  It even has the same voice over that is an awsome touch.  There are new creatures which aren't introduced as gradually as in the original dungeon keeper games so although there is alot of different creatures, spells and abilitys I tend to stick with what I know from old school.I have had this from early, early days and it has evolved massivly since then.  It still has some work to go in some areas and to improve performance and load time furthers.  I will say the Devs seem pretty pro-active so far.8.5/10			"

Playing through the campaign is like going back to the 90s and experiencing Dungeon Keeper in all its glory.If you are looking for Dungeon Keeper 3 this is the closest thing you will find on the market period, they have the exact same guy from DK 1 and 2 doing the voices. This company will work hard to squash bugs and to expand this game you can guarantee it.			"

												For anyone who remembers at the end of Dungeons Keeper 2 watching the Reaper going out in the overworld at the end of the campaign and still sheds a tear thinking about it and those glorious days.... Look no forward! After few not really worth ideal successors here is a game that takes exactly where the gone Bullfrog left and improves it adding many more features and diversifying your arsenal. I'm just at the beginning of the game but I had to stop because tears of nostalgia were blinding me. I've finished the first few missions that introduce you to the game: you are a dungeon lord that explores a subterranean world and attracts minions and terrible creatures to work in his dungeon to search for new powerful spells or build traps and doors to protect your dungeon from rival keepers or from those awfully pretend-to-be-heroes that wants to stop you from recovering your realm. Didn't try multiplayer yet and many other features that are available other than the single campaign, but I love more the solo options, so my review even when updated in future, will reflect this.At the moment I can say I am really impressed by this game I followed through updates from the beginning of the early access and I was really waiting to install it (bought long time ago and never played as my library is quite full...).To all Dungeon Keepers fan: do not hesitate! Just remember to keep your social life alive.To all other younger players: it's a funny and easy to handle game, it's worth more than a try.			"

												For anyone that is a fan of the Dungeon Keeper series, this is a wonderful spiritual successor. Been playing for a long time, and they've come such a long way since early access. It plays, feels, and sounds just what I would expect a DK game to be like now. Lots of new rooms, abilities, spells, creatures - everything. There's still some slight bugginess (as of 12/16/2015) - mainly just some minor issues with the GUI (IE: if you slap a minion too fast, it will only show the animation for the first slap)Campaign is a lot of fun. It's well designed. I'm about halfway through it.I'd highly recommend this game if you're looking for a Dungeon Keeper fix.			"

												I really dig the whole tower defense genre. Compared to TD games, WFTO is a bit more chaotic with so many things happening in so many places - but it's a lot of fun, and unlike some TD games a single error won't ruin your whole gaming experience. There's a seemingly endless amount of possibilities how to play the game - i for one almost never used the alchemist, but focused on building prisons and torturing people to join my worthy cause.The missions (WFTO and the heart of gold expansion) are a lot of fun to play, there's also a sandbox/skirmish/multiplayer mode - however I did not find them that interesting.Overall, this is a great game and I'm looking forward to the next expansion!

Every problem this game has is fixable, and beneath the bugs is a faithful spiritual successor.Pro: - Loads of features        - Great looking        - Good sound assets        - Dark humor        - A developer that cares about the community and the gameCons: - Too many bugs at this stage          - Missing tooltips          - No Bile Demons or Horned Reaper ;) "

												This game is a great follow up to the dungeon keeper series! Lots of new features and creatures, many things to like about it... However, this is most certainly a not quite ripe yet situation. I think as long as the devs keep regularly fixing and improving the game (ala Keen Software House) this game will be amazing. Short of that it will be another tragic effort to reproduce the game we all remember and love. I picked it up to support them in there effort and even in it's current status it's good fun. This has a lot of potential and i am looking forward to it being more polished. Buy now to support them, buy later if you want a fully finished game.			"

As most would attest, it is the closest game to Dungeon Keeper there is right now and fans of that game should definitely consider this one.  My only complaint right now is the game always displaying on the same screen with dual monitors.  It would be nice if there were a feature in the in-game options to select the desired display for the game.  I simply project to the primary screen in order to get around this.However, game-wise, this one is definitely a winner in my book!			"

												I recommend this game since it got it's new update, since when i bought this it was on it's early access stage which had very many weird things like the hand not looking proper or the minions were super laggy and stuff. But now that the update came, the game is very fun to play. As far as i gotten in the campaing i enjoyed it. Bit hard some maps but with some trial and error (if needed) they are passable. I just hope they add somekind of *My pet dungeon* like in Dungeon keeper 2 since those were fun to do after finishing campaing or just if wanted to do.  Conclusion: Very fun game with some challange it. 10/10			"

												This game has come a long way in the years since I played the original early access alpha. I replayed the game a few times as it was updated to get a feel for how it was progressing, and I must say I am quite impressed with the state the game is in now compared with just 6 months ago. The game is well balanced and the progression is smooth from start to finish on the campaign (and in a skirmish). It's not just feature complete but feature rich.... way more content than ANY Dungeon Keeper game ever made. And from what I understand they have plans to add even more content soon with no signs of stopping! It's almost kind of ridiculous how much work has been put into this game. The personality of the original Dungeon Keeper games is intact and further refined. This game makes me laugh out loud regularly! If you were a fan of the original Dungeon Keeper games, this game could become an obsession for you. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECCOMEND!			"

												Needs alot more polish, but as far as features goes, this game has it in spades! I'm confident this game will shine when the devs have put some more effort into it. It was released to early, but this game feels like a passion project, and that is why I believe it will eventually get to a state where it is a must have for any Dungeon Keeper fan. Every problem this game has is fixable, and beneath the bugs is a faithful spiritual successor.Pro: - Loads of features        - Great looking        - Good sound assets        - Dark humor        - A developer that cares about the community and the gameCons: - Too many bugs at this stage          - Missing tooltips          - No Bile Demons or Horned Reaper ;) "

												This game is a great follow up to the dungeon keeper series! Lots of new features and creatures, many things to like about it... However, this is most certainly a not quite ripe yet situation. I think as long as the devs keep regularly fixing and improving the game (ala Keen Software House) this game will be amazing. Short of that it will be another tragic effort to reproduce the game we all remember and love. I picked it up to support them in there effort and even in it's current status it's good fun. This has a lot of potential and i am looking forward to it being more polished. Buy now to support them, buy later if you want a fully finished game.			"

												I have yet to really get into the meat of the game given the limited time I have played it, but I would definitely agree it is a great game with a lot of potential.  As most would attest, it is the closest game to Dungeon Keeper there is right now and fans of that game should definitely consider this one.  My only complaint right now is the game always displaying on the same screen with dual monitors.  It would be nice if there were a feature in the in-game options to select the desired display for the game.  I simply project to the primary screen in order to get around this.However, game-wise, this one is definitely a winner in my book!			"

												I really like this game.  It's more complicated than Dungeon II which I also really like.  I do feel that the tutorial in Dungeon II campaign is better though because it explains each little item as you go.  War for the Overworld does not do this.  For instance on Level 7 you really need to build the bombard traps and lots of them but the game does not teach you that you need foundries to get toolboxes to build defenses.  I had a lot of defenses but none of them were building so I had to watch a video online and not only did it show me that you need foundries but that you can pick up toolboxes and put them directly on the defenses to speed up their building.  The game also did not teach me how to use the screen that lists all your monsters and click on it to pick up guys.  I learned that from watching a youtube video.  On level 7 I found the lack of gold to be my biggest obstacle but using blood money and a big prison and turning all their guys into gold statues did the trick.  Infinite gold basically.  Actually it might be level 9 where you have the gold problems looking at my notes.     One problem I have with the game is that moving around on the screen does not work well with the mouse.  In Dungeons II the mouse moves around on the screen really well but in War for the Overworld you really need to use the arrow keys instead.  It works really well with the arrow keys.  Another problem is the game is a bit dark and so it's harder to see the screen.  I understand underground is supposed to be dark but I would really appreciate a little more light for visibility.  Overall the game does a really good job in that you have many minion choices from Succubus to Vampire , etc.    I guess I should be writing this review from the perspective of advertising to someone who has never played a game like this before.  In that case you build a dungeon to defeat the do gooders that come to destroy your dungeon.  You do this by carving out rooms in the underground and then putting things in them like vaults to store gold, Barracks to attract    low level monsters, Prisons to put enemies in, torture chambers for Succubi to convert them to your side or turn them into Ghosts, Beast chambers to attract beasts, etc.  Then you build an army out of these creatures to attack your enemies.  You can also use traps and doors to slow down the enemy or kill them.  All in all this is a very good game.			"

												I really want to like this game but it just misses the mark quite badly.At first glance it feels and looks (albeit much nicer gfx) then Dungeon Keeper 2, the narrator is a nice touch along with the murky audio.However after a few hours of gameplay it all feels a bit thin, the narrator becomes far too much notifying you of every single little detail and incredibly grating. None of the minions have much personality and all seem to act the same other then scout units who, well, scout and attack from a distance. Unfortunately I have to compare to Dungeon keeper as it was claimed to be the successor to it and I will :In Dungeon Keeper 1 & 2 every minion that entered your dengeon you would carefully select or send back according to what you needed. You would pay attention to them and track their leveling up process and aim to keep them happy. In WFTO it doesnt seem to matter what enters your dungeon as you can just seem to bum rush the enemy from one end of the map to the other as soon as you have a big enough army (which really doesnt take too long), as the unlockable 'sins' or room/spell unlocks chart pretty much throws all rooms at you within 20 minutes of a skirmish game.In DK you would have to make a decision at the beginning of a game, Turtle, tech, aggressive or a mix of the 3 again, depending on the situation, sometimes rushing off to the enemy to fortify choke points and then take some time to unlock tech and build defenses, again in WFTO it really doesnt feel like it matters as long as you get enough minions in your dungeon.Lastly is the actual 'feel' of the game, and theres no real way to properly explain what I mean but WFTO just doesnt feel as kinetic and 'meaty' as DK 1 & 2 did, the units feel hollow and jittery, clipping into eachother while their audio (while very good quality) just seems to either be far to loud or too quiet and cuts off randomly.Even if I were to not compare it to DK I still would feel a tad unsatisfied as nothing seems to have been properly finished or polished off and  misses out crucial finishing touches that makes the game stand out, and instead appears flat across the board.I DO WANT TO LIKE THIS GAME, and I keep coming back to it but it is always unsatisfying to finish a session.I will not talk about stability issues (even though they plague the game and my rig is far better then required..) as that helps no one and I'm sure will ... eventually ... be ironed out.at £10 it could be worth a look but for full price, I am afraid not.(note I backed this game from the very start..)

												It's ok. You know... in the way a nice piece of fresh bread is ok, or a sort of decent hot chocolate. It's not great, like a BJ from Abbie in the bushes behind the oval in high school, or an 21 year old single malt whiskey. It's fun, just don't expect it to rock your world. I question whether it's the best value out there though - at this price point you can find games a lot more engaging, but it's alright.I'm not going to bother writing about the game specifics. I often do, but there are plenty of other reviews that are already doing thatn. Read them. I never said this was a GREAT review...			"

This has to be...No kidding...Grab a freaking snack and Lock the frickin' front door...BEST game out there! Everything that makes up 'War For The Overworld', the graphics, the music, the voices with their funny dialogs and the sound effects and noises. All of these aspects create a gloriously mythical, magical blend of delightfully fiendish evilness that I'm sure you will love! Immersive?! You bet this game is! You will forget all time and space. Remember to get comfortable, grab a snack and say 'Hi!' to the family, (or at least wavy at them) before going in-game...'Cause, you'll be in-game for a VERY LONG time! You will have love/hate relationships with every last one of these amazingly funny characters...To The Mentor, right down to the very last, lowly Minion! WFTO will soon become the crowning glory of your game collection!To everyone involved in the making of 'War For The Overworld', Many thanks for your talents! With all your combined talents, this has to be the most impressive work I've ever seen in a game!Now, back to the game. My Minions are wreaking havoc in my Dungeon as we speak!...Oh those wonderful little buggers!			"

												I like short reviews so... Pros: - Based on the Dungeon Keeper series - Great gameplay - Richard RidingsCons: - Performance issues (Different for everyone it seems but with an above average rig the performance is a bit iffy at times. With that in mind, I'm sure the developers will release a patch to fix these problems)Overall great game. Buy it. Cheers Subterranean games for adding to the lacking list of god games!  "

												This is the game all Dungeon Keeper Fans have been waiting for!I must admit from when i first bought the game back in 2014 till now it has come a really long way and although there are aspects that still dont work such as multiplayer the gameplay itself is fantastic. I highly reccommend this to anyone who loved the origional dungeon keeper series.Do support the development team, there are a few bugs at the moment but i know they are working extremely hard to patch them as quickly as possible. Keep up the great work guys.			"

												War of the overworld is a game that looks a lot like Dungeon Keeper 2 but fails to be  in some aspects.Game is very promissing but bugs in the campaign  and the lack of  multiplayer  and maps on the skirmish were promisses that were not fulfilled.The Game should not be released at the current state, a few more months fixing and adding content would be enough.Still you will enjoy it and have lots of hours of fun if you can overcome the bugs the game presents you and the fps drop.In the final state it will be a must buy at the moment its just a glimpse of what it can be.

												Impatient, non-readers can scroll to end for TL,DRI jumped on this bandwagon about two years ago. I was excited about what they were doing and hoped beyond hope for a game that truly was more Dungeon Keeper. I participated in their discussions and made suggestions. I watched their videos and read their reports. I was all about this game... For about 6 months.In the following months, I became very bored with this game, I admit. I actually felt that things were rolling out too slowly and was concerned that I had bought in to yet another ""early access"" game that would actually be ""forever alpha access"" instead. About a year ago I uninstalled the game and moved on, chalking this up to another learning experience.Yesterday, I noticed it's full release. I have no idea why I went to their page and ultimately installed the game to try playing it again (I really had given up on it) but I guess I was bored enough? I braced myself for disappointment.I think that having so many other early access disappointments really made me far too over-harsh on this group and what they were doing. I was giggling in the first mission and I was hooked in the second. This game is exactly what they said it would be. It's DK without major publisher taint all over it. It's DK's successor.Is it perfect? Nope. No game can be. Is it broken? Nope. Everything is playable and fun. Is there a learning curve? Yep. But if you played DK, you have completed the basic tutorial. Are there bugs? Yes. And the team is already all up in that. I don't approve of people giving this game poor reviews due to the multiplayer not being in full function (at time of writing) or because their system can't handle it (I have a decent system at best and have had very little lag when my dungeon was huge) because that's not what these reviews should be about in my mind. DK was mostly single player, and the single player game is awesome. My only real complaint (and it is easy to remedy) is the voice acting for minions can be a little repetitive. Having seen where they started and looking at where they're finishing, this game did not fail at it's task. If you miss your DK and the other dungeon manager games have fallen flat, then this is what you've been waiting for. You won't be disappointed. TL,DRYes. ...What? You skipped the rest of it so I figured you wanted a short answer. Go on. Have fun.			"

												A really hardcore experience, quite like DK as many have said before me.Can't wait for devs to fix bugs though the game is still very playable. I've only stumbled upon a bug in campaign mode, on the third map (it has got incredibly laggy and no, I'm not playing with my netbook ha-ha). The Skrimish mode was ok (I got my♥♥♥♥♥beaten pretty fast though) and the Online mode did ok too.Great game, recommend you it from the bottom of my heart.			"

												So Dungeon Keeper had a child named War for the Overworld... This child turned out to be better in every way.Many of the games mechanics that differ from Dungeon Keeper allows for different playstyle and strategies, this make multiplayer very interesting. As an exemple : I like doing dungeons with mostly cultists, chunders, necromancers and beasts, investing in little else while abusing the sanctuary and agressively pushing my foes to take as many prisoners as possible, ultimately raising an army of powerful vampires.As I write this, the game is very polished and alot of bugs were fixed over the last few updates.The devs are still working on adding contents and fixing the remaining bugs.This is the best dungeon building/dungeon keeper like game around !

												Developers should take note of how you properly use the ""early access"" system. This is what it was meant for. Not the garbage survival trending genres that developers keep milking.As for the game, it stays true to the previous DK games in every aspect which was the major point and they achieved it.  glhf			"

												It's a rather tough call to recommend (or not recommend) this game, because personally I feel it fits kind of in the middle and much of your enjoyment will come from nostalgia.So, WFTO is essentially Dungeon Keeper 3. After a rough early access and subsequent buggy release, over 1 year later the game still has many issues, but at least the devs have listened and made improvements.That being said:- The ""cursor"" while stylish is still very unprecise- The game still has some bugs in it (most notably health bars of my minions keep disappearing despite the option to do so not being enabled. This is a serious issue, because the game requires you to use healing powers, so it would be great to know which minions were badly damaged)- The framerate absolutely TANKS, which is unacceptable for such a mediocre looking game. It should not hog so many resources on a powerful systemNow on to the actual review:- Graphics: As said before, the game doesn't look particularly good. It's a better DK2 with improved lighting, better models, higher resolution, flashy effects, etc. But the basic models, etc. still look like 10 years old. Let's not even talk about the animation quality. It's just comedic.- Sound: Oh, where to begin. The voice acting is SUPERB, everything else should be thrown onto a garbage pile. Combat sounds blend together into 1 big mess, while constantly being interrupted by ""your minions are being slaughtered"" or ""xyz has died"" or ""your minions are rebelling"", etc. And not to forget the ever present new years rocket when one of your minions levels up. Or the sound effect of your necromancer killing an enemy. OMG. Just get rid of 80% of the sound overlap or make them less annoying. It's a serious problem.- UI: It's ""ok"". My biggest issue is with the warbands UI. This is extremely clunky. Unit control is a nightmare in this game. I mean, you don't even have direct control, but oh my...it's just messy.- Gameplay: If you liked DK 2 you will like this one as well I guess. The game consists of separate elements.1. Excavate a proper dungeon and mine gold2. Build rooms to attract minions and do other stuff (rooms with 4 walls are more efficient I think)3. Be sure your minions have everything they need (food, beer, place to sleep more or less is all they require).This is the strategic management part of the game, which is followed by:4. Click on a banner to send all your minions, previously created warbands or a certain type of minion (e.g. beasts) to a rally flag where they will try to defeat your enemy and not get horribly murdered in the process. Your minions are♥♥♥♥♥♥stupid. Combat is chaos. Eh.5. Cast ""heal"" as often as your mana allows you to6. After 2 minutes ""delete"" the rally flag so your minions won't rebel, because they are hungry or tired or whatever (if they are still alive).Seriously, low level minions die like flies. And the only other spell I found really worth using was lightning bolt, when I was fighting enemies on my own turf, because it is cheap, does damage and stuns the target. Spells also have no cooldown. Of course there are more spells, but micromanaging spells and picking out single units in the melee is kinda not worth it. Just heal your minions or zap the enemy.Apart from that you can also ""research"" new rooms, spells and traps. Traps are in my opinion one of the biggest wastes of time in this game. At least in the late game. They die almost instantly to level 10 creatures, even with a fort that heals them and makes them stronger. They are also expensive and ""lock"" some of your mana away. Rarely worth it. Focus on doors instead. Certain minions need to be working in certain rooms in order to create traps, doors, potions, rituals, or research, etc. You get the idea. If you want these minions safe when fighting or just to resume their day to day tasks, you can assign them to a ""peace band"", which is fidgety as hell.Story and campaign: Since the initial release the campaign was heavily adjusted. Levels that were apparently a nightmare 1 year ago are now a pushover. I had to restart 2 levels at one point, because they caught me off guard. Apart from that the levels are really easy for the most part. They just take a while to complete usually. A difficulty selector would have worked wonders here.All in all it's a fun little game, but it's definitely something you need to really love, so you can overlook all its flaws. The bad performance and the terrible battle controls make me wonder why anyone would want to play this game in Multiplayer. Also, we have 2016, why the hell is there no auto save feature? Get it for a discount perhaps. If you really want a new Dungeon Keeper. And of course you can still possess your minions, though it doesn't seem very worthwhile to do so most of the time.			"

												For those who loved Dungeon Keeper, this game is for you. There are a few bugs to be worked out... and I believe the game probably should have stayed in Beta for a few months longer to work them out. It's small things really, information about units/tiles which isn't fully there, no capability for more than 2+ opponents in multiplayer/skirmish and the odd random crash due to things I'm not even sure of. These however are being worked on by the Dev's from what I can read.But the game itself is still pretty good regardless of all that I've mentioned. A plethora of minions, the voice over/game tutor with attitude, the spells and good use of the Unity engine presents the game in a very graphically pleasing way. It's a very worthy spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper that's for sure... and if like myself you still have a bad taste in your mouth from EA's attempt to milk money from the name, this should help wash it away.I'd be lying though if I would call this a ""complete game"". As I said earlier, it probably could've done with staying in Beta a little while longer and I have a feeling you'll feel the same if you buy this game now. That being said I would still recommend it, it is very deserving of your money, but be prepared to ignore a few incomplete aspects of the game.			"

												I was suprised how remnisent this game is of both the Dungeon Keeper games.  These guys did a fantastic job of making a spirit successor to those great games.  Well worth picking up and playing, especially to the cult fans of the original Dungeon Keepers.It goes much more in-depth than both of them, with some over-the-top units (I just miss horned reaper and bile demon), and the same stupid humor, with the same overlord voice.You'll love it.  Even if you've never played Dungeon Keeper before, this game is a solid and fun RTS/God game.  Don't expect it to be SC2 material, but it's a lot of fun, even if you're just playing around with friends.			"

												I've been waiting along time before making the step to purchase this title.And without going into to many details, that would not be useful.The game is decent far from the old Dungeon Keeper spirit tho, and way to many issues in the game itself.Me playing less than 2 hours completed only 2 missions besides the starting ""area"", and this werent due to the game being to hard, due to POV getting stuck in weird angels after using the possession, 2times the game itself manage to die on me.And the fact that the gameplay isnt that very smooth, grafics isnt anything to scream for either.But the worst thing in my opinion, is that the feel and spirit of this game is no were near the game it comes from ""Dungeon Keeper""and that is the killer for me, the fact that its made to be the ""next"" start in this series, but fails.Btw, i refunded the game on steam, and it went smooth so atleast one thing good came out of this.

												Its a fun game .Unlike with so many other games of this genre I am not disappointed or dissatisfied at all.The core mechanics are what you would expect. farm gold build a dungeon fill it with evil minions who do your beck and call.Many different kinds of minions to summon and all the classic rooms to go with them. From the torture chamber and the jail to the arena and even a few new ones to make it fresh and exciting evil dungeon lord experience.It’s defiantly its own game with its own ideas and story to tell but if you’re a fan of the old dungeon keeper series this game won’t disappoint.

												So far, I am pretty disappointed (21 hours played).  The emphasis is too much on waves of invasion.  The humour has given way to this fight, fight, fight mentality.   There is at least one other game which claims to be the natural successor to DK2.  I have it and, yes, it is an infinately better, though shorter, and much, much cheaper attemp at reincarnation of one of the best games ever dropped by a developer after buying the franchise.And, no, my memory of DK2 does not let me down, I have it running in Dos Box. I would not have purchased this game if I had realised that I would be fighting at least 95% of the time.  Worse, the messaging system swamps the player but allows no time to actually read and respond.If you enjoy games with the emphasis on fire-fighting then this is probably a reasonable game.  If you enjoy planning and building and strategy, then, this will not be for you.			"

												When I first purchased this game I had little hopes of it ever becoming a complete game with a full campaign. Honestly I hadn't even had it installed beyond the point of the first couple weeks.  Recently I have been pleasantly surprised. Not only has the game been given a campaign with a decent story but it did an excellent job leaving us off for further story (which I hope is on its way) Hours of great game play, good story, versatility and control over your dungeons population, a wide varriety of creatures, spells, defenses and rooms. lastly, a mode in which you can personally challenge yourself after you have beaten the story of the current game. Cons      - Whan your dungeon population starts getting a bit higher the game starts running a touch clunky (my pc specs are pretty decent)     - Units will sometimes get stuck on the edges objects in a room. This does not occur often enough for it to cause any considerable grief.Fully recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed DK2 in years passed.			"

												Everything I had hoped for and more!First off: I'm a very old fan of the original Dungeon Keeper series from Bullfrog - so many games that have been called ""Dungeon Keeper clones"" or spiritual sequels have just not lived up to the hype, so when this game came out, I was skeptical.Despite this, I do admit to buying Early Access when the game consisted of nothing but square digging and imp slapping. I bought it, set it aside, and waited for the release message to check it out.This is one of the very few games coming out of Early Access that truly realized their potential. It has everything - the exploration, the dungeon building, a large variety of creatures with different looks and likes/dislikes, in depth magic and room progression trees, and - of course - the ability to slap your imps. 10/10 would back again.

												Spiritual successor to the hit classic Dungeon Keeper, very reminiscent of the gameplay any DK or DK2 fan remembers, and ontop of this, has 2 full campaigns, skirmish, pet dungeon, multiplayer, and challenge/puzzle dungeons. Compare this game to EA's recent Dungeon Keeper Mobile and cry at how EA dragged the DK name through the dirt with their cash cow facebook / farmville style game, and then come back to this and revel in how great it is.

												It has good humour, unique voice acting where narrator tries to interact with player and talk about player's actions. Random quotes. Story is not that good, because of that game still doesn't suffers since it offers amazing gameplay over the story. Each gamemodes offer different experience.You freely can build and manage your own dungeon as your dark heart desires. You can also play in first person by possessing a minion and looking at your dungeon up close. See what your minion sees.Level editor is easy to use, sadly you can't do anything advanced with it. Only simple Skirmish maps so far that i figured.Multiplayer experience is not the best. I'd say it's around average. Game is pretty stable if you're not playing Skirmish with 3 AI. AI is pretty good sadly it can make the game lag if there is more than 1 AI in the Skirmish match. Game's optimization is good (not counting AI)Now Coop experience is not really good as saying ""COOP"" it means you and your friend can fight against AI in Skirmish match or against the Empire (Enemies that wander around the map)Game only offers best Singleplayer experience and average to sometimes boring Multiplayer experience.So far i recommend this game for those who wants  good Singleplayer game. As for those who's looking for a good game to play with your friends then i wouldn't really recommend this unless you and your friend wants  simple Coop, Multiplayer experience by just managing, building your own Dungeon together and attacking the Empire once you get bored. Or picking a fight against AI.Game design is beautiful and improved quite a lot.Reviewed patch 1.5 and 1.6 "

												Current Build: v1.0.23It's Dungeon Keeper with it's own little twists, and it's even voiced by Richard Ridings the original DK mentor. Full campaign is out now. Multiplayer and Skirmish is still in development state at this time, and we have no current word on when they are more maps and 4 player support.Survival mode update coming out sometime later this year, which will feature daily challenges and leaderboards.Expect a little slowdown when fights get massive and when your dungeon gets too luxurious.However for an early build, I think the optimization is pretty spot on.Give them time to work out the kinks. This is the game Dungeon Keeper fans have been waiting for. You will not be disappointed if you played the originals.			"

												Fantastic follow-up to Dungeon Keeper 2 with the same style and charm with just enough new stuff thrown in there to make it worth your while. The game is buggier than it should be at launch, I'll admit, and some stuff just feels a little rough, animations, some of the options, but it's also a hell of a lot of fun for anyone who enjoyed Dungeon Keeper 2 and was looking for a game to follow in its footsteps. If you're hesistant, it may be best to wait for some patches, but the developers are very vocal on the fourms and the entire development process has been so transparent I would have no problems recommending this game even in its current state. It's certainly playable, and the plans for future content are exciting.			"

												One of those games I regret buying at full price...Its a clean, polished game that requires some thinking and strategy but why the hate you ask well I played Dwelvers (Incomplete game, Dev can no longer support) Its very much the same game but has so much more depth to it. War for the Overworld seems like such a simplified version of it but very polished up. War for the Overworld is more of a strategic layout then step 2, throw your entire army at the enemy with no control at all.... The battling part is what I hate most, its just a numbers game... the type of units you have really don't matter other than having melee and ranged units for the most effective DPS. There's just not enough depth to this game, sorry.			"

												A decent game overall, but the UI just gets in the way of my enjoyment. Everything is either awkward, unintuitive, or oversized. It's really jarring coming from playing games like Factorio or Rimworld, where the UI is less intrusive.The use of unbreakable rock in the campaign is suffocating compared to the original dungeon keeper. I have extremely little choice of where to put my rooms.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game unless you are a die-hard dungeon keeper fan.EDIT (after developer replied):Let me be clearer of what I meant.- The ""hand"" cursor is about 5 times bigger than I want. But no way to choose a smaller hand.- The shape of the hand makes clicking small things really painfully tedious. Example: I try to dismiss the (very small) event notifications on the right and the all the the fingertip has to be off the screen to get the right spot, but if I get it a little bit off, I scroll the screen to the right.- I can't make the bulky UI less bulky without also making the keybinding text in the controls screen too small to read.- The original dungeon keeper has really easy to understand though bubbles that appeared above creatures heads. Now, the though bubbles are really small and indistinguishable unless I zoom right in on the creature.- No way to configure the sensitivity for how quickly mouse wheel zooms in and out- Map large map to survey what's going on (like dungeon keeper). All I have is a pixelated thing in the bottom left, which gives me little help. I want a full screen, high res overview of what's going on.- The ""Warband"" mechanism is really opaque. I spent 15 minutes trying to figure out how it works. I still haven't found a use for it that is worth the tedium of setting it up. If I want to see what creatures are in a warband, I get these extremely hard to recognise (and small, because I reduced UI scale, because otherwise the UI is taking up 1/4 of my screen). This isn't starcraft or red alert groups. Nowhere near that simple.- What's the point of ""replacement earth"" when, after being fortified, the enemy can still dig through it? Might as well just make a door.- On the first level with the dwarves: I have to essentialy keep my minions on a constant state of being rallied because the enemy apparantly pull limitless soldiers out of their asses to throw at me. This leads to the announcer droning on and on and on about X creature is unhappy because of Y. This starts to get boring fast, as there's nothing I can really do about it.Summary: the developers have a lot of good ideas and have come closest than others in trying revisit the good things in Dungeon Keeper. But they have a long, long, way to go when it comes to quality-of-life features, UI design and making gameplay mechanics intuitive. I stand by my thumbs down.			"

												This game is cute, charming, and polished.Why the thumbs down, then, you ask?The answer is that the game, while cute, lacks strategic depth and is not worth the $30 price point. The rooms are unbalanced and there is a clear setup to spam in order to win every game. The maps and scenarios are not varied enough to feel like a new game each time. It leverages upon nostalgia for dungeon builders past and does not substantially innovate. There are some QoL issues: for example, feedback loops are tenuous and it is not always clear why a dungeon inhabitant is unhappy.I think that this game may become worth it at the $15-20 price point, since it was quirky and kept me entertained for a little while. If you're into this sort of game, I would recommend waiting for a sale.			"

												I like how Richard Ridings returned as the dungeon mentor and it returned with telling us we should be asleep when it is a specific time. Now I do recommend this game, for the moment, for those who mainly just want to experience Dungeon Keeper again.However, no game is complete w/ out bugs. Don't worry, you get plenty of them hiding around the corner. And no game is complete w/ out flaws as well. That being the minimap. It tends to be hard to figure out where the enemies are coming from if you have a hard time seeing their position on the minimap. When the dungeon mentor doesn't say anything it makes it harder. There are only 3 skirmish maps and both are small (only 2 players per map). And I don't know if anyone else ha a problem with it but I personally feel there are too many gold tiles and many of which are in large chunks and appear too often in unconvenient spots so it seems as though the game is trying to force you to stick with 3x3 rooms or have a dungeon thats just one big cluster ♥♥♥♥ of rooms that aren't separated. I like to build larger rooms to spawn more minions from that room rather than having to keep building the same room over and over.If you can look pass the flaws of the game, then I would recommend it. If you can't... well... come back later.			"

												Dungeon Keeper is a simple concept. Give us lots of creatures and room types, give us a huge dungeon to build out and customize until our evil hearts are content. Give us interesting enemies to strategically invade and battle. It is literally that simple. Every mission in this game drops you into a dungeon that is already carved out, or is full of water, or is full of lava, or blocks you at every turn with impassable walls, or sends stream after stream of enemies at you that can easily break through your fortified walls so you can't funnel them and get strategic with your defenses. You can't place water tiles (that i know of) and you can't even rebuild a dirt wall without paying gold if you accidentally carved a section out incorrectly and want to fix it. There was no mission where I really got to customize my dungeon and train my army of minons the way I wanted to. There is an absolutely dire mission where you simply guide necromancers around the same looking hero dungeon forever that is one of the dullest experiences I have ever had in a video game. As a massive Dungeon Keeper fan, I appreciate the attempt here, the rooms and creature designs are cool. Graphics are nice. I simply can't recommend this for $30-$45 dollars.			"

												I'm a long time player of Dungeon Kepper 1 & 2...and am old enough to remember the thrill of loading these games for the first time.Although I've been a supporter of this project since they first started, well before when they had a different team and a different goal, the amount of progress these absolutely hardcore lovers of DK have made is quite astonishing.  This game is stonking amazing...it literally is the third coming of Dungeon Keeper.I've been a backer, but I honestly only played occasionally, feeling that it would be best to play when the game was pretty much feature complete and also since I don't have much time to bugtest it made the best sense for me.  I am absolutely THRILLED at what they've done here...what they have managed to accomplish.I have played up until the 5th mission in campaign as well as some putzing around in the other modes for several hours (30+), and I can truly say that this has been the time of my life.  The heart and soul of DK is there.  Yes, sure, there's a few bugs and glitches, but this is a massive undertaking that they've done here and the end result is quite simply astonishing.  It looks brilliant, and the humor is there.I experienced zero crashes and very few bugs on my playthrough today.  I played about 4 hours straight and had an absolute blast.I've enjoyed checking out every room and looking at the tiniest details in each of their design.  Posession is quite fun and reveals the amount of work put into each of the models and objects.  It's exquisite.I have absolutely no doubt that given a month or so, a ton of the early bugs will be squashed. This developer team is hardcore committed to making this project a success and you can see it everywhere.If you're a fan of the original DK, or are looking for a game where it's good to be bad, please check this out.  It is quite simply a load of fun with an immense level of detail that puts other games to shame.  This is truly an incredible job they've done and they deserve a swift pat on the back for what they've accomplished.Buy it!			"

								Whats there more to say about a Fan-made game of Dungeon Keeper ? ITS ABOUT *Beep* TIME ! And they know what they are doing. The game might be in development, but you can be involved to make the game better. Just to www.Wfto.com, create an account there, play the game a bit, then throw in suggestment, but just make sure its NOT the same as Dungeon keeper, because EA still have the license to the game, but they have given Subterrean Games permission to make the game close to Dungeon keeper. This game is a lot of fun, and texture/graphics are truly amazing. So i HIGHLY recommend this game if you've played Dungeon Keeper and other games that are similiar to to it(Evil Genius for example)			"

But since your computer is better then mine you'll have more luck. So buy it and make thy slaves (Minions) work!			"

												Great game, after a long and rocky early access where a lot of us felt it may not work out, they have released a fantastic product. If you have played dungeon keeper then you know exactly what you are in for, as this is a new true succesor to that franchise. From what i have been set to understand this was made by the original team as a way to keep the franchise running, but EA holds the rights to the DK name, so they needed to change it. EA is not interested in using the DK IP for anything other then that insulting mobile app.If you want a true DK experience then get this.			"

												I'm probably going to go ahead and get Dungeons II, I went with this one cuz the guy doing the voice overs brings a nostalgia tear to my black heart,  and he's great, and the story's great, the game looks nice, is a tad underbaked and  alittle easy, reminds me of the original dungeon keepers strongly by pigeonholing me in campaign maps into rocky areas where I cant build dungeons the way I want to, etc, etc, and the game has a tendency to make whatever button I'm mousing over disappear entirely. and I've had it freeze on me during a new creature has entered your dungeon 'cutscene' where it takes my camera to follow a monster around in game and in real time or otherwise to introduce some thing thats newly available to me as I playu the singleplayer. Takes way too long for buddy to read the text for you to not be able to play while he does this and it causes the game to lock up a lot. sigh.  I'ts pretty decent,  but it sort of falls a little flat.			"

												This game is perfect sequel to Dungeon Keeper!   The game is 80% a direct clone of Dungeon Keepr with updated graphics and UI.   The 20% difference is excellent update to game mechanics to make the game modern.    If you remotely like god games (Populous, Dungeon Keeper, Power Monger, Godus, etc) then this game is a must purchase.If the game developer reads this, thank you for your efforts, the game is obvious a labor of love for Dungeon Keeper.   I play now with my 6 year old and he loves it! "

												The spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper 1 & 2. The Dungeon Keeper games were full of glitches and were very clunky. This game is a lot smoother to play, and looks a lot better. If you loved Dungeon Keeper 1 or 2, you'll love this. If you never played Dungeon Keeper 1 or 2, play this instead.There are some minor glitches in this game, but is overall very smooth. It's a unique RTS and the campaign is decent (some difficulty spikes bring it down).The RTS genre is pretty limited, and this is a gem.			"

												Before I post this, I backed the game on Kickstarter and bought it on two separate accounts. I wanted to love this game, I was very enthused about it, I initially gave it positive reviews and decided to wait and give it a chance to be patched.But now several months in the game lacks a Pet Dungeon mode and the Sandbox Mode is a poor substitute because it has no missions, no objectives, and no real sense of progression. It didn't even have a hero gate on the maps I checked. It seems like a step in the right direction but if nothing more is ever made of it, it's an inadequate half step.The Campaign initially struck me as promising until I noticed that it's full of pre-fab rooms and rushes you to finish and basically punishes the player for trying to  lovingly hand carve a dungeon.Aside from that it's not bad, but months after launch I had hoped it would be more of a spiritual successor than it actually is. Dungeons 2 is actually a closer spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper 2 than War for the Overworld is, and it has multiple factions to play as, so if it comes down to a choice between War for the Overworld and Dungeons 2 for DK2 fans I'd suggest buying Dungeons 2 instead.I'll change my recommendation later if they add a Pet Dungeon equivilent and revise the Campaign maps to be more about crafting a dungeon and less about capturing rooms and rushing, but for now, I give it a thumbs down on the grounds that this isn't as much like Dungeon Keeper 2 as it appears on the surface. Once you dig past the surface, it's a very different game, and a bit of a letdown.			"

												Where to begin.. I started playing Dungeon Keeper 2 around 2001 and after that every few years i installed it for the nostalgia trip and last year was the first time i completed Dungeon Keeper 2 but my thirst for evilness was not quenched so i started to look around for alternative games and i fell on this, first i was bombarded with negative reviews but after looking further i found out that the game did the foolish move to release it in a very buggy, featureless state and sadly some big YouTubers started hammering on it.But that was 1 or 2 years ago, today this game is a fully functional true successor to Dungeon Keeper 2 which can almost win the title ""Dungeon Keeper 3"" if it wasn't EA who holds the copyright to this game and decides to turn it into a freemium cash machine... Few highlights:♦ Exact same controls and features as Dungeon Keeper 2 (Exception with the Casino, RIP Disco Inferno)♦ Further expands on DK2's existing features with new elements such as Rituals, Beasts, more magic, more rooms and more evilness overal♦ DLC with parts of the DLC being offered for free!♦ THE ORIGINAL MENTOR VOICE FROM DUNGEON KEEPER 2 IS BACK, RICHARD RIDINGS♦ Did i mentioned the awesome voice of Richard Ridings?♦ The humor is still there although a bit less up-front, still funny though♦ Richard Ridings♦ Developers are active on Discord to answer all your questionsOh and a important note, if you are a LAN party enthusiast i suggest you look up the DRM Free version on their site, you pay a bit more but you get both the Steam version + DRM free version.So yeah! On a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being a game i would play just for the gimmicks that has it to a 10 that is just worth the money, is unique, has developers love to it and stands out as a truely unique game (besides being a successor) then i give this game a:8 out of 10 for being addictive, funny, loads of content, has many different techniques you can try, fully voiced campaign with story (which are now 2 if you count Heart of Gold) with a minus point for the UI that is too clunky and large with too much information and another one off for sometimes being overwhelming for either sudden wall breaches or having minions who just don't do their damn job like the cultists or beast masters.

												Right so, 13h into the game and this is included in a small follow up of the game since it was beta. Now the game is fully released and is still getting updates with content and all. +1 for the devs. Must be one of 5 games that I decided to preorder in last 5 years and only one I havent missed by preordering, and now to explain why:I am (was) and avid Dungeon Keeper 2 player. It was a game that I was returing to years after years even after I've tried a lot of games that tried (Dungeons which were, Overlord which was fun after all). Humor of DK2, animations all played into the game including the masterfully done voice acting of dungeon advisor. THESE GUYS MANAGED TO GET THE SAME GUY TO VOICE DUNGEON ADVISOR IN WftO!!!! When I bought (preordered) the game there was no advisor to begin with, you can imagine my inner schoolgirl screams when I heard his voice along with all the comments that gave the game that ""extra"" I wanted in it.Unfortunatelly my job (where I travel a lot) prevents me of playing what I want when I want, but this will be the game I will return to for singleplayer if not multi. Game has a lot features, it's easy to learn if you ever played DK or DK2, some mechanics are different but all the new mechanics (like Aspects of Evil) are a positive and nice tactical change in the game that affects MP games (think of C&C Generals by picking general, but you can unlock all in due time, but that takes, well, time). Characters look great, visuals are superb, traps, imps, slaps, this game has all!it gets solid 9.5/10. For 10/10 it misses casino and Disco Inferno when monster wins jackpot!			"

												For a Dungeon Keeper 2 inspired game, this game copies all the basics and systems. That in itself is a very functional and entertaining system of base building, mining and unit control. However, the port of these things is where the good of this game ends. For starters, the minions do look very uninspired, they lack the fiendish extravagence and undertone of comical wickedness and pure unadulterated evil. Secondly, there are entirely too many different creatures. Some even more useless than the other. There are so many different creatures that roam that the map quickly becomes a mess of creatures in combat or stuck behind doors because the AI is absolutely terrible and because except for the few specific purpose rooms, tons of units overlap in their uses, and if you fight a couple battles and have no interest in dwarven basic soldiers, you'll soon see 60 invisible ghosts flying around the map too.There many different features that could've just been condensed. Why are there two different types of lairs? There is literally no good reason why beasts and 'sentients' have the need for different rooms to sleep in. Why are there two rooms for eating? Why are there many different types of constructs, spells, potions and other magical things, a lot of which perform the same exact effect/purpose or at least overlap in their uses with other spells, potions, buffs or rooms. There is a tech tree forced down your throat because the designers of this game probably felt artificially adding progression is a thing gamers of this genre crave. All of the features that could have been condensed have individual points here, which you gain by putting cultists in a library(or letting them go there naturally, probably the only thing the AI manages to do decently, it can't even keep a group of minions fighting without a few of them standing around staring or just blatently walking past the enemies and attacking a building).I really tried to give this game a shot. I didn't even name all the issues this game has, I just lack motivation to write anything more on this waste of time and I haven't even gone past something like mission 6 and who knows how much more rehashed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is beyond that. Here's to hoping I can still get my money back.			"

												If you've played either Dungeon Keeper 1 or 2, you'd love this game. If you haven't played Dungeon Keeper before, you're missing out! Play this now! The same amazing gameplay, the same amazing narrator, and the same amazing sense of humour combined with modern graphics, and updated spells, rooms, and abilities. Plus a few easter eggs to reward loyal fans of the Dungeon Keeper series.			"

												This is the spiritual Sequel to Dungeon Keeper 2.There is no other way about it - it has a few names switched around and plenty of new features, but not too much more than one might expect from a proper sequel, back when each sequel meant a complete revamp of the game, like between Age of Empires 1 & 2 or Dungeon Keeper 1 & 2.

												The game has a very interesting premise, but it falls flat because of the interface.  The developers have obviously wasted quite a bit of time on fancy models and graphics but not enough on UI design.  The UI makes even simple tasks quite difficult to accomplish the worst offender being that they replace your mouse cursor with a fancy animated hand that you can never tell quite what is being pointed at without waiting for the cursor highlighting to catch up.  The scale on which things happen also tends to make things difficult.  The overall map is quite large relative to the individual unit and the player base is required to be somewhat large to support any decent number of units and the units themselves are quite tiny.  Zoom in to issue orders to units and you cant navigate the map as easily, zoom out to navigate and you cant issue orders as effectively; there is no zoom level where you can effectively do both.			"

												I played countless hours of Dungeon Keeper, so I bought War for the Overworld almost immediately. It has the look and feel of the original, but is essentially unplayable. Which is HUGELY disappointing. Although my profile says ""10 hours played"", I lasted about 10 minutes.I went straight into Sandbox mode. Firstly, there is some crazy mouse lag which I haven't figured out yet. Also, NO minions came through  - I had imps and nothing else, even though I made sure I had created all the available rooms 5x5. And only the basic rooms were available (slaughterhouse, treasure room, ""bedroom"").  The interface is difficult (probably the mouse lag).I'm pretty bummed - it's not worth $5 at this point.  :(			"

												Buggy and slow, other than that shows great promise.Unfortunately release version was total crap. If units go into berserk, you cannot kill them and they kill your core. You cannot even grab them, zap them, put units to attack them, they just keep attacking your core. Vampires especially, or whatever rose from some building go automatically berserk after while, not well guided how to control them, and they just kill your base. Also game is terribly laggy on some levels.Launch version: 1/10Current: 4/10When this is going to be finally ready for play after all fixes in somewhere future: 7-8/10Can't recommend this game even in current version. Go play order Dungeon Keepers and come back 1 year from now, then buy it.			"

												Major Dissapointment. When game first came out got it, found it totally unusable and bug filled and so uninstalled it figuring if i leave it awhile until they release some patches that would sort it.Just installed it again the other day and its still bug filled. Couldnt complete first campaign mission due to a spectre bug, fixed that by reverifying game cache, now on to second mission and thats also bugged. Cant build the library in veins of Evil  because the tech tree is all greyed out, tried reverifying cache couple of times still not working, so unable to complete misison 2 either. I expect 3 and up will be the same, not that i can find out.THESE ARE MAJOR BUGS THAT MAKE A GAME UNPLAYABLE. Try releasing a fkin game that actually works, all the fancy graphics is for nothing if you havent got the basics working. Considering im a huge fan of DK1 & 2 im quite annoyed at this point.SEE LEGAL CASE AGAINST SEGA OVER ALIEN COLONIAL MARINES, ITS ABOUT TIME YOU GAMES COMPANIES STOPPED TAKING THE FKIN♥♥♥♥♥♥OUT OF PLAYERS, AND DELIVER WHAT WE GIVE YOU OUR HARD EARNED CASH FOR IN GOOD FAITH.

												War For The Overworld is a real time strategy game, very similar to Dungeon Keeper, both from a gameplay and atmosphere point of view.You view your dungeon from a top down perspective, drag-select tiles to order your imps to dig space for you to construct rooms, which attracts various types of monsters through a portal. Give them food and a place to sleep, train them to improve combat skills, and then send them out to kill the heroes. Some minions can research spells or construct traps. You can hold captured enemies in a prison, torture them to convert them to your cause, or let them die so their corpses can turn into undead minions at a graveyard.There's a fun, dark sense of humour, especially thanks to the advisor, who is the same voice actor from Dungeon Keeper. As a fan of DK, it really does feel like everything I'd want to see from an unofficial sequel.I wish I could end the review there with a positive recommendation. Unfortunately, my enjoyment of WFTO has been spoiled by terrible technical performance. I've suffered from two significant problems.The first is a very frequent ""stutter"", where everything freezes for about a second. Its not game breaking, but it is very annoying, especially when you're moving the camera around the map.The second - and far more serious - problem, is a progressively worsening framerate, which seems to be related to how much of the map you can see, and how many creatures and traps are active in the map. At the start of a level, everything is covered by the fog of war, so my framerate is a nice smooth 60. But as I explore, the more of the map I uncover, and the more creatures are recruited by myself and the enemy, the framerate starts to die. It doesn't seem to be related to any graphics option - I've got the same problem with every setting at maximum and every setting at minimum. The engine just can't cope with so many moving objects in such a large space.There are 13 levels in the campaign, and as you would expect, the later maps are larger and everybody has a bigger army. During the first half of the campaign the framerate hit isn't so bad, dipping to around 40, which is still playable. But from around level 8, it got much worse, at times being almost like a powerpoint slideshow. I'm not exaggerating when I say my framerate was dipping into single figures.I have a significantly more powerful PC than the recommended specs listed on the store page (Win7 64 bit, Quad core i7 2600k @ 3.4Ghz, 8GB Ram, GTX 770 with 4GB Vram) so I should be able to run this kind of game without a problem. A quick search on the forum and other reviews indicates I'm not alone.Ultimately, in the current state, I have no choice but to give a negative review. Its a shame, because judging by the gameplay alone, WFTO is a good game. But this level of performance is unacceptable. Wait a few months, see if the developers can improve the performance with some patches. (Note: I started playing the day AFTER patch 1.1.15 was released, so 1.1.15, which supposedly improved performance, is still terrible).			"

												I've only managed to launch the game once! Every time i try the game crashes when it starts loading, then the game stops responding and i have to quit. When i did manage to play, the game was running smootly and looked very faithfull to DKII. I feel cheated buying this game! I've been waiting for it for a long time now and just bought it as the steam reviews said the game was finally working and the new patch made everything work. Obviously not!			"

												War For The Overworld is a real time strategy game, very similar to Dungeon Keeper, both from a gameplay and atmosphere point of view.You view your dungeon from a top down perspective, drag-select tiles to order your imps to dig space for you to construct rooms, which attracts various types of monsters through a portal. Give them food and a place to sleep, train them to improve combat skills, and then send them out to kill the heroes. Some minions can research spells or construct traps. You can hold captured enemies in a prison, torture them to convert them to your cause, or let them die so their corpses can turn into undead minions at a graveyard.There's a fun, dark sense of humour, especially thanks to the advisor, who is the same voice actor from Dungeon Keeper. As a fan of DK, it really does feel like everything I'd want to see from an unofficial sequel.I wish I could end the review there with a positive recommendation. Unfortunately, my enjoyment of WFTO has been spoiled by terrible technical performance. I've suffered from two significant problems.The first is a very frequent ""stutter"", where everything freezes for about a second. Its not game breaking, but it is very annoying, especially when you're moving the camera around the map.The second - and far more serious - problem, is a progressively worsening framerate, which seems to be related to how much of the map you can see, and how many creatures and traps are active in the map. At the start of a level, everything is covered by the fog of war, so my framerate is a nice smooth 60. But as I explore, the more of the map I uncover, and the more creatures are recruited by myself and the enemy, the framerate starts to die. It doesn't seem to be related to any graphics option - I've got the same problem with every setting at maximum and every setting at minimum. The engine just can't cope with so many moving objects in such a large space.There are 13 levels in the campaign, and as you would expect, the later maps are larger and everybody has a bigger army. During the first half of the campaign the framerate hit isn't so bad, dipping to around 40, which is still playable. But from around level 8, it got much worse, at times being almost like a powerpoint slideshow. I'm not exaggerating when I say my framerate was dipping into single figures.I have a significantly more powerful PC than the recommended specs listed on the store page (Win7 64 bit, Quad core i7 2600k @ 3.4Ghz, 8GB Ram, GTX 770 with 4GB Vram) so I should be able to run this kind of game without a problem. A quick search on the forum and other reviews indicates I'm not alone.Ultimately, in the current state, I have no choice but to give a negative review. Its a shame, because judging by the gameplay alone, WFTO is a good game. But this level of performance is unacceptable. Wait a few months, see if the developers can improve the performance with some patches. (Note: I started playing the day AFTER patch 1.1.15 was released, so 1.1.15, which supposedly improved performance, is still terrible).			"

												The game has a very interesting premise, but it falls flat because of the interface.  The developers have obviously wasted quite a bit of time on fancy models and graphics but not enough on UI design.  The UI makes even simple tasks quite difficult to accomplish the worst offender being that they replace your mouse cursor with a fancy animated hand that you can never tell quite what is being pointed at without waiting for the cursor highlighting to catch up.  The scale on which things happen also tends to make things difficult.  The overall map is quite large relative to the individual unit and the player base is required to be somewhat large to support any decent number of units and the units themselves are quite tiny.  Zoom in to issue orders to units and you cant navigate the map as easily, zoom out to navigate and you cant issue orders as effectively; there is no zoom level where you can effectively do both.			"

												Did you ever play Dungeon Keeper 1 or 2? Did you enjoy them? Then you should own this game. Would you still play those games if they weren't so old that compatibility issues prevent them from running? If that's you, you should be buying this game. Right now. Go, do it! Okay, finish reading this review, then go do it. Don't make me backhand you with the Hand of Evil.This isn't a typical RTS; it's a God Game. I don't know how best to describe it because I describe any game with this game's mechanics as ""like Dungeon Keeper"". This is basically Dungeon Keeper 3, but that doesn't mean it's basic. Did you ever see the promo for Dungeon Keeper 3 way back when? Uh huh, these devs really know Dungeon Keeper. In fact, I am amazed at how often they respond to reviews - both positive and negative - which certainly was a big factor in encouraging me to write a review.PLAY THE CAMPAIGN! It will teach you about your minions and rooms, spells, etc. in a very logical way. The game is different enough, just as Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2 were very different from each other. In my opinion, Dungeon Keeper 2 was vastly superior to the first one. Expect that kind of improvement again with this one.Pros:The in-game help is really impressive. Click on anything and have a spoken (and written) explanation.Create your own maps. Multi-player. Single player vs. an intelligent enemy AI.Still receiving updates. New content continues to come out. + Bug fixes and improvements.It's really funny. It's funny, dark humor without being lewd. The guide is the same voice talent as the previous games, witty, snarky, and oh so articulate and proper.The game can be slowed down and sped up.Some notes on performance:The game runs much better with 8GB of RAM instead of 4GB.I have played a level in the new My Pet Dungeon content twice. The second run began to stutter every few seconds. As feedback, on the second run, I used volcanic bridge a WHOLE lot more, covering whole areas.The game stutters a bit when it first loads into the main menu. Also, the game and mouse will freeze for a few moments when loading a level. Obviously, these don't affect the game, but they feel out of place. The hardware cursor never gets frozen.Cons:There are no cons. The game is great. However, there are some things that could be improved. Many things that would have been listed here were addressed in the recent 1.6 patch.Documentation! Some information is seemingly impossible to find. I've tried to find information on the Veins of Evil (the tech tree). I can see that they at one point were named and had different buffs a you went further in each. They also seem to affect total mana. However, I have seen nothing about this in-game. I see over the course of a level that my mana increases, but I'd like to know the pattern to see if I'm doing something inefficiently.The new 1.6 patch greatly improved possession. I didn't know that my cultists and beastmasters could heal other minions! That certainly changes the way that I will balance warbands.A minion will slow down when the cursor is on them, but it is still difficult to get information about them. It would be wonderful if there was a box that showed very detailed information about a minion if it were perhaps being held.The minimap could use some improvements. When the cursor is on a room, details are given about the entire room, so clearly the game understands that those tiles together form a single room, no matter the shape or size. It would be WONDEFUL if there were a transparent icon or something on the minimap to show me which of my rooms are where.The UI is actually pretty powerful. It would be nice to know how efficient healing a group is by it's icon, but the many things the UI allows you to do are pretty useful. There are a ton of keybinding for the UI, but they are all in relation to each other by position, which changes. That's fine. However, it would be SO helpful if the current keybind for that position was listed in the corner of the icon.Lastly, some of the room could use a little sprucing up. The spirit chamber in particular looks very bland, especially when compared to something like the sanctuary.But feedback aside, the game is wonderful. I highly recommend it. I would certainly continue to purchase DLC containing further campaigns.			"

												Oh, how I miss DK2. I've been searching for DK2 on steam forever in hopes of it being added. And I just randomly found this game (and on sale to boot). It would be nice if this game was tagged with references from the original series so other hopefuls can find this damn good replacement. I don't even care if there are minor bugs in this game, the nostalgia of it is worth it.			"

Early Access ReviewBelow is my review of the Early Access build.  Left it here as it seems to be the right thing to do.Brilliant game, highly recommened if you love Dungeon Keeper, but just as a caution its still in alpha/beta phase so only buy if your willing to cope with bugs and some missing features.  However the game at the moment does have a few sandbox maps to play on, which is always a good thing.The game is also being constantly updated, and from what I can see they could make this a final release if they wanted, and the developers also coinstantly update their fans every Wednesday.Final Release reviewBelow you'll find the review of the final version of the game.Pros+ Plays a lot like Dungeon keeper 2+ Runs fairly well on lower end hardware+ Brilliant voice acting+ Visuals are pretty good+ Not published by EA+ No Asset flippingCons- Still a few minor bugs and glitches here and there- Long loading times (This may be my system though)- A few frame rate issues here and there. OverallThis is the Dungeon Keeper we wanted.  Something that EA could never provide.  While the game does indeed have its issues and some frame rate problems, it is highly recommended and with the sales coming up soon you might even be able to pick this up really cheap.At its core its Dungeon Keeper, with a lot more.  After playing a few missions in the campaign I found the game is a lot faster paced than Dungeon Keeper 2, but it isn't bad in fact its quite exciting.			"

												I bought this game hoping that it would be as advertised, a spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper.  What I got, however, was a twitchy fascimile that prevents me from enjoying the game.  I think they did great by bringing in the VA who narrated DK 1 and 2.  Humor was there, sorta...  The gameplay devolves into a frantic rally and heal spam all through the game, and that's where it gets ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  The best part of a game like this is building up your dungeon while defending it, steathily scouting for the most opportune spot to strike.  No where is this less likely than level eleven, where four underlords attack you, (I know it's three, but ♥♥♥♥ the devs for trying to make two dungeonhearts a single opponent.)  It's all spam rally, spam heals, over and over.  I was on the last dungeonheart before I just turned the game off in disgust.  Apparently I also own the expansion, it was money wasted, in my opinion.  I'm going over to GoG and getting Dungeon Keeper from a dev who did it right.			"

												I bought this game in 2013 apparently and since the have not played it while patiently waiting for the developers to finish it.While they did add a lot of rooms, spells, traps, sounds and a voiceover since then... it still feels unpolished.Personally i've got several issues that persisted through every version of the game:1) Cursor is hard to use. Yes, you are reading it right - the cursor. They made it look like a finger from an original game, unfortunately as far as using it in the game it somehow became harder, probably due to increased resolution. Clicking on stuff is mostly ""hit and miss"" situation since the active part of the cursor is just the fingertip. Combine that with the fact that you have to click directly on the stuff, like treasure chests and tiny imps - you've got yourself an annoying issue.2) Tooltips. Many reviewers already mentioned that they do not make any sense whatsoever and its true - instead of clear information about rooms its just some strings with numbers and abbreviations.3) UI. There is no way to soften the blow - its horrible in every possible way. The buttons are too small. The cursor is too big and hard to use (read 1). The minimap (again, made to resemble an original DK minimap) is completely useless and would've been appropriate in the year 95 - Microsoft paint blocks instead of actual rooms and enemies just won't cut in 2015.4) I've expected that with time and better optimization the game would demand less PC resources but unfortunately the opposite has happened. So just a heads up - you really DO need 6-8gb and more, as well as good CPU.Unfortunately the game has not met my expectations yet (in the basic controls department at least) and i've waited quite a bit already. I might change my mind later on, if the developer updates the UI though. "

												Yes I bought this game way before its official Release and I have loved it since. Granted there are a few technical issues with the game itself but the Devs have been updating the game early and often to fix these problems! Really great game gets back to DK and puts an interesting spin on the game with the ""Sin"" system in order to unlock buildings and traps and other items. (do not confuse that with anything associated with PAY TO UNLOCK it doesnt do that) This game is a really good DK2 game and even has the original Voice Actor/Announcer! *insert nostalgia here*. This game does its job and as long as these updates keep pouring out like they are currently this game is toatlly worth the money! 9/10 and once all the bugs are fixed easily a 10/10 game.			"

												I really really really want to like this game.  When it works, it's fun and provides the DK style of gameplay.  The problem is the game just doesn't work.  Worker AI is consistently broken, they ignore the blockers and run where ever they want.  There's no real good way to direct their priorities.  In cases where you have to build defenses in order to survive this is critical.Oh and then there are the crashes.  Crash to desktop, the UI disappears, the game is unresponsive.  I've literally tried 5 times to play the same level, and had crashes every single one.  At this point I'm done, and I'll wait for them to fix the game.			"

												It's clear that these Devs love Dungeon Keeper, and really do have talent. This game does have the chance to truly claim the title as the spiritual successor to DK2. But as of the release, it's not there. There is still so much that is only placeholders, a bit of stability issues, difficulty is all over the place (AI in particular), and it really is one of the LEAST intuitive games I've ever played. Even mucking about in the sandbox and I've not even an idea how to find my minion cap. The free skirmish currently only has 3 maps, all 1v1 and horribly small even for that. This game was NOT ready for release. And it won't be for some time. When it is, I'll update my review to say so.			"

I save the game and it seems to happen successfully but when I go to load from a previous save it just isn't there. this makes the game completely unplayable for me. I am not going to start from the very beginning every time I want to play, having to redo the tutorial over and over again. Not happening. While it is a great game that shows a TON of promise it should have never been released in this state. It is beta material. It feels like they are completely misrepresenting the state of the game by selling it in it's current state as a finished product.***EDIT***After a little more fiddling it appears that when Steam is in online mode the game is still saving games locally so after it saves the game and you try to load it it is bypassing the local game saves and only looking at the saves on Steam Cloud. After taking Steam offline I found the saved game I made while Steam was in online mode. Seems like a bug? A pretty big %$@ bug to have AFTER release you think?So to those individuals having this issue you will just have to take Steam into offline mode to play for now until they fix the issue.			"

												Honestly, I'm not very satisfied with this game. I'm about four missions in, and it is essentially the same game Dungeon Keeper was with a graphical overhaul. Feels almost like it's running the exact same engine with higher resolution textures.It's been about 18 years since Dungeon Keeper came out, but War for the Overworld plays essentially the same as it's predecessor. Games have changed and improved quite a bit in that time, but WFTO is stuck in the past.The Good:Same quirky atmosphere you likely enjoyed with Dungeon Keeper. Simple, casual gameplay. Nice voice acting. A pleasant way to spend a few hours.The Bad:AI is generally clunky and bad on both sides. Your minions are not very bright, but neither is the enemy.Many maps are so full of caverns and holes that you can't really design a dungeon the way you want it to look. The map forces your hand in most cases. Combat is a complete mobfest, and usually involves dropping everthing and the kitchen sink onto your enemies heads, spamming heals and shooting some lightening. There is no strategy required.The Verdict:Did you like Dungeon Keeper? Do you want to play it again with unit reskins and higher resolution graphics? If so, then sure, grab this game. If you want a deep and strategic dungeon building game then you will have wait because this isn't it and nobody has made it yet.			"

												This is a game where I wish Steam would have a third recommendation option (other than just yes or no) because my main recommendation is to play Dungeon Keeper 2 instead. WfTO is more or less what the developers wanted it to be, an homage to Dungeon Keeper. This game matches the gameplay and the environment very well. If you are tired of playing DK2, but still want to experience more of that gameplay, than I would recommend this game to you. However, if you are looking for even a tiny amount of freshness in this genre, I cannot recommend this game.			"

Early Access Review
								Epic. Fallowing the style of the great Dungion Keeper series. Unlike Dungionkeeper though you dont just have all the rooms you require each level, Reserch techs you develoup in your own way each game adds so much to the stratigy of the game overall. Do you prioritize reserching your spells, rooms or traps at the start?			"

												I have to say that I wonder about the people not enjoying this game.  I just finished playing through the campaign and I only ran into one ""bug"" the whole time (would requiring spoiling to explain).  That record is _FAR_ better than what I experienced with DKII.  This game has all of the style of DKII that I was expecting and it has far more units, rooms, spells, and other creative features.  The game is not just a ""good"" spiritual successor, IMO it is better than the original.			"

												Diffculty for the levels are so easy its boring. Creatures just run to my core and die, or my creatures are 4-6 levels ahead of the empire/other underlords. There needs to be a difficulty mode implemented for players that like a challenge. Also the level designs are somewhat discouraging to futher me wanting to play more. Every single level just has water/lava/small corridors/impentrable rocks everywhere so I'm not allowed to make my dungeon how I'd prefer to make it. The empire traps are very weak, the crossbow you see on the 2nd/3rd level are very inaccurate. It lands a shot 10% of the time. I could go on but you get the just of how a veteran Dungeon Keeper 2 player forms his opinion of WftO as of its current state on patch 1.2. In comparison to this campaign levels/design to DK2, DK2 is better in most aspects, even the difficulty - DK2 had a very casual player difficulty campaign, but there were some maps atleast that even casual players had a time beating. Unlike yours truly. Another side note is the Vein of Evil - The spells you get are so imbalanced, can destroy entire armies just by spamming certain spells in a corridor because there are no cooldowns and do too much aoe damage.

												April 5th 2015I am a fiend for God games/base builders still have and play both DK, Evil Genius, Startopia, etc. I supported this game as soon as it released on steam.  I opened and ran in Alpha.  However now after the release I can't even get the game to run..... just sad.  I am encouraged by the patches hoping that one of them fixes whatever the problem is so I can play it.April 9th 2015I was encouraged when it started up for the first time for me yesterday and I got to play through the first 3 levels.  Graphics are ok.  Gameplay is good.  I like that you can pick up pieces of traps produced and set them on the sillouettes of traps that you have laid in order to help build them.  I like the idea of the sins as an experience tree in order to unlock new rooms and powers.  I was really pumped..... but then I came home from work today and tried to load the game and it did not load again.  I have tried 5 times and everytime it goes to not responding.  I have verified that my install is good through Steam so that isnt the problem.  I really want to give this game a chance and a place in my favorites if I could play it.  Just to prove that, I was about to give it a thumbs up thinking the problem was solved.  All the time I spent trying to load the game today had me go from 6 then increased to 7 hours of gameplay even though I didnt even really play.  Please keep patching!!!  I am very hopeful!April 18th 2015I was able to get the game to start up and I binged played through a bunch more scenarios. I really like the game when it is working. Got in about 10 hours more of gameplay. Afterwards thought I tried to start up the game 10 times in a row and it crashed everytime. If they keep patching I am hopeful for a great game.			"

												Alright, here we go. If you've played the original Bullfrog Dungeon Keeper and/or Dungeon Keeper 2, then let me just say, this is it, this is what we've been waiting for (and if you haven't played them then skip to the later part of the review). WFTO *IS* truely, more than anything else has ever been, the spiritual successor to the Dungeon Keeper franchise. Its made by DK fans, for DK fans. Don't hesitate (well maybe, see my next point first), just buy the game and play it. Now, before I continue, I must concede that yes, there have been a number of major bugs since release. HOWEVER, the game is most certainly release ready, enjoyable and playable. Many of these bugs have been related to the campaign, cutscenes etc, however the majority of these have already been fixed. The development team are fully committed and have been doing a great job. There will always be bugs on release, especially for a small indie team like this, you cant get around that. Even major publishers often have bugs on release, sometimes massive ones, and they have millions to spend. If you've played the game for two hours, encountered one bug, and called it a bad, incomplete game, you really don't deserve to be writing a review. In a few hours you've played 2, 3 levels? Get some perspective. Almost all of the bugs people have talked about in the negative reviews were fixed within 24 hours of release. So look within yourself, and if you're the kind of person who is extremely nitpicky about their games, and can't handle a few little bugs or a couple of placeholder texts, then fine, just wait a month, they'll be gone. For me, that's certainly not worth giving a bad review over. As someone who has been waiting for this game for almost 5 years, I'm completely satisified with it. Now, for people who haven't played the original Dungeon Keeper games, then you've never played anything like this. Really. The DK games, and now WFTO, are a genre in themselves, once which hasn't truely been seen for 14 years since DK2. Its a mash up of the RTS and God Game genres, with elements of RPG thrown in. Its like mixing a classic RTS like Age of Empires or Warcraft, with something like Sim City or Sim Theme Park, and then throwing in rudimentary elements of an RPG.So it's Sim Age of Diablo, you ask? That's hard to imagine, what do you actually do?Well, you start by building a dungeon, you mine out caverns and hallways around your dungeon core. Then you fill them with different rooms, attract hordes of monsters, minions and beasts into your employment, make them train and work, construct traps and defences, explore and expand your territory throughout the map and ultimately use your army of creatures to destroy the enemy, be it the forces of good, or a rival Underlords dungeon.  There's far more to it than that, but you'll have to play it to see. 10/10, fully recommend.			"

												""This game is awesome"" would be a sufficent thing to say...Since I laid my evil pawns on dungeon keeper during the starting age of gaming I have always missed a game like this! Some pitiful ""wannabes"" can be seen during the way from that time to now. None has even come close to awaken the child within me who always has been crying for the real feeling of a dungeon keeper game.These guys have been working hard and in my opinon they have done everything they set out as goals during the kickstarter campaign. So to get some real numbers for you guys who like it, here it comes !+ Good and worthy sucessor of the dungeon keeper genré+ Good atmosphere+ RTS game without to much micro on resources+ You can ""kinda"" pick your own pace in the game+ You can feel the evilness growing !+ NO KITTY CATS- Don't really feels polished at the tutorial levels- The lore behind the campaign falls a bit short- Opitimization is a bit behind for the release of the gameI WOULD TELL EVERYONE TO BUY THIS GAME IF YOU MISS A DUNGEON KEEPER GAME			"

												Kickstarted this game, been looking forward to it being finished for some time. I chose not to play any Beta as I prefer to play the finished product...something that this 'released' game is not. Couldn't get past the first mission in the campaign because apparently building your dungeon how you like and not how it tells you to completely breaks it. Didn't get the rally spell so couldn't go further. Possesion is currently broken according to the tooltip. Selling a room also breaks the game and prevents you from building another. A shambles. Forget the people moaning, don't release your game until it's finished. I'd wait at least a few months before playing this, though honestly I can't see it being in a finished state for at least another 6 months.Incidently, I completed both Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2 multiple times, I love this franchise. This game feels very much like them, the aestetic and narration is spot on. It's just not finished yet. When it is, I'm sure it will be fantastic.			"

												As of 1.0.144/6/2014Going to wait for game to be polished a bit better. The game itself is good, but bugs, lack of proper tooltips, and omg memory leaks. I have 16g of ram and on lvl 4 of campain it ate 8g then crashed. Building: Tutorial says 3x3 minimum for builds, but doesn't say if 3x4 is better or a waste of space. 6x6 adds another device so one would have to conclude 3x3 or 3x6 or it's wasted space. Rooms don't need walls so rip it all down except your chokepoint to enemy.Minion AI: lol, have a full 6x9 slaughter pen and a empty 3x3 pen and minions are afraid of starving to death. Workers don't multitask, they all tear down walls or they all convert blocks or they all mine gold (even if gold is capped..lol) or they all sit idle.Scout beasts engage enemy instead of scouting.Tool tips: Some are still displaying script descriptions. Most that are working have data stretched horizontaly so it goes 1/4 to 1/2 way across screen. Most info is irrelevant and needed info is no where to be found.Hand and Camera: [del] key for camera tilt movement...really? that key should be to get rid of unwanted worker that was summoned over cap thats costing mana. Screen edge movement is good, but hard to hit minimize button in left hand corner.As with all rts type games, camera does not scroll out far enough. (Curse you Warcraft 3 for starting that crap.)Enemy AI: lol, healers heal themselves or attack instead of healing the tank. Assasins chase a goblin accross map instead of staying with battle group. Dwarves think they are tanks. Tanks spin around and around till they are dead not knowing who to hit.Traps: What traps? Death blosson is just a wall. Cannons are defense not a trap. It needs traps that do damage once to an unsuspecting mob.Models: Other than the fact that they are all carbin copies (no unique faces, racial pigment or even hair color) The humanoids look good for the most part, but monsters look like a 2000 game (see Sacrifice by interplay). Succubus have wings BTW, do it right or call them S&M chicks. None of the models have a WOW that is cool feel except Shades.Textures: Heh, didn't I already tear down this group of walls? Oh this one is fortified, see the grey smudge on top....really? Water looks like brown poluted water from a city sim game. Madel textures are minimal and not very detailed.Concusion: Dungeon game? No it is a tower defense game that also lets you attack their tower after you get a zerg army together. So far this isn't even a diamond in the ruff, it is a turd with sugar sprinkled on it. Why everyone is so fixated with a 1997 game? Dungeon Keeper was good but expand on it. If you could combine Dungeons(Kalypso) with this game it would be good start. They both had a good thing, but to many want to play DK and DK2. Have it so you keep what you build and expand out into the world taking territory. Whats the point in building a dungeon to not have invaders?At this time I can not recomend this game. Will try again in a month...maybe. "

												I'm very sad, about the fact that I'm having to provide a negative review on this product. As a hardcore fan of the Dungeon Keeper series, I wanted this game to succeed very, very badly. The sad thing is that, it does! It's just technically unplayable. There are no bugs, or not to my experience at least. No glitches, weird errors, crashes, or anything of the sort. And the gameplay is very, very funny, and exciting!(NOTE: Many players have reported a great number of bugs! I just personally haven't run into any, and made it to lvl 3 of the campaign without encountering any glitches and or bugs.)However, as I approached the end of the third campaign level, in which you VS another underlord, with spells like you posess also, the game went total ape♥♥♥♥♥♥ I haven't been able to fix it, and no solutions are to be found anywhere on the www at all. The level went well, until I came into actual contact with my opposer. The AI controlled underlord, started casting all sorts of spells on my creatures as they pushed the edges of his base back, slowly but surely. The FPS dropped immediatly as the casting began, to 2 - 7 FPS. Now before you all start questioning my specs, and wether or not my pc should be able to handle this title. I run some top of the notch hardware. Two GTX Titans overlocked in SLI , 64-bit, 32GB RAM, Intel Core I7-4930K CPU 3.40GHZ. They have yet to invent a game that my system can't handle, so no excuses developers! I am literally halted in my tracks.  And I can't play the game I payed for any further, until this matter is resolved. Therefor, I advice all potential buyers to WAIT, and not purchase this title, until a fix has been provided officially. Once there is a fix, I'll consider providing a positive piece of feedback.The devs have made several posts on the community hub, in which they state they've 'improved the FPS issues' however, I've had no confirmation of this what so ever, nor any positive feedback regarding this subject from any other buyers.Good game, terribly optimized! Fix this, so we can play this gem in the rough!			"

												Being a backer, I played through the single player during ""release"".  The state of the game at that time was a complete mess.  I came back to WFTO recently since I just got a new PC that is way beefier than the old PC.  Back then, frame rates were horrible. Nice to see they are better but still garbage. I have been trying to play through the single player again.  I really wish I didnt reset my progress becuase the lack of any type of pacing in this game is enogh to make you kick a puppy and I really love puppies.The lack of pacing, bad FPS, and not being able to skip the god awful cut scenes when you have to restart a level (and you will, a lot) makes me NOT recommend this game.  The dev team seem like a bunch of hard working guys trying to do something but the game just isnt fun.  At least this version of it.  Glad I got the discounted price for backing.  I will be sticking this in the ""wont waste my time"" catagory in my steam library.  Shame.			"

I run some top of the notch hardware. Two GTX Titans overlocked in SLI , 64-bit, 32GB RAM, Intel Core I7-4930K CPU 3.40GHZ. They have yet to invent a game that my system can't handle, so no excuses developers! I am literally halted in my tracks.  And I can't play the game I payed for any further, until this matter is resolved. Therefor, I advice all potential buyers to WAIT, and not purchase this title, until a fix has been provided officially. Once there is a fix, I'll consider providing a positive piece of feedback.The devs have made several posts on the community hub, in which they state they've 'improved the FPS issues' however, I've had no confirmation of this what so ever, nor any positive feedback regarding this subject from any other buyers.Good game, terribly optimized! Fix this, so we can play this gem in the rough!			"

Early Access Review
								I am a huge fan of the dungeon keeper series, this game being the spiritual successor of dungeon keeper II, I was more than happy to purchase the alpha early game access the instant I became aware of it.  I await updates to the alpha early access with bated breath.Do not purchase the alpha for the early access unless you're a die hard fan.  Instead wait for the release so you shall not be disappointed with the development builds.  The horrendous mobile game that was released by Mythic/EA with the dungeon keeper title should be avoided and shunned at all costs for ruining the franchise.  Instead go buy and play dungeon keeper gold (1998,) and dungeon keeper II (1999.)  both of which are not on steam unfortunately, try gog.			"

												I wanted this game to be a huge success. The guys did a good job to revive the DG series but unfortunately they did not capture the spirit. The game is not well polished and I did not enjoy the campaign at all. I am very sad to give a negative review... as Dungeon Keeper I was my first PC game.			"

												Don't buy this game yet.  I've spent hours attempting to get it to launch with no luck.  In 6 months maybe they will have the kinks worked out but given the number of bugfixes and she sheer number of people having problems it is a terrible idea to purchase it now.  I bought it without reading the plethora of negative reviews because I loved the Dungeon Keeper games and love the idea of a reboot of them.  Again, this might become playable but we'll see.  The fact that it was released in this state doesn't bode well.			"

												Game is full of bugs, unfinished, their entire thinking of what should Dungeon management  be is wrong. Everything is too rushy, one second you are reading what library room does, the other second your dungeon heart is being attacked, and enemy is charging on you, you defeat them, you end the mission and go like wtf was that?. Game is unfinished and small details are lacking, its really sad to see a tavern in which nothing happens (minions go there grab food, and leave gold on floor). No sitting, eating, relaxing etc. Exploration of these small details and creatures and their relations is what is fun for me. I am simply to afraid to continue playing it because I have a feeling it will dissapoint me too much I would have to delete it and never look back. I dont want my gaming experience with this franchise to be trying not to drown in bugs, hoping it wont crash and imagining things in game they should be there in first place. Just dont buy it really, if you loved DK 1-2 , or at least dont play it untill its finally done properly.			"

												This game is pretty much a straight remake of Dungeon Keeper 2 with some names changed and without the handy map function.  That would not be a bad thing, only I have found it buggy and extremely slow.  It has never exited without crashing, room tiles vanish without a reason, sometimes can't pick up creatures from your prison, takes minutes to load on a computer that runs Skyrim with ease, etc.It also badly needs a manual to understand many of the features, which is a shame because a lot of thought obviously went into some of them.  Some of the voice acting is pretty good too.  I feel bad saying this about something trying to carry the flag of a game I love, but I can't recommend it.  It suffers from being too like the original without enough added content or new features, and it seems to run worse than the original did on far older ones.			"

												I feel this does not capture the spirit of the first Dungeon Keeper, but I also feel like it surpasses Dungeon Keeper 2, but not enough for me to give a recommendation.The main problem I have with this game is the pacing. Every mission you unlock something new, leading to a rather spikey learning curve as you are supposed to juggle the intracies of new rooms and creatures on gameplay while being introduced to new rooms and creatures and mechanics. The game wasn't even challenging. You aren't ever wanting for resources, nor do you need to carefully build defenses, or carefully gauge how much of whatever room to attract various minions.Prisons and torture are pretty useless, but more units never hurt anything. Traps are overpowered, and you can rally click your way to victory without breaking a sweat. I enjoyed the narration though.The entire game feels like a tutorial, and there's never any added difficulty of learning to use your arsenal well. When you finally get all your toys to begin playing with, the game gives you the credits and a thanks for playing! Well, you're not welcome. Ok, maybe a little welcome. It was still Dungeon Keeper after all.			"

												If you like DK1 and 2, you should definitely give this a go. It sticks extremely close to the formula.Pros:* Feels like other DK's* Similar DK humour (Lol'd at Chunders)* Overall just really good!Cons:* Subtitle text is too small and is pure white meaning it's hard to read on bright backgrounds* All of the buildings have the word 'Prop' in them. e.g. Instead of 'Barracks' it's called 'Prop Barracks'...not sure why.* When you look at buildings/creatures and what they're doing it's not very specific whereas in DK2 it was very specific about what was going on so you could micromanage very well.EDIT: I've been playing it for a bit longer since my initial review.The game is too buggy. Here are a list I've encountered so far (The good aspects of the game still stand, but it's also buggy).- Frequently getting 'Insufficient mana' when trying to cast a spell even if my mana is full.- Imps ignore the boundaries set by the flag to stop them possessing land- I played a skirmish game and nothing happened. No units came at all.- Several graphical glitches- The sidebar buttons are wayyy too small to hit with a cursor. The whole UI is a bit finnicky, I'm not sure if it's just too small?- Placeholder variables in the actual game content. This is unacceptable. Things like 'Identified : False' and 'Team:null' are very lazy placeholders which they need to remove asap. I also encountered one where a beast was going for food and it's status was something along the lines of 'Going to HUNGER_VAR at slaughterpen'...not cool.- When you possess a creature, the movement feels janky and jerky.I think more than anything, they need to seriously review their code. By the sounds of it, they're rushing it and introducing more bugs.Still, If you like DK (not donkey kong) and don't mind a few annoyances, I'd recommend it.			"

												Update:With the new patch I can now continue playing the game and have now progressed further. I find the campaign interesting and varied but I constantly feel rushed to do something else. It makes it abit more tense but I also would like time to get to know my creatures and experience the game abit more. But I feel that this is lacking here. On the outside I feel that it looks and feels roughly like a Dungeon Keeper game but it lacks the heart of one of these or the slow deliberate nature of late 90s RTS games. There is no ""meh"" option for this review so I will leave it as a not recommend game. Original Review:This game has some promise but I at the moment the campaign is unplayable. It consistantly crashs on the 4th mission and I cannot progress. Other modes work but I want to play the campaign but the game does not allow this. It is also janky with graphical erros other gameplay wierdness. Please do not by this game. If it gets better I will update my review.			"

								If you miss and remember Dungeon Keeper you will love this game. This is the same voice actor from orignal dungeon keeper heh, and even the guys making it started as a gaming clan I believe that evolvd into I think modding then eventually after years I suppose they started learning more and more. Got tired of waiting for a dungeon keeper and well made a killer game that is just like the old one enchanced but not ruined in any way thanks to them being loyal fans of the orignal game you wont feel lost in your dungeon building!If you never played dungeon keeper shame on you! Check some videos out on this game and dungeon keeper, I am sure you will enjoy this. Don't forget its still in early acces and getting cooler and cooler they just recently added multiplayer!			"

												I purchased this game a few years ago because I was really excited about a new version of Dungeon Keeper. I have tried playing multiple times and every time I run into some game-halting bug. Each time I try playing, I ending up stopping to wait for the bugs to get fixed. When I first started the game was in early access so I decided to cut them some slack. But now it's the full version of the game and I still can't play because of these bugs that basically make gameplay impossible.I really want to like this game. It's a fun concept and the devs have obviously done a ton of work on it and made an almost-great product. But the focus seems to be entirely on adding content rather than making sure the existing content works. It doesn't matter how great your graphics are, how many levels you have, and how many different rooms and spells and monsters you've thrown into the mix. If people can't play because of bugs, your game is bad.			"

												This is a ""Wait-for-Sale"" game, as much as I hate to say it. But I say that because by the time it goes on sale, it should have more content and most of the bugs out of the system. But if you've been waiting for Dungeon Keeper 3, look no further than this.At the time of review, I had completed the campaign and dipped a little into the skirmish mode. As far as tech problems, I've only had two of note and both happened on level 10. I had the game freeze for 10 minutes when I did a ritual that revealed the enemy dungeon. And I tried to reload a save for it and it didn't load. Other than that the only other tech problems I've had is really nothing that cannot be solved with graphic adjustments in the options menu. If you're experiencing game breaking bugs, you might want to consider the age of your hardware and upgrade the parts that are over five-years old.Despite the bugs and the lack of content in the skirmish, I've had a fantastic time with this game. The campaign, while a glorified tutorial, is quite good whether you're an old player or new to this type of game. I played Dungeon Keeper 2 for comparison and my verdict is that it is pretty much DK 2 with the polish that didn't exist in 1999 and with addtions that add to overall experience rather than detract. I found the use of Potions and Rituals to be an interesting addtion to the formula. And you'll come to love the Narrator, who is from the original game, as the way that he delivers his dialouge is such a joy to listen to. I would put him the Hall of Fame where they reconigze voice talents like the narrators from ""Stanley Parable"" and ""Basition"".This game definately is going to be worth having but it's going to happen several patches down the line. To their credit, they are coming out with patches at a quick rate but this game definately could've used another month in Early Access to polish up their assests. Heck, you can still see the Unity engine titles when you hover over units. I don't know whether it was money and/or the bad reputation Early Access has gotten the past year that prompted them to release it in this state, but it thankfully doesn't detract from the overall game experience and the game is backed by a good studio. We haven't really gotten a good successor to Dungeon Keeper and this is by far a worthy successor to the concept.			"

												Great gameplay, Unfortunately sullied somewhat by freequent crashes, looking forward to some heavy duty patching for stablity. Other than that, Awesome so far.TL;DR -- The game is not complete, Altho being very fun, Needs ALOT of work. If you don't mind playing what is essentially still beta, Then you won't be dissapointed, If not. Wait 6-12 months for it to be properly ready.UPDATE: Since writing the Original review, the game has Launched. Unfortunately, It is still far from what I would consider ""complete"" The Single player campaign has frequent issues (server slowdown/freezes/crashes/Bugs out and after completing the objective nothing happens). These can be gotten around by re-playing the level but you really shouldn't have to do that. There is a servere lack of content beyond the single player campaign too. There is alot of stuff ""comming"" but a released game should be COMPLETE. If it's not ready, leave it in early access. If this was still in early access I could definitely recommend it. The game has alot of potential, and in 6 months to a year, I think it will be a really great game. Unfortunately, It's just not complete. IF you don't mind playing a ""released"" game that is basically still in Beta, then you WILL NOT be dissapointed. However, if you are after a complete game. You will be.			"

It has performance issues, some odd design choices for the user experience and could certainly have built a better executed version of the game, but recent patches show some acknowledgment of the issues so there is hope. Overall though, this is one of 2 (alongside Dungeons 2) Dungeon Keeper games that are well worth your cash if you like this type of RTS/Strategy game.  "

												It's far from being polished, but it's doing a very decent job bringing back the dungeon keeper feeling, while adding some new elements. I'm not sure all of the new elements are all equally sucessfull. I for one, didn't like the level where you are stuck with a 'rally to battle' flag (albeit with an option of making groups) starting with four necromancers, where a more strategic precision would have been very welcome.However rough and unpolished it still might be, I thoroughly enjoy it, and I suspect I will spend quite some hours with it. In my book a game is worth it's value if it keeps me interested for at least a day, and this one already has.			"

												Great gameplay, Unfortunately sullied somewhat by freequent crashes, looking forward to some heavy duty patching for stablity. Other than that, Awesome so far.TL;DR -- The game is not complete, Altho being very fun, Needs ALOT of work. If you don't mind playing what is essentially still beta, Then you won't be dissapointed, If not. Wait 6-12 months for it to be properly ready.UPDATE: Since writing the Original review, the game has Launched. Unfortunately, It is still far from what I would consider ""complete"" The Single player campaign has frequent issues (server slowdown/freezes/crashes/Bugs out and after completing the objective nothing happens). These can be gotten around by re-playing the level but you really shouldn't have to do that. There is a servere lack of content beyond the single player campaign too. There is alot of stuff ""comming"" but a released game should be COMPLETE. If it's not ready, leave it in early access. If this was still in early access I could definitely recommend it. The game has alot of potential, and in 6 months to a year, I think it will be a really great game. Unfortunately, It's just not complete. IF you don't mind playing a ""released"" game that is basically still in Beta, then you WILL NOT be dissapointed. However, if you are after a complete game. You will be.			"

												I can vouche this one.  Was a backer (even though the title wasn't given due to the fact that my pay method wasn't accepted for it).  In the last 2 days this game has been patched with steadfast determination.  I have followed this game for YEARS.  It is one of the very few games out there that promised and delivered after a ton of ups and down within the production.  The game in itself is made with the Unity engine.  The DK series was a favorite of mine from the beginning, and was a kick to the balls when EA bought it and did what they do best.  Round filed it.  These ppl saw a community who was begging for more from the DK title, and took it upon themselves to dev WftO, even though they had to cover their azzes to keep the game in the spirit of the DK genre while making it their own.  This group never promised anything it didn't deliver.  Not once in the promotion of the game did they make it look like it was anything but what it is.  I have faith in this product to be a quality piece.  I have played many games that were top titles that were released in WAY worse shape, and WAY more expensive.I give this game 10 thumbs up and played it for about 66 hrs.  It had some laggy issues with the AI pathing which seemes to have been patched out, and 2 bugs with completion which also has been fixed.  If you want a blast from the past with a new twist, this game is a definite buy.  If you are worried about the bugs, give it a day or 2 to let them sort out the release and then buy it.  This is a must for anyone that is a fan of the DK series, or the ""god"" game genre.  I have been reporting and watching the WftO forums, and I must say that not once have they not replied quickly to any reports or comments.Hop to see you soon Underlord!			"

												Unfortunately, the game slows to a crawl and then crashes when lots of stuff is on-screen, requiring a hard-reset (and a disk-error integrity check). At the ""Keros"" level, the game becomes unplayable.  Sadly, the game seems to have its heart in the right place, but the technology just doesn't work.  It appears the game was rushed to release early, on purpose, since the developer's tool tips are still in the game and appear when you hover your mouse over anything (complete with error and bug notices).  One must assume the early release was out of fear of the competing product, ""Dungeons 2"" which is due out in a few days.  The rush to beat a competitor to market resulted in a  broken game.  Maybe the game will be finished and fixed through patches.  It looks like it has great potential when finished.  But it is still in beta stage, and releasing it like that is awful.  Don't buy this product.			"

Love it alot.Have only play the campa mode.But there is still some bug.. the vampire i raise is UNkillable.. it just respawn and respawn and respawn..It is ok if i was not his enemy for some reason and destory my heart solo.The enemy sometime will trap at your heart and nothing can kill it so even a level 1 enemy can destory you.Lastly i heard from other that this game is too hard to play.However i felt the diff.I cant even see any enemy... previously in dugent keeper 2 the enemy come in by the level 10 wave after wave and after wave that was real fun.Endless of enemy endless of fun.

												Amazing so far, love the DK2 voices humor and gameplay its everything youve been waiting for if you liked the dungeoun keeper series..AI in skirmishes seems to want to hunt you down though, i personally like being slow with my expansion.Missing the Rally spell to get all units to one area quickly but it is possible i have not figured it out yet at the time i wrote this review.[Updated 7-28-2015]i found the rally button, my mistake...wish they would do some more with the survival part, Midas door update made it useable i can hold out against a large wave for quite some timethe hard AI i have yet been able to best, it is very good at attacking probing defenses and counterattacking which i really like, DK2 i could beat a master AI with ease			"

												This game is an OVERLY SATANIC version of Dungeon Keeper 1+2 combined that fails in the performance and game crash catagories. Although the gameplay was getting fun, the game will slow down to a scraping hault after a while on various levels, mainly 3 and some people say level 11 (I got stuck on level 3, started many new games after the patch, game still crashed). I have 32 gig ram machine that handles every other game just fine, this game is bugged, don't buy it like I did :(			"

												Do you remember Dungeon Keeper 2? You did like it right? Well there's nothing else to say then, for the remaining people, continue reading.War for the Overworld is a RTS game which puts you in the shoes of an Underlord: a mystical being which has the power of creating dungeons and using the forces of evil (minions and so...). The purpose of the game itself is to build your own dungeon, and that's where all the fun lies. Many Underlords prefer building traps, other train their creatures to death in order to slay enemies, others use a mixture of both. While doing so you also know how to use some magic that can help your cause. To build your dungeon you have workes to help you, just tell them where to dig, what to do and they will without fail. By creating space you can start build rooms that will attract creatures to your dungeon.Pretty interesting right? Well, the campaign is well done but incosistent: some moments are far too easy and some other are hell itself. I haven't yet tried the multiplayer, but the game is actively developed and I think there will be many interesting suprises with time. A game worth its money.			"

												TL:DR at end.Well, I'll start by saying that I love this game, it really is a modern dungeon keeper. I'll continue by pointing out some downfalls: compared to the first 2 there's not many improvements in my opinion; it seems to be made to be a lot easier too, hence 10 hours to complete campaign (with 5 crashes); It feels like it's still in beta, which i will now expand upon but first let me point out i have not read what the developers have to say about current state & patch roadmaps because I shouldn't have to, Someone releases a game and you expect it to be ready for release: This is not.I'll be light on this subject because if you dont care about these things, you'll enjoy the game, I know i did. First, too many towers crashes the game; that's right, a dungeon defense game and if you build too many defenses, it will crash. One mission in particular, campaign mission 9, you have to defend a bottleneck which is of course perfect for towers but no, build them and after 2 mins you'll be restarting. Secondly, it's obviously not finished, mouse over a minion and it will tell you their current task which almost always is psuedocode, for example (and I'm paraphrasing here ) you will see current task do_GOLD_prop(dugeon.heart)  instead of 'get paid'  or get_raw_food_prop(pigfarm) instead of 'eat micropig'; further to this the interface doesn't work as it should, want to see your list of minions? it will often forget to turn the boundery of the list into scroll bars so you can only see the first 6 or 7 types of minion.Thirdly it takes an insane amount of RAM, I'm not sure if there's a leak in there or whether it doesn't use GFX dedicated ram properly but 4.5Gb of RAM to run? Dont get me wrong, I have enough RAM but DAMN, that's more than any other game in my library (and i have a lot).So yes, plays well if you dont build towers or use the ritual ro reveal the enemy dugeon (yup, that's a crash too!), nothing too immersion breaking on the interface apart from being able to only see half your force and taking 2 seconds to see what your minion is doing instead of 1/2 a second and if you dont have much RAM you may have performance issues, apart from that, a 9 hour sp experience(if you dont crash), only 3 skirmish maps, all very small & multiplayer/survival is still not working right now.TL:DRslapped a micropig, it squeeled and popped and made me smile, 12/10 now stop reading reviews if you cant be bothered to read.

Early Access Review
								This game is amazing.....I never got to play the Dungeon Keeper games, but have always been looking for a dungeon management game that appealed to me. After going through many of the popular games out there and them all being duds, I found this one! This game has very little content thus far, and was still entertaining. I can't wait for this game to be fully released as I imagine I will be logging alot of hours. The only flaws I could even think of was that some of the user interface aspects could be a little more clean and user friendly, as well as workers sometimes taking forever to build doors. Either way this will be an epic game and im 100% on board!Side note* its very rare to play an early acess game with no noticeable bugs, and thats what you get here. This game is really polished to be at such an early stage of development! Keep up the great work Devs!			"

												Great game overall, really takes me back to those Dungeon Keeper days.  I swear they even have the same guy doing the Voice with the same type of humour.The one major issue I have with the current version is that I can't load saved skirmishes, bar gets stuck at around the 80% level.  I always preferred to play long games and really have fun with dungeon design.  So this bug kinda nixes it for me.I'll check back after the next patch, but I do kinda feel like I've wasted my money.			"

												Do you remember Dungeon Keeper 2? You did like it right? Well there's nothing else to say then, for the remaining people, continue reading.War for the Overworld is a RTS game which puts you in the shoes of an Underlord: a mystical being which has the power of creating dungeons and using the forces of evil (minions and so...). The purpose of the game itself is to build your own dungeon, and that's where all the fun lies. Many Underlords prefer building traps, other train their creatures to death in order to slay enemies, others use a mixture of both. While doing so you also know how to use some magic that can help your cause. To build your dungeon you have workes to help you, just tell them where to dig, what to do and they will without fail. By creating space you can start build rooms that will attract creatures to your dungeon.Pretty interesting right? Well, the campaign is well done but incosistent: some moments are far too easy and some other are hell itself. I haven't yet tried the multiplayer, but the game is actively developed and I think there will be many interesting suprises with time. A game worth its money.			"

												There are elements of the game that are unfinished, placeholder text and plain lack of content. However, what I have played is the campaign and that seems mostly complete. I've only done a few levels, but they were good, it felt like the DK3 I've been waiting years for.I think the current ~£3 discount you get in the sale balances out the small lack of content. Especially when you consider the rate at which the devs are releasing patches. It won't be long before the game is complete and very playable.If you are definitely going to buy this game at some point and don't want to wait for the summer sales then buy it now, though you might want to hold off on installing it for another week or so. Happy slapping Keeper.			"

Build in a way that pleases you most; weather that be beasts and violent minions, undead and necromancers...to raise more undead, or somewhere inbetween the two.Unleash your frustrations, unleash your inner evil...no matter how small it may be!  :P			"

												The devs have admitted this game was released while it was still in early access condition and as of right now the game is very much unplayable due to this. To start with the UI is very slow, like 2-3 seconds slow. Leaving for some very choppy gameplay, ive reported this on the official forum and after a month there has still been no fix, ive since asked the devs again if anything will be done about this with no response, im guessing they have given up with this bug. During my play through of the game ive encountered around 40 to 60 crashes and as of right now I am still not able to get past level 7 due to game breaking bugs. I will update my review when they have fixed all of the game breaking bugs.			"

												Disappointing, I know this is an indie project but when you sell it as the successor to Dungeon Keeper you hope for a bit more. The graphics are serviceable but lack some of the edge and charm of the original. The balance is super patchy - some levels feel too easy some levels hard in maddening ways. One example being a later level where you can chew throw two foes quickly only to find the third has an infinitely spawning group of high level forces, workers and mana - even with half of their base conquered!  It feels like a competent update but the magic isn't there and the frustrations push it over to a no for me. Really I was looking for more than an update to the old game. Playing this after Keeper RL and having seen the trailers for Dungeon 2 also push me to think they really could have done more.			"

												The game had a lot of potential.It's horribly put together and is riddled with issues; AI pathfinding is atrocious and your minions are nigh on impossible to control. This wouldn't be a problem if this was a relaxing romp through the joys of building a dungeon and repelling would be invaders or seeking out objections in your own time. The crucial problem, and the deal breaker for me, is the excessive focus on speed and micro management that seems to underpin every aspect of this game. It's like somebody took Dungeon Keeper soul and flayed bits off of it and crammed it into a Starcraft tournament.I kept wanting to like this game but I cannot in good conscious recommend it. I am not enjoying it.The developers seem a good bunch and are dedicated to getting the game running as best it can but owing to the inherent game design issues I have with this game it wouldn't be enough.I may come back in a few months when it's actually finished.

												After the debacle of another game I bought into for Early Access, I had my doubts about this game.  I re-installed today after reading the notes and came upon a pleasent surprise.  Dungeon Keeper 1 is among my top favorite games to play.  This game, while not quite there, does fill the void that game left after DK2 appeared to be it.  After some time to play, I want to give some more information about the game for those out there.  Notable Problems: 1. Sluggish Gameplay: At the moment, they just quashed a major problem by fixing the issue with the memory leak.  This helped deal with some of my slowdown issues, but it hasn't fixed them all.  I'm not on a state-of-the-art model computer.  At the same time, I am running a decent setup that can handle a good chunk of modern games at higher settings.  I haven't tried out my laptop, yet I will get around to that for a final detailed review. 2. Place Holder Text: A majority of this did get fixed.  Some place holder text does remain however.  Also, there are times when text will break and return to a placeholder setup.  This happened to me on the second to last level with some creature texts.  Minor Issues: 1. Saved Game issue - Encountered this one today where my saved game files were out of arrangment.  I had to fish around to find the one that I wanted.  2. Tactics:  At the moment, the computer can be downright stupid at times.  It'll do nothing or do a simple, one direction, brute force attack wave that can be counter with ease.  3. Level Design: Each level feels similar to the next with little change in design.  Only one level really caught my eyes, standing out from the rest.  With all of that said though, this is not a Caveat Emptor/Buyer Beware notion.  Instead, I recommend it as a buyer being aware this game still needs some fine tuning.  I applaud the developers for sticking with the game vs. simply releasing it then splitting with some extra $$$ to line their pockets.  Several updates have been released since launch to fix notorious issues, and, in a week or two imho, the game will start to work even better than expected.			"

												I had high hopes for this game and at times it was very, very, good but there were a few things that I didn't like. Even with the game still being fixed and with all the bugs it was enjoyable, but the fact that the bugs make the game unplayable at times made it really annoying.While playing the game I felt it was pushing you to complete it, rather unlike DK 1 and 2, were you could build your dungeon and plan and plot. Placing traps in DK 1 and 2 were useful, in this game not so much, as when heroes or enemy creatures hit level 5 then the traps prove useless and ineffective. Overall, out of the whole game, there were only 3 or 4 levels where you could just build your dungeon and then expand outwards.Also in the last mission the cinematic was really disappointing, it was predictable and so short I felt cheated.

												War for the Overworld (WFTO) is the spiritual successor of Dungeon Keeper 2.  The campaign is similar to DK2 with a heavy focus on RTS elements and aggressive gameplay.  Fortunately, the game has a speed setting so that you can play slower (or faster) - I found the campaign highly enjoyable on the slower speed.Criticism:I think the UI is far too cumbersome for an RTS game - there are too many UI elements.  Also, there are several redundant types of units, rooms, and spells.  These redundancies just make the game feel bulky.  Fortunately, there are hotkeys for everything - it just takes a while to learn them.TL;DR  This is Dungeon Keeper 3			"

Some savegames won't load, (they will slow the fps so low it would be unplayable like 1fpm (frame/mn XD).  Keyboards layout are ignored (so possession becomes a pain in *** with non qwerty keyboards). Honestly, it's neither an alpha nor a release; i think beta is pretty honest to qualify this product on April the 10th 2015. Let's hope it'll  soon be a real release.			"

												Bought this game ~1 year ago while it was in early release. Fired it up today and had my mind blown at how extensive the progress on it has been. Graphics are looking great, UI has improved a great deal, and gameplay mechanics are smooth, interesting, and fun. This truely is the Dungeon Keeper successor Ive been praying for. Its good to be bad.			"

												If you loved Dungeon Keeper, then you will love this game. War for the Overworld is very similar to Dungeon Keeper that takes the very best aspects of the game. I played this game for hours and it kept me entertained. The challenge of the game varied from level to level, some seeming impossible to beat at times but this is the games way of forcing the player to try different strategies in order to win. I did observe a glitch on world twelve where for whatever reason even though I beat the three opponents it didn't register so I played for way longer then I should have before quitting. When I came back the next day to try again or restart the level, it triggered a win and the level finally ended. I hope that they release a sequel because this game is worth it.			"

												I found the AI of this game makes micromanaging impossible. Its basically a starcraft (without the shortcut keys) where you got to not only feed your units, but keep them happy and always have to waste time looking for them since they wander and its impossible to control them (outside of your floors).I ended up deciding to not continue play after not even 10 hours since goal is mostly always to destroy one or many buildings and the objectives wether single or multiplayer is to destroy the ""core"" of a player and didn't felt like playing a mix of moba and starcraft spamming a building with units.Altough I was tempted by the customizeable tree of upgrades and its various units, I just can't keep up with the gameplay, just my first missions took me around an hour or two each to do since there are so much elements and mechanics in them constantly tossed you while trying to make the campaign itself, that I lost one or two games trying to master basic mechanics and new units.I'd say its probably an incredibly good strategy game once you get the hang of it, but I'm not too fond of the genre myself and just wanted to have a better look at it.Any fan of strategy game and classic RPG elements will be pleased with this title, its a good one, just not for me.

												I played and loved the original Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2 back in the day. War for the Overworld is my Dungeon Keeper 3. All the fun stuff of DK--quirky humor, slapping minions, torture chambers and more--with added features true to franchise.If you loved the original DK games, or just a fan of RTS games in general, War for the Overworld will be a fun and unique addition to your library.

												This is a Spiritual Sequel to the old Bullfrog Dungeon Keeper. And much like Supreme Commander was a spiritual sequence to Total Annihilation, it brings new things to the table. If you are wondering ""Is it really Dungeon Keeper 3"". The answer essentially is yes. In everything but the name, this is THAT GAME and it is Glorious.			"

												It is a great game with a dungeon keeper feel. It is somewhat easy towards the beginning, then gets incredibly hard, then goes back to easy for the final mission. My chief complaint is the level design didn't feel creative. Most levels play the same way. Which is not bad, but some variety would have been nice. For instance, we have a possess creature spell, why not make a level where we have to use that spell continually to win? That said, this still a good game, and worth buying.			"

I have just been so impressed that I had to support this team, and this is the way I am doing it.In a nutshell, I recommend this game to anyone who loved DK and DK2.  I actually think this game is much better.  A small team of programmers made me so happy to play a game again!  The support this teams gives is amazing as well.  You can feel the love and passion of the game they created when playing.			"

												COMPARISON OF OVERWORLD TO DUNGEONKEEPER I bought the game despite the negative reviews, and suggest you do the same. I am a diehard fan of DK, having an emulator on my PC for the sole purpose of playing it (and have done so a lot). I am so happy I found a game that brought me what 'Impire' and 'Dungeons' didn't. This game exceeded my expectations enough I may uninstall my emulator for DK.PROS:+True DK successor- saturated with eastereggs  that even veteran players may miss (micropiglets have invaded your dungeon)+Better storyline than DK. You aren't a random keeper trying to get out of hell for implied reasons.+Perfect voice acting-  Better execution than in DK, which was exceptional to begin with.+Well balanced.  Good luck finding a cheap exploit against a good player.+Multiple strategies for victory. DK was won by having a hoard of creatures and that alone. Overworld has many, if you're clever enough to find them.+Technology tree that allows for rushing, booming and turtling strategies that didn't exist in DK. +An AI that is actually challenging. +Elite, boss like creatures that put dark angels to shame+More meaningful combinations with traps. DK had many traps, but they weren't actually useful like they are in Overworld.+Constructs for sapping, replacing earth (I wanted that so bad in DK), and more+More strategy with spells. In DK, pragmatically you could only use the same 2-3. While you aren't forced to be spell happy, spells can be a main strategy for victory.+Dungeon molds to your playing style more than DKCONS-UI needs to be more polished- If you select a potion, you are unable to change your mind; You have to use it. Selecting a ritual to perform is clunky, and is easy to cancel out of by mistake without knowing.-Was under pressure to ship to market too soon. Fortunately development has been responsive.-Possesion mode doesn't make it clear what you're targeting, or if you're hitting anything as well as DK does.-Creature dialogue can distract from gameplay. I know some other players find creatures overtly chatty. Only the Cultist bothers me. -If there are secret creatures to be gained by combining rooms, I haven't found them.-None of the minigames that gave the original DK some of it's flavor. But I never played those much anyway. No comical video shorts either-No invincible, horned reaper. But let's be honest, it probably doesn't belong in there unless they're literally cloning DK.-Your dungeon isn't filled with yoghurt. The floor isn't lumpy either. No need to order your minions to jump up and down.			"

												Ok so fun story your gonna love this/. Its about one in the morning after my mate gets off skype and goes to bed. I see a patch for underworld. So I download it and look at the notes and said the memory leak should be fixed and I was like oooo.So tried it out.Loaded it up and instantly the menu says ""isn't it past your bedtime underlord"". I was like what the ♥♥♥♥. Is this my girlfriend telling me to go to bed since its 1 in the morning? Haha anyway load up my save from one of the campaign levels that had been lagging like hell it ran smoothly I was loving it. After completing the level I instantly moved onto the next one, feeling int the zone. Next level after defending for 30 mins I held strong. I then counter attacked and lost my army but they had nothing left so I built up another army. I built this army up for ages and it got massive.So this is where it gets funny right? Just as I have spent 1 hour building this army up and half an hour defending so I have spent an hour and a half on this l level. I had a insanely complicated dungeon with defenses everywhere and ward so I could see everything inside their base.I knew how Many troops they had and where they were etc I had built a massive army and waited till they were all like level 8. So after 2 hours playing the games and an hour and a half being spent on this one level.... I sold a tile to build a lair on it as my army was so big then I was gonna attack and win the level. So I sell the tile and........freeze. I wait and I wait and I wait and it comes up with games not responding. I say wait for game to respond and this goes up for a bit where it keeps saying it's not responding and I keeep saying wait. Eventually I realise the game was dead so Clicked close program. I load up the game straight away to see if. I have anything left on the level I had spent an hour and a half doing. It loads up. Menu proceeds to says ""Underlord. Go to bed."" At this point I'm thinking ♥♥♥♥ you. You did not just crash my game and my dungeon and my level that I had spent ages doing and now your telling me to go to bed? ♥♥♥♥ you. So go into save games. Nothing there. I will have to restart the level. At this point I close the game and go to bed.I hate it's guts but due to the addicting nature of the game I will end up redoing the level tomorrow. Even though this game has frustrating moments like this, It did cause me to stay up until like 3am playing it. It is massively fun and the bugs are rare. It was my fault I had not saved. 10/10 would rage again lol 10/10 would play again.			"

												I had high hopes for this game and at times it was very, very, good but there were a few things that I didn't like. Even with the game still being fixed and with all the bugs it was enjoyable, but the fact that the bugs make the game unplayable at times made it really annoying.While playing the game I felt it was pushing you to complete it, rather unlike DK 1 and 2, were you could build your dungeon and plan and plot. Placing traps in DK 1 and 2 were useful, in this game not so much, as when heroes or enemy creatures hit level 5 then the traps prove useless and ineffective. Overall, out of the whole game, there were only 3 or 4 levels where you could just build your dungeon and then expand outwards.Also in the last mission the cinematic was really disappointing, it was predictable and so short I felt cheated.

												Very good game. Clearly good game and is worth its price 'spite arguments below.Not really ok with the trade policy though. This is not a release it's a beta. Some savegames won't load, (they will slow the fps so low it would be unplayable like 1fpm (frame/mn XD).  Keyboards layout are ignored (so possession becomes a pain in *** with non qwerty keyboards). Honestly, it's neither an alpha nor a release; i think beta is pretty honest to qualify this product on April the 10th 2015. Let's hope it'll  soon be a real release.			"

												Finally!  A true successor to Dungeon Keeper, or so I thought.  Well... it started well, then they gave up.  There was a good patch that made it playable but it didnt get over the basic problem. It is very linear and none of the game modes seemed to give it any real variety.  Graphically, it has all the things I liked about the original dungeon keeper but in a graphical environment which is fit for current PCs and doesnt leave you thinking... mod.  Nice ideas and just enough variety to, if not overwhelm one with the possibilities, not to be annoying by itIt t has the open sandbox and Multiplayer capability that DK really didnt do properly even with mods but somehow, the sandbox didnt really work. It is just too limited. Not really the intense epic set pieces I like to fight out.  This is a good, nay, a great game in principle. When it first went to general release it went slightly too early, so scored way lower on metacritic but it isnt terrible. It just isnt good enough either sadly.  Too linear, too limited.  Somehow, just a bit unsatisfying all round. A light weight version of the game I would have really wanted. I liked it a lot for a while but I am switching a thumbs up to a thumbs down as what I thought was a work in progress never went any further in unlocking the potential.			"

												The devs have admitted this game was released while it was still in early access condition and as of right now the game is very much unplayable due to this. To start with the UI is very slow, like 2-3 seconds slow. Leaving for some very choppy gameplay, ive reported this on the official forum and after a month there has still been no fix, ive since asked the devs again if anything will be done about this with no response, im guessing they have given up with this bug. During my play through of the game ive encountered around 40 to 60 crashes and as of right now I am still not able to get past level 7 due to game breaking bugs. I will update my review when they have fixed all of the game breaking bugs.			"

								Clearly like overlord. alot like it, like slightly improoved from it. which is kinda lame because with how things look now adays youd imagine they would improve it a little... There is only one lvl, so that also sucks. the sandboxs are only to build everything. thats boring after 20 mins. im only giving this game a thumbs up because overlord was alot of fun. but this isn't a beta, its more an alpha. but thats my opinion.

												This game is like the old dungeon keepers, but with only two forms of strategy. The only hope for the keeper is to attack or keep monsters around the heart by flagging the heart. Fortified walls can be broken through very easily (just by simply digging), and the AI constantly bum rushes the player. Also, most of the levels already have a pre-made dungeon for you. The game just throws you in and expects you to know what to do. Overall, this is a poor spiritual successor for the old dungeon keepers. Stay away from this game.			"

												Disappointing, I know this is an indie project but when you sell it as the successor to Dungeon Keeper you hope for a bit more. The graphics are serviceable but lack some of the edge and charm of the original. The balance is super patchy - some levels feel too easy some levels hard in maddening ways. One example being a later level where you can chew throw two foes quickly only to find the third has an infinitely spawning group of high level forces, workers and mana - even with half of their base conquered!  It feels like a competent update but the magic isn't there and the frustrations push it over to a no for me. Really I was looking for more than an update to the old game. Playing this after Keeper RL and having seen the trailers for Dungeon 2 also push me to think they really could have done more.			"

												The game had a lot of potential.It's horribly put together and is riddled with issues; AI pathfinding is atrocious and your minions are nigh on impossible to control. This wouldn't be a problem if this was a relaxing romp through the joys of building a dungeon and repelling would be invaders or seeking out objections in your own time. The crucial problem, and the deal breaker for me, is the excessive focus on speed and micro management that seems to underpin every aspect of this game. It's like somebody took Dungeon Keeper soul and flayed bits off of it and crammed it into a Starcraft tournament.I kept wanting to like this game but I cannot in good conscious recommend it. I am not enjoying it.The developers seem a good bunch and are dedicated to getting the game running as best it can but owing to the inherent game design issues I have with this game it wouldn't be enough.I may come back in a few months when it's actually finished.

I mean, do yourself a favor, and instead of playing through the levels on this where you really can't build your own dungeon (the campaign are all missions which tell you specifically what to do, and I can only assume the multiplayer would be even worse glitch-wise) and get something good like Command and Conquer if you're all about the overhead gameplay.  This leaves very little room for your own style of play, which is what really made it a negative for me.  I culd try to assume maybe it was my alienware that wasn't running to spec, but the glitches are numerous, it takes forever to load, the graphics leave something to be desired, etc.  It's just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to play, and when I go to attack with my minions and beasts, half of them don't pay attention to the rally flag, hich is another negative as you can only command your people to go to one place.  There is also no group selection or anything of the sort.  Either tell ALL of them to go HERE or leave them to their business.  This leaves no way to strategize about letting production continue and defend with certain minions, etc.  Overall, this is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game in my opinion, and a waste of time if you're looking for something that allows for real RTS.

												I admire every effort put to this game. It's a tribute to Dungeon Keeper. Feeding vampire in prison, changing prisoners into gold, setting torture chamber mode (execution or corrupt), creating dirt tiles, making potions that effect group of creatures once released, casting spells on group on minions, spirit workers, etc.It's like Dungeon Keeper on steroids... but unfortunatelly overdosed :(Maps are too large to grasp. You can have so many minions you don't see what's going on in the battle. Minions have too much health. I don't feel the bond with minions as much as in old Dungeon Keeper. I don't feel any loss when they die... well, I might feel this way because of my age and gaming experience, but dear developers I hope my complaints will help you in future releases/sequels. Minions are complaining about food, salary and lair too much. When they are ""railed"", they should focus on fight, no complaints ;) And also when you possess your minion, you could make his vision adjusted to his race (vampire - red sight, spider - 8 eyes somehow visualised, etc.).  Like in good old Dungeon Keeper (1997).Only technical thing I dislike is minimap. It should be more intuititive.Overall conclusion, I like innovations introduced in this title, and it's pretty efficient considering so much AI working at the same time, but I think the gameplay requires more polishing and balancing. It's still the best modern title similar to Dungeon Keeper.			"

												Just finished the single player game. Difficult to give a thumbs up here, as much as I want to give one to the spiritual successor of some of my favourite games, which I loved so much that I actually bought WFTO once on Kickstarter and once in Steam. In terms of mechanics it mostly works all right, except for that weird bug where prisoners keep dying as they are dropped into prison (just save and reload) and that thing where Revelation never ends so you can't use another ritual. Mostly all right. Performance and graphics wise it's decent. Just don't expect nifty extras like the special torture animations for different characters, here they are all the same.But the single player campaign missions... so simplistic and skeletal compared to Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2 both. Whoever designed the missions have not benchmarked their work against the predecessors and told themselves they must do better; it is more like they have never tried the old ones. It is a real shame to see all the working mechanics but such poor missions. By the time the game ends you probably won't even have tried half the spells/traps/rituals/potions/ on offer and easily never use several room types and minion types, the mission are just that insipid and easy. Everything is ""kill everything"". Balance issues abound as well. It is simply too easy to convert enemies quickly, DK 1 and 2 had the same issue but not quite so strongly. This makes supposedy tough missions trivial - defeat the first enemy wave and you immediately have enough minions to steamroll all the objectives. This goes hand in hand with the bizarre abundance of infinite gold resource on so many single player missions - it makes the game trivially easy! I finished it all and never even tried ghouls, or spirits, or vampires.. because you don't need it when you have 50 monsters fighting a handful.I have not tried the multiplayer. It is difficult to give it a try when the single player was always wonderful in DK1 and DK2 and so different here. Overall the campaign felt painfully abbreviated vs DK1 or DK2 and the ending was emotionally a big letdown as well. You should NEVER have a situation in a game where the boss died in 10 seconds and his taunts then play one after another for half a minute! Seriously devs.. I guess it's worth buying if it's on 50% sale, or if they have some kind of free expansion with another 15 missions. REALLY hope this game becomes moddable so people can step in with proper single player mission designs and rebalance things like how easy torture conversion is. Don't need your voiceovers. Just good missions.			"

												I always loved the Dungeon Keeper series and hence, looked forward to buying War for the Overworld. I bought the Gold Edition and luckily, it retains all of the atmosphere of the originals, while at the same time adding new elements to it.I like the new races and their trivia during the loading screen, it's even more descriptive than the information we got from the creatures in the originals(!) Likewise, the Cultist and the Succubus better fit the dark theme of the series than the Warlock and the Mistress did, in my humble opinion.Overall the game has great enjoyability, with the singular exception of the time achievements. Which to be fair, are still being recalibrated by the developers in order to keep the game fun and balanced.			"

												A few bugs and crashes still, but overall a solid successor to the DK games. I've been following the project since the early days, looking forward to it, but I ultimately held off due to its somewhat rocky release. The game in its current state is still a bit rough around the edges but pretty good. Management is a good balance between micro and macro and gives enough tools in both toolkits that neither gets tedious. Pacing is good in the levels and challenges are reasonable.The narrative is well-written and the characters are interesting, though the ending is atrocious. Still a worthwhile experience.			"

												This game is like the old dungeon keepers, but with only two forms of strategy. The only hope for the keeper is to attack or keep monsters around the heart by flagging the heart. Fortified walls can be broken through very easily (just by simply digging), and the AI constantly bum rushes the player. Also, most of the levels already have a pre-made dungeon for you. The game just throws you in and expects you to know what to do. Overall, this is a poor spiritual successor for the old dungeon keepers. Stay away from this game.			"

												If you were thinking ""God I love Dungeon Keeper II, but it doesn't work on my modern computer,"" then here is the solution for you. This game is almost the exact same game.If you were not looking for Dungeon Keeper II, then you may want to keep moving (though if you have never played it before it is excellent).The Skirmishes feel identical to the orignal game, though the campaign is a bit more combat-focused and less puzzle-focused. The ""Sin"" system also feels a bit different than anything I remember from DKII, but it works well to dole out your spells and achievements in a way that feel satisfying until end game when you have far more sins than you could ever use.Sorry this isn't helpful to anyone who hasn't played DKII, but this is basically a clone of that game.

												Well, I bought this game a few days ago and already have about 16 hours into it. So I am going to write this review from that standpoint.I played Dungeon Keeper 1 and loved it (tried 2 but for some reason it was really slow). I have no idea why EA never released another true dungeon keeper game, unless you call that travesty of a mobile game a true game.Anyway, this game is fantastic, you build your base with different rooms each serving different purposes. The game looks great and you really feel as if you are a god trying to build his base to crush an enemy. The only negative think I could say at the moment, is that as I build up my base, my game either slows down or freezes for a second before going back to normal, this makes it hard to actually control your alies in first person and attack who you want.The only thing else I could want is a random map generator, so that I could fight AI in a random map every single time, however I realize that would be a LOT of extra work for obvious reasons, so I am willing to give it a pass.So, are you ready to delve in overlord? Are you ready to crush your enemies under your book and slaughter your enemies. Well then overlord, buy this game!Edit: Playing some of the maps can be difficult. Normally the game works great, that is until an hour or two passes when yourve expanded your main base, unlocked more spaces to your dungeon, and added new rooms. This causes several dozen units to move around simutaniously and it really slows the game down. It gets to the point that on most scenario maps, I cant play anymore after 2-3 hours because when anything happens the game drops to less than 10 frames a second, making fights annoying, and making possessing a troop impossible.

												Do you like being evil? This is a RTS that was fashioned after the ""Dungeon Master"" series, and it does very very good job at it. The battles feel a little wonkey as it is hard to understand who is losing and who is winning when you are litterally staring at 150-200 minions, but I digress as it is my only ♥♥♥♥♥ about the game. I am writing this after completeing both campaigns (normal and Heart of Gold) and the game was a blast. I remember the last map of heart of gold I needed to trap my hero as he kept finding a way to kill himself when wondering into the enemy base with no prior instructions to. Pros:Pretty FunBe EvilSmack minions to make them quicker, some times its just fun to smack the succubi (they love it)Not to taxing on your GPU, it ran well on my nvidia580mFunny Dialogue the first timeCons:Some wonky Critter HP gaugesDialogue is repeated and after hearing it 20 times it becomes not so funny.Not enough levels/or campaignsTLDR: Fun, Evil, and will probably play on a toaster. A good RTS for those who loved dungeon keeper or those who think being the evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is awesome.			"

												If you loved Dungeon Keeper, then you will love this game. War for the Overworld is very similar to Dungeon Keeper that takes the very best aspects of the game. I played this game for hours and it kept me entertained. The challenge of the game varied from level to level, some seeming impossible to beat at times but this is the games way of forcing the player to try different strategies in order to win. I did observe a glitch on world twelve where for whatever reason even though I beat the three opponents it didn't register so I played for way longer then I should have before quitting. When I came back the next day to try again or restart the level, it triggered a win and the level finally ended. I hope that they release a sequel because this game is worth it.			"

												I really was hoping for a game just like the original Dungeon Keeper series and boy did this company deliver! I have played several Dungeon Keeper type games since the original and none of them felt quite right until I found War for the Overworld. This is seriously one of the best indie games out there! I cannot recommend it enough!			"

												It is a great game with a dungeon keeper feel. It is somewhat easy towards the beginning, then gets incredibly hard, then goes back to easy for the final mission. My chief complaint is the level design didn't feel creative. Most levels play the same way. Which is not bad, but some variety would have been nice. For instance, we have a possess creature spell, why not make a level where we have to use that spell continually to win? That said, this still a good game, and worth buying.			"

												Despite being a massive fan of the original Dungeon Keeper games, I decided to hold off on buying this game at release because of the mixed reviews it was getting, saying that it still wasn't finished etc. but eventually I gave in a bought the game a little while after Heart of Gold was released, and all I can say is that this is definately the spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper that I have always asked for.A lot of the the early problems that I saw have been fixed for the most part and there's is now plenty of content that has been added to the game to keep you coming back, and it suits all of the play styles. You have the main campaign which despite being relatively short, is good at introducing the new features of the games such as Sins, Beasts and Potions and such, and there are plenty of side objectives you can go through for repeat playthroughs to keep you going, same goes for the Heart of Gold campaign, which improves in a lot of ways on the original campaign.There are also the other game modes including Crucible, a survival styled mode where you have to fight against oncoming hoards of enemies. Skirmish for playing online and against AI. Sandbox for just having the freedom of building your dungeon. Also the recently added My Pet Dungeon mode which had taken the elements from the original Dungeon Keeper 2 game, and improved upon it by adding basically a small campaign with multiple maps and objectives to complete at your own time.Though this wouldn't go without a few faults with the game I feel there still are, though recently improved upon, I still find the possesion to be a little finicky when it comes to attacking enemies. Also there is a little bit of a lack of variety when it comes to creatures for your dungeon, but Crucible did help this by adding new varieties, and you can also convert a lot of the enemy hero units. Overall I'd say if you were a fan of the original game give this game a go, and even if you're interested in the genre try it out. Though it may not be for everyone I still had a great time and couldn't reccomend it more.			"

												Dungeon Keeper 2. The game that captivated the attention of many a gamer and left a solid mark in their minds for all eternity. It was a game that left a monument difficult to match - with a fun campaign, great pacing and truck loads of charm. With its sequel cancelled and EA hogging the rights, people waited and waited for a spiritual successor.So in came War for the Overworld. A game promising to be Dungeon Keeper without being Dungeon keeper. You've got your rooms, your dungeon heart, your minions, your imps... everything is there. Traps, doors, spells, gold... and a deviously evil yet satisfyingly supportive advisor. The charm is there. The atmosphere is there... but one can't help but feel like... something is missing.Gameplay just seems... lacking. The pacing feels all... wrong. The campaign feels a little offly-paced and building up your own dungeon feels... a little unsatisfying. Minions seem less... personal than in Dungeon Keeper as well. You don't get the 'oh look, there's one of my goblins having a good time with a rogue!' feeling you get with DK2... nor do you have the urge to take control of one of your favourite minions to do scouting, fighting or just exploring your dungeon. Your troops feel more like... insignificant insects. Foot-soldiers.So just what is missing? The game has the content. It has the charm. It has the atmosphere... but it just doesn't have the soul. And until it captures that soul... I dunno... I just don't feel satisfaction from playing...I'm going to have to thumb this one down, as much as I really don't want want to. Because it's a game that has huge potential.			"

												As much as I looked forward to this game for ages, and would like nothing more than to give this a positive review...I can't.It's just a hollow shadow of what Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2 were.  There's no character to it.  No real in-depth anything.  In DK2, I felt like I knew each and every one of my minions during a mission.  Felt like each one was their own unique person and I knew all their strengths and weaknesses.  In this...I just chop out large rooms, slap down stuff, and drop a battle-flag on the enemy room until it dies.  I could just tab out and win doing that.  There's no real strategy.  ""Build a bunch of traps, then drop a flag down and wait"".  This is not fun.  This is tedious, boring and disapointing.   DK2 had style.  I can still remember certain key missions that were just so memorable because of how amazing they were.  Like the one where you use the hidden doors to slowly take over a hero fortress from within.  This game...all of the maps are the same thing over and over.  ""Get a bunch of faceless minions (doesn't really matter which ones, just get a bunch!) and drop a flag where you want things to die, then surf the internet on your phone until you win.  The only memorable map so far I've had so far was memorable because of how stupid the gimmick was.  You don't get to build a dungeon (which is what the whole damn game should be about...).  You get 4 necromancers AND JUST LEAD THEM AROUND THE MAP WITH ♥♥♥♥ING FLAGS UNTIL EVERYTHING DIES!  There's no skill, there's no difficulty.  Just a long tedious slog through the map until you have enough skeletons with them to swarm the end room.  Tonnes of gimmicky unbreakable doors to make it so you have to literally slog all the way around the map all over the place, and all it does is stretch out the time it takes to finish, and not for any good reason.  I'm going to go play DK2 again.  Horny's calling.			"

												Its glitchy, its buggy, and even at the lowest graphic settings, the frame rates chugs along like a steam boat. Not uncommon for the game to freeze for a few seconds after you click and drag to mine or build a new room, which given its Dungeon management play style, gameplay is OH so enjoyable. Also, spells crash the game. Never been able to cast one. Every time I select a spell and cast, the game freezes. And then crashes. Whatever 'update' you had me download, it messed up an already buggy game. Its somehow worse in full release than it was in early access. Save yourself the trouble and get Dungeon Keeper 2 off GOG or something.			"

												TL;DR version:I can not reccomend the game, even tho it is the closest you will get to a Dungeon Keeper sequel. The stuff that made DK fun just is not done right. It simply is no fun.This feedback is not about bugs. Devs are doing an awesome job at fixing everything up. And if you read this review most of them will most likely be fixed already. Really they are pushing patches daily.I also won't go into detail about what i like or love about the game, because that does not help much. What i want to do here is go into detail about what i DON'T like. You can judge for yourself if these issues actually affect you. If not: BUY IT.Game paceThe campain missions feel like a constant rush.Waves after wave clashing at your walls, timer that have to be met ect. This is no fun for me. It sure makes sense for a mission or two, but it sure feels like every mission is like this.To explain my feelings a bit easier: After a mission i want to log OUT and not play another one, due to feeling stressed.Number of features - too many? Another strage feeling i get is the feeling of having to deal with way too many features.They all feel so unrewarding that i more often then not choose to not use them at all. Spells, Potions, Rituals, Research,... special stuff to build like walls or bombs ect.Combined with the game pace that makes me rush and stressed i don't like to be bothered with so many options. Strange indeed, because i always think more is better. This is the first game that makes me want LESS. I guess both issues combined are the actuall problem. Id love to get to know each feature and USE it, EXPLORE possibilities. But missions rush by so fast that i just don't bother.Tooltips and general lack of informationsNot knowing how your dungeon actually works is annoying. Simple as that. Bigger rooms? What do they do? You don't know, you can only guess. In a dungeon management game it is strange to not know what will happen if i do x, or go for y.How do i sum up my feelings as a player?I simply expected to have more fun. But i don't have fun (at least not much). It is hard to describe why and obviously ""fun"" is a very personal feeling. I replayed DK2 just now and have to admit: I have played MORE hours of DK2 since this game released then i played this game. It makes me want to play the ""real deal"". I also seem to use the word ""strange"" a lot to describe this game. That is because it gives me all sorts of strange feelings that i can not really explain. I expected a dungeon management game. I feel like i got a game that puts me under pressure to rush while giving me dozens of features that are not explained and / or don't feel worthwhile or rewarding. How do i sum up my feelins as a developer myself?This is actually easier to do. I know the feeling of being able to put in features, just because i can. But more is not always better. And i am quite sure this is what happened here. MP being the biggest problem / time waster (i still don't think the time investment is worth it for the general DK player / fan). So many features, without enough testing if they actually provide value and fun to the gamer.They should have put up the campain in early access. Let the people test how all the little gears work together. I am sure they would have gathered much valuable feedback and maybe shifted ressources in a more rewarding direction.It is actually sad to see to be honest. I see a team of VERY dedicated people that love a game and want to ressourcet it. You where on track but seem to have lost that track and got lost in the endless possibilities you have as a developer. They lost the view of what is FUN just to implement everything that is POSSIBLE. So no, i can not reccoment the game to a DK2 fan. Even tho it is the best current alternative, but it still fails to deliver on the aspects that made Dungeon Keeper fun.			"

												Named after what should have been Dungeon Keeper 3, this spiritual successor is everything one could ever want from a dungeon management game. You will be right at home if you ever played Dungeon Keeper 1 & 2 and / or Evil Genius.This game also has the approval of both EA Games and Peter Molyneux, the original creator of the Dungeon Keeper games and many others back in the day when Bullfrog was still alive and kicking.

												*EDITED* 15/9-2015I still really want to love this game because of what it wants to achieve, but instead i find myself in an unhealthy and abusive relationship with a game that constantly rapes my hopes and dreams. I start it up every now and then and try my best to find the spirit of the dungeon keeper series but it simply isn't there. The campaign seems like something that the developers just wanted done quickly. Every level is about rushing. There's no planning, no lovingly construction of your dungeon, no clever use of traps or spells. Only; get creatures -> plant rally flag -> win level -> repeat. And it really sucks because of all the other work the developers has put in this game. It overflows with GREAT ideas, AWESOME effects and simply a cornucopia of tools that beckons your inner evil overlord to come out and play. BUT HE IS BLUEBALLED EVERYTIME BY THAT FEKKIN RUSH MENTALITY!!!!As a bonus, your ""home realm"" in the campaing still suffers from a bug that teleports your creatures to the bottom left corner of the map, making them unable to be picked up, and makes the level inacessible when you try to re enter the level.___________________________________________________________________________________*Old review*To many bugs, i am currently unable to complete lvl 4 due to the game CONSTANTLY crashing and making savegames corrupted...I backed this game in the very early bedrock beta. Loved the ideas it had. Loved the potential. And in all fairness, the developers did a great job to carry on the spirit of the GREAT dungeon keeper. HOWEVER!!!!! Why on EARTH! would you leave the level design to a guy with utter and complete claustrophobia!? The levels does in NO way encourage dungeon building as much as it promotes a kind of shabby colony expansion on islands where every ""room"" (if you will waver your every definition of what constitutes a room) has its location and usefulness pre deciced FOR you by the shear lack of land to develop on.Furthermore...whats the use for reinforced walls in your dungeon when a normal dwarf can plow through it in seconds with NO way to save it...I would love to see this game ressurect my favourite game of all time, but first the game has to be playable...

												What to say about this one? well I can't really say I was too disappointed by this game because it is the true Dungeon Keeper successor and I was never able to play that game due to it being too old and too finicky with modern systems to get running but I really wasn’t impressed by anything in this game either. It has good intentions but it's really not all that interesting, even going along the campaign and unlocking new abilities, traps and room types the game never got more exciting than the 'oh yay new dungeon management game, im sure this will be good!' thrill at the start.Here are categories on why I was barely able to enjoy the game:Storyline: 3/10What storyline? It's so bland and forgettable I'm pretty sure it's there so the devs could say 'we made a storyline!'. I can sum it in afew sentences. Your evil and stuff, you get betrayed by alot of other evil people you have kill on the way to the top, once you kill all forces of good and become the most evil dungeon lord you get betrayed in a very obvious way you could have predicted way ahead of time and poof game done, yep… seat clenching. It is a shame because surely someone can think of a neat storyline for an evil dungeon lord coming from the bottom all the way to the top of the world? Even if it was taken non seriously like a joke, “They made fun of your really cool hat, knocked over your letter box and keep killing your zombie collection for fun, they must pay!” might have been better. Meh, not a big gripe for a game like this but it never really feels like I have any incentive to killing all these 'good' characters and ruining their world other then, your bad mkay? kill stuff cas the game gives you no other options, ugh. What did they look at me wrong? call my mum a bad name? Not put the toilet seat down?! Why do I hate them to the point of torturing them!? The game never explains that, if it even could, it's not very fulfilling at all and it just made me want to end the game as quick as possible.Campaign: 4/10It took me barely 8 to 10 hours to get done, not alot of depth, not alot variety, a very linear experience from one click spot to the next, I don't know what more to say about this that wouldn’t repeat the storyline section, with no engaging storyline to follow the campaign felt pretty bland and meaningless. I was only doing it to get my monies worth out of the game about half way in and it just left me so unsatisfied at the end I ditched the game right after finishing it and never plan to come back to that waste of time and effort. If you’re looking for an amazing single player experience in this I’m sorry look somewhere else...Graphics and Visuals: 3/10Oh boy is this a major gripe. This must have been made on an old Unity engine cas as far as advancing gaming graphics goes it looks terribad, and I really wish I was exaggerating. Great models and textures but not the right game engine to show them off in! Even the lighting in this is nothing special, there is no real visual evidence that your dungeon is as evil ,dark and monster filled underground hell as it is supposed to be, I was never really fully immersed by it and that's such a disappointment. Oh yea and don't even get me started on the joke of an anti-aliasing option... it's either have sharp visuals with jaggies for days or mega FXAA that blurs the whole game to such a degree you can barely make out the details of a single object or texture *shudders*. Just, no, if you appreciate graphics like me you will have a depressing time here, again all this is to blame for the crappy Unity engine they chose.Performance: 2/10Performance, oh boy! You can imagine a game that's not open world with not much going on and poor visual fidelity will run great right? Well no, not at all, no hopes, again the Unity engine strikes to make this game run dreadfully on my gtx980 with 16gbs of RAM semi top of the range rig. On the last few missions my frame rate got down to a solid 12! I crap you not, 12!! If I was lucky I got 17 fps. With no optimization to be heard of this game will run like the alternative name for a donkey as soon as your dungeon gets to any decent size. I could have turned down the graphics maybe, but it already looked bad enough with no blurry AA on I didn't dare try, and on a gtx 980 why the heck should I have to?! Top of the line graphics cards aren't cheap for a reason right?Variety: 7/10Moving off the biggest gripes, the variety is pretty good, a large range of different room types which also equal a different minion type for most of them, spells, traps, side powers you can call on to help you out abit and even little ease of life constructs. The enemy sends you a decent variety of enemies to annihilate and you even fight other underlords at afew points, this is all great, if it weren't for the insanely boring combat that you have to endure with to progress...Combat: 3/10About all you can do is possession control a minion for some FPS interesting involvement but that gets boring quick due to a single minion never being able to make that much difference even while played by you. The only other thing you can do to help combat is the healing and rage spells and zapping enemies with lightning if they go on any of your territory and slip by, other than that it's just misc helpful spells to run the dungeon and spamming the attack banner around so your stupid minions actually move and attack everything else, nothing goes much deeper than that. Maybe I wasn’t being creative or was missing something? But I doubt it because I tried everything I was given, waiting for a crud ton of minions to spam then just blob charging them at the enemy was the only thing that seemed to work so I went with it for the whole campaign, not very engaging. =/CONCLUSION: Total 4/10I guess after all that the only final conclusion can be... don't waste your time and effort on this, really just don't. This is quite frankly the most boring dungeon management game I’ve played so far, it does nothing new from Dungeon 1, Dungeon 2 and Impire, I can actually say that Dungeon 2 is more fun purely because of interesting mechanics and a playable dungeon lord that always gives you something to do! This game however will consistently show you how bland an unengaging, unsatisfying management game can be. Other than building 5x5 basic 'blocked' rooms and doing some spells and building traps I never really felt like I had any reason to be in this game 'helping'. A disappointing shame but it happens, bad engine and not enough thought and depth put in by the devs. Even the management in Overlord 2 was cooler lol, the minions in that game had personality and where so loveably evil and fun.Buy this when it's majorly on sale if you really want or find something else because this really is a hit and miss for me and mind you I have played every dungeon management game I have found so far so hopefully everything I said holds enough water for you to believe me, because this review is in -your- interests.Thanks for reading, game smart, game on.

												Although the concept for this game is brilliant and the writing is suprising good the unfathomable nuber of glitches, bugs and stupid AI mistakes make this game nearly intorreable. If this game ever fixes at least most of is bugs, then it would be a denfinite recommend. But since the devs have clearly over complicated their own code, I doubt such a time will ever come.If you must own it (I mean, nostalgia overload), wait for it to be at least 40% off. It's way to broken for full price, even though early acesse is done.			"

												I think i have had enough of these games about being a dungeon master, i think i should just find another genre i can waste money on instead.And rember kids, always pre-purchase in the alpha to get the dlc extra of a single different skin to your character that will be out modded when the 2nd dlc arrives, and then 3rd, 4th, by the time the 5th comes around the cow will be milked to death.

												This game should not be ""released"". It's far from complete and doesn't deserve to be released, looks like a desperate cash-grab as i'm guessing sales have dulled off.Hopefully the developer doesn't abandon it before it's actually usable.Get KeeperFX and DK1 instead. It's less buggy.			"

												Plain and simple reason as to why you shouldn't play this game is that it isn't really finished. Minimap is useless. Constantly spams the units are under attack message. Countless bugs, (like minions never attacking). Difficulty spikes. The difficulty of each level in the campaign is either far too easy to be fun or borderline impossible to achieve. Torture chambers do not work. Certain rooms don't seem to function properly (beast lairs sometimes don't spawn monsters)Enemy mobs seem to be either killed far too quickly (rendering them pointless), or are far too powerful (making them frustrating to fight). The balence never seems to be fun. Games options menu is useless. Game performs poorly even when set to minimum graphics settings on a pc that really should be able to handle it. If you, like me, are stupid enough to buy this game in it's current state, then you are in for a massive let down. Give your money to a game developer who actually deserves it by not releasing unfinished games.			"

												What to say about this one? well I can't really say I was too disappointed by this game because it is the true Dungeon Keeper successor and I was never able to play that game due to it being too old and too finicky with modern systems to get running but I really wasn’t impressed by anything in this game either. It has good intentions but it's really not all that interesting, even going along the campaign and unlocking new abilities, traps and room types the game never got more exciting than the 'oh yay new dungeon management game, im sure this will be good!' thrill at the start.Here are categories on why I was barely able to enjoy the game:Storyline: 3/10What storyline? It's so bland and forgettable I'm pretty sure it's there so the devs could say 'we made a storyline!'. I can sum it in afew sentences. Your evil and stuff, you get betrayed by alot of other evil people you have kill on the way to the top, once you kill all forces of good and become the most evil dungeon lord you get betrayed in a very obvious way you could have predicted way ahead of time and poof game done, yep… seat clenching. It is a shame because surely someone can think of a neat storyline for an evil dungeon lord coming from the bottom all the way to the top of the world? Even if it was taken non seriously like a joke, “They made fun of your really cool hat, knocked over your letter box and keep killing your zombie collection for fun, they must pay!” might have been better. Meh, not a big gripe for a game like this but it never really feels like I have any incentive to killing all these 'good' characters and ruining their world other then, your bad mkay? kill stuff cas the game gives you no other options, ugh. What did they look at me wrong? call my mum a bad name? Not put the toilet seat down?! Why do I hate them to the point of torturing them!? The game never explains that, if it even could, it's not very fulfilling at all and it just made me want to end the game as quick as possible.Campaign: 4/10It took me barely 8 to 10 hours to get done, not alot of depth, not alot variety, a very linear experience from one click spot to the next, I don't know what more to say about this that wouldn’t repeat the storyline section, with no engaging storyline to follow the campaign felt pretty bland and meaningless. I was only doing it to get my monies worth out of the game about half way in and it just left me so unsatisfied at the end I ditched the game right after finishing it and never plan to come back to that waste of time and effort. If you’re looking for an amazing single player experience in this I’m sorry look somewhere else...Graphics and Visuals: 3/10Oh boy is this a major gripe. This must have been made on an old Unity engine cas as far as advancing gaming graphics goes it looks terribad, and I really wish I was exaggerating. Great models and textures but not the right game engine to show them off in! Even the lighting in this is nothing special, there is no real visual evidence that your dungeon is as evil ,dark and monster filled underground hell as it is supposed to be, I was never really fully immersed by it and that's such a disappointment. Oh yea and don't even get me started on the joke of an anti-aliasing option... it's either have sharp visuals with jaggies for days or mega FXAA that blurs the whole game to such a degree you can barely make out the details of a single object or texture *shudders*. Just, no, if you appreciate graphics like me you will have a depressing time here, again all this is to blame for the crappy Unity engine they chose.Performance: 2/10Performance, oh boy! You can imagine a game that's not open world with not much going on and poor visual fidelity will run great right? Well no, not at all, no hopes, again the Unity engine strikes to make this game run dreadfully on my gtx980 with 16gbs of RAM semi top of the range rig. On the last few missions my frame rate got down to a solid 12! I crap you not, 12!! If I was lucky I got 17 fps. With no optimization to be heard of this game will run like the alternative name for a donkey as soon as your dungeon gets to any decent size. I could have turned down the graphics maybe, but it already looked bad enough with no blurry AA on I didn't dare try, and on a gtx 980 why the heck should I have to?! Top of the line graphics cards aren't cheap for a reason right?Variety: 7/10Moving off the biggest gripes, the variety is pretty good, a large range of different room types which also equal a different minion type for most of them, spells, traps, side powers you can call on to help you out abit and even little ease of life constructs. The enemy sends you a decent variety of enemies to annihilate and you even fight other underlords at afew points, this is all great, if it weren't for the insanely boring combat that you have to endure with to progress...Combat: 3/10About all you can do is possession control a minion for some FPS interesting involvement but that gets boring quick due to a single minion never being able to make that much difference even while played by you. The only other thing you can do to help combat is the healing and rage spells and zapping enemies with lightning if they go on any of your territory and slip by, other than that it's just misc helpful spells to run the dungeon and spamming the attack banner around so your stupid minions actually move and attack everything else, nothing goes much deeper than that. Maybe I wasn’t being creative or was missing something? But I doubt it because I tried everything I was given, waiting for a crud ton of minions to spam then just blob charging them at the enemy was the only thing that seemed to work so I went with it for the whole campaign, not very engaging. =/CONCLUSION: Total 4/10I guess after all that the only final conclusion can be... don't waste your time and effort on this, really just don't. This is quite frankly the most boring dungeon management game I’ve played so far, it does nothing new from Dungeon 1, Dungeon 2 and Impire, I can actually say that Dungeon 2 is more fun purely because of interesting mechanics and a playable dungeon lord that always gives you something to do! This game however will consistently show you how bland an unengaging, unsatisfying management game can be. Other than building 5x5 basic 'blocked' rooms and doing some spells and building traps I never really felt like I had any reason to be in this game 'helping'. A disappointing shame but it happens, bad engine and not enough thought and depth put in by the devs. Even the management in Overlord 2 was cooler lol, the minions in that game had personality and where so loveably evil and fun.Buy this when it's majorly on sale if you really want or find something else because this really is a hit and miss for me and mind you I have played every dungeon management game I have found so far so hopefully everything I said holds enough water for you to believe me, because this review is in -your- interests.Thanks for reading, game smart, game on.

Also a huge memory leak issue makes the game unplayable if you play for too long.The game itself is exactly like Dungeon Keeper, which is good since the official Dungeon Keeper became complete crap on mobile.I had lots of fun playing, and will change the review if the bugs are fixed.

Early Access Review
								Have not played much yet, found that it is indeed a good rendition of dungeon keeper, but the controls are clunky and played on high rez had me squinting to see any of the descriptions.  I loved dungeon keeper, this is not as polished as the first one, where creature management was easy.  Also no hot keys to get back to your dungeons various parts.			"

												If you like dungeon keeper then this game definately feels very close it. The developers did a great job of capturing some of the dungeon keeper nostalgic feeling. I cannot recommend this game to just anybody though. It is pretty difficult even to a DK veteran. The a.i. cheats ridiculously, by sending massive armies of high level creatures to slaughter yours and you wonder how the hell did he get so much level ten everything so quickly. the only way to have a chance at winning is to dig straight to the unlimited gold vein (assuming you know where it is) and attack him constantly so that he never gets a foot hold. If this sounds like a fun gameplay style to you then you will have fun. If you wanna win by superior dungeon design then I dont know what to tell you... I havent found a way to do that yet. I cant say I am disappointed because, well, It's not dungeon keeper. It does try very hard to be and comes pretty close, but a lot of the dungeon building elements are ruined by the playstyle required to hold your own			"

												This game is everything fans of Dungeon Keeper series ever wanted for/as sequel.Team that made it putted everything that DK has, But they made a grievous mistake - they didn't do anything to improve performance issues. SO if u don't have a new good computer a game-play will look like this  - Wait for 5 minutes to enter game, then when u start campaign and u are in game, if u want to go to in-game menu - for example save the current procces, u have to wait again 5 minutes for it to pop up then the same amount to go back to game-play. So i cant recommend it to anybody who don't have good computer. Sooo Saaad.....			"

												Kudos for remaking Dungeon Keeper. It was really time for a new game using this brilliant game principles. The Kickstarter campaign made clear, that there is a huge demand for this kind of game. WftO has two problems though: abysmal QA and completely missing the pace, that made DK great:Updates tend to break the game, make certain levels unplayable because no one seems to test how an ""rebalancing"" idea they implement actually fits into the single player campaign. I don't know if they don't test at all, are only interested in multiplayer game or someone who already mastered the game tries it out briefly. But when you are new to this game and think about investing money into this: Don't! You are not their target audience. They are themselves their only target audience. This would fit to an free, open source game, but not to a product that sells for money.DK had a brilliant feature, that made this whole ""evil overlord"" concept possible: you could play at your own pace. You could play aggresively with early attacks, before the enemy builds his base, or you could fortify, build up everything and flood the enemy with your über-army. You could be as unfair as you wanted to be. I agree that this is very hard to implement, but WftO fails miserably. It dictates the pace all the time: Timers don't give you time to build up your dungeon, Enemy attacks disrupt you all the time. There is either an oversupply or far to little gold. It treats you like a kid with a short attention span, constantly forgetting what your task was. And in doing so it just expects a certain playing style. It's not hard to play a level: it's hard to find out, how the developers expected you to solve the level, without giving you a chance to develop your own solution and this feels strange.Would be a good free game, doesn't feel like anything someone makes a living with.

												Have owned this game for 2 years, since beta. Once upon a time I was able to play a few parts of the campaign mode with several buggy glitches. Since then there has been multiple updates and even DLC's. Just thought I'd try to load it up since i've been waiting and waiting for it to be able to actually work, freezes directly after the first video on campaign mode. I've tried multiple fixes for this game, multiple settings, and a bunch of other methods weren't even suggested. I haven't the slightest clue why the game is rated so highly. This was supposed to be an up to date Dungeon Keeper style game I got for me and my fiance to play. It's more like a waste of a space on my machine. 0/10 would not recommend.			"

												I was unable to go beyond the fourth campaign level as the game crashes at the same point every time, just as i destroy the enemy keepers heart. As your goal is to destroy what he is guarding i tried fixing it by lining it up so that i would blow up the wall needed to win the game right after destroying his heart, but the wall bomb was bugged and unable to be placed, even though i had taken over the tiles where i wanted to place it.Other bugs:When you want to load a game it ""resets"" the campaign progress so that the narrator starts over and visual bugs appear as the game wants you to do things that are already done.The imp flag to make your imps attracted towards it is again a nice mechanic, however i was unable to actually place the flag on the map, regardless if i owned the territory.If you start dragging out spacing to place a room, but regret it foces you to build a 1x1 tile, not being able to right click and regret placement.Besides that there is a few suggestions to making a better game overall.The flags you can put down to attract minions is a good mechanic, you would expect this would make the monsters ""attack move"" in starcraft fashion towards the flag, but instead it sort of makes the monsters sometimes ignore enemies and incomming damage to walk towards the flag.The imp flag to make imps not take over the territory is also smart as you can stop your imps from suiciding and going places you don't want them to, but it makes them not take over an area around the flag and so the imps will walk by it and still suicide. The map  is confusing compared to DK1. There is no option to size up the map and unlike DK1, there is no flashing on the map to indicate where you barracks and etc is placed. It also resets your camera angle when you want to jump somewhere on the map. This is made worse by allowing little space for constructing rooms and forcing, atleast in the early campaign levels, you to divide your dungeon onto little places. The rooms themselves seem to be disfunctional unless placed 3x3 tiles which punishes this.These are just some random things i wrote down, i waited to buy into the game until release hoping to avoid these sort of problems, but apparently not so. Let's just hope the developers haven't be satisfied with the money already made by early access and kickstarter campaign as it has potential, but still needs a lot of work. Be aware that if you buy this game it is about as functional as you would expect an early beta to be. I waited to post this until i had given that campaign level another few more tries.			"

												While War for the Overworld does a GREAT job in giving that nostalgic feeling of dungeon ke....I mean a dungeon game it is FAR from finished and should not be out of beta yet and here's why:- Basic assets are missing, 25-50% of monsterportraits show some form of ""info missing"" message meaning either poor packaging of assets or nonexistance- Wall'Hack' : minions, mainly monsters often glitch through doors and portcullises- Memory loss: this might just me my lowgrade pc, but some missions literally slowed down to 1 frame per several seconds- worker glitching: Regularly workers glitch in and out of objects placed and built indefinitely- Campaign missions have timers etc. but despite this still wave enemies in during wait times- The crypt mission bugged out so the necromancers stopped summoning corpses after defeating the big healer boss- If you have more minion types than your bar supports? bad luck brian, because thats all you'll see for direct controll- During mission 2 the helper says to place something so your workers dont run into the enemy camps, I still havent found out what since theres nothing on the HUD for that- Skirmish bots so far just die randomly. When I view their dungeon heart for example they die.What I missed:- label things with hotkeys so not everything has to be moused and label them so when you mouse-over you see the hotkey bound to it, really miss that feature.- Stats or anything describing the monster types to me in close up.- a sence of management issues like hungry or grumpy minions etc. They always seem content.- better timing of events in missions, while they seem fun if done right, most missions are either an unclear race or a slow grind.- no real use for alot of the spells and rituals etc. because the mana is simply better spent on healing and lighting most of the timeWhat i Loved;Dont get me wrong they are definately in the right direction- Kewl new monsters taking new roles while giving all the old roles their new counterpart for us nostalgia freaks- Good amount of chambers and monster types- Good narration and feel- Lovely soundeffects and ambianceI hope they work at it some more so they can polish my issues away. If so I might re-review, untill then I'd say don't buy it, unless you want to support the folks making this seeing its indie and all that.			"

												I'm enoying the game and yes there maybe some issues but it's not un-playable.  It's given me 2 - maybe 3 hours? of fun already.  I started it earlier for about 30 minutes and steamed through level 1 and started 2 before I went for dinner tonight.  Came back on about 4 hours later and the DEVS had already released patches for known issues they have encountered.  Some may see this as a negative but if they are patching quickly, listening to the forum and answering promptly I can only applaud them and back them by writing this positive review.The Games State:-It is no where near un-playable as some fickle people are suggesting.  It is entirely playable.Yes the mini map is frustrating with the locater beacon not being great but the maps are quite small so it shouldn't take you long to figure out where your getting attacked.  I'm sure the mini map fix will be released within the next day or so, no biggy from my point of view.I'm pleased I bought the game as it makes a nice change from the norm.  Good Game so far, well done to the DEVS for the quick patches.			"

												I loved the original Dungeon Keeper and its sequel. Although they had a few problems they were always smooth and fun to play. This game has been announced as released but is clearly still a beta, it is clunky and has many problems including frame lag and long hangs particularly when you complete a campaign. Despite all the bugs it still very much like Dungeon Keeper 2 and a very good up to date knock-off with nice graphics.I have enjoyed playing this and hope it will be finished and polished.Until then I cannot fully recommend it and have told my friends I will let them know if it is ever ""finished"".

												Never should have left early access/alpha. Frankly, the game is a mess and the further you dig into it the more that mess reveals itself. I can't finish a level without the darn thing freezing up.Also a lot of the additions to what is basically a remake of Dungeon Keeper 2 don't hold up. I don't know why I need to have to manage spells, rituals, constructs, potions, artifacts...the list goes on. There's just too much bloat; I don't think it will ever be a very good game. I'm still drawn to it because it's the closest we're gonna get to DK3 but the designers should have put more thought into how much these fiddly bits impact the game experience, and they should have squashed a few hundred more bugs before they pushed this out as a release game. War for the Overworld is the perfect example of what's wrong with Steam right now: supposedly a love letter to a lost genre, but with nothing of value to actually add to that conversation...and a willigness to fleece people with an unfinished game. Avoid.			"

												The game is very rough around the edges simply because developers were running out of money. Polishing a game isn't for free so it could only be released and polished with the revenue.That said I recommend the purchase. It isn't massively fun yet due to the rough edges but clearly it captured the Dungeon Keeper spirit perfectly and added innovative ideas to the genrePurchase, wait a month or two, enjoy.			"

												I have waited a very long time for a new Dungeon Keeper game. A game that I did not ever get. I was so happy to see the video of Dungeon Keeper 3 in the copy of DK2 I had. I waited and waited and it never came. So I came to terms with that I would never play a game that awesome ever again. Then one day, I came across this game. I was in shock and awe. I couldn't believe it, a spiritural successor to Dungeon Keeper. I know I had the time to play the Beta but I never got it because I wanted to wait. I wanted to experience this game in full when it was done. So I avoided buying the beta and I did my best to avoid any news about the charcters in the game because I wanted to be surprised by it. I just got it a couple of hours ago and I am beyond happy with this game. This IS Dungeon Keeper. The narrator, the ability to slap your minioins. Everything about it screams Dungeon Keeper. I love every second of this game. I need to put more hours into it when I get some free time but you better believe I am going to play this game until my hands fall off. Even then I will play this game with my feet. I am happy that I waited on this game and I am happy with the results. The game has that dark humor like good old Dungeon Keeper. It has everything that I  loved about DK and I am beyond thrilled that it is this awesome. If you loved Dungeon Keeper in the past buy this game. If you've never played DK this is a good game to start off. The only thing I can say about this game is remotely bad is thatt I want more. More of everything. That isn't the creators fault, its just my lust for this game.  I wish I could meet the developers and throw my money at them in real life. Thank you creators. Thank you for picking up a game style that hasn't been really played in a long time.			"

												I struggled to decide whether or not I would recommend this game.The problem I have with this game is that it tries so hard to be a successor to the Dungeon Keeper legacy.  In some respects, it succeeds.  For example, the gameplay itself is very much like (and somewhat better than) Dungeon Keeper 2.However, this game fails in a few important ways:1.) The levels themselves feel like watered down versions of their Dungeon Keeper equivalents.2.) The mentor equivalent in War For The Overworld sounds like the mentor in the Dungeon Keeper games (actually, IIRC, it's the same voice actor), but the lines delivered in War For The Overworld are nowhere near as witty and sarcastic as the lines delivered in the Dungeon Keeper games[dungeonkeeper.wikia.com].3.) When I last played the game (in September, I think), it still had its fair share of bugs.6/10.			"

												I've been waiting for this came for a long time, I even sat steady and waited after the terrible reviews of the early access to ensure my experience would be untainted, and it is safe to say I am massively disapointed in this game. I've put in 11 hours and I can't be bothered to finish the thing. The AI is terrible, the game is boring, the lag is painful (even when you put it to the lowest texture and pixel settings). As a lover of the first DK and a player of the second I want to make it clear that my thoughts on this game, are written in the absract, I didn't get this game out of nostalgia, I bought it because I thought it might actually be good. Also - nice try on the comedy aspect with your narrator - but after a while it gets stale and then just irritating. Honestly I'd struggle to pick something positive to say, because all the positive things about this game are just OK, their not great or even good - just OK. I just didn't have fun.Honestly I'd like my money back. "

												Thats it... I have officially had enough of this joke of an industry.I wont go into too much detail on the many problems this unfinished release has, as it is mentioned numerous times by others (tooltip problems, crap AI, game breaking crashes etc etc). In addition to all of this their latest update has now made the game run in a cinematic 3fps! I kickstarted this game, and I am now totally regreting that decision and this has now put me off kickstarter altogether. How many times do developers in this industry need to release buggy, unfinished, broken messes before they get the message that we are tired of this♥♥♥♥♥♥ No other industry would allow for companies to release products that dont work, with a ""Oh dont worry, we'll fix it later"" attitude. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to that. In that case why dont you refund me and you can ""get my money later, you know, when the product is actually done!""They have shot themselves in the foot with this. This is a long way off from being finished, and by the time all the issues are fixed, we would have all moved on. People have busy lives, and I for one don't appreciate my spare time being wasted with broken products that I have paid for. When you start charging for a product, you have responsiblilties to meet, and if you can't meet those then dont release the game until it is ready. But no, there is this inpatient greedy mentallity behind companies today where they want it out now, to get money asap, and it's us who ultimately pay the price by paying for broken games.This game ultimately has great potential and could have been the terrific dungeon keeper sequel we all wanted. But in the end, this works about as well as a bottomless bucket. So well done devs, you screwed it up. I am not going to waste any more of my time on this, and i am moving on to other things. If any of you are thinking of buying this game, don't. And if by some miracle this game has not fallen off everyones radar by the time it is in a working state, get it then.This downright sloppy, dishonest, greedy, and money grabbing practice needs to stop. Its crap like this that will ultimately lead to another video game crash, and maybe that is what needs to happen for all these devs to get the damn message. Disappointed and robbed.			"

												This is not a completed game. It has bugs ranging from subtitles not showing to the one time I was trapped looking at a minion because it spawned in (for the first time which triggers an explanation of the minion in question) and the explanation audio for the scene didn't load, which apparently stops the game from letting you do anything because even the usual skip button for this game (spacebar) didn't function. ""Display options"" has maybe a total of seven things that can affect framerate, if you count what size you want the game window to be and whether you want windowed or fullscreen (I don't) and three more are binary options (no I don't count ""force-enable"" as different than enable), the remaining two are ""pixel light count"" and ""texture resolution"" which you can bring down to a stunning eighth of the original value, which is higher than it needs to be for a game where I will spend the entire time zoomed out too far to notice any of the character models regardless. The sound options are between acceptable and as expected. The gameplay would be better if there weren't massive framerate drops every five minutes on the dot and if I didn't have 4 untouchable minion corpses and another four minions in the ""shadowlands,"" or rather innacessible in a corner of the map blocked off by bedrock (no way in, no way out.) Those are all my problems thus far, and they don't make the game *absolutely* unplayable, just very, very difficult to enjoy. This wasn't in early access when I bought it. I was promised a completed game, this isn't it.			"

												Don't buy it YET!!The game is fun, honestly fun. However, it is unplayable at the moment. The game keeps crashing on me. I crash twice within minutes on my first play and now it would crash within minutes of launching. I have not been able to play a full campaign because it will crash right before I win or kick me off right as the campaign starts. In skirmish mode I can't even get to the game before it kicks me off. I don't think it is my computer since it runs Farcry 4 and Skyrim (with dozens of mods) fine with no lags. But I lag like nobody's business. On the second campaign my game will freeze up 10 seconds when my minions engage the enemy. It's great when it works, but right now it just isn't working.			"

That mysterious thing ""fun"" got lost somewhere along the way.  It's a shame really because I think some fine tuning could really make this game a winner!Other than the mish-mash of elements that somehow don't work the graphics are not good.  The original game with far ""simpler"" graphics was actually much clearer.  With this reboot the background graphics are too detailed so the minions seem to get lost against them.  They don't stand out the way they should.Also the narrator is more annoying than funny.			"

												I bought into early access release of this game because I believed in the credibality of the developers promises. A month prior to the Dungeons 2 release this got released from early access due for what I believe to jump on the market. A terrible decision. I would rather this game spend as much time as needed in development like DayZ then be rushed out the door.I spend my hard earned money on early access games because I WANT to support the developers, because I believe in their dreams, and again I am let down. This time from a more trusted developer who I wanted to see succeed. Yet another harsh lesson that early access games are never worth it.If WFTO will be worth buying it isn't now, and not until it is the game it should be.Don't buy it, if you want a dungeon keeper-esq game, buy its competitor, Dungeons 2, which is a more complete game.

												So, I gotta say the devs really care about the game. Just see the low below :)Old review:Like Dungeon Keeper 2. Just a bad version of it.The game is still buggy as hell. Worst of all is the cursor, you just never know where exactly it is pointing. That is especially frustrating when trying to place prisoners in the torture chamber.Edit 29.07.:Hi, LeeFirst of all, cool that you guys took the effort of replying here. Never saw a dev do that before!I looked into what you told me and you're right. There is a light beam, I just never realized as it is very hard for me to see. So there is no real problem and sorry for claiming there would be one!The bug happened in the introductory level for the prisons (2nd level of the red circle to the right in campaign mode I think). I enlarged the captured prison and later tried to move prisoners from the second one (with the lvl10 bard) to another, which resulted in the new prisoner being killed. The same happened for me when I picked up the lvl10 bard and dropped him in the same prison again. All the other prisoners ganked up on the new guy and killed him for good. As I never did this in later levels, I tried that as well and it doesn't appear to be a problem there, so I don't know if that was a special problem or not.			"

												It's like a bag of really bland candy. Tasteless but you eat it anyways just cause you have it. It has none of the original Dungeon Keeper feel. It lacks both finesse and finish. If you expect to play Dungeon Keeper 3 - don't buy it. Replay Dungeon Keeper 1 and 2 instead. If you think it seems like a cool game, which I believe it could be with a few patches, the buy it and hope the devs won't give up on it.			"

												This game is a rehash of Dungeon Keeper 2, so if you enjoyed that game, you'll enjoy this.  The added systems of 'sins' and new rooms don't add a lot to the game so you might be better off just getting an old copy of DK2 and playing that.There are numerous bugs still present even after the enormous update that rolled out a few days ago.  For instance, I had to manually change the screen resolution within a text file because it was permanently set to 600x400 in game.  Also, most of my minions couldn't cross the bridge to fight the final boss.  Add in the very low framerate when you have more than 15-20 creatures on the same screen.The end of the game cliffhangs to get you to buy the expansion.  The whole game took about 8 hours to finish.  The skirmish mode, while complete, isn't really hours of fun.Really, just get Dungeon Keeper 2 online and save your $20.			"

												When this game was released, I had a great time playing it. It ran seamlessly on a fairly old computer, the graphics were brilliant, the characters entertaining, and I was really pleased with it overall. After the 1.6 patch, and the introduction of the 'My Pet Dungeon' expansion, as well as a new computer...invisible menus, in-game crashes, lots of instability, resulting in a lot of time wasted trying to find solutions to why it's just all gone♥♥♥♥♥♥up. I've found eventually a webpage link duried deep in the discussion boards that lists what looks like an hour or two testing and fixing this, that and the next thing, and the excuse given is that some part of the middle-ware seems to not work with some computers...and that's my spare time for a bit of gaming down the pan. Seems a crock to me. I paid full price for the game, which did work once upon a time, and now it's unplayable. I shouldn't have to be scratching my head and fixing errors. It should be in a playable state if you're charging money for it. That said, I was with card at the ready to buy this new expansion, but after this let down, I won't bother. You've already had enough money off me for a game that now doesn't run for me at all. In this state, I can't recommend it. I will say that it has enormous potential and needs the Dev's to fix it.

												What an utter disgrace of  a game! While it is in a keeping with the first two Dungeon Keeper games it is still uterly not in any shape ready for exiting Alpha/Beta. It is a crazy resource hogger, at over 8GB used in memory. Numerous design flaws, and bugs that make it impossible to play under harder difficulties where basic underlying logic of the game is needed to be working normally.Do Not Buy!!			"

												While it looks promising, the game is seriously buggy.  Memory usage can exceed 5.5 gigabytes on Win 7, which on some lesser machines will probably not even allow it to run.  A crash, while loading levels, also occurs, even if you have the memory to run the game.  The game hangs for agonizing seconds during combat, at times.  I cannot recommend this game, until they do some serious bug fixing and memory reduction to reasonable limits.			"

												You will probably like this game if...1. ... you like lots of bugs. Even if it's released it's no where finished.2. ... you don't like to build square like nice room, because it's impenetradable stones everywhere so your dungeon looks like crap.3. ... you prefer a rush game instead of where you manage a dungeon and can in calm plan and attack your enemy and build a nice dungeon.4. ... you like when enemy NPC spam your dungeon with lots of mobs. It looks the enemy lord have endless money and units.Is that fun? If you like these mechanism I recommend you to buy this game. It doesn't feel like a sequel to Dungeon Keeper 2.			"

												I've been a fan of Bullfrog's Dungeon Keeper games since the first one was released in 1997, and so, when I heard that a spiritual successor called War for the Overworld was in the works, my interest was piqued to say the least.  I followed the development of WftO during the past year or so, and when I saw its release date finally come around, I excitedly offered up my $26.99. After all, the hundreds of reviews for the game in early access were ""very positive.""  How could that many people be wrong?  Right?I've never been impressed with the concept of ""early access"" games.  If I wanted to pay for the privilege of using broken, buggy, unfinished software, I could just install and boot up Windows.  This is why I wait for official releases before I start playing any game.  I don't need the added frustration and tedium that early access games bring to my PC, so I respectfully abstain. Or at least that's what I thought before I bought War for the Overworld.When I first launched it, the game told me that it was version 1.0, the official release build, but damned if I can tell from how it plays.  And this game isn't easy to play, by the way.  As soon as I got to the third mission, the game's video began to freeze for what had to be ten to twenty seconds at a time - an unplayable mess. From what I read now, I'm not alone in this.  The mini map is completely useless, looking like some pixelated mess dredged up from two decades ago.  When I first saw it, I had the idea that this must be what people who read tea leaves see in the bottom of their cup.  One would have to be some kind of mystical seer to divine any useful information from it.I'm tempted to go on, but it's all been said in other reviews.  You should read some of them.  I should have waited to read some of those reviews BEFORE I made my purchase, not AFTER.  I've got only myself to blame for wasting my money.  Please don't waste yours on this unfinished game.  Don't stand for ""release now, patch later (if you're lucky)"" business practices.  Vote with your wallet, and maybe game developers will start to realize that they're not doing themselves any favors by pasting a v1.0 on an obviously unfinished product.			"

												It would be a great spiritual successor to DK if not for some crashes and unifinishable ""tutorial"" levels.Sometimes i have to replay a level 3 times so it would progress and, destroying the inhibitor when i bugs out doesn't achieve a victory condition.The UI is rusty, it takes some effort to click things at first but then it gets easier.Some UI elements show programming debug values like TRUE - FALSE - PROP_ITEM_EXAMPLEOverall i'm disapointed with WFtO and i'm expecting some patches soon to change my view of the game.

The new content (at least 70 %) was never tested and the patches focus on balance and grafic solo. Still we can get news about upcomeing DLCs ....Not only should you not buy this, but you should avoid buying from these ppl ever again.I am open to change this to recommanded when it starts working and i do not feel screwed over, but i realy do not think that that is proppable.

												A freind of mine bought this game for me, I saw this game during alpha and was hoping this was the new DK game to rule.I have kind of mixed feelings with it. Im quite dissapointed that its UI was inspired by DK2 and not the first.But I was glad to see new modes such as survival and sandbox so there were new modes to test out.Sadly this is also a game where its a must to forward ports in order to be able to play multiplayer with freinds.So just jumping straight into a game wans't just going to happen...The ""herald"" voice gets really annoying quickly. he's DK2 inspired slick comments gets very cheesy and borring already the first time you'll hear them.The talent system was a nice new way of the game. But it also confused me in the beginning why I dind't get any minions without having very specefic rooms... Normally you would get minions with just food and sleep rooms.TL;DR If you're a diehard DK1 fan like myself don't waste your time, but if you're a DK2 player or new you would probally enjoy this game to its fullest.

												I wouldn't reccomend this game to people who likes strategy and sandbox games, as there's next to nothing of these genres in it.Every now and again I open WFTO to see new changes and stuff. Everytime goes like ""wow, this is cool"", then ""THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY!""There's so many bugs (lots of people have complained, I don't need to spell them out), but the worst one, if I shouldn't just call it poor design, is: Mission 6. Your dungeon heart is just next to the enemy's dungeons, you're supposed to build a beast den, sure, makes sense, but you can't build a beast den with no money, not to mention no room! There was no tiles with gold anywhere either, and the entire screen was covered in fog of war. I had to check tiles by highlighting them in the dark. So no gold, no minions, no war. I could just stare at the screen and be confused and frustrated.So I try to take over the prison and the game complains ""Build a beast den!"". Immediately after releasing the creatures from the prison it is payday. Great. And no money - tada! Also, there would be no food for tired warriors either. How would you like the odds of defeating an entire army with five tired minions? It forces you to drive headfirst into a long battle until it's either won or lost.Other than that, every level starts with your dungeon heart right next to the enemy's dungeon (mind I only got to lv 6), enemies come crashing in constant waves, you have no room to build a decent dungeon with square rooms because you start every game with a carved out dungeon, ready-placed rooms and or tiny islands everywhere for your own enjoyment. Your defence systems aren't worth the gold because the enemies just plough right through them.I would much rather have enjoyed the slow-paced ""get to know the game"" campaigns, which campaigns are supposed to be like. Like in the DK2 (didn't play the first): you start with a few available rooms and you play around and get to know them and the play style as long as you need or want to. The Developers could at least have created it so people could use whatever play style they like. Slow paced or fast paced. Like... build, play around in how much time you want to or get a ton of minions and crash the enemy's party.Overall I don't enjoy this game. I start out with a feeling of awe, then after a few minutes I get frustrated, disappointed and extremely annoyed. It's not strategic and gets to be more like a ""hack n' slash"" tower defence.As someone else said - it's just a shadow of an old game. Nothing more. There's not much new in it, but there's not much of the old game either. It's just a template with no soul.			"

												If this game is on special consider buying it, I do not think it is worth the full price. CONS:- Long loading time at the start- Annoying voices / narration during gameplay- Does not have the charm of the old dungeon keeper 2- Pace is much quicker than the old one (this bothers me a lot) - Creatures level up quickly and they do not seem to have special abilities when at high levels (unless I am missing something?)- Not enough attention to detail - especially when it comes to the creatures in your dungeon (this was a big thing in the old one)- I do not like the ""beast"" concept- Game got very laggy during the second last campaign mission. Probably because there are 4 dungeon keepers on the one map. Very frustrating. PROS:- Sort of satisfies my craving for old dungeon keeper 2- At least someone is trying to remake the old classic			"

								Awful, and when I brought up my issues and had community support on the forums, I was banned for being 'rude' - I wasn't rude at all, However the developers are struggling to make a game anywhere near any of the quality they have promised, within the deadlines they have given, It still has the same level of completion it did a year ago, it was meant to be finished six months ago, it's still unplayable - funding goes up and so does the need to draw out the process with weekly art updates but no real additions to programming, the game, single player, multiplayer - it's really been a -bad- tech demo of bad tech for years, that's all - it's not alpha, it's pre-alpha, Why pay for that?  - because they needed more money to continue the slow♥♥♥♥♥development they've been doing.  Avoid, this is one of the games that gives crowd funding an awful name, now they're on steam they host sales and ban any naysayers to protect the image of the game.			"

												I think this might be my first review ever.  I was a huge fan of Dungeon Keeper and Dungeon Keeper 2 and was so excited about this game, I was a backer for the game and have followed it for quite some time.It isn't nice to play, I know it is meant to be evil but the problem is the units don't work well.  When fighting they bounce and float around, they all stack and pile on each other, deselecting things is sometimes quite hard (potions for example) and you can't cancel build orders for potions either.The game feels like Dungeon Keeper in a lot of respects but not just in the good ways, it feels like a game from 10 years ago.  I was hoping for a new & improved game with lots of awesome extra little things, information and a game that really got you involved.  This game is not that, I wouldn't recommend spending the money on this semi finished fairly lame attempt at Dungeon Keeper 3 which ended up being Dungeon Keeper 1.5.  If you've played DK before skip this game as there is nothing that feels new or exciting and if you haven't then skip this game as it will feel outdated and buggy.			"

												Basically a remake of Dungeon Keeper 2 with updated graphics - but worse art direction.  Also, and this is important, there are STILL parts of the game that aren't complete.  Placeholder options in the menu, a buggy and messy possession mode, etc.  There was a point where I had hope for this game, but after a year of being out of early access I see that it does nothing to improve upon it's spiritual predecessor, and does in fact do several things worse.  I wanted this game to be good, but it has let me down.			"

												well..i have to say that i didn't play a lot of this version, but the game doesn't run smoothly, the gamley is really wierd but you can catch on, if to be honest, it is VERY hard to come with DK3 and just nail in everything, but the devs havemissed so many easy things, and that is just sad.=\i am disappointed from this game, and i shall not recommend it to anyone. i always speak so high about DK 2, and this..this is what happened when almost everything goes wrong :(			"

												I've been playing this game for a bit more than 2 hours now and I have to say that I dislike the game.Every odd couple of minutes, it gets frozen, stopping the game. The controls are not all that good either and the mini-map is useless.So far, I regret buying the game.			"

												While I do enjoy this game I must give it a thumbs down because while this game looks like Dungeon Keeper... it is not Dungeon keeper.  While this game has all the trappings of DK series, the goofy monsters, the dungeon building, the game voice narrirator,  this is not a true DK3.The glaring difference between this and the previous 2 DK games comes in the level of level creativity and ability to explore.  This game quickly becomes a giant dogpile of troops rushing to the end.  It lacks the exploration element in DK 1&2 that are so essential to the overall feel of the game.  The zerg rush of the game gets so bad that rooms like the workshop are utterly useless.  You can't build doors and traps because you are constantly summoning your monsters to engage the enemy or rush the end lair.  You can't take any time because the AI is too agressive or the level is under a timer.  Unlike the games predecessors that allowed you to meticulously plot your dungeon, explore every nook and crany for all the secrets and craft the army you want you are in an RTS scramble to build as quickly as you possibly can and that saps alot of the enjoyment out of the game.I hope that if they release DLC (a 2nd campaign) the creators really sit back and change the whole tempo of the game.  While the game looks like Dungeon Keeper it plays more like the Warcraft franchise.  If I wanted to play Warcraft/Starcraft I would have picked that up instead of DK3.			"

Early Access Review
								Dungeon Keeper 3?  Yes, please.  While it is currently not outstanding it is definitely worth buying early so you're not spending the increased price for it later.Played one of the tutorials and then the sandbox.  Got a little confused as to the tiers of unlocks available, but I'm sure they'll explain more of that later on.Will they also include the dark humor that was present in DK2?  They have the sinister voice actor from it, but I am not really sure that the upbeat tone he has to everything really...fits.''Your nocturnal tendencies have earned you a hidden gaming tip.

												5/10Over the years I've heard about the Dungeon Keeper franchise and from what I read, War for the Overworld is considered the third installment of the series. Being a fan of strategy games and seeing it on sale, I decided to go for it and snagged myself a copy. Honestly and despite giving it a fair chance, I just couldn't get into it. The strategy is so one-dimensional that I didn't feel engaged or challenged and quickly grew bored. However, the graphics though are solid and I didn't encounter a single issue with the game, it's smooth and the user interface is well designed. But, the voice acting - holy s--t it's awful, but I'm sure tongue-in-cheek comments were a lot funnier in the studio.			"

												Excellent game - a brilliant follow on from Dungeon Keeper, that really retains the feel of the originals while adding in a LOT of new features. It's also less micro-managy - there are a lot of different units, and it won't tell you their stats, so you kind of have to just build based on what production you want, and hope they can fight if necessary. It's an interesting take on the concept - that your priority is building up an awesome dungeon, rather than fighting the enemy. I like it though, it's a neat twist and works well - certainly a lot better than any competing dungeon management games.Note that it is still (3+ years after release) buggy, and will crash and lose your game occasionally.

												The game is similar to Dungeon Keeper I and II but its not it completely. BUGS are killing this game... Literally. I DO NOT RECCOMEND BUYING THE GAME UNTIL THEY FIX SOME OF THE BUGSThere were countless bug fixes but there are even more to fix. I have been stuck on the last mission for a couple months because save/load is not working properly. The basic function of the game such as save/load does not work. If I were you I would not make same mistake like I did and bought the game before they fixed bugs. Think about it this way 4 months since release and yet they did not finish save / load function of the game. Thats besides multiple creater AI problems, lack of monster progression.Overall this and Dungeons II were 2 of the better replicas of the good old Dungeon Keeper II. And while the Dungeons II humor and overall feel is a bit lacking compared to War for the Overlord its still a better game because it has a more polished product, different races / sides and more in depth character progression... Even though War for the Overlord had a potential to become the best DK II replica...Lack of Sense of Monster progression. In DK and DK II when your monsters level up they become more powerful especially when they reach level 4, 8, 10. The progression in this game is very limited - creaters do get some lesser abilities but their HP pools overall stay the same. In DK 1 level 10 creater was very hard to get but once he is level 10 he can slaughter multiple level 1s. In this game different between level 10 and 1 is roughly 10-20% of overall strength. Whi this is a bad thing - well it encourages treating your creaters like sensless armies and send them on their death time and time again rather than makign sure they are happy with your dungeon and progress in levels.

 A True Disappointment I cannot for the life of me fathom how it has taken the developers years to produce this terrible game. What disappoints me is that I supported the game from the beginning and feel I've been patient over the years with its bugs and faults. But over 2 years on and it's still a complete mess.It's impossible to list everything that's wrong with the game, I actually tried but my review was too long for steam, so if that doesn't tell you enough then by all means buy it and see for yourself...If I had to choose one thing that got to me the most, it would be the animation. I mean they haven't even tried, the characters can walk and perform a basic attack, and that's more or less the extent of it.I can only reach the conclusion that the developers have used the money paid in by its supporters and ensured that they have been given decent wages with lots of perks, because it is clear that very little of the years they have had to develop this game has actually been spent doing so. To top it off, I have seen that they have the audacity to release an exanpsion to the game! The game is utterly and laughably incomplete, it's a joke and I would under all circumstances not advise anybody to purchase this game, your money will not be well spent and any hopes that it will be efficiently used to improve the game is unforeseeable. I would accept a refund in a heartbeat, following the progress and seeing the end result has been a complete waste of my time.Save your money, play Dungeon Keeper again, it's a much better game that was developed a decade before this one was.

Early Access Review
								War for the Overworld -Pre Release ReviewGameplay & Mechanics-The game play is pleasant, the developers did a good job on the fluidity and ease of controls.  The camera is locked into a overhead mode, this sometimes is annoying when trying to verify your dungeon layout and design.  I did not notice any skill hotkeys; however, I might have overlooked this feature in a menu/sub-menu. This game offers the player four types of usable skill mastery's. Building magic, Attack magic spells, Minons, and Defensive structures.  Playing through the first three campaigns offers little insight to the end game viability of building magic and/or defensive skills.  defensive skills as you quickly learn in campaign 3 take up a specific amount of MP based on the structure from your mana/energy pool.  This limits the amount of defensive structures that a player is able to build. I did notice however; while tinkering around in skirmish mode, advanced walls do not take up MP/energy. Unfortunately once built, the walls cannot be sold or taken down.Value--------------------------Currently keeping in mind that the game is in pre-alpha, I would not purchase this game again if I had the chance.  The negatives outnumber the positives on this one.  My advice save your money until game hits 50/70% off.Pro's-----------------------------------Wity humorDungeon design tools are solidNon game destroying bugs ""this is a good thing in my book""Solid minion diversityCon's-----------------------------------------------Camera is locked in overhead without a way to rotateMinion's are capped (in skirmish I was only able to get 9 in each type of minion roughly 40-50 minions)Defensive structures limit spell usage and have a low cap (about 15 Mix & Match)Worker minions are limited (if you go over ""via build spell"" limit they take MP away like defensive structures)Minions are inefficent, for example they leave tiles unclaimed when making rooms that are not square. (dont forget you cannot rotate the camera to correct this)Minion AI is inefficent when fighter minnions are rallyed to a specific location (with complex dungeon design)Review------My review is based off of 5 hours of campaign and skirmish tests of a alpha/pre-alpha game. As such the released version of the game may differ greatly from its current state.  My review is only meant to offer my opinion of the game as it stands today 04/01/2015.  I believe this game has potential however; several other emerging games might offer more $/hr of enjoyment value.  "

												The prospect of a new Dungeon Keeper made me back this with little hesitation back in 2012 when the Kickstarter ran. Videos from the beta I watched about a year ago gave me some trepidation, but I had hope that it would turn out alright given that there was still more time to improve it. Now that time is up and version 1.0 is out - and I'm really sad to see what the project has come to: This is a woefully unfinished game, not at all ready to be released! It's not just about lack of polish: Animations are jerky and rough or simply missing (slap a piglet and it simply disappears), creatures in combat move around chaotically making it hard to know what's going on, glaring bugs are aplenty - gamebreaking bugs - some game modes are unfinished, the minimap is nigh useless and on top of that the game is poorly optimized. I've never seen such an incomplete game pushed to release and can only surmise that it has to be desperation move by the developers. I suspect this project has been seriously mismanaged and poorly planned out from an early stage. There are many additions beyond the mechanics of the original games and many good ideas among those. The textures are pretty nice and it has the same narrator voice as the originals. How then are basic features like a proper minimap not in place? Why does the core gameplay feels so erractic and why is the relevant feedback on what's going on in the dungeon so sparse? After all this development time? Poorly balanced fluff features? And from the steam achievement you can see that the campaign only has 13 missions (compare that to the 20 of DK1)I must conclude that the developers didn't have the experience, skills and resources to make the game we all wanted and thus failed to deliver. ""Game will be patched."" ""More content to be added."" ""It has potential."" Yadada-ya! - These are the funeral hymns failed games usually receive. Maybe this game will be completed at some point in the future. I wouldn't get my hopes up though, and based on the development speed up to this point it definitely won't be soon. Don't buy this game before you hear convincing reports that it actually has been completed!Instead, get the originals from GoG if you're craving for a dungeon sim.			"

												In many ways this is a game with great potential. I only got 2 days ago, and after playing for a bit I figured out that ok, it's an early access game and there's a lot of work ahead. Today is the 1.0 release, and I am hoping this is a late april fools joke, but it's true. I'd say the game is still in mid-beta stage. It's a fun little game, but by no means a full fledged game ready for release. As many people mentioned it borrows heavily from DK, and anyone who has played it back in the old days will feel at home. The UI is in many ways exactly the same, and it has a few cool new features like alchemy or tech tree. But as I said it's still an underdeveloped beta game. There are major bugs in the campaign, in-game textures are very poor, skirmish offers only 3 maps (all for 2 players only), battle animations are wonky and/or look like temporary placeholders, with a 5x5 study you plow through the entire tech tree in 4-5 minutes tops... Don't get me wrong, THIS WILL BE A GOOD GAME. In a few months. Todays release is a mistake, and if you're considering buying the game hoping for regular gameplay, keep in mind that as of today, you're still signing up for beta testing. Buy a copy of DK2 somewhere and fiddle with it for a month or two, then come back. Maybe it will be a full game then.			"

												This has been my first experience of 'War of the Overworld' and Steam in general and it has not been a favourable one.Upon starting up the game I am greeted with a black screen as it attempts to load. The endless blackness drew me in and opened my mind to such deep philosophical questions as 'is it ethical to allow people to buy a product that clearly does not work?', 'how can releasing an incomplete game even be legal?' and 'how the hell do I get my freakin' money back?!'. Upon resolving myself with the less than satasfactory revelations these questions posed, a flash of blinding light released me from the hold of the load screen and I read the words, 'WFTO has stopped working' - which is quite a feat considering it never worked in the first place.This game does not work. And when, by some miracle, it does work, it still does not work; it is too slow to be played and I can barely navigate the tedious menu. The only way to make this game work is to find a previously downloaded file called 'Dungeon Kepper 2' and play that instead.I am very unhappy with WFTO. I am very unhappy with Steam. And very unhappy with the stain the combination of these two ""products"" have placed upon the gaming industry in genereal. It's like paying upfront for an apple and then discovering it's rotten. And also that it's a melon.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. DO NOT SUPPORT STEAM.			"

												After a prolonged period of early access time, the game's finally been rushed out and it's still pretty god damn awful despite numerous updates and attempts to add more content.There's a mission where the game decides to throw a constant stream of 180 dwarves at you with only 15 minutes of preperation time beforehand.Regardless of what you do, you die.There's not enough time to rebuild your forces even if you go insane with prisons and torture chambers. (It probably doesn't help that your succubi die far too quickly for them to be of any use. The best part is when your creatures become tired and then try to go to sleep in their lairs on very little health (there's never enough mana to heal everything), so what happens is that your creatures get murdered in their sleep by the invading 180 dwarves. The best thing however is when your creatures aren't being attacked for a nanosecond and then decide to go to the treasure room for payday, and conveniently the dwarves have a nice big wave coming in at that time. Oh boy oh boy oh boy. The main problem with this game is that it tries to copy dungeon keeper 2 way too much, even though it's the second worse dungeon keeper game. This game has a really crappy atmosphere and all the creatures are a load of wank and there doesn't seem to be enough depth in the right places. Sure it's got the ~veins of evil~ but that's just a messy list of tech upgrades that just give you more useless/highly situational abilities that you'll use once in a mission that requires you to use it and then you'll never use it ever again. There's also no level editor which really sucks because these dungeon keeper style of games would be really great with level editors. Instead of trying to balance the campaign so that it's actually playable past mission 7, the developers seem to be making a survival mode instead which I assume is an even more poorly designed version of mission 7. It's a real shame that every game that tries to emulate dungeon keeper's success/style just ♥♥♥♥s it up completely.			"

												This review based on single-player campaign only. I bought the game just before launch and then waited several weeks for the big patch before playing. The reason being that in the beginning the game menu and save/load screens were very laggy. The patch has improved this though there are still long load times.  I didnt have any problems with performance during gameplay until towards the end of the campaign where the large maps and number of enemies made it almost unplayable on some levels. I pushed through to the final level only to be stopped cold by a bug that wouldnt let me finish. (the invisible barrier...sigh)I was a big fan of the old Dungeon Keeper and so wanted to like this game but in the end I just felt more frustration then fun while playing. The graphics are good and the old narrator is back but the charm for me is missing. Since there's no neutral rating I'm going to have to give this a No.  "

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE VISTA.The game will barely get to startup and then crash as soon as you hit the play game button.Do not waste your $25, save it for something more worth the price.Do not make an account for their forum, you'll be wasting your breath as the Dev's do an immediate after launch series of bug fixes they apparantly didn't bother to CHECK for.If you're still interested, then save your money  to upgrade, otherwise with Steam having no refund option, you'll be stuck with this game in your Library, and $25 poorer.IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THIS REVIEW AND GAME: This is subject to change, I'm saving money to get a better rig, so when I get that rig and am finally able to play it for at least one hour, then this review WILL CHANGE.Do not take this review as me ""hating the game"", I just can't play it properly, and was mad that I burned money on it I can't refund to save or spend on something else.

												I bought this game in the hopes of continuing from where we left off in Dungeon Keepr 2, and was very much dissapointed.The story is all together unrelated in my opinion. The AI is rather simple, and the maps literaly force you to build in predefined patterns, with gold being available when needed, thus not realy needing to plan much for economy.Overall its a poor attempt to mimic DK2, if you are hoping to meet those expecations, dont buy this game or you will be dissapointed.

It could have used another round of beta testing.Also, the mouse cursor is difficult to accurately use and some of the icons are infuriatingly small and hard to click, especially when in a rush trying to defend your dungeon. There needs to be some hot keys and a control menu to let you assign them.In it's current state I can't recommend this game. "

												It looks like a cool game, but I can't play it on my 2015 iMac. WftO crashes consistently on the loading screen for the first level of the first campaign. In addition, there are glitchy garbled rectangles in the app loading screen, and a few places where the UI is briefly unresponsive and audio cuts out before returning to normalcy. I suspect the game was not well-tested on Macs. I'm normally more charitable with buggy software, and tend to talk to developers through private channels to resolve issues. But since there is no free demo or shareware to try before taking the leap and buying the game, I'm the one that loses here, and potentially other Mac gamers. Please fix your serious bugs.			"

												The most annoying Dungeon Keeper-like game to date.This review/opinion is based on the two campaigns which are included.Both of them are a complete mess and almost every single mission will annoy you to no end.The game takes away from the room building and focuses on just pushing armies around while leaving you as little square space to build on as possible. There is no room wall bonus or keeping things tidy, drop all OCD and enjoyment because this game will force you to rush through every single god damn mission.There is a level editor and you could make some non-annoying maps, but that part is not for everyone.It does not make up for the really REALLY bad campaigns.Skip this one and get one of the other dungeon keeper games here on steam.

After saving game, my Gold goes down to zero. I am mining like stupid, my gold stay goes up and immediately down to 0. What the ♥♥♥♥???The Kollossus: When beeing attacked, he summons his gold spell but do not attack itself.

												This game is NOT Dungeon Keeper. If you aren't looking for a modernized Dungeon Keeper then maybe you will enjoy War for the Overworld, but if you are I'm sorry to say this is another dud.  It's clear that the creators of this game wanted to make a clone, they even got the same voice actor for narration. but they didn't execute it well enough.  The visual and narrative style of this game takes itself way too seriously, and overall the game seems like it's trying way too hard to be cool.  Every level is a gimmick and is geared towards the AI having a distinct advantage.  The campaign is annoying and tedious, with almost no standard destroy the opponent missions and many timed objective based ones instead.  In addition this game is poorly optimized and regularly skips during play for no reason. I could go on about my complaints but the bottom line is that this game is no Dungeon Keeper, if that's what you want you should boot up DK2 and replay it...that's what I'm doing.			"

												Campaign is awful at the minute, levels are far too linear and some are near impossible until you lose and know exactly what will happen, there's barely any freedom in levels to actually build your own dungeon, 70% of the levels you're given 5-15 minutes to build an army or defences then bombarded with enemies.The number of useful traps, spells and creatures feels a bit lackluster - I found myself only using a handful of the creatures, traps only when I was forced to and the only spell I used was create imps. Rituals and constructs are a nice touch but rituals also feels pointless, once again never used them unless I had to in campaign. Definitely needs more useful rituals, spells, traps, etc.Skirmishes and multiplayer are meh, found myself giving up on multiplayer because it's a mess and skirmishes are good but needs more options.I can honestly say I wouldn't recommend this game even to my friends who like dungeon keeper/starcraft/etc, which is unfortunate because i've been following this game for a few years and while I didn't have my hopes set that high, I expected a bit more.

												Hi All,I really want to like this game, but it's still really a beta at best, and seems very close to almost an alpha in my book.  So much is broken if you really play this game, especially in sandbox mode and skirmish against the AI.  It's very hard to really build up a force of any kind.  Unit managmenet is hurendous.  There is so much potential here, it's just all miss managed.  There is so much broken here.  And to top it off.  When you play skirmish, it's againts another Underlord?!? WHAT is that about.  I want to play a cool anti-hero game.  Not a game againtst myself.  It's like if Starcraft was Bugs vs Bugs only for skirmish mode. :(Hope they really overhaul this game.  I bought it ages ago when still alpha.  So sad to see what the release is.... :(			"

												I'm sorry to say that this is one of those unfinished games where the producers thought it would be ok to sell you the real ending later on.I found the game decently fun for a while, despite all the technical issues(it is utterly unoptimised on any rig). However I just can't get past the fact that this is an unfinished product. Yet another kickstarter fail.			"

												I am a huge fan of the original Dungeon Master game, and so kickstarted this game hoping for a similar feeling. It seems like they managed to recreate everything except for the ""feel"" of the units. It reminds me of when games first transitioned to 3d, and everything was unclear and awkward. The movement of the creatures feel like there is no weight - they seem to glide more than move, and I can't really distinguish the attacks that they make when they are fighting, and the sounds don't really engage me. I'd say this is definitely decent for an indie game, but it really doesn't have the same magic as Dungeon Keeper.			"

												Being new to this game, I first tried the campaign.But that made me lose intrest in this game completly. Why? Because I only managed to beat level one and got stuck at level two. The second level is so buggy that its really no fun.If you dont do everything in the correct order the ""Quest"" gets stuck. If for example you first build a lair and barracks and it then tells you to make a tunnle and claim the gateway, even after claiming the gateway the quest is stuck there. Or if you build the archives AFTER the gatewa, barracks, etc even if you get a massage that you got new sins, the sins dont show up in that purple orb. And you cant open the vines of evil. I had to build that food-get-place but even after i builed it (3x3 just like the game wanted) the game didnt advance the quest and got stuck.This game isnt early-accessso it should not be this buggy.Sorry for my bad english.

												I bought this game when it first showed up on Steam. Ive had the game for over a year now. I hate this game. It NEVER actually came out. It still hasn't. This is a complete joke. Take out a loan. Hire some game developers and FINISH THIS GAME. To be fully honest. I demand a refund. Over a year and this game still doesnt actually work. Its a complete joke. Its buggy and has less than 10 hours of campaign???? You owe EVERY SINGLE EARLY ACCESS Customer a REFUND. 100% refund. Hell you should pay us interest on that refund.  I dont care how good this game could get. I care about how much of a joke its been. I want my money back and I hope to never ever hear about this game again as long as I live. If you cant make a full game, THEN DONT!			"

												I have had this game since it debuted as early access and as I write this it's now been several weeks since the ""release"".Regretfully for someone who loved Dungeon Keeper II, this game is simply not good on several fronts. First off, it's far from anything remotely deserving of being called ""released"". It's barely playable, the framerate is in the single digits (and I have a beefy computer). The interface is entirely inadequate, there are a bunch of rooms that Ihave no idea what they do or how to use them and it isn't explained anywhere.For a game that set out to improve on DK2, on that count they have failed. The gameplay is bland, the maps are poorly designed, the missions are boring and drag on and on (made worse by the abysmal framerate). Of all the amazing traps of DK and DK2, this game has like four. Which all suck. Perhaps in an attempt to disguise that, the traps have toggleable ""modes"" but I have no idea what they do, the interface doesn't tell and I forgot what the tutorial said when they were introduced 5 missions back.If you're feeling nostalgic for DK2, just play DK2 again.

								This game is said to be the next Dumgeon Keeper, but it is lacking in all that mad theoriginal Bullfrog games so wonderful.The game is ugly, everything being a dull brown or gray or muddy green, and has none of the sense of humor of the original. Even as an early access game, it's painfully incomplete. There is very little gameplay, and what is there is uninteresting. The updates are very infrequent and don't really add much.Steer clear for now, maybe return in a few years to see if a real game has been made of it. When you get a Dungeon Keeper craving, play the originals.			"

								UI not responsive when any action is going on. Game is definitely not playable. At least with better specs than the minimum specified. Even the main menu buttons look unresponsive when being clicked or hovered....I have a dual core 3Ghz and the game goes up to 100% and starts lagging. I bet they have not tried to play the game with a machine with the minimum specs. The game will start yes, but it cannot be played. Those optimistic minimum specs should be updated, unless you still want to trick people into buying a game they won´t be able to enjoy.I also tried to lower the resolution to see if that could fix the problem, but then you cannot even scroll the screen properly right and left... funny that at this stage there are still problems like theseCreatures also sometimes hang in their positions doing nothingOverall, the game is bad. Worst 30 euros spent in a very long time...			"

Posted: May 2, 2016
												I would like to state that my whole review will be extremely biased, offensive and discriminative against game types, publishers and developers so if you become easily offended please do not read this review. But I believe the hard-core gamers will understand me even if they will not agree with me.First: I don’t think that there will be ever any middle level or above Dungeon Keeper (DK) fun that will be pleased with this game. You know that for most of us, our scariest nightmare is either the developer or the game itself to be bought by the company gamEs for retArts (gEAy games). It is usually means either the death of the series, or the idea, or the product or the any original thing in that production or the producer group. We are already not expecting any creative or exotic or extreme ideas or games from a company who only focuses on sales thus only produces football, basketball and f. king racing games that have no atmosphere, no story, no emotion, no idea, no intelligence,  for shosers. Yes these people are not gamers they are definite anti-social shosers who are not able to pick a ball and play at their garden, (or they can be minors but again same brain age) whatever… Hence we were not expecting anything that can satisfy us from the gEAy or any company controlled by gEAy as a sequel of DK, or Black and White (BW). That company is created for rounded games and for rounded people to kick so no offense for them.Second: On the other hand, you emerged from nothing in order to revive a cult game. Yes DK is a cult game with no similar and especially the first one was not designed for everyone. With the music, difficulty, ideas, strategies… it was unique. -	It was far serious than the DK2-	Even the names of the spells and the narrator were the part of the dark atmosphere-	Game was not too short and there were strategic options on the map.-	Blood-gore level was far more higher-	The player and its dark army was the evil part however was not the strongest, there were characters like Avatar who can take your whole horde down at least 3 times. -	The game was difficult. It was not possible to finish the game in few days.-	The map and the ongoing story were far more darker and had a perfect atmosphere-	Music were dark and suitable to the environment-	The creatures were giving the feeling of the intelligence-	Even there were conflicts between some creatures such as wizards and vampires, bile demons and skeletons...etc. so it was difficult to organise the dungeon.-	There were many details for captives, it was required different procedures to make them ghost, skeleton, vampire.. etc.-	There were more torture machines and screams than the WAR for Overword and this was the main concept of the game so F… you.-	Was not automatically finishing the level when you win the mapThird:  Yes DK2 was different. It has not got some of the above characteristics however it had some other things that made it acceptable as a sequel and successful for fanatics like me.-	This time we had black humour and the deep darkness of the game was a bit broken by the jokes and short clips.-	However the gore was there with more colourful wars, aggressive atmosphere and action.-	The music was gone crazy. It was best experience I ever had with intelligence system that changes the music with increasing aggression in the game. The music was sometimes the war atmosphere itself. Many times forced me to possess and join to the bathe with them.-	Ok spells were not mystical and powerful like DK… No plague, no armaggedon, no shield.. but still they were colourful and functional. Yes they really lack when you compare with DK but yes as long as you can have bile demons behind you and go to battle as a dark knight or dark angel aside with horned reaper…. Yes still acceptable-	Horned reaper become an exceptional creature/character with a call function but hey that was fun. It was amazing to feel that artificial intelligence of heroes make you feel their fear they felt against horned reaper.-	The game was not short again. She story was more colourful and rich. There were lots of levels with various difficulties.-	Narrator was more active bit funny but was not NPC of the game who intends be the secret antagonist in the game.-	Was not automatically finishing the level when you win the map-	The king with two blades and stone guardians were epic at the end of the game. And it was a real feeling of shame when the game ended. We all wanted and desired for more.-	Still we were the evil side there were no “corrupted king” that yells as “kill me hahaha take the flesh on me set me free because developers are bunch of story f…ing unintelligent midiots”Fourth: Ok we all know about copyright issues, difficulties of being an independent company, trying to develop something on a heritage of a good game etc. However If you are going to use the name “War for the Overworld” it means you have come up with something that can really be a continuation of DK games with higher quality and more offerings. Otherwise you can change the name of the game as “Dungeons” do not claim anything from the DK heritage, make a funny and rubbish game like this than we never blame you. On War for the Overworld-	We haven’t see any war above the ground. That name was intended for that purpose, you remember? DK3 was planned to be the story of rising over the ground from the dungeons… Even the funny game “Dungeons 2” made it with a way which combines Warcraft 3 and DK2, but you… nope sorry…-	Game was ridiculously short.-	Other underlords and their jokes were disgusting.-	The creatures… Yes you have to offer new ones I can completely understand. And a succubus was a good substitute for the mistress. And ogre was a good idea. Beast master was different but not functional. But what the f… is a Chunder? Do you think that what you placed a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ troll in game and make it fart like a bile demon it will become a substitute for both of them? It is not even a Bileroll or Trol Demon.-	Yes it became really fancy to summon a vampire and to feed them. Necromancers were good too and that ghouls may replace skeletons. But sorry you still lack of black knights and dark angels (or something that can be substitute of them)-	Bile demons and horned reaper were signature creatures. I understand that you cannot replace them easily with something else. But you had chance to reference them in game. They were the atmosphere of DK and DK2. Not even a easter egg … f.. you! -	Titans…. No, sorry. They are neither unique nor add something to the gameplay or the atmosphere. Neither scary nor have a character.-	Music? F… you! What music?-	Story? F… you! What story? “the story of evil king that emerges suddenly and explodes all you dungeon and a traitor narrator voice”…. wow-	Atmosphere? F… you! What darkness? What aggression?... none of them were available in this game.-	That torture chambers are just a disappointment. You are the disappointment…-	Spells… F… you!-	Traps… I hope you someone sticks that blade lotus in your…. Nose.-	… just tell me what do you offer more than DK and DK2? You see if you are not able to do something good without Peter Douglas Molyneux why in the world you are over forcing your brains to do something that they are not capable of and ruin all of the product, idea? You see that that guy was in same conditions with you and created a game which is called GODUS and with that he may not be trying to revive another legend which is Black and White series however he created something at least as beautiful as B and W and made the fanatics happy.So please go find and internship somewhere close to the Peter Douglas Molyneux and don’t touch the DK series again.

I press esc, I take a♥♥♥♥♥♥ come back, press continue, AND now my core is being destroyed, but I cant do anything, because the dang esc menu is still up.Over all, this is a great game, but for people who dont really have alot of luck with bugs, steer clear until fixed.

												A terrible disappointing follow-up to the masterpiece that is Dungeon Keeper 2. I have been playing the Dungeon Keeper series since the pre-release demo of the 2nd game so I went in this game with fairly high expectations. Unfortunately, developer oversight has let me down as this game is horribly balanced, has poor tutorial and mechanic explanation and in general feels unpolished and not cared for. The learning curve for this game is way too high for the early game, you have to effectively break the game and do the complete opposite of what you're being told to actually complete the game. You're not here to have fun and build a dungeon, you're here to play the linear meta and spam OP defences that make your ""dungeon"" impenetrable.The developers have taken all the fun out of a Dungeon Keeper game to create their own miscalculated, unfun formula that makes for a frustrating and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t experience where scripted story segments can screw you over - and by doing what the game has told you to do nonetheless! This game is not the Dungeon Keeper 3 people have been saying because it's actually a lot different from Dungeon Keeper 2, which this game is clearly trying to emulate in its own fashion, and a lot of what made 2 great is just not present here.In this game, you either have too much or not enough of everything. Be it gold, space, bedrock, minions, defences, shrines etc. The levels do not feel balanced and crafted in a way that allows me to express how I want to make my dungeons, rather, the way the developer wants you to take a certain paith. Goodbye fun, goodbye creativity and goodbye balance, say hello to linear, boring and overpowering formulas that you HAVE to take part in in order to stand a chance in the campaign.Avoid buying this trash if you're a Dungeon Keeper fan and instead I recommend Dungeons 2, or better, stick to Dungeon Keeper 2.

They should of just stuck with the same game mecahincs and just prettied it up, waste of money i say considiering how long its been.Summary, Dungeon Keeper 2 is 15 years old and is still far superior to this in every way.

								Theyre working on making another dungeon keeper it seems, one of my favorite games of all time. However it's not anywhere near ready to be called a game. Its really more of a basically functional alpha. Not much really ""fun"" about it, the minions lack style, the rooms behave oddly, and the mechanics that made DK so much fun are pretty much lost. It would seem that alot of the menus and and play are just sorta clunky and lack feedback that would make them more fun.I really think that the Devolpers should buy a copy of Evil Genius and Dungeon Keeper 2, It would make me feel better about the future of the project			"

								First time writing review...but why not:)It was a nice idea to bring back to life DK. but at this moment it is a terrible game. Yes, there are some nice new ideas, yes, it is a little bit nicer graphic..... But overall feeling is a naseau of dissapointment from so much things which could have moved in better direction.I do understand it is an early access game....and seeing rip offs made by old companies by turning HD, adding bugs and selling for new money it could be taken as nice undertaking...but again.They got money on kickstart, early access here should be at least playable and a little bit smooth...without that much content but a least that.They focues on content and lost fun, playability and feeling of old DK.Cheers,BTW: Will keep in my library, might be that they get to good game in 6-12 months timeframe...

								I honestly can't reccomend anyone buy this game at this point. That is because it is not a game at all. It's little more than a tech demo and needs a LOT of work yet before it should have ever been put into prerelease sales. This review is subject to change once they get it out of this alpha state but until then it gets a solid thumbs down.			"

								I was going to slate this as being woefully unbalanced in the campaign and leave it at that as I couldnt get past stage 3 I think it was but then I played the sandbox and I think if you can stick with it campaign wise it will probably give you some enjoyment eventually but the sad truth is that with the soon to be arrival of  Dungeons 2 this game will seem like a pale comparison and I didnt like Dungeons but they seem to have listened and maybe created a game to carry on the DK spirit which is bad news for Overworld.Its just all taken too long to get from A to B and there is a lot in the pot all mashed together. They would have been better off concentrating on the core game that was so great with DK/DK2 then releasing all the rest as add ons but here we are now and without even a finished product they find themselves up a shiny new toy in the shape of Dungeons 2.I suppose this game is now the example of what happens when there is too much input from the community and good people try to please everyone all at once. I'm glad that the game still has very positive reviews but I cant recommend this to anyone......I just played DK2 on the emulator and enjoyed it more. My advice play DK2 until Dungeons 2 comes out and if that turns out to be a turd like the first one then wait around for Overworld.			"

												I could neither master nor understand the games mechanics after several hours of play. Rushing appears in the least very difficult, inspite of AI enemies who seem to amass a well trained army in the first five minutes; minions train at glacial speeds and defences take too long to be (or frankly never get) built. Recovering from an attack is slow and by that stage there is no point in continuing and with respect to latter campaign levels just became tiresome.			"

								This appears to be little more than a clone of Dungeon Keeper 2. May as well just play the original. Hopefully some newer, more original content is eventually added to make this a successor rather than a clone so I can change this review...Another potential successor currently in early access has added some original content. It doesn't appear as polished as this, but it does actually feel like a new game inspired by DK rather than simply recreating it.			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding cheese cake recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients: 1 cup digestive plain sweet biscuit crumbs3 tablespoons sugar3 tablespoons melted butter40 ounces softened cream cheese1 cup sugar3 tablespoons flour1 tablespoon vanilla1 cup sour cream4 eggsDirections:For The base:.If you're using a dark pan, preheat the oven to 350. If you are using a shiny pan, 375.Combine the crumbs, melted butter and 3 tbsp sugar well and pat onto the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. I also like to very very lightly butter the sides of the pan so that the cheesecake will not stick later on.Bake for 10 mins in your preheated oven and remove. Let it cool while you prepare your batter.For the batter:.Make sure everything is at room temperature.Combine sugar, cheese, flour and vanilla in a big bowl and mix on medium speed till well combined. Don't forget to scrape the bowl as you're doing this.Mix in the sour cream till its incorporated well. Then, add the eggs one by one, mixing well after each addition.Pour the batter into the springform and let it bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes After the baking time, turn off the oven and leave the door ajar. Let the cake cool in there for about 1 1/2 hours.Remove the cake and let it cool thoroughly. Refrigerate overnight.Release the sides of the springform.Eat.			"

								This game is a Dungeon Keeper clone. The rooms are being designed to be different it seems but along similar lines as well as the creatures. The game shows promise and is receiving regular updates however in its current state i would not recommend the price tag. It is extremely early in the development with only a handful of rooms and spells developed giving a very limited number of different creatures. Key features are missing or not yet implemented for example the minimap and creatures tab meaning you never know how many creatures you have or what ones you have. unfortunately the number of bugs in this early stage is also large and at times makes it unplayable examples being, losing cursor, cursor stuck in selection mode. The game shows promise and hopefully in the future once it progresses it will deliver something that any fan of dungeon keeper will enjoy. If you want to support the development by all means purchase the title now but if you are looking for a game you can play here and now you best wait as this is not for you....yet. Happy gaming!			"

You never need gold or cash for the good old "" PAY DAY "". This game just has been dumbed down that much it has become war for the hello kitty adventures.If you must buy this game know this.

The base gameplay strongly reminds of dungeon keeper, but with all its design flaws, the absense of engagement for detailism, the absurdely slow and laggy technics, and the very very VERY slow update progression, WFTO would fit better in a 1$ humble bundle rig than it does in the steam store.

								Games awesome but there are a few things you need to know before purchasing if you own a mac and are planning on playing this on your mac. I just got this game a few days ago and played it on my mac the first issue is it crashes every time you finish a mission or sandbox game so I went to the games company for help turns out theres a major bug for the mac version of the game and they don't know when it will be fixed. Another bad thing about this bug is it makes you only have half of the features windows has. For instance dungeons,some characters, and I believe some sand box modes are not in the mac version. But other then that the game is awesome there is no lag and it never crashes while your in the game intill you try to go back to the menu or close the game. I 100% think you should purchase this game if you have windows or linux you will very much so love this game for you have all the features that are released, no lag and best of all no crashes! So if your a mac I think you should get this game only if your willing to be patient enough for them to fix the bug if your a windows or linux buy this game right away it is worth it!			"

								I love this Game and understand its in BETA but i would wait a little longer if your using a MAC because it crashes frequently, no idea how it runs on other OS's, however i would definatly recomend this game to everyone because it certanly bring back memories of the original dungeon keeper and i cannot wait for the full version to come out.

								This game has all the hallmarks of bringing back what many fans of Dungeon Keeper miss (War for the Overworld is spiritual successor of Dungeon Keeper 3: War for the Overworld). However, this has been a long time in development, with not many patches nor updates to new systems. While I will happily play the finished product of this game, the current ""Early Access"" build still needs a lot of work from what I've seen.That said, I give this game a thumbs up.			"

								I was watching videos of Dungeon Keeper and happened to bump into video about this game... so of course I got excited and had to buy it straight away. Once I get into game, I think I cried tears of joy soon as I heard the good old narrator talk.This is truely worthy successor for Dungeon Keeper games, but we shall not talk about the garbage on handhelds *spits towards EA*If you loved the original Dungeon Keeper games, this is must get!!

Early Access Review
								A faithful, intentional sucessor to the Dungeon Keeper franchise. It lacks some of the quirky charm, but is very impressive regardless. There have been very rapid developments in the past month or so which have left it feeling more like a game than a beta, and even if there is still a way to go, things are looking good.- The design is frankly, beautiful. it captures the feel of the classic dungeon keeper games perfectly.- The UI is... less impressive. It's functional, but feels somewhat rushed in places.- The creatures are interesting, but lack some of the character that the Dungeon Keeper creatures had.- Sound effects are a little repetitive, but tend to be very nice.Overall, it's a beta and it shows. Some things seem missing - animations occasionally feel like bland placeholders, there aren't a great variety of levels to play and so on and so forth... That said, it's already an impressive game and I can only see it improving as times goes on.			"

												Great game overall, few bugs and those that pop up tend to be taken care of fairly quick. It is very Dungeon Keeper like and the narrator is just as pushy when I try to take my sweet time on mission but thats part of why I love it. Devs are very active aswell which is awesome. Thanks to the WFTO team for restoreing some of my faith in early access games.			"

												Really Enjoyable. If you enjoyed playing Dungeon Keeper then you'll enjoy this. Its very similar but it does have its own quirky levels. I still play DK2 fairly frequently now but since buying this a few days ago it has been taking all of the little free time I have.I've found myself yelling at the characters a few times when they seemed dumbstruck and just let themselves get hit without damaging back. The camera shape on the map doesn't seem to represent the area you are viewing on the screen either, it just feels off. This makes using the map to click to a different area very hit or miss.The levels do feel like they force you to complete them before you really want to. Quite often I'll hardly have established any base and I'll already be fighting the enemy and once you start they just continue to keep rolling in. I wouldn't mind but its starting to feel like this is EVERY level but aside from those bits it seems to play really well.Level 9 is probably the hardest level of them all.EDIT: Having now completed the game and onto the add on campaign. There is a quite big flaw to level 12 on the main campaign. The drawbridge - you can't cross it and neither can the enemy (even after youve got the levers to drop it. Now I still managed to complete it as the enemies were kind enough to come to the edge of the drawbridge and the flying demons managed to hit them. took a bit longer then it should have but I got there in the end.Also THE LAG ON LEVEL 12!! its unplayable at points, it actually crashed on my first attempt at the level (and I hadn't saved, RAGE) I haven't had any lag issues with the game until this point and my computer stats should easily run a game like this. It doesnt have issues with much more demanding games (I saved and quit to relaunch the game which seemed to help a bit)			"

												I like the game (and loved the original games many years ago too), but it has poor and hindering performance crippling the game sometimes. Try placing a 3 by 3 prison and it lags (but doesn't lag for any other scenarios generally (unless it memory leaks which happens on occation). It is very very annoying in the alt-tab scenarios where it has no windows icon often on the task bar, so u have to bring up ctrl, alt delete menu and use swtich to to give it focus again.			"

												Have an hour or two before work? This is idea and a fairly decent game. A few things dont please; The maps can be very predictable, the AI is all or nothing and your minions dont really have any relevance to their race. Feels a little like a 2 player game where you both have nukes and only nukes. It's not expensive, its entertaining and offers a good contender for a Dungeon Keeper themed game. Recommended? Yeah.

												Dungeon Keeper 2 was and is still one of my favourite games, I've reinstalled that game mulitple times to replay it but its always unstable and now as a Mac gamer I also have to run it through Crossover/Bootcamp, its a hassle. I've hoped for a new Dungeon Keeper for years so when I saw the kickstarter for WFTO I jumped straight onboard. I didn't play it while it was in beta, I wasn't interested in guiding the game through its development, I just wanted it made, I didn't play it when it first went Gold, I heard it was buggy, and read the message from Subterranean Games, so I waited a bit longer, until today...This has been sooo worth the wait, I'm only a few levels in but absolutely loving it, it looks fantastic and plays brilliantly and hearing Richard Riding's voice brings me straight back, thank you Subterranean Games for bringing this classic gameplay back to life with such love, I can finally throw away my DK 2 install disk!

												Recent Patches made the game playable! Finaly i could enjoy the campaign and the new creatures. The game graphics are nice, but i still want to talk about some features, which i didn't like as a DK1 fan. WftO is much as Dungeon Keeper 2 and made the same failures as DK2. Easily Destroyable Walls, Weak Traps, Creatures with only a few spells to cast! (I think 4 is the maximum for my lvl10 wizard-cultist)   :'(  If you think back to the very old DK1, the minions had many many more spells and it was so much better to watch them fight. I miss Dragonfire, Lightning and IronMaiden Lifesucking Spells, i miss ""Indy Traps"", Gas Trap, Lightning Trap, Hellfire Trap. The new creatures are all very nicely done, but if you expect a long awaited game close to Dungeon Keeper 1, this is not the right one. If you expect to buy a game as Dungeon Keeper 2, you will have fun with WftO!			"

So this is my perception of the gamefrom what I have played so far. - ITS FUN!It felt like time flies when I was playing this, from designing the layout of my dungeon to strategically designing layouts with maze like defences for enemy minions to fall into was satisfying.- Look and feel is greatthis game gave a look and feel of what the life of being a dark overlord would be like... - Easy to get a hang ofThe campaigne tutorial gave me a good idea on how to play the game, before I even hit level 3 I already had a basic idea of how the whole upgrade system worked.- Just the right amount of difficultyIt's not like where you get to a point where it is just frustrating, if you know wha you are doing you can really have a blast and enjoy unlocking upgrades in order to boost defences and minion powers. I think they did this really well.- Voice acting is annoyingfrom the minions to the narrator. it's entertaining at first but the voice acting is very limited and repetitive and gets annoying after awhile, but aside from the lame puns and the bad voice acting if you can overlook that it's just fun!- Sandbox mode and skirmish modethe different game modes are great and gives flexibility if you get bored of campaigne's I think the variety is important for keeping the game fun. They even added a survival mode which is a great time killer.- Game modes can get boring after awhileAs much as I actually enjoyed playing this game after a few days the game modes get boring, maybe because there isn't that much of them?

												I have played 9 campaign missions so far. This game feels like the real successor to the Dungeon Keeper series.+ Once again you feel like the evil overlord, slapping around your minions.+ Graphics are a lot better than those of DK2, but not too awesome.+ I like the new gameplay concepts such as beasts and constructs+ Campaign is fun so far, quite some variety in missions (capture this, destroy that, defend your base).- Switching between menus feels tiresome, where are my hotkeys?- I only use the healing spell, can't bother to click the others and find a suitable target (again hotkeys would help). I think they should have gone for a quick cast radial menu (can't think of an example). Right now it feels too fiddly to decide which spell you want to cast and then try to find a target (and then hope your spell had any effect).- The UI is not very clear. When I hover a room I expect to see a summary of capacity/size/usage etc (which Dungeons did right). They should also organize the event log by event type- The DK series felt a little more polished, but hey, this is an indie game, so they may fix the rough edges in future updates (I hope).Overall a pretty solid game, lots of fun new concepts, but a little rough around the edges.Edit: Currently the game suffers from frequent crashes. I hope they patch this around soon. Couldn't get past the 10th campaign level...Edit: It seems the latest patch resolved some memory leaks \o/			"

The level of control it offers, whilst keeping things managable, is very appealing.* The game offers various levels of difficulty. You can also slack off and just have fun with your dungeon. Those who want an extra challenge can try the Survival Mode.Overall, this is a pretty awesome game and fullfills nearly all expectations affiliated with this genre.

												I love DK when i was a kid which gave me fond and unique memories to think and imagine from time to time.If you love DK, don't hesitate to buy this game although still buggy, the develepors are continuously fixing it even at the time of writing of my review.  The developers like me are a big fan of DK series which gave me complete faith that they'll be doing what they can to fix everything they can.If you're new to this kind of game and you enjoy dungeon management, buy it! WFTO has a lot of potential. I'm all for supporting the developers. An artist myself, I can fully understand where they're coming from when they release WFTO at this state.			"

												I love Dungeon Keeper games but I don't love this. It's set together pretty poorly with a bad story and immense lag issues, or RAM issues, rather. During loading and during some of the later campaign maps it took 5-10 minutes for it to load, during this time the computer being completely unavailable, since WFTO is leeching all RAM, making it nearly impossible to even open up a new tab on Firefox. Furthermore, on the later campaign maps there would be constant small lagspikes making it very hard to properly manage the battles and what not. Many other minor problems here and there as well, lacking names and structures in rooms actually having 'Prop' before it's name...			"

												Performance issues and more stuttering than Jimmy from south park, huge memory leaks that slow down your entire system, the most brainless AI i've seen in a while, TONS of bugs and incomplete UI, uninteresting campaign consisting mostly of rush tactics and nothing else... It's a fun game when it works, i've dumped plenty of hours into it already but its too broken and hollow to truely recommend it in the current state that it's in. For all the funding it got from hopeful players of the original DK series there's no reason why it should be in this condition and just continues to prove that kickstarters and the like are wastes of money and only lead to disappointment.

												Progress with patches has been frequent but the bulk of the game is still unplayable or imbalanced and as far as I can tell will remain that way for a significant amount of time. Multiplayer matches are simply about making blobs of monsters by spamming rooms in an open style dungeon before setting a one-click rally to your opponent's core. The focus in patches thus far has been making the campaign playable and even then it isn't very long. Until multiplayer and survival modes are fleshed out with balance and community mapmaking I'll have to change my recommendation.			"

												It is an awesome game that looks and feels a whole lot like Dungeon Keeper 2. It has a number of new ideas that are a lot of fun to use. The biggest draw back at this moment are the bugs that keep popping up after updates, but it must be said that the developers are working really hard and releasing a lot of updates to counter this problem :-)In short I love this game and would reccomend it to anyone who loves DK2, but you may want to wait a while untill most of the kinks are smoothed out ;-)			"

												I have been looking for years for a remake of Dungeon Keeper (1 or 2) because it was one of the most fun games I have ever played. I found some similar, but never quite on par. This game however hits the nail on the head. So familiar (though I wish they could use the same characters) it is hard to tell the difference! I am glad they got the same voice actor as the narator for the campaign. The game is not only an amazing revamped version of Dungeon Keeper 2, but it is far improved! The unlock system from the archives is very cool. I also like the skill trees with a big bad creature you can summon at the end of each tree. I did not play this prior to the patch 1.11 everyone is talking about, but I can tell you now this game is polished and awesome with many modes of gameplay. I had been trying to port a stable version of DK2 for a while on my PC, but it would crash and whatnot so thank you for making this!!!!Everyone buy this so we can battle dungeons!!!!			"

												So I've been playing this game here and there since Beta.  I am amazed at how far along this game has come over the past year.  I was honestly worried for a little while that this would end up being just a ""cash grab"" for the Dev's however, they have religiously kept us all updated on the progress of the game and have really put in some long hours and hard work to make this game what it is today.  I finally played through the entire campaign and I LOVED the ending. Very fitting for a game of this type.  Now I'm ready to delve into some Multiplayer action although, it seems that there is not much to be had as I sit in a lobby for as long as I can stand (with no one joining) and then just give up and go off to play something else.  We need more players so we can have fast multiplayer matchups. This is something that the Dev's can't do, and it is up to you to give this game a shot. See you all in the underworld.			"

												** Update**  Since my last review the Dev team has clearly been very busy - I fired up the game last weekend and to my surprise, I was no longer having any of the previous performance issues. Game is now smooth, and more what I was expecting when I initially purchased it.Thank you dev team!For the dev team - the issue I was having was severe performance issues.  I have a fairly powerful machine, capable of running most games at high resolution.  When I would open the game, it would take about a mionute beforfe the main game screen would load.  Once in game, overall the performance was slow, but it would become unplayable on big maps with lots of units.  I even tried reducing the graphic level to low but it did not make a difference.Now, the game runs nice and smooth, as I would expect.  I hadn't played it in a while so I can't say exactly which patch resolved the issue.  I also upgraded to windows 10 - don't think this was the fix but it is the only significant change to my system.Initial review - This game is a poster child for why you should not buy games before they are completed.  Dev's are scrambling to release patches, 3 weeks later game still unplayable on windows 8.1			"

												After soooo many attempts, it's nice to find a Dungeon Keeper clone that actually does things right.  The story is interesting, the gameplay is excellent, and the references to other things is hilarious.  It's everything you could ask for in a much needed spiritual succesor to one of my favorite games of all time.The only problems I have are weird bugs that pop up every once in a while (like a mission starting and not triggering the voice overs and being stuck there until I restart the game, or the game freezing for no reason), but they're rare enough that they can be overlooked.

												Really been enjoying this new game, is a great adaptation from the old favourite dungeon keeper 2. Great character design and enjoyable extra features built on top of the DK2 set up like the skill tree addition. I would say that there could be a benefit to having a difficulty modifier as there seems to be a steep ramp up to extremely difficult on level 9 and can't seem to make any decent progress towards winning despite replaying many many times. despite this challenge I am enjoying so far but hope that can be tweaked. looking forward to seeing how this great game evolves!

												I honestly don't know if I can recommend this game in it's current state. the gameplay was good. very reminiscent of the Dungeon Keeper games, with a few bits added in, and of course a few bits taken away - and many that directly mirror the games themselves with renames or reskins, the campaign obviously wasn't as long, about 13 levels compared to DK2's 18. The narrator doesn't an excellent job, but there's minimal cutscenes, and what bothers me the most is the performance issues and bugginess of the game - several missions I retried because my game crashed so many times, and often saves would corrupt and you'd have to start anew. This was more of an issue on the last handful of missions where levels were much longer.In terms of difficulty I can't really say I struggled at all, the A.I. are particularly lassaiz faire, with the exception of Level 12 where you fight 3 'underlords' (referring back to a very similar mission in DK2, but their dungeon structure followed a straightforward pattern that I noticed very quickly (playing the level several times due to crashing and admittedly 1 or 2 restarts), however the last mission is very lacklustre, the enemy has a big base, but they throw very small raiding parties at you of size between 8 and 12 creatures of levels 6+, which is basically just a level farm for your minions, and you can attack whenever ready. The last mission was very glitchy though - loading in from a save just before a defeat (I was attacking and didn't notice a party) there were creature models missing, and the drawbridge was invisible. Also the ending is complete and utter bullcrap.Aside from this, the gameplay was fun, I did enjoy it as I love RTSs and it also had funny moments. I have yet to play any other modes or skirmishes but it was a shame that it's so buggy.			"

												Can I recommend it? Yes and no (as of April 2015)Yes:Wow, they really did it! This honestly looks, feels, sounds, tastes (well, maybe not that last one) like everything you liked in the original Dungeon Keeper series. This is a proper and real successor and I recommend any fan of DK to throw away anything in their hands and try this game. I cannot applaud the developers enough, well done!No:Not yet, at least.The game is simply not really done and ready for proper release just yet. On the positive side the developers are working like crazy releasing patches so I have my hopes up. The current state feels like a beta. A lot of things works very well, it's certainly playable, but you're constantly reminded of the game state by unpolished edges. To name some:- Performance bugs: Even with a PC above recommended specs, every now and then you'll experience extreme slowdowns making the game unplayable. For now, a workaround for me is to exit the game and restart after each finished level. That seems to fix most of it.- You'll see developer placemarkers for text, debugging or the like in the descriptions of creatures and rooms, instant immersion break right there.- The campaign works but is quite unpolished. The campaign has a lot of different types of objectives and introduces new features steadily but often the education of new players gets lost, and they'll never get to try out their newly acquired knowledge before having lost the level and forced to start over.- Another thing in the campaign is that your trusty mentor will often tell stories or talk to your enemies, though regularly these get mixed up and are played in the wrong order.- The campaign level difficulty is rather random. You can play the same map twice in a row. The first time might be a hectic, stressful experience, trying to figure out how new things work, getting to know your enemy, etc., only to lose because it's almost impossible. The next time you play the same map, it's a rather peaceful experience, you got lots of time to build your base, explore and react.I might add more when I remember it but these are, for me, major things that need to get fixed before the game unofficially can get out of beta.Still, despite all of this and all the frustrations, the game is awesome. It just needs a bit more time to really shine.			"

												The War For The Overworld is a decent and fun game, those who haven't played the classic Dungeon Keeper should give it a go since its the closest game that comes close to that style of strategy genre. You could say Dungeon, is similar but it maybe have elements of it however it tries to be different by adding RPG elements into it, which Dungeon Keeper isn't in anyway although it does have creature leveling.What I'm saying is that if you want a really close experience that is the same unqiue feeling that you got from Dungeon Keeper, this game is great, if you haven't then its a great experience.However even though I would recommend this game, it does not quite as well outshine the classic but by its own rights, it is a great game.Here check out my video below for my First Impression

It has been enjoyale seeing the game progress, however I feel the game should not be available to buy yet as there are many bugs that still need to be ironed out. I tried many times to complete level 12, which is quite hard, only to have it crash every single time. I then came to my senses and realized that I could save the game. This said, once the game was loaded from a saved position, it's like the enemy AI had completely disappeared, and i could charge in with almost no resisitence.I completed level 13 with almost nobody in the enemy base. I still don't know if that was a bug, or the way it was designed to be. After completing it I was looking around for the next level, before realizing that the game was over. I keep waiting for the multiplayer part to be completed, but as of yet nothing.In saying all this, I would still recommend the game as when it does work, it is enjoyable to play. Most levels require very little effort to complete, and most features, eg: half the potions, are completely unneeded, but if you are a fan of the old Dungeon Keeper series, I believe you would still enjoy exploring the levels.Hopefully the game will be improved upon soon, at the moment I would estimate that the game can be completed within 30 - 40 hours maximum (if you save your progress so you don't have to start again each time it crashes) "

												You can tell that the developers really loved Dungeon Keeper, and wanted to do it justice in a spiritual sequel. It's a little buggy right now, but I still love it, and would recommend it to anyone who either liked on Dungeon Keeper or feels that good guys winning all the time just isn't fair.			"

												Fun and fairly deep clone of the classic Dungeon Keeper series. I haven't played anything in the many years since DK2 that felt as much like a sequel. Good voice acting and that classic tongue-in-cheer humor. Props to the developers for an excellent early-access game and the steady stream of improvements and new content.Worth the money!			"

												---------- Slot1Gamer.com Early Access Reviews --------Game is fun, a shame that the Dungeon Keeper trademark ran out :(This game needs more work, it doesn't handle resources well and will run very slow on most systems.Pros: Fun gameplay, If you loved dungeon keeper you'll like this one.Cons: Poor resource management, gameplay and voice acting is a little too childish and almost seems to make fun of the original games.Wait for the full game review once the game is finished.

												Helloonly the 9th level is a little harder, you should be more progressive and make other levels harder (even after 9th !!!!!).Problem with zoom, I can't zoom out after have zoomed in, and we can't step back enough to have a better view.is that useful to have so many different creatures ?? i don't think so... dev' have lost time on these numerous creatures instead of work on other contents.Well, a lot disapointed after i have finished the game, so easy !! not funny, no humor, no ambience, no good music, and an expensive game !! this kind of game is good for a true solo campaign, and this one doesn't exist.... so short and boring. Dungeons II is better for ambience and several language speaked (french for me). after there is also defaults but that's a finished game with a style and humor.			"

												i love the old dungeon keeper games, and this game made me really excited, but this game isent finished, like everyone else says, and in its current state i wont recommend it to anyone, not even the die-hard fans of dungeon keeper. as the game stands now,(i havent finished the campaigne because my game keeps crashing or bugging out) you have a campaigne which doesnt work half the time, and as the game is now, there are only the campaigne, yes you heard me right, no multiplayer, only 3 skirmish maps, and lets not talk about the sandbox mode... i must also say that there are many things i love about this game, many new great ideas, and the game doesnt feel like a copy-cat.but, dont buy this game before they finish it...

												I have read a lot of negative reviews about WFTO - and they have a point. Certainly some elements of the game are not finished or polished, and it still suffers from a few bugs.What you have here is the spriitual successor to one of the great game franchises of the past couple of decades - Dungeon Keeper. A modernised version of a classic, and so far the developers have been very active with constant updates and fixes, which is a major plus point.The game is far from perfect, but for fans of the genre and of the DK series, WFTO is a nice way to reminisce about the good old days, its only missing the Horned Reaper himself.As things stand I recommend the game despite its shortcomings.

												Recent Patches made the game playable! Finaly i could enjoy the campaign and the new creatures. The game graphics are nice, but i still want to talk about some features, which i didn't like as a DK1 fan. WftO is much as Dungeon Keeper 2 and made the same failures as DK2. Easily Destroyable Walls, Weak Traps, Creatures with only a few spells to cast! (I think 4 is the maximum for my lvl10 wizard-cultist)   :'(  If you think back to the very old DK1, the minions had many many more spells and it was so much better to watch them fight. I miss Dragonfire, Lightning and IronMaiden Lifesucking Spells, i miss ""Indy Traps"", Gas Trap, Lightning Trap, Hellfire Trap. The new creatures are all very nicely done, but if you expect a long awaited game close to Dungeon Keeper 1, this is not the right one. If you expect to buy a game as Dungeon Keeper 2, you will have fun with WftO!			"

												I have played 9 campaign missions so far. This game feels like the real successor to the Dungeon Keeper series.+ Once again you feel like the evil overlord, slapping around your minions.+ Graphics are a lot better than those of DK2, but not too awesome.+ I like the new gameplay concepts such as beasts and constructs+ Campaign is fun so far, quite some variety in missions (capture this, destroy that, defend your base).- Switching between menus feels tiresome, where are my hotkeys?- I only use the healing spell, can't bother to click the others and find a suitable target (again hotkeys would help). I think they should have gone for a quick cast radial menu (can't think of an example). Right now it feels too fiddly to decide which spell you want to cast and then try to find a target (and then hope your spell had any effect).- The UI is not very clear. When I hover a room I expect to see a summary of capacity/size/usage etc (which Dungeons did right). They should also organize the event log by event type- The DK series felt a little more polished, but hey, this is an indie game, so they may fix the rough edges in future updates (I hope).Overall a pretty solid game, lots of fun new concepts, but a little rough around the edges.Edit: Currently the game suffers from frequent crashes. I hope they patch this around soon. Couldn't get past the 10th campaign level...Edit: It seems the latest patch resolved some memory leaks \o/			"

Early Access Review
								A faithful, intentional sucessor to the Dungeon Keeper franchise. It lacks some of the quirky charm, but is very impressive regardless. There have been very rapid developments in the past month or so which have left it feeling more like a game than a beta, and even if there is still a way to go, things are looking good.- The design is frankly, beautiful. it captures the feel of the classic dungeon keeper games perfectly.- The UI is... less impressive. It's functional, but feels somewhat rushed in places.- The creatures are interesting, but lack some of the character that the Dungeon Keeper creatures had.- Sound effects are a little repetitive, but tend to be very nice.Overall, it's a beta and it shows. Some things seem missing - animations occasionally feel like bland placeholders, there aren't a great variety of levels to play and so on and so forth... That said, it's already an impressive game and I can only see it improving as times goes on.			"

The state this game is in does not warrant purchase.My 16GB of RAM machine hit 100% thanks to a memory leak. Pay Day causes machines to lock up for numerous seconds.

My own Vampire attacking my core and no way to stop it from killing it even after it's lair was destroyed... Ghouls beeing stuck in the crypt after Necromancer leaves the room (after reaload)...

												A worthy spiritual succesor to one of my all time favorite games, Dungeon Keeper. A lot of fun and familiar factors to add to the experience. One thing I would like to point out though, is that the dungeon doesnt feel as much 'alive' as it probably should. The game is inevitably compared to Dungeon Keeper, where the creatures always seemed to be going about their business, training, eating, having fun, guarding, etc. This is something I am missing so far in War for the Overworld. Sure, they move around, they prepare for combat and they keep themselves alive, but it doesnt feel like a living and breathing 'society'.I am greatly looking forward to future imporvement, a lot of bugs and issues have already been removed. I have total faith in the potential of the game and the talented developers.			"

												I would recommend this if you're looking for a basic Dungeon Keeper with a few niche extras, but it still needs a lot of work.I have a list of things I'd like to see happen throughout development, other than obviously fixing bugs and planned updates. 1. Slower and larger levels in the campaign, seems very fast pased atm, which is fine for some levels, but not all. 2.  More 'options' options, rebindable keys etc. 3. Improved UI - updated tooltips etc. 4. Improve AI - minions are all over the place, not reacting to enemies, commands etc. 5. Animation of struggling minions when they're picked up. This is just a few things, will probably think of more later.			"

												There are many great things in this game. Most of them stem from the Dungeon Keeper influence. The humor, voice acting, and artwork are all superb.There are also a few design issues that are a bit annoying. The campaign's tutorial sections are mandatory and can cause issues when loading a saved game. Not allowing the player to build anywhere but the glowing area is annoying and problematic.As much as I loved DK1 and DK2, and see much of the spirit revived in War for the Overworld, it just isn't ready for release.With some time to polish, I'd happily jump back into this charming little title. Until then, there are too many annoyances getting in the way of enjoying the game, the majority of it coming from technical issues.			"

Very similar to the original game in many ways.Old negative review -Talk about a game that has VERY LITTLE to teach you what is going on.  No to little instructions. Good luck trying to figure this game out.  Guess it's time to dig the internet and watch lame videos to figure this lame instructions.  DEVELOPERS, next time put a little more effor into teaching us what is going on.  What is everything?  Lame job on training.			"
