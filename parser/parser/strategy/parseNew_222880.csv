InsurgencyNote: Each field is weighted differently, and thus affects the overall score differently.  Field Rating Review   Graphics 7 Visually, Insurgency isn't anything special, but the detail put into the guns is extremely well done. Nothing here will jar you out of enjoying the game, though there are some quirky animation glitches that give some good laughs.   Gameplay 9 Hands down one of the most intense firefight games I have ever played. If you want to win, you need to be tactical, or you're going to get picked off real fast. The firefights are intensified through audio and visual effects, from the crack of a sniper's bullet, to the hiss of a round passing by your head, to the pings and putters of the bullets hitting the environment around you. The controls are solid, and lend themselves to improve the gamplay (there is lean in this game, use it). With several different game modes to choose from, including playing against AI bots, you're able to have hours of endless fun without getting bored. There is a timer between spawns, but it goes fairly quick, and spectating your friends is entertaining in and of itself.   Story N/A You're a soldier in Iraq. That's about as deep as it gets.   Multiplayer 10 The mixture of new gameplay styles (you can't just run and gun here, you'll die), tactics, and some funny glitches on occassion, add up to be one of the most wonderful times I have had playing a game with friends in a long, long time. There are many, many laughs to be had here. If you're into moving tactically, this game is also your ticket to a good time. Even if that's not your thing you'll enjoy this one.  Some tidbits of my friend's and I playing, for everyone curious (I did not create the video, was merely playing with them at the time): Insurgency Gameplay   Replayability 10 This one will keep you coming back for a long, long time. With free DLC releases containing new content, and the recently boosted community, there are few things to keep you from returning to play another round of Insurgency with your friends.   Overall 9.2/10 I'll be honest, I didn't expect to have such a grand time with Insurgency, but it is easily the most fun I have had with a group of friends in several years. If you're playing this one alone, it's good. But when you're playing it with buddies, it is absolutely grand. A refreshing game in a field of run-and-gun FPS games, demanding you to take your time and not go rambo.

												Insurgency is a strange animal - a blend of various ideas characterized by other games like Counter-Strike, Red Orchestra, and the cult classic Firearms mod - that manages to do a very good job at providing a tactical, hardcore shooter experience.On paper, Insurgency seems very normal - two teams, the classic push/conquest/objective style game types, and guns. However, that's pretty much all Insurgency has in common with its modern military shooter bretheren. Insurgency is mechanically a very different beast. Let's start with spawns - instead of having reinforcement pools like Battlefield or Red Orchestra, Insurgency uses spawn waves to regulate gameplay flow. It sounds weird, sure, but it works extremely well in practice. Let's take a basic game mode, Skirmish. Five objective points, conquest style. Each team's closest points to defend are objectives that can be destroyed, which removes them from the map and tightens up the cap order. Each team starts with 2 spawn waves. These spawn waves kick in every 60 seconds or so. Anyone alive by then stays alive, anyone dead by the end of this timer comes back. Every time an objective is captured, another spawn wave is added to the capping team. This means that players are not only incentivized to do objectives in order to extend their own playtime, but it also increases the team's overall effectiveness. It also means that rounds can take a while or be over extremely quickly depending on the degree of teamwork and individual player ability to stay alive.The other thing that this game does very well mechanically is its gunfights. In other tactical realism games like Red Orchestra or ARMA, an average engagement is a sniper fest - whoever sees 'em first ends it pretty much instantly. Now don't get me wrong, Insurgency has its share of ingloriously quick deaths and sniping corridors, but an average medium-range gunbattle can often devolve into a stand-up fight involving suppression, repositioning, and grenades, much like a real fight. Part of this is enabled by the fantastic sound design and particle effects - guns are spectacularly loud, a blinding amount of smoke and dust gets kicked up from fully automatic fire, and suppression effects seriously mess with a player's accuracy. Ducking away from a window to have a burst of automatic fire rip up where you were just seconds ago is quite unnerving. Insurgency also seems to be one of the few games that really understands that shooting a real firearm often results in a sort of almost-blindness from the muzzle blast and recoil, which makes attempting to shoot enemies less of a ""line-up-and-click"" moment and more of ""frantically fire in their general direction and hope they don't shoot back"". tl;dr: the guns feel realistic and meaty, and getting shot at is freaky.With that said, however, I must be clear with you - Insurgency is NOT a game attempting infantry combat simulation like ARMA or Red Orchestra. The accuracy and damage dealt by the game's large selection of weapons is on par with those kinds of games, but this is also a game tuned for balance and fun. There isn't any superflous mechanics like changing the zeroing on your ironsights or wounding (like RO2 does), but it does make thematic concessions, like fully animated fire selector switches. The inventory and loadout system also emphasizes that it's still very much a game . The end of rounds gives your team Supply Points, which you can then use to build your character's weapons kit. You can equip armor to hopefully increase your survivability by a shot or two, attach a 4x scope to your SKS to plink at range with it, or shunt your points into a slow-handling rocket launcher, which is good for objectives and heavy suppression. There is  no grindy metagame progression system like Call of Duty. It's just the loadout and inventory - all based on your team's performance in and out of rounds. Kind of like Counter-Strike!As someone who cut their teeth on games like Red Orchestra, I can say this about Insurgency: it is NOT the most hardcore, realistic shooter I've played, but it is most definitely the most FUN I've had with a realistic team-based shooter! For an early access game, they have a very good product released as of this date (12/29/13). I haven't had a single crash yet, it looks amazing, and runs like a dream! They also have quite a selection of maps and well-balanced gameplay to top it all off. If what I've said sounds good at all to you, go on and get this game, even if it isn't on sale. It's worth it.

												One of the best FPS game I have ever played. It's more realistic than Counter Strike, but not as hardcore as Arma. By default, there are no health bars, no ammo indicators, no crosshairs and no kill messages. Kill messages can be toggled on by the server.Enemies drop quick in this game if you're using AP rounds; usually in 1-2 shots. The 'sniper guns' (M14,FAL, M40A1, Mosin) will kill in one shot with AP ammo, even if the target has heavy armor. All guns will kill with one shot to the head. Most bullets that are able to pass through a wall, will retain enough energy to kill someone in one shot to the head. Guns shoot straight, you don't get an unrealistic spread cone like Counter Strike and shotguns are still lethal long range using slugs. Suppressive fire exists and it's tactical. However, there is no bullet drop at all. Teamwork, heavy armor and being tactical wins the game. This game also has a better community and less 12 year olds than most FPS games such as Counter Strike and Call of Duty. The best gamemode and the one I play most often is Ambush. Even though I got this game for 25 cents ($1 for a 4 pack in a humble bundle). It is worth the $15 in its entirety. I highly recommend this game.			"

												Insurgency is a refreshingly new intense multiplayer FPS.Expect no kill cam, no crosshairs, no radar, no medic or healing. No enemy damage notification. This is all hardcore realism of fun!Maps offer a good mix for long open lanes for snipers and confined areas for short range encounters. 8 Game modes from Firefight, Search & Destroy, Skirmish, Strike, Push and so on. There are also Co-operative missions.Gun loadouts lets you choose various amount of classes before the game starts, from support, rifleman, sniper, assault, sharpshooter and so many more. While customising your build, each costs a amount of points, but your choices will also effect your weight, the more you carry the slower you move.It's still has a active server population of roughly 1500 people online who play it daily. And the developers have continued to add new content to the game.If you are into these tactical shooters, and you're also looking for a truly immersive combat experience, then this game could be for you. I've been enjoying playing for many hours now, so incredibly addictive and challenging. Highly recommended!			"

												I decided to hold off on writing a review until there were a few more updates and for me to have at least 500+ hours invested into the game. I am going to keep this straight up what i think about it as a whole with no fluff. Short and sweet.Should you get it? It depends on what type of fps's you like. Many CS players have fell in love with it because they like the realism and they've grown tired of the arcade feel that most other shooters have. Don't doubt it for a second, this game is hard to pick up on but once you do, you realize how well reflexes really help if you're rushing but don't expect to be 360 no-scoping people because there is almost no chance in hell that that will happen. Those with good aim that are looking down sight as you turn a corner will get you every time so this is a game best played instinctively and safe (just don't be one of those snipers that sit at spawn and let the enemy capture everything). There are few grenade, C4, or launcher spots that few people know of and use at the start of some maps which can be frustrating, so that is why I'm really hoping that much larger maps will be released in the future that are more open and don't feel as constrained/guided (Heights and Buhriz are like that but i still love them). Maps that were easy to spawn camp have been updated heavily to prevent that which is great. The devs are absolutely brilliant at balancing and opening new areas of maps, always on top of it so kudos to them. Community engagement is stronger than i've ever seen it, there was a public playtest of player submitted maps that were voted on in hopes of them being added to the game and the rise of The Digital Gaming League is starting their first official Insurgency competitive season with a multitude of teams signed up. The Nightfall update just added so much more to the game, it feels totally different than it used to in every good way possible. Noises are made when crossing though brush and leaning, leaning mechanic feels more 'stiff' (meaning not fluidly unnatural), the night vision is spot on and well-balanced, flares look awesome in the night sky, but my only complaint is that the running animations with weapons look kinda wonky now, i preffered it the way it was before but i won't nit-pick things for the sake of the length of this review. Also the new co-op survival is an amazing idea, i could see myself spending hours on that alone with friends. I could write a list of 10,000 reasons to get this game but none of that could possibly describe the feeling that it would give you if you were playing it yourself. It needs to be experienced, the feelings it gives never dies and that in itself says something. Kills are rewarding, objectives are highly valued, teamwork is vital. You need this game in your life if you are looking for a realistic shooter!*12/20/14 edited formatting*NEW UPDATE! 5/3/161,290 hours logged, i just can't seem to get enough. New maps, improvements, feautures, etc. OH and a new Insurgency game is coming out soon hell yea! Community is growing steadily, a lot more Pick Up Games (PUG's) than there used to be when i wrote this review for those interested in competitive. My only wish is for ranked competitive matchmaking to exist instead of the typical unranked. The future of Insurgency is looking very healthy!			"

Intense & Atmospheric // Attractive For Team-Players+ Agreeable balance in multiplayer+ The game's audio is superb and offers some of the better sound effects I've ever heard in a multiplayer FPS+ Weapon-kit customization is excellent, intuitive and well-rounded+ The game boasts a healthy variety of firearms, peripherals and equipment+ Movement feels largely fluid and realistic (save for some hit-detection issues when entering doorways, but to this, one quickly adapts)+ Menu interface is very minimalist and aesthetically pleasing+ Multiplayer places an overwhelming emphasis on vocal communication and team synergy; while this can be problematic in a new server, it makes for an incredibly rewarding experience when you insert yourself into a competent group of individuals+ Variety of entertaining game-modes (despite many large and glaring similarities between them, though this does not take much away from the game in my experience)+ Seemingly realistic hit-detection and bullet-spread+ There is no microtransaction or pay-to-win mechanic in this game, and the unforgiving gameplay makes the multiplayer entirely skill-dependent+ All weapons and equipment are, for all intents and purposes, 'unlocked' from the outset; weapon selection is based upon selected class and available weight distribution, which appears to be more lax as your account accrues experience+ Detail put into firearms is impressive+ Very, very high replayability+ Healthy, competitive player-base+ No HUD, which lends a feeling of maturity to the experience+ Night maps serve to give the existing map selection a greater measure of replayability, and add significantly to the level of challenge- Quite a few bugs and glitches; this includes a handful of CTDs- Environmental textures and visuals are lacking (though not drastically)- Learning curve is initially a bit steep, and may deter more casual gamers- In regard to night maps, night-vision is near mandatory (flashlights make you a prime target in a game that distinctly punishes such behavior), yet it sucks up a massive portion of your weight limit, severely hampering the usefulness of the rest of your kit; it seems to me that the weight of the item is unbalanced and punishes newer players to an inordinate degreeLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												*UPDATED* - I bought this in the sale for like £3 and I honestly feel like I've scammed the developer...Realistic atmosphereGreat gunsIncredible communitySniping is... just so much damn fun and it's one of the few games which actually gets the scope-zoom right!Imagine Counter-Strike, Battlefield and Red Orchestra all got together and had a baby10/10Update - After owning this game for about 2 and a half years now, I am truly astonished with how New World Interactive is treating this game. The game, even in Early Access (I think it was EA anyway, or could've been just a beta) was pretty damn good and yet they have never stopped improving it and trying to make it the best it can possibly be. Even now, they're starting to port the whole game over to Unreal Engine 4, add a campaign story and also add esports elements.. If I had the spare money, I would honestly buy the game again and gift it to a random friend who may want it just to show my gratitude to such an incredible development team who deserve every penny that they make. Bravo, NWI! It is just a shame the 'big boys' don't copy you.. (Ubisoft, EA etc). A truly incredible development team with an even better game! <3			"

												TL;DR: Rainbow Six + Red Orchestra + a bit of Counter-Strike and a sprinkle of attachments like Battlefield but without dumb unlocks.  A solid tactical shooter with a slow pace and punishing time-to-kill where a few bullets will take you down.    Insurgency is Rainbow Six in Iraq with lots of sudden death and PTSD and jumping because you're shot out of nowhere.  It's a game of hide-and-seek with laser sights betraying their owner's position and footsteps betraying your own position.  Imagine if Red Orchestra had a baby with Rainbow Six.  It's got a lot of that in its blood.  In fact, one of the original devs for RO is the guy behind Insurgency.  Now, the hypothetical RainbowOrchestra child was raised by Counter-Strike.  Some round-based game modes and not all of them have respawns without some major coordination.  It's a tense package where you might go with no kills or a lot, depending on how well you can plan ahead with your teammates because if you don't get the drop on your enemies, you're dead before the bullets leave the chamber.  If you liked the mod, you'll like this.  If you like Red Orch but in the scale of the older Rainbow Six games, you'll like this.  On a scale of 20, I give it three thumbs up and -25% off coupon to a medium 2-topping pizza at participating locations.  Would recommend.			"

												Insurgency is a HARDCORE FPS at its finest which doesn't follow current FPS trend. The game strips you of most realism shooter mechanics such as a cross hair and simply says hunt or survive. From my point of view it combines all the best features of Counter Strike , Red Orchestra and Arma. This game has a very good sense of realism in that there are no hit indicators to tell you where you've been shot from, it doesn't take many shots to kill - fewer from the neck up - and the only feature that breaks the realism is the small indicators to show you that the person next to you is a teammate, and also where the objectives are. That's it! No radar either, which makes the game even more involving. And friendly fire is always on at any time and it is forgivable. However, I would not recommend this game to people who ONLY like really arcadey shooters like CoD and BF since these two are really casual comparing with Insurgency. But if you really try to explore this game, well I would say you may find much more teamwork and strategies here. What I love the most about this game is how difficult it is, and how it focuses upon tactical play and cooperation with your teammates. I haven’t seen a game like Insurgency for a long time(except for CS:GO), We need more games like Insurgency, and less of the CoD Advanced Bulls**t that we are overwhelmed with nowadays. This is a game will never disapoint you .			"

												I started playing Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat many, many years ago as a mod. As soon as I heard they were making a standalone, I bought it without thinking twice. Throughout early access, the developers listened to what the community had to say, and made changes accordingly. I have heard the developers say several times that they 'made it to play it.' This is the best mindset a developer could have, and it shows. Even though the kickstarter for Insurgency failed, the developers managed to keep it alive long enough to enter early access on steam. Their dedication to this game is really amazing.	The game has a minimal HUD, meaning your screen isn't cluttered up with useless things, such as a minimap. They also implemented a 3D VOIP system that allows you to hear anyone, including the enemy, at a realistic distance. If you decide to talk to a squad member over the radio and an enemy just so happens to be on the other side of a doorway, god bless. It requires a good amount of teamwork and communication in order to win. There are a large amount of original game modes. Some of these modes were taken directly from the mod (such as Push), and some are brand new (Ambush). All of the game modes are original, and are mostly based off of capturing points, rather than getting kills.	One of the main problems I had with Red Orchesta 2 was the super clunky movement controls. This game has very smooth controls, but still manages to keep it medium paced. You will find it necessary to rush a corner sometimes, and other times you may need to wait for the enemy to move up. Running and gunning in this game is very, very hard to do. 	When Insurgency was released from early access, the developers decided that it was in their best interest to LOWER THE PRICE. Games that come out of early access usually RAISE their prices, but the developers of Insurgency decided to cut the price down and increase the playerbase. If that's not dedicated, I don't know what is. 	This game is easily up there with the $60 games, and you can get it for 15 bucks or less. I have played over 600 hours, and I loved every minute.			"

												Red Orchestra: Modern Warfare.The gunplay is amazing: I never thought that such detailed recoil and bullet penetration are possible on Source.If that alone is not enough for you, here is why you should buy it: *  Game is under active development. The version I bought in August and what I have at December are different. It feels like it's a sequel already: map design, ui, gameplay, sounds - everything evolved and changed in a positive way. And developers are not afraid of hotfixes. That's how you do an Early Access. *  The sound. If you have good sound card and speakers/headphones setup, you'll hear one of the best gunshots sounds. At Least the best I ever heard. Yes, it's better than War Tapes settings for BF:BC2 or BF3. While it's not yet enabled for all maps, ones like District are just a joy to listen in 5.1. *  The weapon handling is very well done. It feels like the real thing, it looks like the real thing, it kills. Like the real thing. Attachments are done right too. You don't consider them like an upgrades, they are to change weapon behavior in a special way. Most of the time I'm using the gun in plain ironsight mode because it fit my play style more. *  Contains 5 different game modes for each map, like Skirmish from the original mod, all classic team deathmatch, Firefight (last team standing), VIP escort and everyone's favorite Push (aka Rush, aka attack-defense).

												A overall amazing game, has potential to compete with shooters like CS:GO, Battlefield and even Arma to some extent.Gun mechanics are finally a break from the ""you have 90 bullets in your ar-15 and they magically go in your mag when reloading"".Some quality-of-life and realism improvements/Things I'd like to see:-More guns-More character interaction (the character voice interaction is A1 in this game)-Surpression being more useful (making your screen a little bit blurry doesnt do that much. Especially support classes would benefit from this, as their main role is to lay down surpression fire over long distances. Maybe make it so if you get surpressed, you start to yell more, giving away your position, and maybe being more innacurate)-Maybe make it so, when you are being surpressed or in adrenaline rush, you reload faster or something?-When you aim down sights while standing for too long, your hands get tired and your sights/scopes start to sway (depending on gun weight. (This will help against rpg's maybe?)-Clips for Mosin?-More voice interaction-Make it so when you are in need to switch to your handgun/get a grenade you can drop your weapon instead of holsting it then slowly taking out your throwable/gun. Maybe we will see inclusion of shoulder gun belts?-More voice interaction pleaseOverall, I rate this game 8.9/10 Also, props to /k/ for suggestionsEDIT: -Guns are noisy as ♥♥♥♥ in real life, especially LMG's, sniper rifles and shotguns indoors. If you keep spamming that LMB you will probably get some ear disease. Add earpro as a accessory. This will also make surpressors more useful (by the way, surpressors DON'T make the gun go ""phoosh"". They're still loud).-Make going prone faster, like plunching yourself on your belly, when getting fired at-Muzzle flashes are a big deal when shooting at night.EDIT 2:-Add a .357 revolver that you can load either .357 rounds or .38spc rounds (obviously, the 357rounds will do more damage but will kick a lot more, and the .38spc rounds will have much less recoil (due to the low power and gun weight) but will damage less, making it a good hit-and-run weapon maybe?-Maybe add so you can adjust grain ammount in bullets, maybe make a Hollow point +P abomination rifle that will one-shot unarmored opponents?

												You dash toward the corner, barely escaping a rain of bullets down the hallway, mowing down your teammates in front of you. You take a second to adjust your position, then quickly peek around the corner and unloaded a burst of AK rounds into that barely conceivable shadow of the enemy behind the counter in the dark room.You go flank alone, sneak into the next room and see three enemies' back facing you. You swore under your breath that you didn't spend a few points on a suppressor, take a deep breath to stop yourself from panicing out and shooting uncontrollably, then fire a short quick burst into each of their asses before they realize what's happening.As you charge toward the bomb site, you literally run into an enemy. Both of you freak out and started blind-fire, your gun start to shake as his bullests thunder by and your vision turns blurry from his muzzle blast, but you get lucky and managed to knock him down before he gets to it first.You're sure the sound of that shot came from above that giant rock in front of you. You kneel down, slowly and surely move up the gravel slope, trying to cover every angle in front of you without making any sound. As you climb to the top, you look around carefully and finally see that sniper bellying behind that bush, his giant boots betraying his position. You smirk, switch to your knife and sink the blade deeply into his exposed butt.=======Those are all real Insurgency moments I had during the beta. Long time Insurgency player since the original mod, and dare I say that Insurgency is the best infantry combat game out there. It's slightly arcady in the sense that you don't need to learn 25,000 key mappings to do things down to knee-jerking. It's realistic in the sense that your HUD is stripped down to minimal which means, one, you actually have to look hard to tell what you're shooting; two, your view is super clear for you to do so.Insurgency managed to explain the term ""firefight"" in the purest form. On smaller, Tactical game modes, you'll see players break into small groups or single out, followed by short gunfights breaking out across the map. On larger, Sustained game modes, it's common to see many players grouping up, taking points, pushing and holding for objectives while exchanging franantic automatic fire.Those adrenalin rushes. Oh, so good.			"

												Insurgency is relatively realistic. It looks like a Ken Burns documentary compared to Call of Duty’s and Battlefield’s more Hollywood approach. For one thing, your screen isn’t filled with information. You have no health bar, no compass, no map, and no aiming reticule. Flashy text doesn’t congratulate you after every kill.Without it, Insurgency looks cleaner and more authentic than its peers, letting you focus on strategy and action instead of keeping track of an enemy’s location on a minimap in the corner of the screen.Insurgency also doesn’t have a lot of the flash you see in modern shooters.At first glance, you’ll want to compare Insurgency to Counter-Strike. Both are competitive, team-based shooters that pit terrorists against counter-terrorist forces, but the two play differently. While you only get one life per a round of Counter-Strike, most game modes in Insurgency permit you to revive your entire team if you complete an objective, like capturing a certain point on the map or destroying a weapon cache.This dynamic provides for some fun comebacks.Insurgency offers roles like demotion, sniper, and recon, but you can’t necessarily be whatever you want. Each match offers a set number of slots for each class. The available loadouts change depending on the map and mode you’re playing. Since Insurgency is so much more realistic than most shooters, it’s also a good deal more complicated and less forgiving.Also, you won’t find any sort of training or single-player mode, so your only option if you want to improve is to jump into some online matches and suffer through some punishment. Insurgency was originally a Source-based mod, but this standalone release still uses the almost 10-year-old game engine. As a result, Insurgency isn’t the most-detailed game, with a lot of textures looking flat and dated. Ultimately, Insurgency is going to win fans for its gameplay. The action is highly competitive and focused.Sure, it doesn’t have the flash that most shooters proudly throw at your face these days, but Insurgency’s quieter, more realistic, and tenser take on modern warfare deserves a look, especially if you’re tired of instant knife kills and exploding buildings.

												InsurgencyScroll to bottom for a quick SummaryWhat is Insurgency?A tactical first person shooter that emphasis on communication and strategy.Made with the source engine this game may not look pretty but for the gameplay it really doesn't need to.The gameplay is not for the rambo's of the community, what I mean by saying that is you cannot rush in guns blazing, the hp in this game makes most deaths near to instant.  This makes the pace of alot more rythmic and steady, forcing you to check that corner , make sure the objectives are clear etc. This by no means makes your ability to aim  any less important, the game being focused on realism makes weapons with heavy recoil and bright muzzle flashes.  There is no killing based objective mode in Insurgency, each mode is heavily objective based forcing you to work with your team to capture the objective, each team has a certain ammount of waves that determine the games length, so those more intent on fragging are still aiding the team.Unfortunately some game modes are fairly boring and some are completely unbalanced for certain sides.Co-opA really big feature of this game, up to 8 people per map can work your way through a series of modes that will test your skill and communication against bots that really do live up to the ""Brutal"" difficulty. There are no mistakesFailure when your whole team dies, you can respawn your team when an objective is captured, Coop is a really enjoyable addition, just as challenging and popular as multiplayer it will keep you on your toes constantly.The game is altogether alot of fun and for alot of people there is a good chance that this will become a regular pasttime of yours.Graphics - 4/10+ Really catches the atmosphere+ Workshop support can upgrade some aspects-Source engine really shows its age-Lots of textures are repeated-Not clear what objects have different levels of bullet penetrationGameplay - 7/10+Really fun teamwork based +You are forced to play the role you pick to a degree+Workshop can add alot of fun additions+ Maps are well made and most are well balanced+Leaderboards and Mvp Displays really give you a sense of achievement and encourage competition+Coop is really good+Night maps make for a nice change and add whole new elements to the game+Great sound and immersion+A different way to approach most situations-Some game modes sadly require blatant camping-Some game modes are very unbalanced-Some guns are wildly underpowered or overpowered-Workshop allows performance enhancing addons (Clearer sights , player models, etc )-Anti Cheat is lacking-Connection to steam servers can be dodgyOverall6/10Agree or disagree with something in the review?Comment please, all feedback is appreciatedHope this helps :) "

												My friend told me this game looked like Call of Duty. I laughed. Then, I did what any reasonable person would do. Pulling out a claymore, I screamed ALLAHU AKBAR at the top of my lungs as I sacrificed myself for Allah and wiped his ignorant face off the planet.Actual review:I hated this game when I first got it. Looks like a fast paced shooter, right? I downloaded it, deciding that it would be something new, maybe similar to CS:GO. I enter my first game, and get a sniper. I'm a pretty good AWPer in CS:GO, so why not try sniping. I run out of spawn... hmm... this is weird. The running feels like I'm actually running, the movement is crisp... I was loving the game already! A smile crosses my face as I see someone all the way across the map: a target! Focused, I scoped in. I lined my crosshairs onto his head, and... WHAT THE FUUUUUUUU- My body collapses. I am dead. Who killed me? What just happened? I shake my head. This life will be different. I run outside, and, long story short, die. An hour later, I have killed 3 people, and died... around 50 times.What was I expecting? A fast-paced, 420 blaze it MLG game. What did I get? A slow-paced, gritty, realistic, EXTREMELY TEAMWORK-BASED tactical shooter that makes you think before every action. And to be honest, that's what made the game so much better for me. It's different, it's unique, and it's rewarding. Kills fill you with pride; you realize that you're actually DOING something. The other team doesn't have infinite respawns, so you just contributed to victory. This feeling of being a part of team and capturing points makes this game like no other.Buy this game, and play it with friends. Your first hour or two (or ten) will be brutal, and you will die constantly, but once you figure out what you're doing, this truly is amazing.I know most people aren't going to read the long text I have above, so below I have a pros/cons list... Because that's all people look for in reviews anyways...PROS:Very realisticTeamwork-orientedExtremely fun with friendsMods allow you to change your game UI/looks/musicSeriously, I have the ""Murica, F*** YEAH!"" music playing at the start of my rounds"" and my knife is just a spatulaRewardingUnique, different shooter experienceIndie devs that listen to their community, and even promote some of the moddersLots of updatesMany different maps and game modesVery polished for an Early AccessVery few hackersCONS:bullet drop not possible with Source Engine (not too important, but detracts from realism if they ever add maps large enough for this to matter)Very frustrating to get intoLike seriously... VERY frustratingI'm not joking... I still suck at the game, and I've spent quite a few hours in it...A lot of the game modes are similar ""take point"" objective modes that get repetitive""Competitive"" matchmaking needs LOTS of work; people leave randomly with no punishment, and games are reset without warning. Also, the use of voice chat is not promoted enough; in CSGO, people use voice chat because there is a clear objective that everyone strives for. In Insurgency competitive, people split up at round start to do their own thing, and there doesn't seem to be any sort of actual competitive gameplay happening. Part of this is lack of an actual objective. Sure, you're supposed to capture points, but that's a lot less defined and concrete than in CSGO, where you have to plant/diffuse the bomb. Lack of a clear, defined, INTERESTING objective makes people less inclined to care enough about the game to talk and strategize with each other.Game has a few bugs here and there, but is EA			"

												This game is basic.Or, rather, all about the basics.It's you.It's your gun.It's your team.It's the enemy.There are no health bars, no kill streaks, no indicator on how many enemies are down, or if you did or did not kill someone. It's simply about trying to best your opponent.As someone who leads a team of over 30 players into the field, lemme give you a piece of advice. Learn the maps. Knowing where your enemies are most likely to be expected will win, or loose the game for you. Coordinate with your team, this is one of the games where the VoIP feature is realoly an asset instead of a nuisance.  Sound is important - listen to the footsteps around you. Maybe one of the enemy team is distracted enough to call his teammates on the radio close to you, enabling you to hear their strategies. Find the balance between being aggressive, or waiting for an enemy's failure - One shot can and will often mean your death, but being too slow can mean inevitable defeat. If you're not that much into the PvP high pressure aspect, however, this game also features an extensive CoOp-mode with five (!) different modes and loads of servers out there. If you will, please trust someone who spent over 300 hours into INSURGENCY: This game, although extremely cheap, can rival every single triple-A title in terms of content, with the only disadvantage being the game's somewhat inferior graphics (Source Engine) and a lack of a real Ladder or Ranked-system.Just, don't expect to be instantly rewarded for kills like in CoD, in BF or even in CS:GO. Killing someone is fine. But at the end of the day, You Are A Team. And you will Win Or Fall as a team.			"

												Wow... just wow. I've been told this game is just a standalone upgrade of the Source Insurgency Mod and I'm very sad face that I missed that gem. Hands down the best infantry game(not too sim not too arcadey) I've ever seen / played. It still runs on the Source engine so you won't be see amazing graphics but the upside is that the source engine can run on a potato so you can still run 200+ fps with ease (in case you want to take advantage of the client speed being slightly faster with higher fps even though your monitor won't render past the 60/120 refresh rate).Interface wise, It's the closest thing to minimally immersive that I've seen in a shooter. You get the basic UI showing what points are capped, your fire mode on your weapon, and how many magazines you have left (It won't show you current ammo so you have to estimate how much you have fired from the current mag). The weapons you carry will appear in the fade-out box only when you switch weapons like usual. No minimap showing you where the enemies or your teammates are so you have to figure it out for yourself, be it the bullets flying by to clock your enemies position, or calling out through voip to make sure no friendly fire happens when you cross flanks. There is a label on your teammates to give you that little help in deciding who is friendly though if you pay attention (hopefully they will add a server option to disable this).The bullet count is even realistic, which so many other shooters try to simplify. The magazines left are just that, magazines. There is no magical extra pouch that you dump the unused rounds to somehow top off the last mag you have, so you have to decide if you want to top off or risk running out of rounds mid firefight, although for some reason you get an absurd amount of spare mags. The mags you replaced without being empty will actually go the bottom of your stash, then when you get to them you end up shooting like 2 rounds then having to switch mags again. Kind of annoying but kind of an awesome way to use up the unspent rounds when you are low on ammo.Now I'm not a fan of free-aim (where your gun isn't locked in place on the center of the screen) but it fits so perfectly in this kind of game. It isn't overly done like in RO2's full screen free-aim, there is a deadzone that will free-aim, then turn when you reach the edges. It will force you to ADS (also not a fan of in other games) if you need the accuracy, which also isn't ridiculously instant like in other action shooters(visual delay only); and the movement in ADS mode will actually sway instead of snap making OP drag shot a little less potent. The free-aim deadzone is pretty realistic, giving you realistic accuracy, and rewarding you for instinct shooting from high ready. There is also emphasis on crouching in front of teammates so you don't get shot in the back, prone to get better cover, or even feigh death behind cover (there is no kill confirmation). The realism really has a Red Orchestra feel to it but in a modern setting.The respawn system really makes you value your life because anyone who dies won't respawn until your team has captured a point or the next wave comes in sustained mode, which also encourages grouping up instead of just running, gunning, and dieing. So the gameplay may seem slow at first because of this but that all changes when you get into a fire-fight. From calling out where enemies are, to staying behind cover and watching bullets wiz past your head. You really feel like you are in the thick of it. The maps are extremely well made, there are multiple places you can fire from (lots of buildings with windows and cover) and encourage teamplay even more with a common tactic being team A advances while team B covers and suppress fire or throw smoke to rush. The maps can feel a bit asymmetrical but this is infantry realism, you are not always going to be on equal terms.Recommended that you have a mic on the ready because the VOIP is pretty crucial in communication. It's somewhat positional audio so it's easier to tell who is talking just by the direction of the voice; but beware, enemies can hear you too if you are too close to them, positional audio is just that. It will also help when flanking, calling it out so you don't get murdered by your own team when you come around a corner.Also, don't expect neglectful devs. The devs for this game are very involved and determined to make this game happen. I've even run into a few devs while playing and constantly responding to forum posts, so it's not like they are going to easily give up on a game they actually play.			"

												Some people just haven't experienced FPS. Realism?.........Some people are wanting this nowadays. If you are one of those hardcore, patient, tactical and competitive FPS players, Insurgency can tide you over. I wouldn't believe it is quite as addicting as your typical shooter, but you will be more satisfied, I promise you. And this game would be one of my closest FPS titles to Realism. This game will punish you to an extent where waiting and peaking around a corner can be more satisfying then doing the same old stabby stabby in TF2. This game runs fine while also having decent graphics. The lack of UI....The fact that reloading isn't automatic.....The crazy recoil....The Slow Pace........All those make this game good, rather than bad. Of course though, when I write this, the game would have still been in Beta so many things are subject to change. I wonder why this game isn't as popular as it should be. Realism? This is the closest your gonna get.Edit: From the dramatic changes from Beta to release, the pace and overall game has become more mobile and more arcade-like, comparing to the experience in beta.

												INSURGENCY!Insurgency is a FPS hardcore tactial shooter, there is no campaign - meaning that all the attention is on multiplayer.There are two teams that are pitted against each other, Sercurity Forces (US) and Insurgents (Middle - Eastern extremist).There are a multitude of very enjoyable maps, some take place in day and some in night - making the flashlight a viable option. The game does a many things very well, the game is extremely realilistic in the sense that; 1-2 shots will kill, (please be careful!). Your gun will also lock when jumping in the air, sorry no 360° noscopes. Footsteps are a very good indication of where enemies may reside, so you have to be very silent when moving. Some things that this game does not do well: Hit registration, it is actually horrible, and this subtracts from the immersion of the game when you clearly hit someone, and they don't go down - it can also be very fustrating.Ping really effects your gameplay in this game, as I said before hit registration is even worse when you have a ping of over 100!Another fantastic part of this game is the steam workshop!Find weapon skins, custom UI, custom sound packs, well pretty much custom everything!This game is really easy to run, on almost any system you will run the game at highest settings at atleast 45 fps on almost every map.Overall I really enjoy playing this game, and the team still bring out updates but they are not as frequent as they shoudl be!8/10 "

												The most exciting, immersive, fun, and lethal multiplayer FPS I have ever played.The Battlefield...If I had one word to describe the experience, it's TACTICAL.  First, if you're coming from BF3/4, the COD franchise, or CS:GO/S, forget everything you've learned about gun fights. Two, or often one, hit will kill you which means you need to use cover, suppression, smoke, and flash to get around. Gun fights are TENSE - this is partly due to the lethality of weapons, but also the suppression mechanic: you can hear the bullets wizzing by your head, your screen blurs, and if you pop your head out at the wrong time - THWACK, and your dead. MAPS are expertly designed, consistently updated, lots of variety, and new ones are created suprisingly often for such a small developer.WEAPONS have character and I've found new favourites for given situations even 100 hours into playing. UNLIKE CS:GO where you have to memorize spray and spread patterns for each weapon, Insurgency weapons perform realistically in that, wherever the sights are pointed, THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE THE BULLET WILL GO - weapons still recoil, but you know exactly where the bullet is headed when it does. GAME MODES - brilliant. Co-op is awesome, multiplayer modes are relatively diverse and awesome. What's really unique here is the emphasis on teamplay. You really need to coordinate with your team to win certain modes, whether its popping smoke or having someone cover you while you move up. What sets this game apart, other than everything else, is that players work together here - you're not playing with the silent majority on BF4 or COD - people are on their mics, strategizing and celebrating the game - mostly adults too (well, adults who yell ""Alloha Snackbar"" as terrorists while throwing grenades at American Soldiers, haha). If you get this game, get mic please, you miss out on a lot of the fun and you contribute to making this game less fun for everyone. Final Words...One of my favourite games on PC. Kudo's to a great development team who keep this game alive with frequent updates and tourneys. They obviously have a passion for what they do, and it's part of what makes this game great.It also happens to have a total conversion mod for my first multiplayer FPS (TPS*) addiction, Socom 1 & 2 ( ""Socom: Source"" ).

												Many of the games at a 60$ price aren't worth that amount. This game is definitely worth MORE than 15. It doesn't matter if it's on sale, you should get this game and tell your friends to get it. Here is why:I have accumulated over 1,200 hours on this game and have actually founded a competitive insurgency team. It's only fair that I give the game the review it deserves. If you want to know about a lot about the game before you buy it, you're reading the right review.The Competitive Scene:The competitive scene, while not as big as CSGO, has been mostly developed by the players-many of which have played the game for a long time. These leagues (DGL, ESL, ANZ) spread across every region of the world and have offered regional seasons, tournaments, draft tournaments and even world cups. No matter what region you are from, you can play this game. I've played with guys from South America, America and Canada, Eastern and Western Europe (from the UK to Ukraine), Australia and New Zealand, etc. The game does not boast ten's of thousands of players but the players that play this game in the competitive scene are very dedicated. It is not as hard to learn how to play as it used to be because the game has been allowed to develop and the players have figured out how to play the different maps in general. If you're wondering what ""game type"" the competitive scene revolves around, it's a game mode with 3 points that you can capture, objectives similar to that of the battlefield genre or starwars battlefront. You own one, they start owning one, and then there is a neutral point. If you cap a point, you bring your whole team back. You start with 5 players and they start with 5 players, you fight to the death to kill the other team, using all sorts of strategies and tactics, but also try to potentially cap a point (or bait a cap) and bring the rest of your team back. Sounds fun as hell, right? It's awesome.Game Types:If you're not a competitive guy, there are a ton of game modes to suite your fancy here. Want to play fast paced with 32 people and respawns? Choose Push. Want a slower paced mode much like the one I described for competitive, but with 16 players instead of 10? Choose firefight. Want a mix of Push and Firefight, with points you can capture but also respawn waves? Choose Skirmish. There are a few others as well- ambush for instance puts you on an attacking or defending side, where you are forced to escort your VIP (a player who cannot die) to one of two possible objectives. These are the 4 most common game modes, in that order. Server Activity:Insurgency recently broke the record of an all time high in the number of players online at once. No matter what time you get on to play, there are always active servers to play on. Gameplay:The gameplay is quite different from any other game. It's a lot like the Call of Duty 4 Pro Mod or hardcore mode. You don't have any HUD's or ammunition/health bars. You have your gun in front of you, the time of the round, the points and their status at the bottom of your screen and that's pretty much it. It's a source engine game, a lot of former COD 4 guys and CSGO players like it, although it's not really anything like CSGO.Pace/Mentality/continued comparison:It can be pretty fast paced- especially push. There are people everywhere and they're all trying to kill you. Other modes like firefight and ambush can be much slower paced. Yeah, you can go for that initial kill, and if you're good you might get it. The other team might also be playing slowly, and you might pay dearly for a risky move. I'd say it's relatively realistic enough to make it different from COD or Battlefield but still arcady enough to be fun for the guys who like that aspect of games- it's a good balance. Reloading takes a little longer than your average FPS, but not too long. Sound is really huge in this game- you can hear tons of things and when you run around people can hear YOU in the next room. You don't know how many bullets are left in your mag unless you've given it at least a little attention, etc. The game requires a lot of mental attention if you want to do really well, but also is arcady enough to where it's completely in your right to mindlessly shoot virtual people at 3 AM. For instance, you can't really mindlessly play Arma or Squad, but COD or Battlefield doesn't require quite as much mental attention. It's hard to be really good at CSGO- but for different reasons. CSGO is a lot about aim. I'd say it's relatively ""harder"" to be good at insurgency than it is to be ""good"" at Call of Duty or Battlefield, although prior shooter experience certainly helps. The mental aspect of insurgency and attention to detail isn't really found in another shooter. You'll definitely get a new experience here.What are you waiting for! Go play the game!			"

Insurgency:  An indie team of gamers turned modders turned developers.  Everything about this game was done right.  From the attention/engagement with the community to the sales that basically give this game away for free, which in turns invites more gamers, modders, and FREE content for the game from both the community and developers.I got the game for free from a friend and what attracted me the most was the modding support and the open modding community.  This allowed me to jump right into modding my own server out immediately.  Under 2 years later, I host the most popular coop servers in the game with a continuously growing 700+ member community.  Bottom LineIf you enjoy immersive PvP and or Coop with tons of different servers, mods, and content.  You'll enjoy Insurgency.			"

												I'm not Rambo, so I was never in a war. But seriously, when the devs talk about realism on this game, they mean it. With that being said, this is an FPS I'm terrible at, but I will give you an honest review.The Gameplay:There's a variety of gameplay types, but I won't go into detail because the essence of the game is basically the same in all of them. For example:-Cover matters on this game, and if you have played other FPS games that stressed the importance of cover, this game will probably stress the importance of cover even more. Forget running around aimlessly and looking for someone to kill. You definitely won't be going up the scoreboard using that approach. -Staying hidden and scanning the area is very, very important even if you're not a sniper. If you don't know your surroundings, you're going to get killed by the person who does. Staying hidden and waiting for the right time to shoot is also an aspect of this game you need to apply. You'll have to station yourself in buildings, hide behind rocks, anything that hides you from plain sight. The people who get the most kills on this game are the ones who know how to think tactical. It's not about how good you are at COD. It's about how well you can apply tactics. -You can die in much fewer hits than on most shooters. While it is possible for players to take quite a few bullets in the torso (depending on the armor, that is), for the most part you can die in as little as one shot from a pistol. Keep in mind if you're not used to this type of playing, chances are you may find this game unappealing. Nevertheless, this mechanic allows the game to keep its tactical gameplay, forcing players to use cover rather than just running around like headless chickens on a rampage. -Lastly, teamwork is very important.The cons of this game:-You can die very fast. While some people might not mind this, I honestly don't think it's that fun to get killed by your enemy without even having a chance to react. Yes, you saw me saying earlier that dying fast on this game is a good thing. It can also be a bad thing imo. I wouldn't mind if players were given a bit more HP but not too much. That's basically all I got to say. Is it a bad con? No, it's not really a bad one at all. More like a minor nuisance.-Almost every server I try to join only plays on game mode called VIP. On VIP mode, one team has a special person, hence the name VIP, that they must escort to a checkpoint. The other team must defend their two checkpoints and kill the VIP before they can escape. It's not a bad game, but it gets really boring if it's the only game mode people are interested in.Conclusion:It's realistic and very fun to play, and while it does have only two annoying cons, I'd say this is a great game that you should consider buying if you're sick and tired of all the other FPS games out there that are all about running around like a complete moron and mindlessly firing bullets to get as many kills as possible. In short, using your brains will make you better at this game than your itching trigger finger.			"

												After 580 hours of play, Should I say anything?Grab this great indie game, this game's developers are very honest and still developing this gem released at 2014..If you join a team acting as a team (in pvp and coop), your pleasure is %100 guaranteed. In this game, don't think your personal scores , try to move with your team.. For example, if you're a sniper, try to find a good position and eleminate you opponents as much as you can, don't try to rush objective points.. if you're a support, try to provide covering fire on objective points while moving your team together not to try to rush objective points before your assault team..finally thanks to the developers for their efforts to enhance this great game time to time and continious supports			"

A good tactical realistic FPSThe stage is set in the Middle EastBalanced modern warfare gear/weaponry Firefights take place at close quarters combat rangeOne shot one kill; The person who shoots first winsNo perks, no unlockables and other BSTense gameplay, knowing that one bullet can put you downMinimal HUD info like no ammo counter and health meterTaking cover and teamwork are crucialRealistic sounds; Impact of bullets, gunshots etc.No vehicles, it's just man to manSupports Solo, PvP and Co-op (PvE) playEasy to pick up controlsSmooth movement and animationsCommunity is alive and the game gets updated frequentlyPoor AI (they're still improving it)Patience is required for its slight learning curveThis game is not designed for solo mode. Don't buy for singleplayer only, it's a poor implementation. These types of games are rare nowadays especially the CQC ones. I wish there were more of them. I only play the game in Co-op mode which is quite enjoyable despite its questionable AI. Not a game for everyone but if you like most of the above points then pick this up.			"

												If Counter Strike feels too arcade-y, but Arma III feels like too much micro-management, Insurgency may be the FPS for you. The weapons and setting feel very authentic, the sound design makes every bullet flying past your head terrifying, and the damage model means that getting shot HURTS. There will be times when you die and you don't even know where the shot came from, and times when you've shot into a room or alley, and THINK you've killed your target, but aren't SURE you've hit anything. You take a step, not really wanting to move forward. Suddenly a grenade flies out of the dark room, and with no time to react, you're dead. The tension and terror feel very real. It sounds overly dramatic to say, but playing this game gives me a tiny sense of how real life military personnel end up with PTSD.Gameplay is solid, with most action happening in the PVP matches, but the Co-Op mode is also very solid, with you and a small squad of other players cautiously advancing toward an objective. Even once you've learned when and where Co-Op attacks will happen, there's something gripping about you and a few human players trying to survive a rush of incoming attackers.On a closing note, I really appreciate that a game set mostly in the Middle East doesn't descend into the standard ""Americans=good, Arabs=evil"" cliche. For instance, when playing as an insurgent and starting the match, you'll often hear your character yell things like ""Let us push this invaders from our homeland!"" The game doesn't celebrate or denigrate any of its characters, it just soberly presents the conflict between them, and captures the terrifying, violent desperation to survive.			"

												Do you want to get shot? 'Cos that's how you get shot!This game has been described as a cross between Counterstrike and Red Orchestra 2, and I think that fits.The arcadey pew-pew of CS is absent and instead you play in a more realistic environment where your cautiousness and tactical thinking is rewarded. The sense of immersion is greater than in CS, and while the pace is (generally) slower, as a result it's also more intense with the stakes seeming higher.You WILL get one-shot-killed in this game. AND you will one-shot kill others. You know going in that this is the case: that bullets are very deadly. This affects the way you play and you value your life more, and this in turn increases the immersion.You will NOT find yourself (as seems to happen in CS:GO) plugging several rounds into an enemy standing right in front of you who immediately one-shot-insta-kills you, and be left with the feeling that your death was somehow unfair.The bots in co-op mode; waves of enemies that unlock after an objective has been achieved to protect the next objective or re-capture the one just taken (randomly triggered) behave, on the most part, very realistically. You'll get ones that see your head as you lie prone and headshot you and you'll get ones that rush past you, failing to spot you waiting round a corner (as well as ones who anticipate you hiding there). They never feel either under or over-powered and do a good job of convincing you they're real. The only exception is their tendency to disregard fire (from molotovs/incendiary grenades) and they will quite often simply stand in the flames and burn to death without fleeing or run straight into the fire, disregarding it and ... die. That needs fixing.Co-op with 5 other players feels very good. Six player teams mean you don't feel too much individual responsibility most of the time, but that can suddenly change when at the last moment as your comrades have fallen you're thrust into the  role of saving the team, capturing the objective and triggering their re-spawn against the odds. This can result in an Immense sense of achievement and reward when successful and (unless you're playing with Grade-A A-Holes) good-natured sympathy and/or hilarity when you fail. Communication with your team is often essential to succeed, the whole game mode is very enjoyable.PvP is a blast and where the comparison to Red Orchestra 2 is closest. Squads of up to 16 players (although, as this is a Source-based game 12v12 is the norm) fight against each other across some beautiful and realistic maps.You will love the warm glow of the sun in the late afternoon as you run through the crunchy snow, but you will also curse that very same sun getting in your eyes and obscuring your view of the other side of the ravine and that blasted snow for giving away your movement.The feelings of ""oh crap, oh well, here goes"" as your squadron marches into uncertain death that games like Red Orchestra and Planetside provoke is here, albeit on a somewhat smaller scale, but Insurgency does it better. It's prettier, smoother and  more polished than RO2 and your value to your team is much higher than in both that and Planetside.And did I mention how inexpensive it is? The Fun:Value ratio on this game is very, very high. If you have a few spare quid and a few friends to play this with, you will have a blast with Insurgency.			"

NotePlease remember that this review represents the personal view of the author, and is in no way an absolute truth, so there's no real point in arguing in comments about anything if you disagree. Still, if you really want to, no one would stop you from doing it.The author disclaims any liablity or responsibilty for any consequences of proper or improper use of this review.***Because of my strong love for f-word, I'll replace it with the word ""chainsaw"". Credits of this idea go to Jon Lajoie (cheers).***Operation Flashpoint, Rainbow Six (the old stuff, like Raven Shield),  SWAT - that is the kind of names that comes up in my mind when I hear the combination of words like ""fps"", ""tactics"", ""realism"", ""hardcore"" and so on. Unfortunately, related words usually were ""dead genre"", ""empty multiplayer"", ""what the chainsaw they've done to the series, why couldn't they chainsawing do it just like the old times, chainsawing chainsaws"". But things have changed for me in March 2014, when I purchased Insurgency. To tell the truth, my hopes weren't really up about this one (even though I played Insurgency when it was a mod back in 2008 and I really enjoyed it), for I've seen too many new fresh games that looked promising and got positive reviews to turn out to be, em, disappointing, including the sequels of series that kicked♥♥♥♥♥back at the time. So I was pretty scepctical when I started playing, my judgement wasn't clouded by so called ""wow-effect"", the one you get when you start a game you've been waiting for and looking forward to, but in the meantime I  wasn't too sceptical, and I actually even forgot that I played the mod.So here I am, playing Insurgency, trying to figure out who is who, what to do and where the chainsaw I'm being shot at from, and the more I play, the harder it gets to ignore this thought screaming through my brain: ""THIS IS CHAINSAWING IT MAN THEY FINALLY CHAINSAWING DID IT"". And it actually _is_ it. The game is challenging: you don't have crosshair, healthbar and even ammo count on your HUD, only the amount of magazines, o you have to elaborate some sort of ""feeling"" of how much ammo you have left in your magazinge and how bad you are hurt; you can actually die from a single bullet, and that makes you act carefully and steady; it's hard to aim because of the ""trembling hands"" effect after you sprint for some time and the suppression effect that is caused by being shot at (really cool feature that is also implemented in a nice way); equipment weight and resupply points that make you choose the equipment wisely - you can't assemble a ""wunderwaffe"" and have it all; and many other things that make this game hard, complex and challenging, but so damn enjoyable. It really feels great when you accomplish anything in this game, even a single kill, and the key to success is your tactic thinking and experience, and only after that come reaction time and velocity. The game has multiple game modes, and each of them plays a little different; that adds to gameplay variety pretty much. There are even coop modes against bots, and that also creates more ways to play the game (for example, you can play it alone, which I prefer sometimes). The game's techincal side is also in a good state, I've had no technical difficulties since the very start.To sum it up, Insurgency is challenging, old-school, hardcore, interesting, intense, rewarding and just fun.P.S. The two things that make me love this game even more:1. The updates, that often include new content, features etc are free. That is just amazing, two thumbs up for the developers, or whoever is resposible for this.2. Once you start the game, the first thing you see after it loads up is the main menu. Yes, you heard me right, this game has NO CHAINSAWING INTROS at all. At first I thought it was temporary, but it's been like this for more than a year now. This is my personal favourite, and it may be even greater than the updates thing for me.			"

												Insurgency is one hell of a beast, created by mixing up all the good things from other great FPS title.It has the realism of Red Orchestra / Rising Storm that adds a great immersion and intense atmosphere, the small skimrish maps akin to Counter  Strike for a quick and fun close quarter battles, great weapon customization system that reminds me to Rainbow Six / Ghost  Recon, and Battlefield's class based gameplay. Looks unoriginal eh? Nah, not at all. Insurgency DO feels like a combination, something ""in between"" of those game, but the devs executed the ideas impressively that I can consider Insurgency as an original, somewhat one of a kind game that still maintain its own unique identity among an ocean of FPSes nowadays.Gameplay (10/10)Immersive, intense, hardcore, yet it still can offer a fun and enjoyable experience. Insurgency is one of those ""easy  to learn hard to master"" game. Naturally, Insurgency itself is a very simple game, the thing that you'll have to learn is how the general system works, weapons and attachments, the different set of classes, and the realism factor itself. I believe you'll fully understand how the game works in around an hour, or even less. Insurgency isn't for a trigger-happy FPS player. Patience, teamwork, and careful observation of your surrounding is the key here. Even if you already do that, like walking slowly, crouch, peeking on corners, you'll find yourself in  ""WHERE THE ♥♥♥♥ IS THE BULLET COME FROM?"" situation, first shot, screen blurred, second shot, you started to panic, third shot and you're dead. In many occassion you don't even have the time to be panicked, you'll have an instant death. Another great aspect of this game is how devs design the overall system. No grinding, no perk, just pure skill and tactic. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of varied game modes that actually..well..varied, a balanced class system. Overall Insurgency is, one of the most balanced and fair FPS I've ever played.Sound (10/10)I could've put it in the gameplay section, since the sound isn't just to make the game more atmospheric, but the sound design is a part of the gameplay, its a crucial part. For a modern military FPS with a flare of relism, the sound must be designed to make the game, not only immersive and realitic, but also ""usable"" and its actually a part of the tactic. Yes, the sound is mind-blowingly fantastic. I love how detailed the sounds are, the sound of bullets blazing over your head, hitting the wall or floor, fly near your ears, and when it do hit you, everything become muffed. The guns sounds realistic, it doesn't sound too weak, yet doesn't sound THAT powerful.  Sound is your best friend and your greatest enemy.Graphic (9/10)Insurgency is built from Source Engine, which is, in a way..dated. But. thanks for the great level design and visual effect, and of course the gameplay. You'll find Insurgency's graphic to be a brilliant one. You might think Battlefield has the most realistic graphic for a FPS game. That might be true, but Battlefield's graphic is just too beautiful to be realistc, I find it more in the cinematic side. Insurgency, in the other side can capture the overall atmosphere of a battlefield. A battlefield is supposed to be ""ugly"", no filtering, no lens flare, it's rough. No, no.. I don't say Insurgency graphic is  ugly, far from it. It's a bit dated yes, but the ""dated"" factor and the genius devs behind the game make Insurgency's graphic looks truly believable. Conclusion (10/10)Immersive, believeable, realistic, hardcore, tactical, yet still fun, enjoyable, and pretty much accesible. Insurgency is a perfect balance of realistc / hardcore FPS game with the close quarter combat fun and quick matches of a more arcade-ish FPS game. Insurgency does take inspiration from a wide range of FPS game type, but the devs cleverly managed to distinguish the game to something more unique that can stand at its own two feet and overall maintaining its own identity of a new kind of FPS game.

												This game is worth more than it's retail price, yet I got it for free because one of the developers sent me a key. Now, 180+ hours later, I'm still addicted to it. I bought the Humble Jumble Bundle just so I can pay back the developers in some way, and gave away the key I got. The devs are awesome--they are a part of the community. The community is awesome, too. One of the most mature communities you'd find in FPS games these days. You will truly enjoy playing and will always have a sense of fullfiment when you win because communication and coordination with teammates are required to win. This game is worth more than it's asking price. I completely stopped playing CS: GO after I got this. Hopefully more people discover the beauty of this game.TL, DR:Awesome devs.Awesome community.Awesome game.			"

												Insurgency has one of the most authentic FPS experiences I've ever had the pleasure of playing. The authenticity of this game is due to HUD realism (no radar, no hit markers), sound realism (let's just say you'll understand why people are hiding behind cover when you hear the bullets whizzing by), weapon feel and control, and loadout customization. The variety of guns, maps, and modes lend to its replayability. The AI in this game is probably the best I've seen so far, sometimes rivaling the skill of real players. The game supports the Steam Workshop where you can find some of the best maps, gun mods, and audio packs that really spice up the experience. One of the biggest personal selling points is the dedication and passion that the developers show for this game. Since release, they've released huge free content updates that include new maps, weapons, gameplay updates, and most recently, Linux support.+Authentic experience+Loadout customization+Night mode+Great AI+Free content updates+Steam Workshop support+Linux support+Achievements+Trading CardsNo cons.

												This game is not for the impatient or the twitch shooters who like mindlessly running and gunning down whatever moves near their randomized spawn. Skill is not the be all, end all of this game. It plays a large role but ultimately boils down to: The smarter team ALWAYS wins. If you like first person shooters that are challenging, i recommend this game. It will make you an extremely efficient player in other fps shooters if you invest some time into it. With 1 or 2 bullets killing you, it forces you to really learn the maps for camping spots and how to properly use cover/concealment. Also, players learn your strategy from the previous rounds so you have to be adaptable and unpredictable. The developers put an emphasis on teamwork and it shows. The scoring system is based more on playing the objectives and less on the k:d. It is also extremely rewarding if you win after a long round with evenly matched teams. The workshop is one of the reasons why I really enjoy this game. It is completely customizeable. You can change the weapons, optics, reticles, scope reflection colors, gun sounds, player skins, music, and even environmental details just by hitting a subscribe button (for free). The community is also amazing. You have a ton of players making quality mods including the developers themselves posting weapons. You know it will be top notch. If pvp isn't your thing, there is a coop setting with many fun game modes where you play against bots. There are even many custom servers.As for how the game runs, it is very smooth. Even if you have a lower end rig, there is very little compromise and still looks friggin awesome. There are, however, minor bugs here and there and sometimes crashes happen but it is still a solid game. One thing I noticed is that the developers did their homework with the guns and are very detail oriented. You can see smoke trailing off the end of the barrel after shooting for extended periods. Blood splatter patterns of your teammates can indicate the direction of the shooter. Each mag contains the correct number of rounds after you reload (no fairies sitting in your pockets recombining your ammo in this game). The suppression is so intense that it scares the crap out of you the first time you pick this up. Changes in tone can tell you what type of grenade was thrown. And the audio direction cues are spot on. You can pinpoint exactly where someone is sneaking up on you, based on the footsteps or gun sounds. I've noticed a lot of fps shooters have sounds indicating the general direction of players and then you have to search a little to see the enemies. In this game, you hear them, you shoot them.Cons:1) Crashing to desktop can be a major buzzkill2) Some custom servers override your mods and can cause conflict making parts of the gun invisible until restart3) Spawn camping (until you learn to avoid certain areas altogether, it's not fun)4) You will probably suck for a loong time in this game in the beginning5) This game is hardcore so there is no crosshair (ever) or kill indicators on some of the servers. So if you're used to having them, you're gonna have a bad time...6) Teamkillling and spam kickers can get out of hand very fast and ruin the experience sometimes.7) Your character can be pretty stupid. When you are trying to be sneaky behind some enemies and a teammate happens to die within your line of sight, your guy might yell out, ""♥♥♥♥♥♥THEY TOOK OUT OUR SQUAD LEADER!!"" getting you completely massacred. Can't tell you how many times I've died from the stupidity of my character announcing my presence.Still a great game though and I highly recommend it if you have the grit to take it on. (I have some friends who refuse to play this game because it was too hard for them. Especially on the sniper heavy pvp maps)			"

												Insurgency is, for my money at least, the best shooter currently on the market. I've put nearly 100 hours into it and my main thought is why didn't I buy this game earlier. I'd seen it on the store before and just passed on it cause it seemed like some bog standard FPS that i'd spend 20$ on play for a week and never touch again. I couldn't be more wrong. I picked it up while it was on a 3$ sale, my god was it a steal.There are two sides, Insurgents and Security. Two different styles of games, COOP or Multiplayer. Personally I don't really play COOP much so I don't know much about it. But the one match of survival on tell I did with about five friends was incredible. Made it to wave 63 in about an hour n a half. Bloody amazing fun.As for multiplayer you can play in three different types each with a few different modes, except for competitive. In Sustained Combat you can choose from: Strike, one team tries to destroy three weapons caches while the other team defends. Occupy, both teams try to capture and hold one point in the middle of the map. Push, where one team tries to capture a series of three objectives then destroy a weapons cache at the end. And Skirmish where both teams fight over three objectives each while simultaneously defending their and destroying their enemie's weapons cache. In tactical operations you can choose one of three modes however this one everyone only has one life except for firefight. In ambush one player is the vip and must be escorted to one of two zones and the other team has to stop him. I've honestly never played elimination before so idk what it's about. The last is firefight where there are three objectives, however you only can respawn if your team takes an objective while you're dead. The last game type, Unranked Competitive is a 5v5 version of firefight.Now onto the guns n♥♥♥♥♥♥ Well for starters it's asymetrical balance that actually ♥♥♥♥ing works. Security can only use Security guns and the tererrists can only use tourist guns. Weapons range from the AK-74U to the MP5K to the ♥♥♥♥ing M1 Carbine. Each class has different loadouts however it stays fairly simple. MGer get MGs, riflemen get M16s or AKs, snipers get bolt actions and semi auto battle rifles, and engineers get shotguns and SMGs. Now there are a lot more roles than the ones I listed and there is overlap but that's basically it. All of the guns are useable unlike many other games. I've seen people go ham with the MP40 as much as I've seen amazing killstreaks with the UMP-45. You can choose from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of different attachments, optics and ammunition types. You can also choose from 4 different grenades, C4/IED or RPG/AT4. You can also take light, heavy or no armor at all. Most everything will be a one burst kill so it pays to be accurate.Now for the maps. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ There are some absolutely amazing maps: Ministry, Embassy, Verticality, Panj, Kandagal, Siege, Tell, Station. The list goes on and on. Maps range from complete urban combat like Ministry to entire rural like Panj and many have a mix of both. Maps are also asymmetrical. Certain maps Insurgents get to this objecive faster or this map Security gets there four seconds faster. Still all of the maps are very well designed and I haven't found one that I absolutely dislike, even Buhriz which this community for some reason loves.Random♥♥♥♥♥♥about the game. Currently the game is run on Source so it's a bit dated but works very well for potatos. Next year the Devs are planning on introducing Insurgency Sandstorm which will be on Unreal 4. The community is rather small which is the biggest problem. It's not so bad that you can't find a match but if you have a group of say 6 people and are looking to play a specfic mode with a populated server it may be a challenge. The community quality is about as good as you'd expect. I've met some really nice people, but honestly, it's 10$ there's lots of idiots around and lots of people who really don't have much FPS skill. There are also two announcers one for each side. The Insurgent one is okay, a bit bog standard. But the Security one, oh man. He's ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious. Actual quote when you're the last guy alive and you clutch it ""Man I thought he was just gonna ♥♥♥♥ing die.""TL;DR♥♥♥♥ you I spent a long time writing this go ♥♥♥♥ing buy this game.			"

												Insurgency is a hard game and raw, you probably will be able to fully appreciate only after few rounds ended disastrously and any hole in his chest too. The title offers good realism of firearms, a personalization system treated classes, a decent graphics and sound rendition definitely noticeable. Co-operation with their team is a key part of this title and play to help his team rather than get a good personal result is required. If you're the kind of player who prefers a quick and immediate and perhaps loves being the Lone Wolf of the situation, then Insurgency is not for you, but if you're the kind of person who likes to cooperate with fellow to develop complex tactics and a type of gameplay less frenetic and more reasoned, you have found a game worthy of your attention.Insurgency is a multiplayer shooter that delivers everything it promises and it does it with the weapons of the maximum realism, without compromises or concessions modern. Take it or leave it, but if you like the thrill of dying with only two bullets take it ... also costs little.			"

												Insurgency is a really good and simple tactical shooter with a realistic feel.  It is easy to get into and easy to play.  There isn't a high skill ceiling that requires hours of play to master.  There are plenty of game modes and maps to play with enough folks online playing.  It's perfect for quick matches or longer sessions.  There are no health bars, so if you get shot, you are going down.  The checkpoint system makes it so you don't have to sit out the whole round if you die.Insurgency has my favorite AI of any game that I have played so far.  The enemy bots are tough and creative.  I am constantly amazed how they never seem to do the same thing twice and are always finding new ways to attack and flank.  It keeps you on your toes and forces you to expect surprises.This game isn't expensive and is worth the money.  Grab a friend and join a group online because taking on the bots with a partial team, while still fun, makes survival very difficult.EDIT:  So apparently my review has been copied by a French girl who claims not to be good at English.  When you read her other reviews, you can clearly see the difference between hers and mine.  Yep, my review is marked posted on Nov 12 @ 11:40am and hers was posted on Nov 12 @ 5:44pm.

My Review after 4 years of playing...My review is below but here is a disclaimer:People should do some research about BattlEye before they claim it's spyware. All anticheat software could be considered spyware by the way... you have to give to get ladies and gentlemen.As someone else stated ""No, BattlEye is NOT selling you porn logs to Walmart.""Also, if you're afraid of invasion of privacy, don't use any website ever or mobile app. Notice how the ads on Facebook change to whatever websites you've been visiting? Coincidence? I think not.I've spent the last 4 years in this game... as with any game it has had its up's and down's. I created the league that would, at one point, encompass the entire world's Insurgency eSports play. To this day, I still love this game... I just wish people in regular public servers would play less scared and play the objective. I recommend this game and I recommend that you play the game fast (rushing) in the beginning to learn the maps and halfway points quickly. Too many people waste their time playing slow off spawn when the fight is halfway across the map. Watching someone crabwalk for 2 minutes just to have them never see an enemy and lose by being capped out on is detrimental to my mental health. If you're a casual gamer who likes first person shooters, this game is well worth 10 dollars. Most people get this game for a dollar on humble bundle or another discount site. I think I spent over 150 dollars on this game by buying it for multiple people, etc. and I don't regret it. The game is intense and fun. There is also a decent coop scene for those who are afraid of getting rekt by people like me.If you're looking for a heavily established comp scene where you can scrim 24/7, you may be disappointed...  however there are competitive pick up games nearly every day and scrims every day during peak hours. This game is one of the best competitive games I have played in my 15 years of gaming and that's ranking against COD4, Tribes, and Overwatch. The competitive depth of the game is unreal in terms of strategy, map knowledge, rotations, etc. The meta is continuously evolving even after 2 years of established competitive play.The game still to this day has a couple thousand people playing it at any given time... when I started playing this game in Alpha the only time there were players was when my team and I were playing. Fast forward 4 years later to today and it still has at least a thousand people playing during it's low population points. The game is still alive and kicking.They did announce their sequel to this game over a year ago. Insurgency: Sandstorm will be a brand new game at a much higher price and on the unreal engine. It will have projectile based bullets (bullet drop) and light vehicles plus a story line with coop. Because Sandstorm is going to be at a higher price, it makes this game worth it even more in my eyes. Sandstorm won't be released until sometime in 2018, so you casual gamers can easily get 10-20 hours out of this game in that time which will be 50 cents to 1 dollar an hour of entertainment.Last bit of advice...Pay attention to the reddit - www.reddit.com/r/insurgencyA lot of questions you have are answered there, just use the search functionIf you want to see some high level Insurgency play... here's an old shoutcasted match.https://youtu.be/QF9KTmsYSR8?t=3m20s "

												This game is the one that I've been searching for all the time. If you are looking for an FPS that is as tactical as ARMA, yet paced like Battlefield, here is your game ladies and gentlemen.Pros:+ Very nice community.+ One shot one kill (unless you shot an heavily armored guy with a pistol).+ Minimal hud, no ammo count, no health bar.+ Encourages teamwork and communication. If you use voice comm, then chances are you will win.+ Very rich equipment and weapon variety.+ Customizable weapons.+ When you scope in, only the scope gets magnified, unlike other FPS games.+ Very tactical gameplay. Has leaning and suppression mechanics.+ It feels ♥♥♥♥ing awesome.Cons:- Maps are sometimes confusing.- Learning curve is a bit harsh. You will probably rage-quit your first 3 matches.Score: 9/10			"

												If they ever decide to release a boxed copy, I will probably buy it again and make love to it after every game. This is the most fun I've ever had in an FPS! To me, it's a more rewarding experience than CS ever was in 12 years due to the more complex maps, which allow for way more tactical creativity and freedom. It's as relentless and relentlessly fun as Vietcong was, and the focus on capturing objectives reminds me of the initial thrill Battlefield 1942 gave me back when it first came out. This game has filled a void in my life that a combination of several excellent older games left. May you continue to grow and delight people looking for some serious fun, beloved Insurgency!			"

												You're escorting a VIP through a market square, while half of your teammates search the surrounding buildings looking for anyone trying to ambush you. The chatter on your radio indicates that they're all clear, but soon after you hear gunshots ring out. You begin to hear muffled voices coming from above you, and they don't sound familiar at all. You send one of your squadmates in there to see if there's anyone there, and more gunshots are fired, ending with your teammate screaming, ""THEY'RE HERE!"" The VIP and the rest of your group run hurriedly to one of the extraction points, while others try to combat the ambushers. Many die, but as you approach the extraction point with your last magazine, not knowing how much ammo you have left, you see one last ambusher waiting for you to arrive. The VIP ducks into cover, but you try to return fire to the assailant. He shoots you twice, but you land a lucky shot on him and kill him. Insurgency is filled with moments like these. The learning curve isn't as steep as you may think, and the game is reminiscent of other hardcore FPS's, such as Red Orchestra 2 and Rising Storm. With your little amount of health, you must coordinate with your team members in order to assure victory for your team. Patience is key, because running out will end up with you being shot at from 10 different directions. The game is excellent and should be enjoyed by anyone that wants to have an enriching multiplayer experience with or without friends. Be wary, though, if you prefer games like Call of Duty or Battlefield, then you will have a much harder time getting into this game. The guns are harder to aim, and it takes only a few well placed shots to kill someone, so make sure you aren't entirely visible. All in all, this is a really good game that may not be for everyone, but deserves to be tried. Try out the mod or play the game during a free weekend to see if you like it			"

Not only do they update the content (maps, weapons, gadgets, gamemodes... you name it) and gameplay frequently, they also don't cash any money for their DLCs. While we live in times where companies charge money for DLCs that come out at the release day of their games, NWI really shows how it should be done.

Let's try and find the games closest to Insurgency to give you an ideaHave you played Hostile Intent an HL1 mod? Or do you like the first Rainbow Six, up to RavenShield?Those games focuses on CQB mostly. But what if you want the same realism with bigger maps?And with lots of co-op, lots of player at the same time and mandatory friendly fire?Okay, then we are talking about Arma; except that you need the whole keyboard mapped in order do play.I could mention the famous America's Army, but the murika's BS might p!ss you off.Well, for me, Insurgency is very close to AA, but in much better IHMO.There is also Red Orchestra even closer than AA, but you might also be tired of WW 2.Of course there is the HL2 mod named Insurgency - Modern Infantry Combat too. In that case you already know what I am talking about here.In Insurgency you will find realism.One shot, one kill mostly. You will also experience bullet penetration and ricochet. Friendly fire is always on, forcing you to advance in coordinated groups and with a proper formation. There is no magic radar where you can see friendlies, no indication of the rounds left in your mag. Bring up the full screen map to know where people are, but then you are vulnerable during that time.The recoil is similar to the one you might find in RavenShield, and the aiming and movements (running, sprinting, sliding) are smoother than in America's Army.Weapons modifications will drastically change your gameplay and behavior. It is absolutely not cosmetic here. You can choose the rounds types (JHP, FMJ, tracer) to suit your class. It's not BS.The sounds/SFX are awesome. The voice comm is directional and ""spacial"", meaning that you will have to be close to the guy using his mic/talking to hear him. Which the opposing team will hear too!The objectives are very cleverly made: clearing an objective will make your teamates respawn, which can turn a situation around. Sometimes, a single match can last quite a long time when both teams are skilled. The objectives will get captured, lost, etc. making people respawn and so on.And finally, the community is mature--for now at least.Is it hard? Definitly yes.Is it worth it? Damn right!Are there other alternatives to this game? Short answer is ""not really"".Takedown was (is?) an attempt to revive the Tactical FPS but has failed so far IMHO.America's Army is too tied to murika, and is full of bugs and not maintained anymore.Arma is too slow paced, and feels like a sofisticated airplane simulation so many key bindings there are.Hence, Insurgency is pretty much the only tactical game since RavenShield released in 2003.Yeah, it is the only tactical game available since a decade.So no, there are no alternatives.Now you should clearly know what you oughta do:GO GET IT. NOW.			"

												This is the best infantry based FPS out right now.  Period.  Before I begin, if you liked America's Army 2.x or Red Orchestra 2, you can skip my review and just buy it now.Insurgency combines highly deadly weapons (1-2 hits across the board for the most part) with Squad based combat.  Unlike games like Call of Duty, you choose a role on a fireteam and certain weapons and equipment are available to you, while others are not.  This promotes teamwork which you otherwise wouldn't get in games where every player can equip themselves as a one man army.There is no crosshair to help you to fire from the hip.  And players can't put a dot on their screen to cheat their way around that, since your gun moves independently of your screen to a certain extent.  This makes firing from the hip that much difficult, but also more rewarding if you can pull it off.The maps feel immersive and set in Middle Eastern environments ranging from Iraq to Afghanistan.  They aren't the shoebox style maps present in other mainstream FPS, but shaped and structured like real cities or outposts that you'd find in that part of the world.In most game modes, your team will respawn in waves based on capturing objectives.  There is no run and gun team deathmatch mode here.  Nor are there killstreaks, perks, or other rewards to help bad players.  When you die it will be your fault, not some UAV or airstrike.You'll die a little bit before you get the hang of it because it's unlike anything you've played before.  But once you master it (I've seen friends of mine get good over the course of a day), this is the most rewarding FPS you'll ever play.It only costs $15 but is easily worth $60, IMO.Update: About this BattlEye stuffTwo years and over 2,000 hours later... still love the game.  But about this BattlEye stuff on the front page... The developers conducted multiple polls over the years to gauge what their playerbase wanted.  More weapons?  Got em.  More maps?  Got that too.  Mac and Linux support?  Done.  Performance improvements? Yep.  Anticheat?  Finally, yes.  We asked for it, it took some time, and we got it.So what's with all these negative reviews about BattlEye?  On a technical level, it's not accessing or doing anything that VAC or any other anticheats aren't already doing.  So what's with the hate?  I don't mean to paint with a broad brush here, but consider GabeN's comments about the attacks people make against VAC...""There is also a social engineering side to cheating, which is to attack people's trust in the system. If ""Valve is evil - look they are tracking all of the websites you visit"" is an idea that gets traction, then that is to the benefit of cheaters and cheat creators. VAC is inherently a scary looking piece of software, because it is trying to be obscure, it is going after code that is trying to attack it, and it is sneaky. For most cheat developers, social engineering might be a cheaper way to attack the system than continuing the code arms race, which means that there will be more Reddit posts trying to cast VAC in a sinister light.""- https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1y70ej/valve_vac_and_trust/So take that into consideration when you see people coming out of the blue bashing Insurgency for adding something literally everyone was asking for.

												This game has been described to me as many things, the most prominent of which would be ""Battlefield on Source Engine"". That is hardly accurate.A more accurate description would be ""A well made realistic shooter that requires tactics, good aim, bad accents, and cancerous slav music""Most notably, This game takes aim to create a source-based FPS that requires communication and slow play to succeed. New World does pretty well with what they have set out to do. The game itself is actually pretty chalk full of content for a game that was originally cost at or around 15$ on launch. It has a lot of maps, a lot of game modes, and a surprisingly fun co-op mode. As a matter of fact, I enjoy the co-op mode more than the PVP. There seems to be a lot of teamwork in that mode.Past all of this however, there are some issues that seem to persist. Most notably the grahics and optimization. It looks about 1/2 as good as CSGO, and takes 2x the processing power to pump the same framerate. Fortunately, The way that the game plays makes frames a secondary concern to game sense. If you know what you are doing, you can absolutely destroy people from your 8 year old potato. Believe me, as one of the best players I know plays off of a pentium build from 2005 getting an average of 20 fps. The flow of the game focuses more on positioning and waiting games rather than twitch aim. There is a learning curve, but as long as you check your targets and don't shoot your buddies nobody will really rage at you.The community in this game is what really makes it to me. I've never seen a higher Meme-per-capita in a video game. You always get that one dude that shouts ""ALLAHUUUU MAHALALALALA AKKKKKKKKBAR"" whenever he blows up a supply cache, and that one dude that speaks with radio callsigns, and that one dude that talks in a russian accent and links us to the ""cancerous slav music mod""(I'd actually insist you use it too). I swear. I bust a nut laughing every time I launch the game. The massive modding community really adds to it as well, constantly making better optics, skins, and music packs.It keeps getting more and more Cheeki Breeki all of the time, and I don't really have any reason to not play.Glorious Cancer/10 "

												This is an awesomes stuff!  Amazing atmosphere and really one of the best games to play as a team. Good graphics, realisic movments and amazing sound effects make you feel like you are really on a battlefield! Plus, developpers are always developping this game improving level design and polishing other glitches. Community  is also much better than in other more popular games. This is just great....			"

												Hopefully NWI reads these things, at least when they are negative. This game had very little wrong with it, I doubt I could honestly come up with 10 things, none that were deal breakers and only a couple that were really annoying. I have 1032 hours in this game, I love this game!The updates, whether they were yesterday or today have broken the game to the point that I can honestly tell you that if I had just purchased it, I would immediately request a refund. You have taken a Great game and broken it, long after it's release, that is not sound business strategy. It is very broken, and if you need me to tell you why, then you (NWI) certainly spent no time testing it. It was likely the update in the last 12 hours (6 PM PST 9FEB17) as I did not experience the litany of issues I just had playing just one level on the same server I played on 12 hours ago. You also need to rethink your application of BattleEye, I like many others only play Co-op, I have seen only 1 person cheat in all my time playing. If you need the anti-cheat for competitive play which apparently you do, then have a selection screen on startup, competitive or co-op, so the great number of us that don't want to play with that intrusive kernel-rooting software don't have to.Fix this stuff and I will edit my review and make it positive, and describe how NWI really cares about the views of it's customers, the way it should be, else, it stays as is, and sadly I and many others will just stop playing, and you can watch as your mostly positive reviews begin to go the other way at warp speed.UPDATE: Now that I am a bit less angry... Well, the updates certainly screwed up my favorite server, and it still isn't completely fixed (finally fixed as of 2-18-17). This was the most destructive to mods of all that I have seen. I also understand, you don't have to install Battle-Eye, so I imagine if the co-op servers don't enforce the use of it, I will not be required to install it. I'll see how that goes, and if I can still play in a couple of weeks, I'll update and change this to positive, or maybe just delete it, anyway. NWI really does need to show in the server list which servers are B.E. Required. On a positive note, the graphics for some reason look a little better, or maybe I am just imagining things...			"

 Definate 10/10 First off, not for the easily frustrated. This game is difficult, but rewarding.Secondly,  THE DEVS ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THEIR PRODUCT Now, for the nitty gritty (sorta).Team play is nearly a must. You can do well on your own, and you can decimate a group of enemies on your own if you're experienced enough or just have a great position, but more times than not, having a competent squad at your back or your front is typically always better than being a lone wolf.Communication is just as important as it is in any other game, and if you don't (have/want to use) a mic, this game gives a good means to do so, with (mostly) fleshed out voice commands. I could recommend a few, but this isn't the place for it. What matters, is that you can generally get your message out without having to type. It is typically easier to communicate with someone who you've spent a few hours playing with.Gunplay and controls are tight; it's a source game, what do you expect? As for gunplay, weapon recoil is not going to have you admiring the skybox, but it's not going to have every weapon acting as a lasergun. Almost every weapon can one-shot the chest (Depends on target's armour, what type of ammunition you are using, and caliber of gun.), and all weapons will one-shot the head under average circumstances.Movement and navigation is crisp and as clean as any other source game, save for the small map props that can peak up from the dirt, or a ledge that's just barely elevated enough that you have to jump. Other than that, movement speed itself is not fast, but you won't be a slugman.Overall/TL;DR: Teamplay is recommended, communication is concise, gunplay is dandy and responsive, and movement is crisp.Recommended if you enjoy games like Red Orchestra 2 or Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege.

												Insurgency is it worth a buy? Insurgency is a close quarters combat first person shooter which was once a mod for half life 2. It's a source engine game which meaning that it won't take much to run at 40+ fps. Which is fine by me.The UI is decent.The devs have kind of left the game  to work on future games such as insurgency sandstorm, they still fix bugs time to time. Don't expect much since the game is 100% complete.The community and the players are not as toxic as in games like cod, csgo and dota 2.What it feels like is I don't want to compare it to cod but It feels like COD done by REAL programmers unlike COD's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t half♥♥♥♥♥multiplayer.. It's on sale alot more then it used to be for like $2 or something coming up soon. This game is not dead at all, I'm seeing a steady 2000 which is better then some games like COD IW.Is it worth the $9.99? Yes no doubt about it.			"

												It's a bit sad that Insurgency has only 3k players, meanwhile other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fps have way more players.I must admit that I had Insurgency in my library and I ignored it for a long time: ""I'm playing csgo, csgo has tons of player, it's made by valve, how can a random indie compete with this game ?"" Then one day I decided to try it... awesome ! It takes the best from csgo\arma\cod.More tactical than csgo, faster than Arma... better than cod, perfect balance between simulation and action. Mod support, coop, nice graphics and sound effects, it's even cheap. Definitely recommended, Insurgency deserves more players "

												This is one of those games, travelling just under my radar, yet was perfectly designed to meet my first person shooter gameplay demands. This is no frills, tactical teamplay with realistic gun physics. There is no corny gun skins to destroy the immersion of the gameplay, gun models and animations are above average, lending to the smooth and clean look of the maps. A first person shooter of this quality is a rare achievement. "

												If you're a fan of games like Red Orchestra, you owe it to yourself to check this game out. Some of the game modes are a little unconventional compared to others in the genre, but once you understand exactly what you need to do and have a good team communicating and working together there's very few games that can deliver the same sort of experience. The developers have been fantastic with constantly listening to player feedback and pushing out meaningful upgrades, and I don't expect that to change after the official launch.Highly recommended.

												Okay before I get on my soapbox about this game let me tell you a little about my background to help put things in perspective. I have been gaming over 30 years (yes I'm an old fart) starting way back in the days when we had an Atari 800 and floppy disk. I have pretty much played every FPS out there (well most), messed around with map making for various games, and currently am the creator and manager of www.ShakesPub.net. I served 4 years in the military as a Army Ranger with the 3/75. I only tell you this as I know what ♥♥♥♥ sounds like when all hell brakes loose. Some of you are wondering is this game any good? Are there enough players? It's the Source Engine isn't that kind of out dated? Etc. etc. Forget all of that nonsense....this game got it right when some of the latest AAA releases have gotten it so wrong! The core mechanics in this game (i.e. weapons handling, combat/ambient sounds, suppresion, etc.) are some of the best if not best I have seen in an FPS. The battlefield in this game is unforgiving and if you don't check corners, cover your buddies, avoid danger areas, etc. you will be dead...that simple. There is no hud to aid you, hit detection, or indicators to tell you where fire is coming from, or a medic to come revive you....it's raw battle at it's best & to be honest one of the best FPS titles I have played.Throw in COOP where you hook up with strangers you don't even know and quickly the comradery of battle brings you together and your covering each other's six's, chatting over mics, and just trying to make it to the next objective. The AI are so incredibly tough which even makes the COOP that much better....it's a challenge and keeps you coming back for more.I think this FPS will be the cinderella story of 2014. If you are looking for a truly immersive combat experience that will have your ♥♥♥ puckered at every corner then you need to get this. We will be doing quite a bit of coverage of this game at www.ShakesPub.net (i.e. YouTube, Twitter, Twitch, etc.) as we think it's pretty incredible. We are always looking for mature players to join us so swing by and get on our TS server with us.

												Yo, There hasn’ t been a great tactical shooter on the Mac in a while. Mywa.. shame, I use a Mac. Anyway..  I was fond of playing Medal of Honor and Socom back in the day, but updates to those games have long since stopped appearing on my preferred Apple platform.Leave it to an independent developer then to dish up some sweet tactical goodness in the form of Insurgency SWEEEET BABY JESUS HELLLLOOO.. A tactical shooter like Insurgency is defined by gameplay that requires you to think and act strategically, while often featuring realistic damage and bullet physics. In Insurgency, you can die in one shot if you aren’t careful. At its core, this game demands teamwork and patience. If you aren’t capable of either, I suggest you move on. Yet, those willing to learn the grade of the mechanics you will truly find a very tense and satisfying shooter at their fingertips.An introduction to Insurgency can be brutal, as you will be punished for blindly rushing about or failing to cover corners. However it is never cheap or unfair cause every death is always your own doing and a lesson on how to improve. Without any kill-cams, you have to learn where you are dying from, and why, without any particular assistance. The Insurgents usually come from certain spawn points for you to recognise this. You can have a play on a deverse amount of game modes across a large amount of different maps. The differnet categories define the type of play, some offer more tactical games, or more action while others are cooperative against the very competent AI. A quick filter system lets you easily pick what mode and map to play on, or you can browse the server list. This makes it simple to jump into whatever kind of mode you feel like playing Try servers with a mass Bot and supply point, holy heck.Insurgency’s 32-player maps offer a lot of variety. The urban cityscapes will have you crawling across streets under the cover of smoke, while another may have you creeping around mountains with a sniper rifle. Our favourite is a multi-storey building with numerous ways to get around and flank the enemy team.Fortunately for a game built on teamwork, it provides you with full communication options. Built in voice chat is clear and easy to use at the press of a button. Team chat and “all” chat are also present making coordinating enemy locations and strategy simple so long as you use it.Each side – the Security forces and Insurgents – have squads and classes each player can fill in. Each side and class has a particular range of weapons and gear available to equip via supply points. Extra ammo may cost you one point, but a suppressor will cost you four. Its fun to mix and match your supply points as you like or the match requires.  Every weapon feels weighty and each shot impactful. Just watch your aim because friendly fire can also take you or your fellow team members out.There is also a great vote kick/ban system in place that lets you call out changes to vote on. This type of player power is good and helps get rid of the occasional team-killer or unwanted map rotation.Visually Insurgency is solid. It uses Valve’s Source engine so is comparable to the likes of Left 4 Dead and Medal of Honour, possibly Battlefield.The strength of the game’s audio is appreciated. Gunshots are crisp, footsteps can place enemy locations and soldiers frequently shout out contextual commands or responses. And should you survive an explosion, you will left with your ears ringing. With no interface to tell you clip count, you must listen to know if your shots fired.Once you learn the maps, get comfortable with the game-types and play tactically as you should, Insurgency becomes a world of fun. A few small bugs are annoying, but ultimately don’t detract from your enjoyment. It won’t break your wallet and is worth the time of any shooter fan that likes a dose of realism. New players will struggle, but the community is friendly and helpful.			"

												I have 765 hours in this game. Let that sink in for a bit, over 10 months I've put 765 hours into this game. The majority of people who im friends with that play Insurgency (most of my friends list), have over 300 hours. That alone speaks for itself. Even with it's faults, and dissagreements over the certain pathes this game has taken, it is still one of the best games I have ever played/watched on Twitch. You die in around 1-3 good shots depending on your loadout, and rely on your teams help in order for you to win. If you know what you're doing, you can make your way from point a to point b mowing down everyone in your way. Be warned, this game does have quite the learning curve, and until you bring up your game awareness, it'll be hard to even get far from spawn. Be warned, this game is indie. It's made by a small dev team. There are some bugs that creep up from time to time, and there are a few quirks that get overlooked. At the end of the day, these guys have a good product. It may not be 100% refined, but they release regular updates (1-2 months always). They're commited, and they've stated they have a ""vision"".Regardless of any issues, I would HIGHLY reccomend this game to anyone who's enjoyed Arma, anything from BF, or even CS. I reviewed this game once before when I had only 8 hours, I was sold back then. You wont regret it.			"

												Salty review.It's like someone took CSGO and said ""F**k it, let's make a game that doesn't focus all on aim.""And that is what this is. A CS:GO for people who want more than aim.➥ The guns feel amazing. ➥ Each feels completely different.➥ You can customize your weapons and armour, you can add different types of ammo, suppressors, flashlights, foregrips, bipods, heavy barrels, laser sights, scopes. So you can customize based on what strategy you will take the following round.➥ Workshop support with weapon skins, character skins, and maps.     |★★★★☆|- ½☆  For lack of content, though it is only $9.99CAD. - ½☆ For mediocre graphics, they are great, but with the Source Engine, aren't anything special. Optimization does take a hit as well.Plus it doesn't have textures worth more than a brand new Ford Fusion. ˙ ͜ʟ˙			"

Product received for free
												Quite possibly the most fun and challenging game I ever played. Excellent gunplay, The adrenaline rush you can get in this game is just insane. Imagine this; You're the last one alive on your team, the only way to get them to respawn is to capture a point on the opposite side of the map. Just you, your gun, and a sea of angry NPCs between you, who won't even hesitate for a second before filling you with lead. You run room to room, across streets, through alleyways. Bullets ricocheting behind you, shooting anything that moves in front of you. You finally make it to the point, your gun low on ammo, you grab a nearby dead terrorist's RPK and set yourself up in the room, waiting as that bar fills, capping the point. Just when you think you're home free, terrorists start pouring through every direction, firing everything they got at you, to stop you from capping that point, you keep firing, mowing them down, hoping for those magic words to resonate through your headphones. ""Charlie has been secured"", and then. nothing. A terrorist gets a lucky headshot on you, killing you instantly, losing the round, but no one is mad, not your team, and definitely not you. You may have lost, but god damn that was fun.Its moments like these that sets Insurgency apart from other shooters. The only other shooter I can think of that can give you this kind of rush, is Arma. Speaking of which, in some ways these two games are quite similar. While yes Arma is a open word milsim, and Insurgency is a closed map FPS. Both still are the same in quite a few ways. First off both games feature a leaning mechanic, both allow you to deploy a bipod for better aim, and both let you customize your weaponry. Unlike most shooters. Insurgency tries to give you as less info as possible. Essential things like your teammates and points are present, but things like health and ammo aren't. The only indication of how much ammo you have is a number in the corner. Showing how much magazines you have. Though, that doesn't mean they're full. You could leave 1 bullet in each mag, and still have the game tell you that you got 5 magazines. As for health, lets just say. typically no armor is a one shot kill from most weapons, light armor is 2 shots, and heavy armor allows you to survive up to 3.I highly recommend Insurgency to anyone, and also recommend Day of Infamy, originally a mod for Insurgency, like Insurgency originally was a mod for Half Life 2. Now a stand alone early access game that takes place during the European WW2 theatre, Oh, and lets not forget the weapons themselves, American soldiers are granted access to all the typical US armed forces rifles. M4A1, M16A4, M14EBR, the M249 and many more. The Insurgents on the other hand get more typical weapons of a middle eastern faction, weapons like the AK74, AKM and RPK, but also featured surplus WW2 weapons like the M1 Carbine, MP40, Sterling, and the Mosin.All in all, amazing gunplay. pretty good selection of firearms, pretty decent though small community, and very easy to get immersed into and have fun, even when failing the same mission over and over.

One Of The Best Hardcore FPS Games In Recent Years! - August 2014Insurgency is a unique FPS game set in the Middle-East based on teamwork, tactics and some realism that offers multiplayer, co-op and solo modes, if you like first person shooter games then do yourself a favor and get this fantastic game! ImmersionOne of Insurgency's strong suits is immersion; the look, feel and handling of the weapons, the little sway of the glass scopes when they pop in place when aiming down sight (ADS) and how the area inside the scopes is magnified while the rest of the environment remains visible resulting in no tunnel vision, the smoke that comes out of the barrel after firing a few rounds, the light effects of the flashlight and tracer ammo on night maps (yes, there are real night maps!), the reload animations and the overall attention to detail: it's like you are really holding an assault rifle in your hands and together with the solid player movement you will feel the tension of being in an actual firefight somewhere in the Middle-East. Insurgency never goes into full simulator mode because there is plenty of quick CQC action in the different and fun game modes for upto 32 players on the many diverse infantry-only maps (the vehicles in the game are not operational). E.g. in Firefight mode you will respawn each time your team captures an objective so you don't have to wait until the next round to get back in the game.The brutal and realistic sound effects of the weapons and explosions (the sound of firing an RPG is phenomenal!) and lifelike ambient sounds all add to the unique atmosphere in Insurgency, it just feels right and the completely clutter free screen will only pull you further into this virtual world. There is no minimap, no permanent crosshair, no health bar, no bullet count, no kill cam or kill feed so you have to confirm your kill visually: just like IRL! The music complements the different environments very nicely: Insurgency is one of those rare games where you can leave the music turned on while playing.  Gameplay MechanicsThe gameplay mechanics of Insurgency are solid and robust and are working fine; there are no netcode problems, no hitreg problems (all weapons are hitscan), no sudden ""killed in action"" deaths, no trade kills, no tickrate problems (many servers run at a tickrate of 100 or higher) and you will not die when you are already well behind cover. In short: this game is based on skill, not on luck or random events! Of course this could be expected from the latest iteration of the proven Source Engine that is used in Insurgency.Other FeaturesInsurgency has many other great features, such as:a stamina system that affects your aim and your breathing a weight system that affects your running speed and your stamina, all items weigh something and there is a limit to what you can carry a unique free-aim system: there is no permanent crosshair on your screen!  built-in 3D proximity VOIP: you can hear other players, also enemies, talk if they are close to you in-game a supply point system, all weapons are available right away (no boring grinding or lame assignments to unlock weapons) but supply points are limited so you have to make tactical choices for your loadout available classes and how they are always balanced in the teams (no 16 snipers in one team)co-op modes with upto 7 of your buddies to play against bots with different AI levels (this mode is so good that a bunch of players are only playing co-op!)quickly accessible mute function for players you do not wish to hearone of the best implementations of multiplayer night maps of any FPSvisual map voting systemmany different and challenging game modes, i.e. Skirmish, Conquer, Occupy, Ambusha ranking system (with pvp, co-op and individual stats)SupportNew World Interactive (NWI) is a small indie game developer fully focused on the continued development of Insurgency so whenever there is a serious problem the devs are on top of things with quick fixes and active involvement on the forums. There are also regular updates, new features,  DLCs and full Steam Workshop support for the many different mods that are created by the community. Very surprisingly in this day and age is that all updates, DLCs and improvements are  completely free, there is zero extra cost for the user. NWI reminds me how it used to be back in the day and they deserve our support & praise for that. Lastly, players can opt-in to the Insurgency Beta branch to help test new features, weapons and maps by playing together with the Insurgency developers (how cool it that?!) and give them valuable early feedback on the game.Room For ImprovementAfter all this praise you would think Insurgency is perfect, well it may be one day but some things can still be improved: texture wise the Source Engine is showing its age here and there even though Insurgency is doing an amazing job and still produces some really nice graphics and great looking maps the bots in co-op mode sometimes seem to get stuck in corners or behind a wallthe in-game server browser is not integrated with the rest of the game GUI and the filter settings are not savedin-game menus could be more user friendly Done!it would be great if the volume of the ambient sounds could be set louder separately from the gun sounds player shadows are sometimes missing on some surfacesthe player character customization and looks could be better (we need more visual clues to see if someone is wearing heavy armor or not)the spotting mechanism could be better Done!saving loadouts would be a very welcome feature (and a time saver)there are no goats, cowbells, chickens or dogs ... for that extra immersive effect :)VerdictIn the end, what matters is this: is Insurgency worth your time and the retail price of €14.99? The answer to both questions can only be an overwhelmingly ""YES!"". Insurgency is one of the best tactical FPS games that I have played in recent years, I have almost stopped playing all other FPS games because of it - I'm hooked! Absolute must-buy game.9.9/10 "

												Not sure why I disregarded this title for so long. I should have checked it out sooner, but I guess the advantage is that it's much more fleshed out now. The cooperative Player-Vs-AI modes remind me of oldschool Rainbow Six, and the PVP modes are brutal.No healthmeter, no minimap, friendly fire, no ammo count. None of that Call of Duty crap. The random players I encountered in the PVE modes were all very friendly and while everyone wants to succeed it is incredibly difficult. The difficulty made for amazing gameplay and communcation.

												Insurgency is one of the best and most intense shooters I have ever played untill now and I think that, after having played over 450 hours, I am ready to give a review!Gameplay:Insurgency isn't a kind of hardcore or fast pace shooter where you just blast your way through players but, instead, is more like a slow pace game of precision and strategy where every corner must be checked in order to make your progress and achieve your goals.One of the things that clearly contributes to this slow and very tactical pace is the damage model: 1 or 2 shots....and BAAM...you're dead! Here, there are no medics or healing tools....if you go down you will have to wait for your respawn. This feature is important because you will really have to adapt and evolve in a very particular gamestyle that Insurgency demands from you.Teams:There are two factions in the game: the Insurgents and the Security Forces,a kind of American Marines. These two have different kinds of weapons and each weapon has its own behaviour like firerate, recoil, damage impact and sound. For instance, the sounds coming from guns are inportant because, to help you during a gunfight, it will be wise to memorize each sound from each gun to get a clear notion if you are near a friend or enemy.Types of Challenges:The game has multiple types of challenges available like Push, Skirmish, Firefight, Strike or Occupy, all these based on battles supported by waves being permanently deployed for both teams.There are also new and innovative modes like the V.I.P, in which you have to defend or kill (it depends on which team you are) a player whose goal is to get to a safe point across the map.You have the possibility to play P.V.P (against other players) or fighting against A.I.Maps and Levels' Design:Insurgency's maps are some of the most intense and well designed arenas that I ever played. There are different kinds of backgrounds like urban settings or open landscapes.The urban maps are characterized by high density streets and buildings, which are more destined to infantry and close quarters battles, with many narrow alleys and open courtyards, top floors, walkways, bridges and ground-floor shops....many spaces to hide or ambush! The open maps are more favorable to snipers and sharpshooters backing up the attack of the infrantry on the front line of the battle.As you can see, each type of map will determine your strategy and the way you react during a battle. Fighting on a street surrounded by windows will have a very different feel than fighting completely exposed on an open field...Night Maps !!! (use your Night Vision Goggles !!!)One of the most incredible features in this game are the night battles that clearly distinguishes Insurgency as a top-notch game. In these battles you may need your night vision goggles in order to make your way through the map. Trying to spot your enemy in the darkness as you walk your way through the map is one hell of a challenge! For instance, if you have your night vision goggles on and if you stare at a bright light...then DAMN !....you may get blinded for a few seconds, giving your enemy a chance to kill you!The night battles have some of the most incredible environments you will ever have on a shooter...needless to say the battles are epic and very tough to win.Graphics / Source Engine:Insurgency runs smooth and is well polished for a Source Engine game. If you are expecting for a top of the chart graphically optimized game...then Insurgency is not what you are looking for.Instead, Insurgency relies on using an old but trusty graphics engine to create an immersive and well conceived shooter for people who want to experience a true tactical game.Community and Developers:The community is very friendly and receptive and new players have been welcomed day by day. The quality and singularity of the game contributed to gradually establish a loyal and commited legion of players who help to improve the quality of gameplay for every newcomers and also to maintain high levels of players thoughout Insurgency's many servers.Even so, today I think that this community is still kind of small, a fact that I hope changes soon given the extreme qualitiy of the game, its developers and the people who play it and help it to improve. This game fully deserves a larger community.The developers are incredible and they created a game whose purpose is to achieve an immersive game, instead of a dull and only graphically optimized game. The new contents for the game are always free and new stuff is always being implemented like maps and guns.Nowadays, Insurgency is a rare pearl that concentrates and explores to the limit everything that we want in a game: fun and innovation!...And the love for this game is still going! I nominated it for the “Test of Time” Award 2016.I just keep coming back for more and more!			"

												Insurgency is a tactical multiplayer FPS set in the middle-East and it's best described as a hybrid between Counter Strike and Red Orchestra. I would say the game is less realistic than Red Orchestra but more realistic than Counter Strike. The maps are also in between those games, so bigger maps than CS but smaller maps than RO.Obviously, gameplay is the most important aspect of a game like this. Controlling your character and shooting just feels great. Since you often die in just a few hits, taking cover is essential and it makes your adrenaline pumping, every time you find yourself in a tight spot. At the start of each game you have to pick one of the many classes and spend your points on guns (20+ in total) and other gear like; light/heavy armor, flashbangs, grenades or Nightvision goggles. There are quite a few different game modes for you to choose from like; Ambush (one player is the VIP and should be protected, otherwise your team loses), Firefight (defend objectives from the opposing team). There are also a few modes to co-op vs bots like; Checkpoint (destroy, occupy and defend your positions, throughout the map), Hunt (Kill all bots and destroy their cache).The graphics look great, nothing really to complain about. As you would expect from a game set in the middle-East, most maps have a lot of sand and brown/yellow colors (although there are a few snowy maps as well). Still, there's lot of variety between the maps. Some for close quarter combat, some for open ranged combat, the developers simply did a great job creating interesting maps with the same template.Personally, I prefer Insurgency over Counter Strike, at least for the time being. I can recommend this to anyone, who's looking for a good tactical multiplayer shooter. "

												You can't ask for a better price on a solid FPS like this, especially when it occasionally goes on sale.I used to play a lot of COD back when I was an XBOT. This game ♥♥♥♥♥ all over anything Infinity Ward has done. I'm glad I switched to PC, otherwise I would have never known about this game. Seriously, it's one of the most intense games I've ever played. The developers know what they're doing and have been very good with constant updates for as long as I've been playing. Plus, it has steam workshop, so mods makes this game extra enjoyable. Beware of the rage-inducing RPG. I can't stress that enough, I've seen people rage quit because of it.			"

												You'll be frustrated, a lot. You'll often find yourself going, ""w...t...f, that didn't make any sense."" Confusion and rage are probably pretty common in this game. The AI can be fairly challenging even on the lowest settings. There's always a certain percentage of human players who are completely clueless or inept. But when you get with a team working well, there's quite a bit of satisfaction in it. Keep in mind, I only play co-op. After 80+ hours in the game, I think I can say it has joined my personal ranks of addictive co-op, joining the likes of Payday The Heist and Left 4 Dead 2. I've only had the game for about a month, but it seems the developers are keeping up with it, as they near a year of official Steam release. Their community manager even streams the game now and then.Also, workshop! There's some cool skins and sound mods so far. I keep a mod for weapon sounds, which makes the gunfire in a firefight much more intense and nerve wracking. Completely worth the $5 I paid for it. A must-have if you enjoy getting killed frequently.			"

												So I was enlisted in the army, yeah? First day at bootcamp, this instructor (who am I kidding, he wasn't teaching us recruits jack sh!t) told me to run and crawl through a warehouse. Assuming I never shot a gun before, he intructed me to shoot non-moving targets with a pistol. Let's be real, it wasn't any trouble at all, especially since I've had a prior background with guns. I moved through the rest of the training like it was butter. I was here to show this jack@ss that I wasn't here to mess around. At the end, something unexpected happened. Insurgents started attacking our base. My unit quickly took positions to take out the enemy. Nothing would ever prepare you to get into a firefight on the first day of boot camp. After what seemed like hours, we finally pushed them back. Taking count of the casualties, we pushed out of the base to push back the rest of the lingering Insurgents. Months later, my unit and I were assigned to an Insurgent filled area in the desert. We had to take control of the immediate area and eliminate as many hostiles as possible. It was rough, sand flying in your face, the hot sun beating down on you while you're loading with 50 lbs of equipment. You hear war stories from vets back at base about men, friends, they've lost. Those don't prepare you for when it actually happens in battle. My bud was laying prone next to me, trying to pick off hostiles with his M4A1. Watching the left flank, I didn't notice the goat-♥♥♥♥er coming up to us on our right. Next thing I knew, I heard a gunshot, immediately followed by a yell. I looked over and saw blood gushing out of my buddy's neck. No matter how many pills I drink or how much booze I ingest, nothing will ever let me forget the look on his face as he died. Or the stream of blood painting the sand red. To avenge my fallen comrade, I unleashed hell upon the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that killed him. Even after my mag was empty, I continued to pull the trigger, the clinking of the empty chamber the only thing I was hearing. The Insurgents unleashed something inside of me, something I didn't even know I possesed. I scavenged a grenade from a casualty and pulled the pin. I threw the little green ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ into a building, hearing the explosion and screams following it. My squad and the Security squad accompanying us eliminated any remaning tangos and took the area. We called in a medivac for the injured and waited until we were extracted. Most sat on a nearby building's stairs, staring off into the distance or messing with their equipment. The relief we all felt when we saw the evac coming was undescribable.TL;DR 10/10 would complete the training course and play Buhriz Push again.			"

												Insurgency is an amazing game that blends the one-life CS:GO formula with less arcadey, more tactical, teamwork based gameplay with realistic elements seen in shooters like ARMA. If you're looking for a more realistic and tense First Person Shooter, Insurgency delivers this amazingly well without being a full blown simulator. It perfectly compromises realism and gameplay into one addicting experience. PROS - Great graphics. The game has very good visuals, whether it be a large desert area with few buildings and abandoned humvees, to multiple indoor areas such as markets, a ministry, and more. The gun models and textures are all decent as well. - Sound design. The soundtrack itself is very good. It fits the mood of the game and especially in tense moments, when you turn the tide of the match, to even defeat. It captures these themes fairly well. However, where  the sound design really excels is its attention to detail. From immersive suppressive gunfire sounds that seem to ping right above your head  to footsteps of a rebel approaching your corner, it really puts you into the firefight. - Gunplay. I haven't had such satisfying gunplay since the classic PAYDAY 2 days, which is impressive. Insurgency really puts a lot of research and details into making their weaponry faithful and pretty realistic too. The guns feel nice and they're a blast to fire. Even though some guns serve more or less the same purpose, they still feel and look different, which is a welcome change. Popping enemies and scoring headshots is really satisfying despite there being no hitmarkers in this game. - Lots of game types. Insurgency has a healthy variety of game types, so you won't get bored easily. There's Checkpoint, Conquer, Survival, and more. Other than PvP there is also a PvE Co-Op, which also has multiple gametypes. You could easily play only the PvP aspect of Insurgency or just the Co-Op aspect of Insurgency and still get many hours out of the game. - Good selection of maps. There's a lot of different settings in this game, even if most of them take place in a desert. Other than that, each map feels different, with different vantage points, cover, and more. There's smaller, indoor maps to sprawling, Battlefield esque maps like Buhriz with very open areas.- Point system. There's a pretty nice point system that is similar to the CS:GO system where you buy weapons and armor, but instead of money you use a permanent supply of points. For example, you'll start off with 5 points, with your gun being one point, attachments and extra armor being another. This adds a level of customization and various ""builds"" of gear within different classes. - Modding/workshop. There is a very active modding and workshop community in Insurgency. Whether it be drastically different gun models, attachments, sound packs, or even complete reworks of the game that you can play in custom servers. It strays away from the cancerous microtransactions (looking at you CS:GO and PAYDAY 2) and instead allows you to endlessly customize with no limit...and it's free. - Community. Now this might be a surprise. An Online modern and fairly popular FPS not having a completely cancerous community? Yes, that's right. Now, of course you'll run into the eventuall troll, mic spammer, and the guy who keeps saying ""Allahu Ackbar"" trying really hard to be funny, but other than that most of the community is very cooperative. I've met many friendly players across multiple servers and game modes. CONS - There really isn't much to say bad about this game. It's that good. There are a small amount of bugs and every blue moon your game might crash, but it's understandable since it's a smaller team working on this game. Also if you alt tab from games a lot this game does take forever to tab back in, but these are nitpicks. NEUTRAL - Minimalistic HUD. Personally I love this HUD since it not only fits the realistic feel of the game and removes the clutter, and it looks nice too. But it's up for the player if they like this type of HUD or not. - No single player. This isn't a single player/story driven game. There's a short tutorial that acts as an introduction but there's not much more than that. If you're looking for a big story or narrative you should search somewhere else. The fun in this game is found in the multiplayer. - Realistic elements and gameplay. This isn't CS:GO or Call of Duty. It's more like Battlefield and ARMA combined with the life system of CS:GO. A stray bullet can and will end your life even if you have a helmet and extra armor. This game requires more of your attention, teamwork, and slower tactical gameplay. You can't run and gun the same like in other shooters. So again, if you're looking for arcadey gameplay like that, look somewhere else.Overall, Insurgency is an excellent game. It has constant free updates, bug fixes, and the game itself is only $15, which it itself is a huge steal. Even then this game goes on sale pretty often, so you really get your bang for your buck here. Considering all the factor's I've mentioned, the price, and the developers' work ethics, I'd give this game a full 10/10. I highly recommend this game for almost every military FPS fan.			"

												Welcome to a refreshingly visceral, no holds barred, vision of infantry-based tactical combat. In their attempt to recreate the tension and brutality of old-school tactical shooters of decades past, New World Interactive have created an original and satisfying gameplay experience that rightfully sets itself apart from its contemporaries. Welcome to Insurgency.The base concept of this title might initially seem all too familiar to fans of the FPS genre; two opposing teams engage in pitched close quaters combat attempting to outmanuver and outgun each other accross a variety of objective-based game modes. However to turn away at this initial similarity would be to miss out on arguably one of the most refreshing and authentic presentations of adversarial modern combat that stands out within a genre so often cited for its notable lack of innovation.In Insurgency bullets are as lethal as their real life counter parts and many players may swiftly meet their end with little more than a single mouse click or the shortest burst of enemy fire. This fact alone enforces a chilling uniformity to the title's playing field, where advantage is gained primarily through individual player skill, experience, team cohesion and map knowledge. Insurgency is unrepentent in its difficulty and newer players will likely face a substantial intial learning curve as they spectate proceedings from beyond the grave. What is worthwhile however rarely comes easily and Insurgency's unapologetic lethality, combined with a tense and at times frenetic pace serve to create a satisfying portrayal of close combat that is at once engaging, unquestionably challenging and always deadly.The expansive arsenal of modern (and some decidedly older) weapons are without exception brilliantly rendered and immensely satisfying to use. Whether picking off foes from afar with an M14, storming an objective with a german mp40 or laying down suppressing fire with an RPK or M249, the the authenticism and individual characteristics of the weapons depicted in Insurgency are immediately apparent; to put it simply they just 'feel' right. In addition, a formidable array of equipment and attachments are made available to the player depending upon their class, from grenade launchers, bipods, silencers, body armour and hand grips to a variety of ranged and close quater weapons sights, armour pericing, tracer and anti-personnel rounds as well as grenades that burn, stun, obscure and destroy, the list of equipment is long with each addition offering up a different tactical advantage.The ferocious nature of the events unfolding on screen are expertly narrated by a robust and terrifyingly diverse and authentic sound design. Everything from the distant pops of enemy fire, an AKM expounding virtue on full auto, to the sharp supersonic snaps of incoming fire are all superbly realised and serve to enhance immeasurably Insurgency's gritty portrayal of close combat.Insurgency's battles rage accross an impressive range of extremely well designed maps encompassing tense urban engagements with nerve-shredding ranged firefights accross a variety of diverse topographies. From the dusty streets of a middle-eastern hillside town, to the frozen wastes of an afghan mountain village, Insurgency's maps each carry a distinct, authentic atmosphere and are at once immediately engaging. Multiple routes to objectives create ample opportunity for tactical flexibility while multi-levelled buildings and high mountain peaks present three-dimensional battlefields where keepng an eye on a window overlooking an alley might just save your life. Each of the maps are further enhanced by night-time variants where the tension reaches new heights as players equip nightvision, flashlights, smoke grenades and flares in an effort to keep the darkness at bay.Insurgency comes bundled with a variety of different game modes from those centred around the traditional seizure of map zones and the destruction of weapon caches, to the more novel VIP escort missions and intelligence retrieval (Insurgency's take on capture the flag) where teamwork and communication becomes increasingly paramount. Cooperative mode sees players securing successive objectives while facing an extremely skilled AI opposition with frighteningly swift trigger fingers and a seemigly unhealthy appetite for RPGs.Insurgency deftly avoids a politically charged narrative in the depiction of its principal adversaries who are known only as Security and Insurgents. The precise identity of these groups and their motivations are at best left up to the player's imagination and at worst, a casual irrelevence. The injection of a welcome touch of dark humour (and strong language) in the game's impressive voice acting seems to remind the player of the game's true intent as foremostly an entertainment piece. The focus here is not on white-knickle realism but rather on creating a fair and brutal sense of authenticism. While material penetration and surpression effects are present, one should not expect to find an accurate ballistics model or any semblance of a functioning wounding system. The ommission of such features is due in part to engine limitations and the remainder to conscious decisions surrounding game design. Insurgency is purposefully not a military simulator and arguably emerges a far better title as a result. Insurgency is heartily recommended to fans of the tactical shooter genre and those looking for a fresh and lethal take on squad based infantry combat. Fans of more robust military simulators might all to easily find this title a guilty pleasure and one no less intense or satisfying, while other fans may find their loyalties to more established franchies severely tested. New World Interactive, a relatively small team of developers, have actively and continually supported, updated and refined Insurgency, all the while remaining engaged with a growing and passionate player community. This level of dedication and fidelity is to be highly commended especially during a time of notable ambivalence by their larger AAA peers and this hard work and resolve readily shines through in the quality and polish of the title. Insurgency's greatest strength remains its presentation and execution of core gameplay mechanics which culminate in the creation of a fast paced, nerve-shredding competitive combat experience where each and every encounter with the enemy is brief, terrifying and always lethal.

												Insurgency. Without a single doubt in my mind this is one of the best purchases I have ever made on Steam. This game is the definition of a gritty, hardcore, and realistic shooter. It can have it's ups and downs, bugs and etc, however this game is amazing and I truly mean it. If you've ever played games such as ARMA or CS:GO and enjoyed them then you will undoubtfully love this game. Not only is the gameplay a key role to a great game, but so is the community. You may be saying ""What community? All I hear is a bunch of idiots yelling allah akbar!"", this may be true, but what I mean by community is the developers. It isn't very uncommon for me to run into the developers while in game. In fact I have played with Mikee on his stream on multiple occasions. The fact that they are so close to the players that you can touch them is amazing. If you were ever to watch Mikee stream (every saturday at 3PM EST) you would get the sense of close knit communtity I feel whenever playing. The developers in a whole are very open to suggestion in the community and know exactly what it takes to make a gritty and hardcore FPS.Pros:- Hardcore and gritty gameplay.- Immersive gameplay.- Fantastic voice acting and weapon sounds in general.- Strategic planning can be easily made with the right team of players.- Great content within the community workshop.- It feels like it's own game, not some copy of another FPS. This is a true original.- Challenging gameplay whether it is on co-op or PvP.- Realistic recoil on larger assualt rifles.- Ethusiastic developement.Cons:- As of late there has been some bugs related to hit detection. However I've only came across this issue in co-op so far.- The shout wheel can be some what hard to maneuver when moving around/firing a gun.- Many, many players constantly yell ""Allha akbar"", ""Snack bar"", etc. If you don't like it when people ruin the immersion as such, you may want to mute them.- Competitive mode is practically empty, sadly. It is extremely hard to find a competitive game which is full.- As of now there is no actual ranking system for competitive, but this is understandable since competitive is relatively new.- The lower difficulty for AI in co-op can be slightly mentally deficient, however the higher levels of AI can see through smoke and blow your head off. This isn't overly common, but it does happen.Conclusion:I can recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a unique and hardcore take on the FPS genre. I have very much enjoyed this game, myself and I hope to put many more hours into it as the game develops and grows in the forseeable future. If you have been contemplating buying this game and my review has pointed out qualities you want in a game then now is the time to buy it. "

												I believe Insurgency delivers on what it promises. A fast paced, first-person tactial shooter. The guns are great, they feel very realistic and satisfying when you use them, The game visuals are really impressive for a game running on the source engine, The community is great,as they accept new players unlike *Cough* CSGO *Cough* , and heaps of gamemodes and maps that will keep you hooked on the game for hours on end. So basically, if you enjoy tactial FPS games that requires skill like Battlefield, i can definitely assure you will like this game.			"

												In comparison to another famous tactical terrorist-vs-counter-terrorists shooter...Insurgency has...-MUCH more tactical gameplay-Community ten times better, with people that actually want to win the game-No Harambe,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the Illuminati and other ""dank"" memes-No crap skins, traders, scammers, and people inspecting their knife to look cool.-Interesting game modes that take a bit of thought to understand.-Mic spammers? Occasionally, but you can only hear them when they're up close, which is great.-The Sterling Submachine gun. I mean c'mon. How can you not buy a game with the Sterling?Overall, Insurgency is an amazing game, and is a breath of life in comparison to other mil-shooters of today. And, it is amazingly cheap for its quality.Great game, and I'm looking forward to buying Day of Infamy.			"

												The amount of tactics/counter tactics and thinking on your feet needed in this game to not get squashed like a bug really separates it from any other FPS I’ve played. It makes for interesting gameplay every time, mix that with the ingame voicechat that enemy’s can hear when you are close really gets your heart pumping.This game really hits the sweet spot of first person shooters, not to wide open like Arma or battlefield and not to close quarters like CoD, but still offering both sides of that gameplay with long alleyways for snipers and close building for the sub machine gun enthusiasts.9/11 would kill insurgent scum again.Re-Review at 200 hoursStill going strong and loving every part of this game.Great to see this game number 30 of steams top 100 most played games.I felt bad about getting this much gameplay out of a $15 game, i have now purchased the game over 22 times and given they keys away to the community.Great job Devsre-re-review at 300 hours.

Highly recommend this game.There are no levels, and no perks. Loadouts (depending on class, such as Militant, Specialist, & Support) and equipment variations (such as weapon attachments, Light or heavy armor, sidearms, and different explosives) are the only thing you can work with to give you that edge on the battlefield.One of my favorite things in Insurgency besides its realism, is the fact that you RARELY ever see ONE player dominating a match.

												Insurgency - A Game you should have played.Its great.The Graphics might be not the best,in fact Insurgency use an older Source Engine but the Explosions and the Weapon Finish looks awesome.You can choose between Insurgents and Security,each Faction has his own Weapons and Classes.Theres tons of Guns such M16,AK47,Galil,RPG-7,RPK and many many more,you wont miss any in this Game,trust me.The Community is nice,you will experience alot of People screaming ""ALLAHU AKBAR"" after shooting their Rocket launcher or at the end of the Match (im one of them).Also,Steam Workshop provides lot of Community-made Skins for Character Outfits,Weapon Mods such as Scopes,Maps and many more.This Game is pretty Hardcore compared to Call of Duty,Battlefield or CSGO.At the beginning its bit hard to understand what to do,where to go,where the enemy is coming from and so on.At this Point Insurgency is lot harder than the Competition and you will spend hours of hours to learn this Game.I can recommend this Game anyone who likes hardcore FPS.

												Insurgency started as a Source Engine mod, and it evolved through much iteration to finally become what it was always meant to be, a full indie game.The combat is tight and solid, the weapons look, feel and sound great, and thanks to the many features like being suppressed under heavy fire, or the dozens of weapon attachments and modifications, the game offers an ample and varied close quarter combat experience.When under fire, the stress induced by the particle effects and the bullet cracking and ricochets around you is something to behold, it really creates a feeling of fear and panic.Aside from the very solid PVP modes, the game also offers Coop modes, which allows up to 8 friends to play online against AI controlled enemies, and I must say I haven’t had so much fun since the old Rainbow Six “Terrorist Hunt” modes.Finally a game that scratches my tactical close quarter combat itch, and it scratches it good.

												The most poignant impression of this game I've heard was one from a teammate who was huddled with me next to a windowsill. Bullets were whizzing past the panes and we knew peeking out meant certain death.""God damn, this reminds me of '05, man.""It's a heart-pounding multiplayer experience that's all about the victory and team coordination rather than the body count. The visuals on Source are impressive and stylized—most maps have the look of an oil painting. The audio is spectacularly immersive, with superb ambient sound design. There's so much attention to detail in this game, and it gets those details just right.If you're into tactical shooters, try this one out. Highly recommended.			"

												It's like Counter Strike and Red Orchestra had a baby. Everything feels like it has parts of both games.The maps are bigger than the average CS maps, but not as big as RO ones.The gameplay is much like RO, but the game modes are much more reminiscent of CS.You have class limitations like RO but some degree of inventory management, like CS.You have people using Mosin-Nagants like RO and people playing terrorists going ""Allahu Akhbar"" like CS.If you're looking for something a little more realistic than CS but in the same spirit, or something that's easier to pick up and play and faster than RO, Insurgency is the way to go.

												Insurgency, another one of those games that keep the Source Engine alive.Pros:- Great CSGO-like visuals. ( I could actually say this would be CSGO if it was a DECENT game )- Very realistic sound effects that emerge the player deeper in the firezones.- Truly depends on teamwork and each player should live up to their class.- The AI is very well coded, they will surpress players and even cover their teammates.- Very fun to play with friends.Cons:- There should be more models and weapons for the player to use.- Bullets don't have a travel time ( Source limitation ) like in most realistic shooters which makes it feel more like a game.I would really recommend this game for both Casual and Serious players.

Insurgency - sounds quite like a clichée shooter name doesn't it? It actually isn't, as the game proves it's stable and well-working engine. Let's start off with a list of good things about the game!+ Very complex and smart level design, keeping you edgy in the Modern-War set game+ A good amount of arcade and realism aspects keep you entertained with a good variety of weapon customizations+ Extended controls allow you to Arma-like use realistic movements that can help you out in many situations+ No need to play hundreds of hours to unlock each and every attachment; grinding doesn't exist in this game and makes it a very methodical and fair way to tweak your gunsGameplay-wise, the realism-style weaponry ranges from modern tactical Iraq-War gear, up until the classic good old WW Mosin Nagant. Insurgency offers you a variety of realism, arcade gamemodes and an overall nice feeling, which keeps you edgy with a very smart level design and clear sound design. Gunplay gives you a good amount of fun balanced with skill. Nobody's perfect, and neither Insurgency; so here are some quite game-breaking flaws:- Headshots give you a 100% 1hit kill chance, making some weapons very overpowered- A lacking good AI in singleplayer doesn't make this the best game to play by yourself- Sadly, like most shooters; odd hitboxes can probably cause you to be very angry; so be warned.- Unbalanced health/damage system, very COD-like you may die because someone shot you in the ankle. Twice. I'd like to keep it short, so here's the conclusion about Insurgency:Overall, it impresses me how ""unpopular"" Insurgency is, among all of those modern-shooter trends. It's very slow-paced, methodical and is alot about skill and tactics. It gives you an opportunity to think about every step you make, but sadly enough the odd hitboxes and upsetting flaws quite often takes you away the vibe the game appears to show. I do recommend it, and would buy it again, but I am most definetely sure there are better games regarding realism;tactics; and so on - but if you're not into Call Of Duty, but dislike Battlefield, this game will serve you well, and keep you entertained (atleast for a while.)7/10 flashbangs "

												Insurgency. Where to start with what i think is an absolutely amazing game?Starting out as only a mod this game has come far in my opinion.Insurgency offers tactical team-based shooting missions and fights to its players. With a wide variety of balanced maps; and an even wider range of weapons with various attachtments to fit your playstyle. Insurgency is the perfect game for you if your into fast paced tactical and action filled fights. One thing which i think seperates Insurgency from any other FPS is it's realism. Motion blur, wounds, body hotspots, i could go on! You ever wanted a game where you can storm the enemy lines, sliding and ducking for cover, luckily dodging bullets and winning the game for your team? Or maybe you want to lay back with a LMG and suppress your enemies, providing backup to your allies and team members and winning their favour? Well, let me tell you. This. Game. Is. That!Before i go into more detail i'll tell you why i love Insurgency over games such as Call of Duty. As many of the fellow FPS gaming community knows, some FPS's unbalance the way they work. Some involve vehicles which makes not being in a vehicle a massive disadvantage to playing. Other games simply are played by running around spraying bullets everywhere until a kill is obtained. Well not Insurgency. In this game there are no vehicles, and running in the open carelessly will get you killed. This game is balanced in that sense, it's as easy to die as it is easy to kill someone. A few shots and you're dead. None of that; ""I can take a whole magazine of SMG rounds to my chest and walk it off"" nonsense. So overall it's the balancing which attracts me to Insurgency.When i first started playing Insurgency i admit i was bad and it was a hard game. But unlike others this didn't throw me off. Any good gamer knows practise makes perfect. The more i played, the better i got. You may also find this game very hard if you're used to Call of Duty or Battlefield. So take my word when i say don't run around. Take cover, think, know your surroundings, then fight!So you're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, this guy is sorta making sense"" or maybe ""This game sounds great for me"". Well if i haven't convinced you already let me give a summary in a few words.-Fun-Money's Worth-Friendly-Thrilling-Replayable-Overall AmazingNow my ratings on various aspects for an FPS shooter:Graphics: 9/10Realism: 9/10Balanced Gameplay: 9/10Community: 8/10""Good-Time Feeling"": 10/10Multiplayer: 9/10Story: N/AReplayability: 9/10Overall: 94/100Sources: 650+ Hours of Gametime              Massive variety of FPS games played              Runs a highly known Insurgency Clan			"

												As Tom Clancy's name is being drug through the modern shooter mud and developers have all but forgotten the golden days of ""tactical shooters"", Insurgency provides us with a prime combination of better AI and slicker graphics without sacrificing game play. Insurgency has the best elements of old school Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six combined with smoother graphics and movement. Insurgency is a little more forgiving than true realism sims like Arma or Red Orchestra, but it does so to help you stay engaged and keep you from becoming overly frustrated. One shot can kill, ammo is limited, and you can only carry one long gun along with other weight and burden restrictions. This keeps every player from turning into Rambo and the game from becoming another spray and pray trifle, yet cuts down on the learning curve of different weapons and keeps you on the front line of the action with the other players. At no time do I feel like the game is over dramatic or being sold to the Jerry Bruckheimer crowd. Weapons are, for the most part, based on modern military technology carbines and rifles and the standard fare rebel AK-47. Movement and holding down automatic fire can throw off your aim, while moving more slowly and sighting in on a target will give you endless satisfying headshots and center mass impacts. Scopes and grips can be swapped out, different magazines provide different ammo options, and frags, flashbangs, and molotov cocktails give you an edge without overpowering the rest of the map. Weapons are balanced well and play and sound realistic. I do wish they could factor bullet drop, especially for the bland sniping, but I realize that's an entirely different level of programming.The cooperative maps are more linear than Arma but you don't feel funnelled or stuck on rails like a typical action map. Most coop missions are limited to seizing waypoints or hunting enemies in the dark but it has yet to get old for me. There's no single player story per se but the fan base for Insurgency is generally more mature and coop games make for quick, fun missions. The AI does a good job of flanking and even uses grenades and fire bombs effectively, but they do periodically turn blind or run the wrong way. PvP maps are wide open with tons of hiding spots, tight corners, choke points, and high and low points to gain an advantage on your enemies. Either way, this is not a run and gun game, and the gogogo crowd is usually the first to say the game is bugged then rage quit because they couldn't hit anything at full auto while sprinting. Crouch, move, think, shoot. Developers release new maps and new weapons at times and some of the fan base have produced custom maps as well, keeping the game fresh. The graphics are pretty standard for a non-mainstream game. Shading is limited, textures repeat, and explosive effects are minimal, but the animations are fluid and when a real fire fight gets going, it's easy to become immersed. The smooth textures make distance shots easier as you can actually see your target rather than a blob of pixels in other games. Insurgency should play easy on mid-range computers as, even with a maximum amount of bots or players on the screen, my aging PC doesn't seem to have any issues. It's stable too, as I've nevery had a crash that I recall outside of a custom map not loading at the beginning.If you love combat simulators over standard first-person shooters, why are you not playing this game? It's not the most challenging and compared to Arma it feels ""casual"", but the challenge is more than satisfying in that you have to think while you play. Give it a shot and don't forget to duck.

												I can't believe I haven't been playing this game... This game is definitely underrated. They managed to make an FPS game at the sweetspot among the other combat FPS games. It's quite acurate like CS but not that much action packed, It's closer to ARMA series but not that much of a simulation, It's movement animations is like Battlefield 3 and 4 but slow-paced... So gameplay is spot-on! They've really found the sweetspot...I definitely recommend this to anyone who is into slightly tactical, slow-paced gameplay (but can be faster if you need it), a well made, good looking source engine game.

												Insurgency is easily one of the best Tactical Multiplayer FPS's I have ever played.The realistic and unforgiving combat immerses you into the most gritty and adrenaline fueled combat situations you could ever get into in a game, brought to you by New World Interactive.There are two teams to a map: Security and Insurgents. Security uses mostly military grade weapons (M16's, mk18's... anything you would expect to see the American army use), while Insurgents use mostly old Russian weaponry (AKM's, SKS's and FAL's). Each team has two squads, each with 8 roles to pick. The point system in the game balances out the amount of attachments and armor you can pick, giving you the choice to either deck out your gun with fore-grips and weapon sights and run un-armored, or armor yourself up and give yourself extra ammo with no optics or attachments on your gun. Most primary weapons are a one shot kill to the torso and head at all ranges which forces you to pick your cover and pathing to the objective carefully.There are 6 game modes for multiplayer: Skirmish, Push, Firefight, Ambush, Occupy and Strike. Skirmish and Firefight are objective zone based; go to the objective and occupy it until your team has captured it and eliminate all enemy players until their respawn waves are ceased, capturing an objective gives you a respawn wave. The only difference between Skirmish and Firefight is that Skirmish has an addition 2 objectives which can be destroyed. In Push one team needs to hold back the enemy from capturing the two objectives in each zone until their respawn waves run out. Occupy is the classic King of the Hill, Ambush is a VIP escort mission and in Strike you must destroy the enemies objective while you protect your own. Servers can hold up to 32 players (16 per team) and there is an addition co-op game mode.Overall Insurgency is a tense, strategic and realistic game, brought to you by a small and intuitive game studio that will give you endless hours of fun.Pros- Well structured maps that suit every game mode,          Extremely polished weapon models and weapon animations,          Limited Heads Up Display,          Harsh damage model/ Health System.Cons- Movement animations are a bit ""On rails"",           and Bullet ballistics are simple and outdated.

												Insurgency is an industry-defining FPS with beyond excellent graphics, challenging gameplay, and a plethora of gamemodes and community addons. It's almost as if Battlefield, Modern Warfare 2, and CounterStrike had a perfect baby with no bad genes.One of the most revolutionary aspects of Insurgency is the concept of supply credits. No longer will people run around with a completely decked out rifle, three grenades, heavy armor, and a rocket launcher! Additionally, depending on the class and mode you're playing on, you may not even have enough for any one of those things. And if that wasn't challenging enough by itself, there is also a weight limit. You'll rarely run afoul of it, but when you do, you'll definitely know.An interesting feature I have not mentioned yet is the solo gamemode. Unfortunately, there is no storyline, but the Solo mode allows you to play any mode, on any map, day or night, all by yourself. Oh, and the bots are ferocious. It's a wonderful way to practice getting familiar with weapons and maps before trying your hand at cooperative or even multiplayer. There's also a tutorial. I highly suggest you run through it, as it teaches you some very important tricks and movement commands.The Cooperative mode pits you and up to seven other people against bots that want nothing but to take your head off, literally. Whether you're running between safe houses trying to keep everybody alive, systematically clearing the whole map via checkpoints, or just shooting as many as you can before succumbing to an unavoidable RPG, you'll find that communication is key to victory. You'll find that it is a great way to develop the communications skills needed to play competitively, should you desire to do so.I want to take a moment to acknowledge the absolutely incredible community integration that New World Interactive supports. Everything from custom sounds to scope replacements are available on the Steam community, and all for free. Of course, if a server operator wants to turn these off, that is also available. As per Source2 tradition, server-side mods are very prolific and always available.Multiplayer is the most saturated of the available modes, with many NWI and private servers alike filled up to the brim with fellow players. Massive battles for control points, weapon caches, and survival dominate your environment, and sometimes you'll have to do it at night, too. God help you.In early alpha is the competitive matchmaking element. I am hesitant to like this, as professional competitive players also inadvertently bring their snotty, immature fans to the game and, just like CounterStrike Global Offensive, these underage brats ruin not just the competitive element but every mode they abuse, cheat on, and scream at in Russian. It's not easy to play this game though, so hopefully the trash will be limited to the already overplayed modes.Overall, Insurgency is a very excellent game, and for all the reasons above, is deserved of $14.99 US Dollars. I reccomend this game highly to anyone seeking a challenge, teamplay, and lots of tension. Have fun, and I'll see you in the mountains of Peak. :)			"

												I never played csgo or any source engine based games, so to start off from being a total noob to close combat tactical shooter is pretty hard but once you are ingame like aroung 2-3 hrs you can get your way into the game by knowing that you cannot run and jump from place to place without being shot and tactics play a huge role in this game as you have to try and be cool for most part than rushing to get killed than killing someone . This game feels real and its real because you die if you are spotted and you haven't spotted your enemy, just a good shot is enough to kill someone but the precision is not that easy compared to battlefield and the same goes the otherway.The mechanics in this game are good for close combat shooter and game port is simply amazing, i broke my gpu recently and thought i could play a game but this game runs at 50-60fps on 720p at a decent med-high setting on integrated intel hd graphics. The cons in the game are not that big deal, but i felt that they had to be the distance shooting without any sniper where you cant find whether you actually killed an enemy as there is no popup on screen and you can only guess by the blood when the shots are fired on enemy and the respawn takes time as the whole wave is respawed at a time. Overall i would recommend to buy game pack for you and your friend if you want to suffer for abit if you are new to close combat and learn how to play the game that is much closer to realty.			"

			Resoula reviews Insurgency, a first person shooter by New World Interactive For more Res Reviews check out our playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIKsf2nlMdD_KDb6YzF7Lhza0vgfsfFpU...		

A text review is provided below-Insurgency is a “tactical” first person shooter that challenges you to take part in modern warfare style fights between US Soldiers and generic insurgents. There is a PvP mode filled with 13 year olds yelling “allahu akbar” and a Cooperative mode with 18 year olds trying to be super tactical and will team kill the entire team if you don’t do exactly what they say. So as you can tell, the playerbase is the first pro I have for this game.The gameplay though is actually really good. The guns all have different feels to them and there is a decent variety of them. You’re able to completely modify your kits each round with a number of points available to you depending on the game mode.There are plenty of different cooperative game modes as well and difficulty settings to cater to those that prefer tactical experiences to those that just don’t like the toxic mess that is PvP in shooter games.The sounds in this game are perfect. The sounds of each shot, explosion, and the movement of your gear all complement the realistic setting that Insurgency tries to make. The graphics are sub-par because indie title on the Source engine, but it doesn’t really bother me. The narrations of the announcer can be funny at times in cooperative, that’s a pro I suppose.The biggest con is probably right here: The fact that I have already told you my thoughts on literally the entire game. It’s not an in-depth game. There’s not a lot to it. There’s no campaign, no persistence to anything other than your score card, and no reason to really play it unless you’re someone that just enjoys shooting things. The game completely lacks any form of progression too as there is nothing to unlock, not even cosmetic options. There’s no unique mechanics. It’s not really all that “realistic”. There’s nothing at all that helps this game stand out on the market.But the big question is...is it worth it?  Is a game that is so bare-bones with a dwindling playerbase and nothing to keep you wanting to play other than the fun of playing the game itself worth $10 full price? Honestly? Yes, yes it is. Insurgency is AMAZING fun when you play it with friends. If you’re a solo player I really wouldn’t even recommend this on sale, but if you have even one friend to play this with then definitely. The PvP might just prove an irritant but the hilarity of the cooperative modes alone with a friend can provide dozens of hours of gameplay and I definitely recommend this game at full price on the condition that you have one friend that will play it with you.The reason I said all that first is because the actual rating I’m giving the game is a 6/10. It is a just slightly above average game for what is is. The amount of fun to be had with friends is the only reason I can really suggest purchasing it, but now I think you have a clearer picture on the exact reason for the rating. Insurgency is a fun game, but there’s barely anything to it.			"

												CN/EN一直在找兼顾真实性与游戏性的现代战争射击类游戏，insurgency算是个人感觉不错的一个游戏了。找掩体、侧身、火力压制都做的相当不错。但对于喜欢一个劲突突突的玩家来说肯定是噩梦了，除非你的技术实在过硬，不然应该是很难在这游戏里独挡一面的。武器的配件组合、兵种选择都值得研究一番。果真乃现代战争版的Rising Storm，建议想体验这种感觉的童鞋可以试试。缺点：个人感觉地图还是不够大，上手有点难，联机人不多。Insurgency is a modern combat FPS game that I suppose it to be the combination of both reality and gameplay. Cover, sides, suppressing fire and other aspects are fairly remarkable. If you're the one likes fighting all the way down, Insurgency would be terrified to you, absolutely, without skilful abilities. Weapon seletion and combination require you to have a good study on them. Alas the map is not large enough and the game takes some time to get familiar with. Still I highly recommend it to you. And hope you like it. "

INSURGENCY (BATTLEFIELD ON PC!, Kinda ._.)when i first played this i felt like its two games mashed together, Battlefield and CSGO, though its not bad, what i mean is the gamemodes remind me of CS in some ways but ofcourse its not the exact same as it, just similar, this also ties into the bf part aswell, like the mode where you capture flags reminds of rush in bf3 same goes for the attachments but here the attachments are FARRRR Better than BF can ever hope to dream of, i get BF Is going WW1 soon but this games attachment are very similar to bf3, but in many ways better, same for the gamemodes, if you like battlefield and cs then try this out, hell even if you like FPS games in general, and by no means am i trashing this or anything, i've only played a bit but i love it, fits my tastes perfectly :DD (thx to Capitalism for gifting me this aswell :D)			"

InsurgencyInsurgency is a team based military shooter designed to be fun and realistic in a current era. This started as a realism mod for HL2 and turned into a standalone retail project. GameplayExpect a hardcore gaming experience. That means no crosshair in the center of your screen and realistic feeling weapons.  Unfortunately there is no bullet drop.  Where you aim is where it lands. However this is a fps and as far as realistic feeling fps go, this is one of the best out there.GraphicsThis game does look dated and for a good reason, it is developed on the source engine.  The game delivers a satisfying experience most of the time. This is no AAA title nor is it next gen graphics. It would be nice if New World could have produced the quality of modifications to the engine that Respawn did for Titanfall but that takes a lot of money and this was an Indie project. But lets be honest here, Valve's CS-GO doesn't even look close to Titanfall and you have to wonder why? ConclusionThis is a great game for the budget price if you enjoy realistic combat experiences.			"

But the developers are so commited to this project, so passionate about making it a good game - that it payed off, to turn into something very special. This game is worth every cent if you're into authentic war experiences, much alike to Red Orchestra and something more dynamic than ArmA.If the price of the new ArmA isn't accessible - this is one of the best alternatives on the market.The cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes are great and it's only getting better with each update.

(for what it is).It runs great, it's brutal, nice graphics, everything works (it hardly ever bugs out).CoOp and PVP modes are both great, there's a  decent , large community playing. The gun play is outstanding.In terms of negative points, smoke and AI needs work, snipers will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off and well, thats about it.Team work really pays off in this game, I like the fact it's limited in option's as it allows tactics to be deployed and for players to get better.Finally, it makes me jump alot and the suppression effect is fantastic.

												this game is great! even though it is in alpha it really isnt.  the graphics, gameplay is fantastic.  I have yet to play a game where everyone is seriously working together to complete objectives.  The maps are really great no map feels unbalanced and the game modes are fun and intense.  This game has a ton of HOLY CRAP moments such as watching your teammate get shot down try to sprint and slide to cover, when your pin down your vision is reduced to nothing, or when your about to go cap a point and C4 explodes infront of you or a building is cleared out with C4.  Guns have a great feel to the point where hip firing feels so good and accurate.  $20 for this game is fair I would say about 8 game modes, 8 maps just dont expect a ton of full servers.  As of now there are always 2 servers that have 24-30 players each and several co-op servers that are always full.			"

												Insurgency is the best Tactical FPS on the market.Don't let the low price fool you into thinking otherwise.If you try to ""play it"" like a game, you'll get spanked.To succeed in Insurgency requires cooperation and communication with your squad.Insugency separates the men from the boys.  Edit:  ""If you're not flanking them, they're flanking you"".April 3, 2016 Update:  Now, a little over two years in game and almost two thousand hours.  Started a group ""BabyBoomers"" 18 months ago.  We have a dozen folks playing from 11-70 years of age.  Collectively the group is approaching ten thousand hours of playing time.  I've never had more fun.February 18, 2017 Update:  Close to 3 thousand hours in game.  My little group is now +25 folks and total game time amongst us exceeds 15000 hours.  We run two modified Checkpoint servers.   One a 32 slot and the other a 50 slot.  This is the only game I've played in three years and likely, the next three.  Best money I've ever spent with the best folks I've ever met and now call friends and family.			"

												Since this game originally appeared here, it has had many changes. Over the years, I've always been a huge fan of the immersiveness that this game provides, of the realistic sounds (you can hear the echos and dinks!), and of the great community that surrounds it. Only one thing had stopped me from becoming the gamerest gamer of this game, and it was the inability to play it natively on Linux. I did run it in Wine without much trouble, but it still had some issues with the soundsystem, and in the end I opted to just dualboot for gaming purposes. About a month ago, I managed to destroy my Windows partition, and now have only Linux.For a long, long time, I would open my Steam Library and almost poop my pants whenever I saw Insurgency on the top of the list (favourite games tab). Up until today it had always been a disappointment - the Library showing all owned games as opposed to only those that run on Linux. But today... Today it happened for real. I cannot express the happiness. I checed three times to make sure it wasn't some sort of strange glitch. Now, I'm downloading the game. Thank you, devs. If it matters at all, you just made a grad student a lot happier :)			"

												This game is soley focused on being real. No game has compared to the realism to this game. If you think battlefield is realistic. You really have no idea. I rarely/never write reviews, But this game diserves one. If you want to feel like your in the middle of Iraq with  a firefight, This game is you.  But if you like pretend battles/Arcade battles. Leave this game alone. If you liked call of duty ""hardcore mode"" this is even more hardcore. The occasional crackling of an spitting assault rifle emptying its magazine in the distance, the occasional loud bang randomly placed on the map from a hand grenade. To the flashes of a muzzle from a random window in the distance. To your comrad falling over dead from a bullet ripping through the air from a unknown location, Forcing you to hit the deck as a hail of bullets scream over your head. Or even you unleashing a Light machine gun at a location to suppress an enemy. Ive never really been so emerced into a battle.     10/10       I recommend this game to all.			"

												It's really surprising. Insurgency has no flaws. Even to a pessimist. This challenging shooter is smart, rewarding and, most importantly, utterly impressive. The gameplay design choice to remove most of the HUD and the entire kill feedback altogether was ingenious. The decision to add the non-zoomed background when looking through the scope, material penetration, a great sound library (Even the non-integral feature of the game the Alackhu Akbar mod that I can't play without) and all the other small details that we will never notice make up the crown jewel of Insurgency. Oh, and the devs are just great, since they have created good free content. Lots of it. They're really far from the greediness of Overkill and sometimes seem more productive than the devs on Rust.

A tactical masterpiece!While the game looks like a normal first-person-shooter at first, it has a very unique feel to it once you actually play it.A new level of immersionIf you value realism, you will love this game. Everything is built to bring an immersive feeling to the player and the game does that successfully. The weapons feel like real weapons while moving, aiming and shooting. The maps look realistic and detailed. Only the sounds are not optimal and don't feel right for some weapons. Something the developers should keep and ear on.Addictive tactical gameplayThis game is nothing like the purely action-based and fast shooters like Call of Duty, but it is also even slower and more tactical than Counter-Strike, yet faster than tactical simulators like ArmA or Americas Army, while still maintaining all tactical elements. It feels like it takes that perfect line between tactics and action and once you get used to it, it becomes really addictive. Although it may be initially frustrating for some, if they are used to fast shooters.Huge potential for skillAn important factor for competitive players: Skill really matters and can make a huge difference. Although this is a different type of skill than in games like Counter-Strike, which is heavy on aiming and hitting. The actual killing in Insurgency is not too difficult, as people die from just a few hits after they get spotted. But what the focus lies on in this game is the right positioning, movement and teamplay to actual get the advantage over your opponents. Outplaying comes more from the mind in this game.Competitiveness is rather poorDespite having all that potential for it, the game is not making much use of the competitiveness. Currently there is no real matchmaking with team balance and competitive matches. The competitive scene is pretty much not existent. The developers are rather implementing more different types of gamemodes to add versatility for casual players, which is totally fine, but they also end up splitting the playerbase too much between these modes. The game is certainly lacking something like a main mode for players to compete between each other.Those 4 points are the main ones you have to know, if you are wondering if it's worth buying the game.Overall I would definetly recommend this game for tactic fans. But if you are looking for a game which brings quick and fast paced matches, it is not the right game for you.			"

Now it does look way better, and for me personally it is very important that the game now allows to customize your weapon with various attachments. I've waited for such a thing on Source for so long!!!Finally, I've found a game where I can go on with my M-9 Silenced pistol with LAM, and I feel totally badass, just like Solid Snake.

												Today's Insurgency though it and independent game, still bears the stamp of relationship with Red Orchestra. The old-fashioned shooter doesn't forgive mistakes: on the screen there isn't enough interface, enemies strike from one-two bullets. The system of classes is very similar even. Each of the parties well limited number of fighters of a certain type so it is impossible to make group entirely of snipers. The main difference of Insurgency from a ""brotherly"" series — cards. Fights generally take place on narrow small streets and in rooms. This clear decision, after all open locations look absolutely modestly, and the closed spaces — is tolerant. Technical shortcomings smoothes and the thought-over design of levels. All of you won't examine plaster in hazardous firefights equally, but you will feel on the skin as it is sensible roundabout routes are laid and shelters (by the way, it is possible to be driven to them from running start and then accurately to lean out) are placed. The revival system is curiously realized: in some modes — the only way to return capture of a key point to a system of the left players. Forcing to work carefully, we are given after all chance to break a battle course. Other rules more liberally. Besides ""fights for the territory"" in five variations are escort of important persons and mission against bots (approach or defense). About 10 years ago this game would get lost among similar: from dusty gates, Saddam's portraits and ""Kalasha"" then felt sick. Today the shooters applying for gravity, leave too seldom to disregard ""horoshist"" like Insurgency. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours). "

												Insurgency is honestly some of the best fun I've had in a long time. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a hardcore realisitic modern shooter experience. The game is based upon situations that realisitically simulate warefare, gunfights, capturing and seizing objectives - how you do this is entirely based upon the players, however in this game you will need to work as a team in order to be successful. It is rather realisitic and you can die very quickly, so if you're used to fast paced or standard shooters, this game will challenge you.I personally find it more fun to play with friends who have the game as you can communicate with them more efficiently and really enjoy yourself. Insurgency offers you a small array of training practice to get you used to the game, how it plays, the weapons, etc and it's important to play through the training part as well as have a couple of practice sessions 'till your firm with the gameplay. The game can be taken rather seriously if one wishes too, but honestly, it's brilliant fun!The only downside I have with this game is that I wish there could be more gamemodes and tactical equipment (For example tripmines/claymores) Apparantly some features are in the original mod version of the game that didn't make it to the purchasable title, but I understand this is most likely for gameplay purposes!Other than that, a fantastic game inwhich I personally waste hours of entertainment with!7.5/10			"

												After playing this game for several months and more than 500 hrs, I sadly have to say that I'm disappointed -- not so much by the game itself, but by the software quality or rather lack thereof.Playing on linux means that a ""crash reporter"" process is hugging an entire CPU core while not doing its job of actually reporting crashes. Even better, (and by better I mean worse), once the game crashes (and crashing it will), the crash ""reporter"" will keep on running. Same goes for quitting the game.The game engine itself is far from what I would consider stable as there's a plethora of rendering artefacts, checkerboard viewport depending on the chosen texture filtering, and since today's update (2017-Feb-8), the engine keeps on crashing on every single startup attempt, even though I haven't changed a single setting in months./opt/steam_games/steamapps/common/insurgency2/insurgency.sh: line 55: 14787 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) ${DEBUGGER} ""${GAMEROOT}""/${GAMEEXE} ""-game insurgency $@""
If this would've been a game that just got released, I could live with those issues (and hope for a patch), but THREE (3) years since release means that there's imo no hope for that.Would I buy it at full price? No way. 10% off? Nope. 40% off or more I would consider it, given that it can be a lot of fun once it is actually running somewhat stable.Edit to add: the ""new"" ""Anti-cheat"" (on top of the existing VAC) is known to do shady stuff, see f.e. reddit. Given that it is a kernel-level ""Anti-Cheat"", the sole difference to a rootkit is the phrase ""trust us"".So it is the perfect addition for any WIndows 10 user that already gets to enjoy spyware. For me, well, I just perma-deleted it and will move onto a game that at least somewhat respects my privacy.@ NWI: Bad move. Had you fixed your code, I would've given praise. But adding this garbage and making the game crash on every startup means that I won't buy a single game from you in the future. glhf.			"

Updated Review (after 280+ hours of play):If you enjoy hardcore, tactical multiplayer experiences intertwined with a strong, friendly community, then Insurgency is for you. You will die, and you will die again, but when you learn the ins and outs the rewards will be plenty.Seriously, this game is worth every penny at full price, so much so that you're practically robbing the developers when you get it at discount (and it gets discounted often). It's insane that the game costs a quarter of the price of most franchise shooters yet gets way more love and attention from its developers; they're not selling you a game in the hopes of turning maximum profitability before moving on to a newer, flashier title; they're selling you an investment, an experience that you will carry with you every single time you touch any other tactical shooter.Oh, and they update this game. Regularly.PROS:INTENSE REALISM: - Damage done is based on round-type; different weapons utilize different calibers of ammunition, though you are given the choice of utilizing armor piercing rounds or hollow point rounds for any given weapon; - your character will tire after sprinting for longer distances, resulting in increased weapon sway until he's had enough time to catch his breath; - you need to confirm your own kills as there are no hit markers (however, competitive servers do have kill confirm);- there is a supression system in place and your screen will start to blur when fire from critical angles;- the ability to drop into prone, or slide if previously sprinting;- some nice particle effects when firing at a wall or someone taking cover; the impact of the shots will kick up dirt, which can then be used as an impromptu smoke screen to either run away or move in on the target;- player models react to where they were last shot when being killed, changing the trajectory of their ragdoll;- don't stand behind a dude firing an RPG, you will die!AWESOME AUDIO:- The realism doesn't end at gameplay mechanics, shootouts are audibly intense;- weapon sounds are varied;- indoor/outdoor sounds are realistic.GREAT MAPS:- Since purchasing this game in 2014, they've added quite a few content updates which include a few great maps;- the core maps are mostly balanced and wonderful to play on;- if maps aren't balanced, the devs usually rebalance them in updates.THE DEVS:- These guys give a ♥♥♥♥;- they release regular updates to address issues, rebalancing or just provide us more free content (at this point I would pay for more content, because I love them).GREAT COMMUNITY:- For the most part, love the game and love to play tactically; I usually find myself on servers where the team is communicating effectively;- some really funny people on this game, just down to have a good time;- trolls are dealt with fairly quickly.FREE CONTENT UPDATES:- As alluded to earlier, since buying it during the summer of 2014, I've lost count to the amount of FREE content updates the game has received.CONS:PUSH:- I'm probably alone in this, but I'm rarely excited when playing Push; the objectives don't allow for a wider range of tactical movement and it encourages lazy play from the defenders, while encouraging relentless balls to the wall stupidity from the attackers.UI: - The UI in the vote menus could definitely use a bit of a UX upgrade;- at the moment, you can't have preset loadouts for the classes presented in the game; this would be a nice feature to have.Summary:If you got this far, don't be an idiot... buy this game.

												Long have I waited for a properly made tactical shooter that I could finally enjoy as much as I did Infiltration, Red Orchestra, SMOD Tactical, and Hostile Intent. I can see myself playing this for years to come. The clunkiness that is present in most games of this genre is nowhere to be found. Animations are top notch, and I will add that they are the most important thing for inspiring immersion. The weapon handling is almost perfect. Perfect enough for its flaws to be of little consequence. I can honestly say this game has the potential to outshine every tactical shooter that currently exists.Insurgency's controls are quite simple. You've got the usuals, such as aim (iron sights), lean, prone, and sprint. Then there's the extra features that bolster the gameplay. Focus gives you extra zoom and tightens your aim a bit, but only lasts for one breath. Ducking while sprinting allows you to perform a slide. This maneuver is relatively helpful, boosting your speed briefly and allows you to dodge shots or fall into cover. Reloads can be interrupted through several means, such as double-clicking, sprinting, or jumping. Bolt-charging can be delayed by simply holding fire.There are a range of modes to play, in which, you'll most likely find one you love and stick with it. All modes, versus or coop, are objective-based which includes wide variations on capture points, cache destruction, and a single mode with a VIP. Aside from 'Occupy', the modes don't intrude on the overall experience and take varying amounts of coordiation. Occupy is the black sheep of the bunch because all strategy and tactics are more or less removed in favor of dogpiling onto the objective. Whether this is fun or not is subjective. I say nay because it contradicts the other modes, much less the 'thinking man' philosophy behind the tactical shooter genre. I've played many co-op game modes in various hardcore FPS games and Insurgency's take on it certainly holds its own. If versus is not to your liking, you can easily spend all your time in the two co-op modes, which are more than adaquate. The AI, as in most other FPS games, can have its cheap 'aimbot' moments that rob you of well-deserved success. It has many other flaws such as but not limited to: predictibility, brain-farts, superhuman senses, superhuman reflexes, etc. but the experience is nonetheless rewarding and challenging. I'm hoping for the day the AI recieves much-needed polishing that will really help the co-op modes shine.If you've played any AAA FPS for the past... ever, you'll recognize the all-too-familiar loadout system. You are allowed a certain amount of points to spend and you cannot exceed the maximum carry weight. Each weapon has various 'hard-points' to which you can add one accessory. While it's more flexible than other games that sport a similar system, you're very limited in your choices unless a given server has a higher point minimum, and points can only be obtained by accruement of game rounds.Insurgency's greatest flaws lie in its cheaply designed weapon balance. Many weapons are far too homogeneous with each other for their own good. Others are so far from what they should be and need to be, that you wonder what the devs were thinking or why they even bothered. The M249, for instance, has the 200 round drums. The implemented disadvantages of this from both a game standpoint and a realistic standpoint are almost non-existent. This is nothing compared to the ridiculously lethal RPG weapons. They're so exagerated they may as well be hand-held nuke launchers from Starship Troopers. What hurts the most is that ballistics are non-existant in firearms. Yes, Insurgency has primitive conical hit-scan. If there's one thing that should be changed, it's this because proper ballistics would add so much to the game, it can't be stressed enough. Even the AI would be improved by consequently leveling out its cheapness at medium and long distances. While the suppression and accuracy systems partially counter-act the exploitation of hit-scan, they also introduce some measure of dice-rolling to firefights, something that absolutely does not belong in a tactical shooter. What a pitty.At the end of the day, the most important thing is that Insurgency achieves what it strove for. To give an immersive and suspenseful experience, deferring realism and authenticity when necessary to easily maintain a competitive and tactical atmosphere.			"

												Honestly, this is one of the best and most fun (realisticly) tatical shooting game/engine I have played...If I had to start this review off anywhere, I would start with the graphics!The graphics in this game aren't at all that good but I would say they are realistic enough to make you feel as though you are acctually fighting in a war! Truthfully, you need a good PC to run this game at high graphics levels! High Graphic = Amazing.Secondly, This game is supposed to feel real and is made for realism. If you are buying this game as a ""Run 'n Gun"" game then I MOST DEFINATLY do not suggest this game for you! This game is aimed for realistic gameplay and makes you feel like you are in war!Thirdly, gameplay in this game is amazing (for me, and most people). If you are being shot at and have already been shot once in the leg, you are probably going to die, if you get spotted and are facing an enemy in close quaters, you need to react fast because it takes only one or two rounds to the body/head to kill someone. This is what makes this game amazing and unbeleivably hard for people (this makes it fun). This makes the gameplay not as hard for snipers as they probably will get the kill in one shot! Overall this is an amazing game and I have only spoken about a few aspects! It really makes you feel like you are at the event in real life and the crazily scary and chilling sounds of the bullet flying your way!I rate this game a 10/10 (Would rate again, lol jk) and this is AMAZING!but PLEASE, on most servers team killing is on (for realism) so do NOT be minge and shoot your mates on purpose xdd!Thanks for reading and I hope you consider trying out this AMAZING game!

												After playing the Source mod for a long time back when it first came out, I lost track of it as I moved to other games. This new release, while in a lot of ways less developed and mature than the mod, is surprisingly good. The old maps and weapons we remembered are gone (Can't wait till they bring back the FAL) but the new maps and weapons are brought together in a pretty slick way. It's a tight, focused tactical shooter, not for the impatient run-and-gun style players. I sometimes end up sitting in a spot for minutes at a time, watching my lane and anxiously hoping that my battle buddy upstairs is still alive and alert, only to have a frag thrown into my face and be obliterated before I even get a chance to see the enemy. For something that should be ragequit-inducing, it's actually more suspenseful and fun than one might expect, as being on the delivering end of that quick single shot that takes down an enemy from your firing position or sneakily fragging them before they react seems appreciably more rewarding, knowing that any second can bring you instant death if you're not totally on point and alert. It's not a realism game per se like the Arma series; as a combat vet I can attest that probably nobody outside tip-of-the-spear SOF units can shoot this well, let alone how bad most of the irregular forces were at actual infantry tactics and basic marksmanship. Taken less as an attempt to recreate realistic modern combat in Iraq or Afghanistan, and just as a unique gaming experience, I really enjoy it, but it does need your full attention, as looking away for a second can result in your seeing that old ""Waiting for Reinforcements"" screen until you get your next chance to get it right. I highly recommend this for anyone that liked the old Rainbow Six/Ghost Recon games from the early 2000s, and anyone looking to get into a shooter that values patience and team communication and runs at a pace different than the current BF3/MW crop of shooters.

												Insurgency is a first person realistic and tactical shooter game set in middle east, the conflict between the security forces which i think its a private military faction and middle east insurgent.First thing first the gameplay of this game is pretty damn good, they give you many weapon, attachment, and equipment option for you to pick. You want to carry an RPG ?? You can ! But because its heavy you can't wear a heavy armor. You need to pick and match your equipment to give the perfect balance for you. The weapon recoil is really realistic and very satisfying, the kick that the weapon give and your mouse movement when you try to control the weapon its just fun factor of its own. All the match objective is like some improvement version of capture the point kind of thing, your objective is either capture A, B, and C point, or hold them. There is no heath system in this game you been shot ? You are dead, you shot someone ? They are dead also. I think 2 bullet in the chest is enough to kill any player. There is no indicator when you killed someone, so you have to make it sure yourself, is the guy that you shot is dead or not.The graphic and the sound this game have is pretty epic also, i never ever play a game that have this kind of epicness into it, when you shoot something, lets just say a wall, there is some white dust come out of that wall when your bullet hit it, so the more you shoot at something the dustier the battlefield become. The sound.. well.. Lets just say it will scare you and your enemy. When the bullet that the enemy shoot hit the object near you, you will hear some loud noise that will make you duck in fear of dying and vice versa. So, you can give your friend some covering fire because when the enemy is been shot at, they will cower in fear too. the sound is that good. Its really hard to explain it, If you try it you will know what i'm talking about.Apart from the pvp, this game have some co-op option too, which is more tactical than the pvp one, the mode Is 8 players vs 25 AI. (Note that this is in hardcore mode) You didn't have any friend indicator what so ever, so if you go behind the enemy line and your friend see you from far away, prepared to be killed. You need to actually announced your position to your friend so they didn't mistakenly shoot you.Well, to conclude my review, this is by far the most realistic and fun first person shooter i have ever played and this is coming from a guy that is already played ArmA 2 and Tom Clancy Rainbow Six: Raven Shield.

												Insurgency is completely as teamwork game and great stunning effect.it's feeling me like a real war and u have better seriously attention to play because 2-3 shots will take ur into R.I.P even u use armor it will take 3-4 shots.Let me tell you two things at this game,First things,my experience at this game learned me to go with team, to trust teammates can do it and i want to tell that u not allowed to go ALONE(crazy idea u want to become pusher and also want MVP? simple, u can dead easily at this game) at enemy territory ,you need your teammates also to push enemy territory and going alone is very risk, u must see every enemies that will come after you and after that u dead or being a hero to go for win.Second things,Gameplay is more like RO2 and i wanna say this Modern era with RO2 Style.Insurgency maps is really big same as Red Orchestra 2, you have to find enemies like Red Orchestra 2 same as find and kill.and i found some interesting at this game which is class and weapon modification this making me really feel ""Oh god,this is awesome a new FPS game at this year....""Absolutely recommended this game,this game very challenging and addict me to play it more at Co-op and Firefight server.I want to say "" Thanks for release at steam! New World Interactive as Successor HL2 Mod of The Year !  :D ""P.S Some WW2 guns added at this game! Co-op is the best one this game! and i love win music at this game like a inspire song			"

												Well, finally I got over 80 hours behind, so I'm ready to reveal my opinion of Insurgency.First of all it's really nice to buy finished product in the era on Early Access. Don't get me wrong, I'm really enjoying some EA (not that EA) and on the other hand Insurgency need a bit more polish, but still.Main question that gamers could ask ""Is it better than CS?"", fair question though, both games made originally for same audience. I tell you that, Insurgency might take same place as CS got 15 years ago. It got that potential. But it can't be wildly popular. No way. It's hard, not like Flashpoint,  but enough to scary ♥♥♥♥ out of casual players who like weapon skins\stickers\hats\etc. Insurgency reveal itself after 40+ hours of gameplay (maybe earlier if you are playing with friendly group), it shows really wide field for the tactic battle. It's all about details, like you could hear radio talk of the enemy who seat right round the corner. Another strong side of the game is ""shooting"", guns feels like they should, and it's truly enjoyable by itself. Developers communicate with the gamers and listen to their needs making updates pretty fast for small company. I played CS since 1.1, I liked Source, I gave a try to GO. It doesn't feel right anymore, maybe it cause of ""casual features"", maybe it's cause of my age, don't know. Anyway Insurgency make me happy with its solid gameplay, I didn't feel it for a long time in multiplayer shooters. So maybe you'd want to try it too?			"

												Two words for Insurgency ""Hell Yeah"".One of the best tactical military online-FPS games i've ever played, within the best coop gameplay you have ever seen. The Bots are totally Hardcore, sometimes a little stupid but most of the time at the beginning you will die. PVP is also awesome because if someone snipers around for example, it's easy to kick this person very fast. No pay to win and nearly perfect balanced so you will have a lot of fun with your friends no matter if you play COOP or PVP together. And they instantly work on this game so you can often enjoy a lot of updates, new maps, awesome hardcore custom maps from the workshop, weapons mods and skins, explosives, a medic function and stuff, but on a high quality level. My personal hero is the ""survive"" mode yeah but you will find your own favorite sooner or later. Go go go Soldier or Insurgent and have a lot of fun			"

												Insurgency is realistic tactical FPS which is pretty much affordable, and at €9.99 you get a game that is worth playing, and you're going to have fun, guaranteed. I've decided to quit CS:GO due to cancerous community, raging and screaming kids, and ofc cheaters (if i had a dollar for every cheater i encountered)..... Anyway, I'm pleasantly surprised with this game, it's community and gameplay. Sure, it has a  small community of 2-3K people, but it's better to have small community with nice people than big community overloaded with cancer. IMO, Battlefield 1, Rainbow Six Siege, and Insurgency are great games with great communities. Weapons are fully customizable, and there's great choice of weapons. You have classes,so you can choose whatever you like, my favorite class is support. Game also has co-op, which makes even more fun with your friends. I also want to say that this is the best multiplayer FPS i ever played, so if you doubt to buy it, do it ! I haven't found anything bad in game or something i don't like, so i definitely recommend it. 10/10			"

												Clearly one of the best games i've ever played in my life. This fantastic realistic FPS is surely not for inpatient CoD/CS:GO kids, it requires much prudence, consideration, teamwork and forethought.No crosshair, no HUD, no hit indicators, no radar, no sh*t. Insurgency is an amazing tactical shooter based on teamwork, patience and skill. The game has many good features, such as an interesting system of weapon kit customization, a well-balanced multiplayer and an attractive coop with many available different playing mods.The delevelopers work hard on the game, update it regularly and give a maximum support to players and fans.Thosands of workshop mods, maps and skins allow you to customize your game as you want it to be.The game community is very huge and active, you can ask and discuss different questions and problems with nice and open people, sometimes even delevelopers participate in discussions.All weapons, mods and features are absolutely free, there's no f*cking ""pay2win"" DLC.To be honest, it takes a while to get into the game, but what did you expect from a realistic shooter?I would also mention that sniping in Insurgency is disastrously hard at the beginning, as a pretty experienced marksman I had to learn some new things and tactics from Insurgency.It's hard to mention everything but I tried my best, hope you liked this review and it helped you to make a right decision.10/10.

												Really fun game at times. Can be a bit hard, but it is supposed to be harder then Battlefield or Call of Duty. It is after all supposed to be realistic. Good to know before you buy the game is that you have no crosshair, you can only take between 1 to 2 shoots before you go down. And it is very hard to master. You will die over and over and over again (But dont give up, took me 8,5 hours before I actually got some kills before I died). It is pretty hard to kill people too, I like to play on the map called Panj, and when I play Panj I use Sniper or Sharpshooter class. Summery:If you think Call of Duty or Battlefield are too hard to play, then dont buy this game becouse its just harder. But if you want something a bit more realistic and harder, then this is probelby the best FPS you can find. If not this game is your type but you still want something harder then BF or COD then I would say you should buy arma, but this game have much more action then Arma, Arma can be pretty boring at times...I hope you found this helpful, if you did could you please upvote it :D.

												I would rate this game 10/10 if I could. The fact that there are no health bars and there are also night maps makes this game one of the most intense games I have ever played. You have no health so you better be fast at reacting, too. The best part is the guns in my opinion. You can create several combinations to make your gun the best for you, whether you want a flashlight or a laser sight is all up to you, just be creative. Anyway, the only advice I suggest that you do is go to solo and do the training and the most important, have fun. (Do not rage if you die, you will die a lot in this game)P.S did I mention there are VAC secured servers to reduce hacking? I found one yesterday and really enjoyed it.			"

												The perfect mix of tactical, realistic FPS gameplay without bringing game pace to a crawl. Teamwork is essential for success in this game. There is next to no HUD; no map, ammo count, killfeed(depending on the server), health indicator, etc. All you are given is the objectives, time, and your magazine count shows up when you reload. Weapons sounds are some of the best that I have heard in a video game, and the guns take skill to control. If you go into this game running and gunning trying to spray everyone down, you're gonna have a bad time. This game is a must have for anyone who enjoys urban, realistic, tactical gameplay.The competitive community is fantastic. Most people are more than willing to help out newer players and teams get on their feet if they are interested in the competitive side and it feels like a real community instead of a bunch of teams trying to beat eachother. Everyone is always looking to scrim, get a pick-up game going or just chill in a pub. This game needs to be in your library if you enjoy FPS.			"

												The game for me is the best online-only multiplayer shooter I've ever played IMHO. Rebels and government troops fight each other on the 20 maps which mostly focus on urban warfare. The realism is somewhere between Counter-Strike and Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad: there are no cross-hairs, no ammo counters and players usually die after one or two hits.The game will really test your reaction time, tactical skills and your nerves. I have rarely cursed at a multi-player shooter before but this game did. However, a shot and a kill was really more satisfying in this game. The objectives mostly is about conquering/defending locations or destroying weapon caches, but there is also a Capture the Flag and VIP escorts. The best part is that there is a co-op mode in which players solve the usual objectives against bots who are smart or dumb as hell depending on diffuculty setting.I've been playing the game for over two weeks now and find it just great!  There are only limited upgrades for weapons during the game. Rambo actions on the battlefield will definitely get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked even by the dumbest bots.  The best thing, however, is the community as a whole. You can see that here maybe coz I believe players are mostly adults, based on their actuations during the game.  No one squats behind the screen and snipes all day long or does nothing to help the team.  Almost everyone are generally very respectfully and knows the objectives. No constant insults in chat like in BF4 or Call of Duty. Great game overall, Insurgency leaves a good impression and I really recommend it.			"

												I've never played any game for more than 30 hours. My average is maybe 12 hours for a game. I'm on 800+ and still going strong – no intent to stop! This is a fantastic atmospheric game that puts you in the shoes of mercinaries and insurgents. Getting shot at is scary, going out of cover is sweat inducing and managing to pull your pistol out to kill that one dude is exciting as hell. Teamwork is key – especially with the 'hardcore' mechanics – but not an absolute necessity (it will help you win, that's for sure). As a bonus, there is a (small) competitive scene!If that doesn't take your fancy, why not play with teammates to clear out objectives one after the other of AI-controlled ennemies? Hell, if you feel like pwning some other players, why not give a shot at the many gamemodes available? At this price point, there is no way you can regret it. See ya on the battlefield!			"

												The game has superb gunplay, the action is often rather brutal with engagements being swift. Co-op is also rather fun and has gone from being a tacked on extra to a valid game mode in it's own right. It is also worth noting that the devs are working hard on improving the game and ironing out any creases, the game has changed massively from the pre-release build and development seems to be continuing after release and heading in the right direction.

												Game Play: Insurgency offers top of the line virtual combat experience.  Not many games can match the intensity of a fire-fight than Insurgency.  In many ways I find myself intimidated by the game and often curse out loud or jump when I receive fire.  There are however some issues that I find annoying, for one some of the map assets have bad collision and you end up shooting invisible walls (the rocks on peak in particular).  Another issue is the unneeded wait times between rounds, beginning and end of levels, etc (however this has greatly improved recently).  Overall the game play is one of the most intense experiences I've had in gaming, one of the most challenging, and one of the most unforgiving.  I love it.Sound/Music: The weapon sounds are top notch and only add to the experience.  The sound of receiving fire is the most realistic I've ever heard (over Arma, Battlefield, Darkest Hour, and other authentic seeking games).  One thing I feel most games fail to achieve is creating weapon sound effects that produce a feeling that the gun is appropriately powerful-scary, Insurgency does not fail in this regard.  Suppressors work like a charm and sadly most people use them, I'd advise the developers to increase the supply cost of them.Controls: In early access I found the controls annoying and had to rebind them I also suffered from mouse sensitivity problems.  There were inconsistencies and I even noticed certain weapon actions were changing my mouse sensitivity.  I haven't had a problem since the game released.  I never use default controls in a game, so I'm used to rebinding them.  My current controls are perfect for me.Graphics: Surprisingly I have to say graphics in Insurgency are amazing.  Something about the game's level design allows for much more detail and atmospheric effects than other games on the engine.  Personally I'm very immersed in the game and find the levels in Insurgency very realistically portrayed.  I can't imagine the graphics getting any better on this engine.Value: Currently at $15 it's not much a risk.  Really, Insurgency has been a steal from Early Access.  An authentic gamers' must buy! Even if only to support the developers and their future.Coop Game Play:Initially the coop was laughable and I felt it posed little chance of future success.  However Coop has come a long way and though it does get dull after a bit, it is a great way to practice and hone in skills and knowledge of the game. Conclusion:Highly intense, unforgiving, and immersive.  Insurgency offers what most games don't, an authentic realism shooter that doesn't heed to idiots or lack of skill.  Insurgency leaves itself open, open to teamwork, tactics, (virtual) combat effectiveness, and does so with rigorous intentions.  And thus it has my utmost respect.			"

												With triple A shooter’s such as Call of Duty and the Battlefield series being considered the standard for an fps in the genre, Insurgency eloquently bust’s out of the mold. Insurgency takes the typical war zone and adds intensity you rarely see in other titles. Firefights are brief and terrifying and give you a thrill you are unlikely to find anywhere else.Insurgency is a military shooter that aims to be more on the realistic side of the genre. It creates a more tactical and tense gameplay experience, which might be a draw back for some people. Players will have a low damage threshold, sprinting for extended periods of time will hurt your aim unless you are given a chance to recover.Insurgency uses a somewhat standard load out system in where you pick your specialty and gear at the start of every match. With an assortment of classes that have unique guns and gadgets, there is sure to be one that fits your play style. You are given a set amount of supply points and each piece of gear costs a price. A standard M9 pistol will run you one point where as a full auto M4A1 carbine will cost you a bit more at three points.With two factions facing off it opens the game up to a nice bit of variety on each side. The security soldier’s will have reduced prices to body armor and ammo where the insurgents will have access to Molotov cocktails. The obvious difference will also be in the gun selection with AK’s and other lower tech guns on the insurgent side. While the security forces sport a burst or semi M16 and other higher end guns you would suspect.Now that you have gotten through your team selection, picked a class and loaded up on gear it’s time to really dig in. With objectives being the focal point in every match, it is important to work with your team and not run off hungry for kills. Completing and objective will yield one hundred points where a kill will only grant you ten points. There are decent amount of objective varieties, ranging from capturing points to detonating an enemy’s supply cache or even both of those examples in the same match. Each match typically starts with people rushing for choke points/hot spots or flank routes. After the first blood has been drawn groups tend to start working toward objectives. The game will either won by the last man standing or whichever team has taken the objectives. When it only takes one or two bullets to end someone people tend to take things a little slow, luckily if an objective is capped when you are dead you will respawn with the rest of the team in a reinforcement waveInsurgency all in all is a well-rounded game that brings rock solid versus multiplayer, a functional co-op game mode and tons of fun to the fps genre. Whether its heart pounding gun fights or just admiring the little things like gun smoke off of your barrel, Insurgency most likely has what you are looking for. If you finished reading all of that, I apologize if it is poorly writen, still working on my writing. Hope this helped someone purchase this amazing game.			"

												Pure and Simple not much gimmick just straight up gun on gun. This doesn't try to hard to be the best shooters yet is succeds in it's simplicity. You have a few weapons for each class and few gadegets so not much there, almost any weapon kills one to two shot in the upper body so mistakes are paid for dearly. The maps are pretty large bigger than your average cod map and some are close to them , it also supports more players I believe 24. The weapons have heavy recoil so single fire is adviced or controlled burst is a must. The game focuses on objective gameplay and teamwork pays off comminication helps tons. My only gripe is with the rpg launcher it just feels cheap and overpowered other than that the game is fun and very intense since hardcore mode is always on, no hipfie crossjhair no health bar so no crutches. This is an awesome game although it will not fit the bill for all, think Arma meets COD in a way but closer to the first! this is a must play for any fps fan.			"

												Stays true to 'Modern Infantry Combat' while improving on ALOT of things. SMGs, more DMRs, and a launcher for the Marines has been added, as well as options to customize your weapon to adapt to the current envionment. The attachments are all pretty cool and varied, without being so plentiful as to be overwhelming and redundant. Different ammo types have been added as well like AP rounds which allow you to more effectively cut through cover in order to hit targets hiding behind it, or hollow point rounds which can tear your target to shreds, drastically reducing your time to kill (essential in a game like Insurgency). If you've ever played a modern military shooter, I'm sure I'm not telling you anything new so I'll move on to why you should buy this game.GAMEPLAY:This game is like my ex-girlfriend; cold, brutal, and unforgiving. The weapons have ACTUAL recoil, and getting shot once in the chest with most weapons is enough to make you dead over-easy. A well placed machine gunner can decimate a whole team, getting shot behind cover is a common occurence, centering your sights on someone takes about half a second (more than enough time for you to get blasted), when you fire an unsilenced weapon EVERY ONE and their grand mother knows where to find you, and the people you're playing against will more than likely have been playing for close to a decade (seeing as how they're vets of the original mod) and will perpetually butt **** even experinced FPS players until they get it together enough to the point that they realize this isn't COD, BF, or CS. You will die A LOT. Went through a door first? Dead? Didn't stick with your team mates? Dead. Some one texted you, and you looked away for juuussst a second? Dead. And when you die, you don't just sit at a respawn screen for a few seconds and get back into the fight. You must shamefully sit there and wait until your team mates capture the next objective. Making the shame of dying pointlessly/stupidly that much worse because your team is really depending on YOU to win. AUDIO:This game sounds better than anything I've played in a long time. The ambient sound is oddly calming and serene, making it that much more jarring when the staccato of gun fire thunders all around you or the audible *WUMP-BANG* of an RPG explodes and murders your whole squad. I love playing in the mountains and camping just to hear all the different sounds going on around me (Sorry to the people I played with), or even in the city where it honestly SOUNDS like a city. Headphones are definitely recommended to enjoy this game to it's fullest.VISAULSNot the best looking game in the world, but still very pretty; especially when the settings are cranked to max. Is this the next Call of Crysis Modern Battlefield Ghosts 3 in terms of graphical fidelity? No, but it definitely holds it's own, especially when you consider this was made by a relatively small team with an even smaller budget.MAPSVaried in size, uniform in the acute attention to detail that has been payed to them so that players can have the best experience. I have a few maps that I love, more that I like, and none that I hate. Each time there's a vote for a new map, you really can't go wrong by just picking something random and going with the flow.CONCLUSIONThis game is fun and made by and indie developer to boot. The gameplay is crisp, fast, and addicting, while still maintaining it's originality and loyalty to it's fan base.The devs are STILL adding new content to the game and tweaking, so while it still has some ways to go, I can't reccomend this enough. Plus, at the time of me writing this (1/27/14) it's on SALE. If you're an INS fan; buy it. If you're a modern military shooter fan; buy it twice. Once so you can play it, and then the second time so that after you smash your computer, delete your Steam account, and swear off FPSs for the rest of your life because of getting hurt so many times, you come crawling back with your tail in between your legs and beg for more. See? Told you the game was like my ex-girl friend.9/10			"

												This game is definitely worth missing a few job interviews. It might just distract you enough that you'll forget the hunger and pain.It had a few crashing issues some weeks ago, but that really doesn't happen anymore to me--can't say if it's fixed in general--therefore, once again I am able to spend shameless amounts of time playing it and spending the rest of my money with redbull and energy bills.I need help.On a serious note, this game is lacking some basic things that every shooter already got straight, for instance: a crosshair, minimap, a HUD indicating how many bullets you have left, double jumps, kill cam, a generic campaign, racist 13 year olds, and being downright a worse game than it is right now, so I can complain about it.No, but seriously, did they simplify the co-op maps lately? #ThanksObamaGet this game, you won't regret it.

												Insurgency -- A source mod turned stand-alone game developed by New World Interactive.I'll start up front by saying that I never played this while it was just a mod, I've only placed since it's stand-alone release.If you're looking for a good game to play co-op with friends, or a competitive multiplayer fps look no further -- However, if you're looking for the Call of Duty style run-and-gun, halo jumping ""arcade"" style action this may not be for you.It is, as defined by it's user tags on steam, a more tactical and realistic style of FPS -- for example, a shot to centre mass of your enemy will mostly likely result in a kill with any high caliber weapon, and 1-2 shots in centre mass with any other low caliber weapon is also a kill. There is no dumping 9 rounds into someone and hoping they're dead.However, at the same time, it's not realistic to the point of having bullet drop.. the ballistics are nice and there are quite a few sound mods that increase the immersiveness as well as re-textures for weapons available from the Steam Workshop. It's also fair to say that there is a plethura of custom maps for both co-op and multiplayer game modes.TL:DR -- A great co-op game for playing with a few mates, decent ballistics, immersive sounds.. A great game for players who enjoy tactical gameplay more then arcade style'd games. "

												Do you like BF Series? If yes buy it.Insurgency is a medium paced first person shooter which injects a sense of realism into the game. No crosshair, HUD is limited, Decent grenade physics( COD: ACROSS THE MAP KIL 420 BLAZE IT), realistic movement and gun physics makes the game as realistic as possible. Communicating with your team is vital to this game, no ♥♥♥♥ing call of duty run and gun♥♥♥♥♥♥but Carefully looking around corners using the lean function or sliding in while your teammates provide overwatch. All guns are balanced, such as sniper rifles may be a one hit kill, but the sway and fire rate is hard to master.			"

												First game in  a long time that I really enjoy.I often find myself not having fun in games like BF1, Siege etc (Triple A multiplayer shooters)however, I feel I fit right at home playing Insurgency. I can take my time, I can camp and strategy pays off while playing this game.It's realistic meaning you cant rush-spray and pray for insta-win, you need to take time developing your strategic positioning on map, you need to know bottlenecks and areas / passages of high importance for the game's objectives (and camp there ;) ) and there is minimal HUD (no crosshairs, remaining bullets left in clip, sometimes no kill feed so you dont know if you just made a kill or if he's still out to get you). You can also play night maps where you rely on nightvision, however, in bright spots of the map nightvision works to your detriment. The guns also feel good. When ADS all guns sway, people die in a few shots depending on the gun compared to other games where it takes a whole clip to kill someone, which adds to the realism, and each gun is highly customizable in terms of attachments depending on what you want to do each game. You can also choose how much armor you want to wear, how many grenades; which types of grenades; etc.It's not an expensive game and it's given be far more entertainment than what $10 would have gotten me in any other multiplayer FPS game.

												First person shooter. Hardcore. Tactical. The only ways to make this game better isn't in the gameplay. If you play Battlefield, Modern Warfare and Counterstrike, but want a more realistic feel and more tactical shooter and isn't about runnin' and gunnin', then this game is for you. Highly recommended for hardcore players and not noobs who scream out ""Campers!"". Trust me: there's a helluva lot of camping here.			"

												This is an amazing game. I'm nearly at 400 hours so I've decided it's time for me to review this work of art.When you start, you will be very, very♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. It will be frustrating and it will seem like you died for no reason. But the only reason you died is because you exposed yourself. 1 bullet is more than enough to kill. So be careful, and treat it like your own life. Start out in more public games, once you hit 30 of 50 hours, you get a good idea of the maps and you can move on to competence 5v5. That's when♥♥♥♥♥♥gets real. There are tons of teams and if you are decent at the game the community is very nice. Even if you think you know what you're doing remember that there is always, ALWAYS, something more to learn. After 370+hours I still don't know all of the little spider holes that some sneaky guy with a mosin could be hiding. If you have friends who are willing to play with you, coop is amazing. I e gotten 8 guys to go with me and it never gets old. There are tons of updates that introduce new maps and weapons or ANYTHING. There are full conversions for the game, like a Vietnam one is coming out soon. So it's like you're buying 5 games instead of one.BUY IT. It's only 15 damn dollars you foking cheapskate. Drop your silly battlefield and counter strike and play like a real man. Who needs health bars and ammo counters and no friendly fire. GET THE DAMN GAME. Also, one quick note, there seems to be a small amount of idiots who think that bullets drop like rocks. This is NOT TRUE. A real bullet does not start to drop untill around 400 meters, and even then it's drops very slowly.			"

												Insurgency is the number one tactical FPS that is avaiable to both those looking to play serious games (like ARMA) and to those looking to just run around and have fun (say, Battlefield-ish). Obviously the game strikes a rather big middle ground. The game takes itself serious - and that is a good thing - and has gritty realism that is not suited for everyone. If you get shot once, you will die in most cases. At the same time the game does not make you feel like you _lost_ even when you die. It's satisfying to watch your teammates play in most of the game modes (I suggest Ambush! I love the gamemode, even when I'm dead. I can enjoy myself, laughing at my teammates and the VIP with other dead teammates.)Dying feels more like 'oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ I made a mistake' rather than '♥♥♥♥ING HAX! I AM GONNA REPORT YOU!' which is rare in most competitive FPS games. The game runs well, even on my laptop, and I'm sure it's better for those with desktops. The large amount of mods available make the game fun to play, and the guns can be turned into pretty much anything. Also there's anime girls available for those that want it. It changes the graffiti around the maps to anime girls.On to the bad sides: The game still frequently deals with hackers. It's not every match, it's not even once every week, but there's definitely a lot of hacks and they don't seem to get banned. Either that or the detection system is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Mostly it'll rely on the enemy team realizing, and kicking, but more often than not you have to complain for multiple games in a row before they do that. The game can be frustrating at times. The inventory system is a bit unclear at times but easy enough to understand, but besides that frustration, I also frequently struggle with boredom after 1-2 rounds if I am not playing a high action, fast paced game. For some of the longer modes, the maps feel too big. The map variety is also decent, but should be bigger. You can play some of the maps once before you know all the spots, and some of the maps you can play 10x and not know all the spots. Sadly for some maps it's impossible to know all spots because the game, like Battlefield, forces you to stay in a certain area. I would understand if it was just around the enemy spawn, but it often is like half the map.However I definitely encourage you to buy this game. It's great!			"

												What the game successfully combines is the tension of real death CQC like the Swat series with the firefight intensity of any modern online shooter.John Wayne Cowboy tactics are death.Team communication and RWT are key.When the chips of wall are flaking away and the pings are dangerously close, your heartrate WILL increase. Then when you realize it's you yelling like a 4th grader, a smile takes over.Total noob as I just got the game, played coop for an hour and had a blast.Well worth it.			"

You are put with a team of between six to eight players to complete a list of objectives.The bots are not the smartest but they can still be quite a challenge most of the time.If you like realism in your shooters this is probably something for you.

												This is about the best balance of action-packed and strategic focused FPS that I am aware of. It doesn't have the large maps and sometimes tedious realism of ARMA and it doesn't have the millions of unlocks, attachments, vehicles and run-and-gun madness of Battlefield. It is simple, the gameplay isn't perfect, nor is it flashy and it's maps are not big - but it rewards teamwork, good communication and thoughtful play whilst remaining fast paced and full of excitement. The guns feel solid when you fire them and they are deadly when used effectively (any gun can one shot kill). You have limited kit, hud, no killfeed and limited ammo and therefore it takes time to get to grips with the game - and that is the beauty of it. Each decision you make is more important with these limitations and you have to use your head to stay alive.The community is not quite as vibrant as with the original Insurgency, with less people in total and a lack of competitive play, but it's still good for some exciting games here and there. The game modes lack the tension of the original mod (they are designed to be more fast paced and have shorter game times) and the maps feel less well thought out - but maybe that is just nostalgia. I really liked grinding up the hill at Karkar.Worth a try if you haven't already. "

												The map was Revolt, the mode was Firefight, all of my fellow Mujahideen were dead. It was up to me alone to capture an objective in order for them to respawn, so I make it to alpha. The area is full of crates, stacks of bricks and stacks of wood, but soon my Jihad senses are tingling... there is an infidel or two nearby! Armed with my MP40 with suppressor attachment, I stalk my prey, sneaking behind objects, checking my corners... until I see the infidel, but he doesn't see me. Allah has blessed me with the element of surprise, so I quickly fire my suppressed MP40, RAT TAT TAT TAT TAT!! The infidel is dead, but I haven't captured the objective yet, so there's another infidel nearby. I continue to stalk my prey... I find the other infidel, but this one sees me too... but Allah has blessed me with a quick trigger finger and I fire first, RAT TAT TAT TAT TAT!! Then I capture the objective and all my fellow Mujahideen respawn, each of their 72 virgins in heaven will have to wait.This is a most excellent FPS, probably the best multiplayer FPS I've ever played and definitely worth the money, especially considering that they add new maps, modes and weapons to the game free of charge (no microtransactions or costly DLC). The game is realistic, yet can still be fast paced. You can run and gun if you want, but nine times out of ten that will just get you killed. The sound effects, gun recoil, and damage are realistic and there's no hip fire crosshairs, so you almost always have to aim down sights to be accurate (unless you're barrel stuffing them). The only complaint I have would the be the extremely annoying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that like to team kill just to be trolls, but things like that happen with just about every other multiplayer game and they can always be vote kicked from the game.

												This is one of the best games I have ever played! I got this game on sale for 2.50$, it's normal price is 17$, but I would have gladly payed 50$ for it. This is a fairly long review, however I've tryed to cover all major aspects of the game, please tell me in the comments if I left something out.Despite being early access there are little to no glitches and those that are present in the game are not gamebreaking. The online community is really cool, I haven't met many toxic players at all, people are willing to communicate and use teamwork to capture objectives or to advance. Teamwork, communication and strategy play a big part in this game compared to games like CoD, where everyone kind of goes to do their own thing instead of sticking together and working as a team. The graphics really aren't that bad and you won't need a 2000$ PC to run it, compared to triple A games like Battlefield and CoD.There is a cool ""squad member"" selection when picking your loadout. Example: If you choose the Support class, you will have access to big LMG's, if you pick the sniper / designated marksman class, you will have access to high power scopes, silencers and long range guns. This way, each player has a role in their team. The weight system is a great feature aswell. Equiping items like heavy armor, rocket launchers, large weapons and grenades will add more weight to you, making you move slower and get exhausted quicker. So players can choose light armor (or no armor) and light guns (or no guns) and rush objectives, or heavy armor and a big LMG to gun down an entire team with.There's also a cool ""radial menu"" where you can say several callouts if you don't own a mic. Callouts can range from requesting backup, to notifying your team of the enemy's location. The Squad Leader also has his own set of callouts that he can use to; tell the team to flank a certain direction, monitor a certain area or move to a specific location / objective.The HUD is very limited, showing literally nothing but your gun. No crosshair, no health bar, no ammo counter, no minimap, no killfeed. The only ""ammo counter"" you have shows you how many mags you have left. If you reload and your magazine still has bullets in it, it goes back to you. Therefore if you tend to reload often, you'll find yourself loading in magazines that are only half full. There IS a map that you can look at by pressing a specific key but no ""minimap"" like we have in CoD. When you get shot or hurt, the peripheral area of your vision will get blurry, that's the only way to tell when you are hit. Again refering to CoD as an example, your peripheral vision gets blurred, not your whole screen and it isn't covered in blood.If everything I've said up to now hasn't convinced you yet, here are a few smaller points that I liked about this game:- You can blind people w/ flashlights and laser attachments.- Every map has a night version of it where it gets dark...really dark. Also, NightVision Goggles :D- When you kill an enemy (or your friend gets murdered right infront of you) you can not only pickup his gun, but also any grenades that he was carrying with him.- C4, IED's (The Insurgent equivalent of C4) and rocket launchers have huge blast radius's and can even kill people who are hiding behind stuff.- Frag grenades, smoke grenades and flash grenades are actually useful. Frags have a pretty large explosion radius, flashbang's blind players for more than 2 seconds and smoke grenades create large, thick smokescreens that fog up your view if you walk into them.Final comments:At first I thought that I wouldn't like the lack of crosshair, HUD, minimap, etc, but I found it really fun. After playing a game this good I find it hard to return to other FPS games. No amount of words can describe how much fun I've had with this game.Edit: Definitely nominating this for the ""I thought it was cool before it won an award.""			"

It's frightening to get shot at and die in this game, due to the panic inducing moments and astounding particle and sound effects the game has. Speaking of which, the sound design is a highlight, it's absolutely fantastic. The game also has a delightful dichotomy of realism and fun. New World Interactive has done an awesome job. 9.0/10.0 "

But if you like to play team, comunicate and feel like you've acheived something this is just what you been looking for.The damage is brutal here, but remember, it is so for your opponents. If your a quick trigger you feel great when you waste someone!The devs are excelent thy update very often but never released a single payed DLC! Any new update brings a bunch of new things like maps, guns, game modes, UI improvements and bug fixes off course.10/10 period			"

												Excellent game , have heard of this game for quite a while and just got my hands on the game about 2 weeks ago . A solid 10/10 tactical shooter , considering the fact that it is an Indie title , what makes me even love the game more is that this game is built on the Source engine , which let you customize everything in the game , gives me a nostalgic feels from a couple of years ago when i was just a kid whose pc could barely run CS:S , all i did back then was spending 6 hours a day going through Gamebanana to find awesome skins for my game , and Insurgency did it again , i spend about 1 hour a day to go through every single Insurgency skins on the workshop , just like back in the good old days of CS:S			"

												I love it for the fact that the Hunt & Nightfall DLC is free. The devs are constantly improving and upgrading this game without charging extra. The community's brilliant & growing (most of my steam friends are from this game). This is a big middle finger to the AAA devs and even other indie devs who want to milk their existing customers instead of trying to reach out to more people with a dedicated game.			"

												TLDR: Buy this if you like Red Orchestra, Counterstrike, and intense gameplay where you actually care about how loud your footsteps are, you'll love this. Intensity comes from interesting spawn ticket system and high-stakes firefights. Also FAL best gun, objectively.Insurgency started life as a Sourcemod way back in god knows when under the name Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat. It was a time where Red Orchestra was considered pretty new and fresh, and I remember it actually being one of the first games that I ever saw that had weapon deadzoning involved. It was a slow-speed, long-range, lethal shooter that was set in the very real world of Marines fighting Insurgents in the middle east, probably Iraq.Now it's simply called Insurgency, and it's changed a lot. The biggest change is the maps are smaller, making it feel much like the bizarre lovechild of Counter-Strike and Red Orchestra. It's a gifted child. Other changes include that the USMC forces are now simple, unnamed ""Security Forces"" which appear to be Security contractors cooperating with Marines under a different name. The Insurgent forces also now have no real-life name attached to them, opting for a more ""don't offend anybody"" style approach to the game. Does it ruin everything? No. I think it's clever that the game worked like that, particularly how they included Marine uniforms in some classes for the Security side. Speaking of classes, rather than a purer class-based system like in the original Insurgency mod (Let's call it INSMIC from here on out), Insurgency allows for more customization in the way of a point-based accessorizing system. Each class has specific equipment it has access to - Machinegunners are the only ones with access to RPKs and M249s, for instance, but may opt out and use an AKMS or M16A4 respectively at less point-cost - and 10 points to divvy up amongst weapons, optics, accessories, explosives, body armor, and load bearing equipment (which allows your little soldier to carry more magazines, and even grenades). Each individual class has its own model, too, so a Specialist on the Security forces is going to be some T-Shirt wearing, Beard-sporting Chris Costa lookin' summa♥♥♥♥♥ that you'll probably be running pretty light with for high-speed, low-drag operating conditions, while the Machinegunner on the same team will be wearing a full uniform and look more like the average Marine and by default will be wearing the (optional) heavy body armor that makes him slow and strong. Like a turtle. With a 5.56mm automatic rifle capable of sending 2/3 of a pound of lead down range in a minute.My only complaint regarding equipment in the game, though, is that there are no Grenade Launchers and no Grenadier class. The closest you get are the respective RPG7 and AT4 launchers, both only get one rocket, and I've heard this is because some complained that grenade launchers would be overpowered in a primarily CQB-based game like this. That's an addition I'd really like to see made.The sound design is really good. The gunshots might not be Heat-tier, but they're better by far than many, many other games currently on the market. The best part about the sound design, in my opinion, is how they capture the almost muffled, underwater sound of gunshots in the distance and the screaming snaps of a supersonic bullet narrowly missing you. And suppressors do serve a much more realistic purpose in this game. While slightly reducing the noise level of discharing your firearm, it'll make it difficult for enemies in the area to determine whether you're chopping off with an AK like the rest of their Kebab-chomping buddies, or if you're ripping it up with a Mk18 CQBR like a true Hamburger-inhaling imperialist of democracy.The reason you'll care about that, though, is that the game runs on a wave-based respawn system. In many gamemodes, it operates on the basis that everyone gets one life, when you die you spectate, and when an objective is captured all those spectating for that team are sent in on another wave. This makes it possible to either have the enemy team completely wiped out in a mater of minutes, or can stretch a simple king of the hill game into a tug-of-war over reinforcements. Gamemodes I personally care less about involve a more simple system where there's X amount of respawn waves per team, and as those deplete more can be gained by capturing objectives. Other modes simply have no respawns involved. It covers a lot of bases. There's also a co-op gamemode that one would think would be tacked-on, but it's actually pretty fun.Basically if you like something like Rainbow Six, Counter Strike, Red Orchestra, even Arma, I'd suggest checking this out. Also it's cheap as hell oh my god I'd totally pay $30 for this game.			"

												This game is just....wow. Everything is amazingly accurately depicted, from the grenade weight, the audio, the physics, the bullet penetration going through different materials, the suppressing fire system, everything about this game is intense and punishing if you ♥♥♥♥ up for a second while in a firefight. It's times like this in a match where you're scoped in, looking to pick off any enemies, especially opposing snipers or grenadiers. You see an enemy sniper far away, and he sees you too. It's all a matter of who pulls the trigger faster, and you hear an empty dull click from your gun. No more bullets loaded in the chamber? You soon find yourself dead.That's right, there's no ammo counter or anything that indicates how many shots you have left, nor a crosshair or a life bar. The only thing you have on your HUD is how many magazines you have left and a compass w/ a map you can toggle. This game requires good teamwork and communication to win matches, and it's rewarding to blow up the final enemy cache with a brick of C4 when you're the last man standing. Bottom line: if you want a tactical shooter that delivers intense close quarters combat action, with a variety of huge maps as well, get this game, you will not be disappointed. My only gripe is that I wished the developers spent more time optimizing the game, because it only utilizes less than half of my cpu and gpu combined, which can lead to minor fps drops at times.Oh, and get ready for all the ""allahu ackbars"" on the mics.

												A refreshing FPS with some creative game modes, this has replaced battlefield 4 and CS GO (for me), I'll split the review into pros and cons.Positive+Guns have a sense of weight which is missing in alot of FPS.+Hardcore- no killcams, no killfeed (well most servers) and no bloody hitmarkers+Good gamemodes, fun and very intense+There's an offline bot mode +Lots of maps, as well as, night versions +Cheap+You can play fine at pings around 200+Runs nicely (well mostly)+Developers give free dlc and are constantly updating and supporting the game+In game callouts are on point (as you may already know)Negative-Population is not massive, but it's not small either, just could be bigger (but you'll easily find a game)-The offline mode has no proper UI in place in order to change gamemodes and maps (you change it in the console)-Stuttering and Microstuttering plague the game (different for some)-Graphics aren't great, but it's pretty easy to run, on a gtx870m, its maxed out at, 1080p, 2xmssa and fxaa, solid 60fps.-Some weird♥♥♥♥♥3rd person animations (I personally like immersion) not all the time, just when people slide and sometimes when sprinting (as if they are air running- feet are slightly above the ground)8/10- Recommend for anyone who wants to play  a hardcore FPS that's fun with lot's of action and doesn't take realism to the point where combat is as enjoyable as wiping your♥♥♥♥♥with sandpaper, but isn't so hellbent on making you feel like a special snowflake (e.g. COD).

												This game is not for the casual player. Not by a longshot. This is for those who are already familiar with semi-tactical games like Battlefield and want to take a step up, or for those who are tired of camping sims like Arma and want to take a step down. Either way, it's unforgiving, and it's beautiful.In fact, at one point during a co-op match, watching someone else play because I was dead for the umpteenth time, I found myself strangely identifying with one particular corpse. I don't know why this specific dead terrorist resonated with me, but they did. And then I realized the connection: We were both riddled with bullets by two guys simultaneously.10/10 would tapfire merrily to my death again.			"

												Best FPS experience i have ever had. Requires a lot of teamwork, gun fights are really intense, and the graphics are really good!!Realism and more realism,There are no crosshairs!! If you want a realistic firefight experience this is the game.This isnt like other fps games where you can just get back up after you die! Once a player dies in most game modes the only way for them to spawn back is if a set objective is met like capturing a capture point or blowing up a cache. This game favours a tactical approach over mindlessly running around the map killing people. This game is fun with friends so tag along!			"

												A fantastic FPS with heavy leanings on stressing realism. First thing to note, the pace of the game and firefights feel just right. Gun mechanics, hit boxes, ballistics, sounds, and maps have all been polished quite nicely. The level of immersion you will feel while playing the game is incredible, and you will be provided with many tense moments while playing. Whether it's the RPG being fired from a distant spot in the map, or the sound of your comrade screaming as he's being shot at, you'll find yourself doing whatever it takes to stay alive because you'll truely fear for your life. Insurgency doesn't BS you by making you level up guns to unlock attachments. Everyone gets an allocated amount of supply points to modify their loadouts freely, at spawn. Want a optic site? You got one. Want to carry a molotov instead of grenade? You got it. Want heavy armor? Sure. You pick your own loadouts based on your preferences. This adds a tremendous amount of variation in the loadouts that you can create.Overall, this is one of the better realism FPS shooters. The learning curve for new users can be considered steep, but this makes it all the more satisfying when you do finally get the hang of things. Well worth the price.			"

												I think Insurgency is a great game. I like the close quarters combat. I also like the fact that it is objective based, the players are rewarded more for getting objectives than kills. It takes a good team the win, not just people that can get kills. It is more of a hardcore game where you don't have a minimap that shows where the enemy are. You also don't know your health status or your weapons ammo status. The emphasis is not on what rank you are but if you are a team player that communicates well. The game play is intense. Give yourself time to learn the maps. The longer you play the better you will become. It is not a run and gun game, it is tactical. I also like the fact that the system requirements are not to high, the game looks great and it will be able to include more players.			"

												This game is very good and would recommend it to anyone who likes this sort of fps game. Of course there are some bugs which have been encountered by some player (but luckily enough not me, not encountered a single one). I only hope that this game gets a bigger player base and becomes better because of it.The fact that it doesn't have features such as kill cam or radar or crosshairs just makes it all the more fun imo. Having features like kill-cam ruins the games because it makes it much easier to see where you got killed from. The fact that it doesn't have them means it is slightly harder than normal fps's, but when you get used to it it just becomes easier.  I've also heard that this game requires a fair bit of team communication but from what I have experienced on the servers I have played there has been little or no communication between teams. Obviously it would help players on your team if you do have a mic and use it to communicate.All in all I would give this game an 8/10 at this moment in time as it has just been released.Luke :D			"

												This game is not CoD.  It is not Counter Strike, nor is it Battle field; however, this game will have you peeking around corners and begging your friends for cover as you cross the street.I only play the game for the co-op aspect.  I don't play PvP with the exceptions of a few games, so if you are reading this for a review on the PvP multiplayer, I would take this info lightly.The sounds!  Not that I have ever been in a fire fight, but I feel more like I have now than ever before.  The pop from your weapons and the cracking of bullets ricocheting off rocks will have you, the player, ducking in your seat!  The frantic screams for help that the characters shout while under fire can be extremely dis-concerning.I feel that  the bullet physics are lacking in comparison to Battle field, but the guns have excellent recoil, and the dust as well as the blur that arise from fully auto fire is lovely.The AI is decent.  Certainly not the best I've ever seen, but far from the worst.All and all, if you want an intense co-op fps to play with your friends, I highly recommend this game.  There are TONS of dedicated servers, so finding an empty server for you and your peeps is never a problem.  And the game carries a very fare price tag: $15

												Insurgency was originally a mod for Half-life 2 that won the 2007 best mod of the year award and now revived by its original developers first known as Insurgency 2 but then changed to just Insurgency.Insurgency is like a small scale ARMA battle in a given map similar to sizes of maps in Call of Duty Ghosts. There are numerous gamemodes players can engage in. It is a solid shooter with interesting concepts, but it is unfortunate that it lacks a larger playerbase. "

												If anybody ever liked playing CoD or Battlefield multiplayer games on Hardcore mode where the bullet damage is increased and there's no map then this game is for you. At first, I was dying alot and I mean ALOT. Then I started to get the flow of this game. If a player rushes, better know what you're doing because 1-5 shots from any gun then BAM you're dead. Not for the easily frustrated I must say.The matches can be quite intense because the players usually has to depend on their teammates to change the course of the game. There are smoke grenades and bullets flying everywhere so thinking tactical is helpful. Yes there are camping ""chameleon"" snipers like in Battlefield but for the most part they are good at helping out the team. Cant say much about about the co-op. Best advise I can give for noobs is take your time, kill when needed, and play the funking objective (ptfo). Allahu Akbar!!!!!			"

												After over 800 hours and almost a year of play time, I figure it is time to write a review.I'll keep it short - Even if it is not on sale, it is worth your time.Pros--Competitive scene is growing and inviting (by this I mean that everyone (for the most part) is friendly).  There are several big comp scenes for players, being the ESL (Euro) and DGL (NA), but as far as pick up games go, both are open no matter where you call home, if you don't mind dealing with ping around 150-200.-I've heard it is pretty realistic.  I have personally never been shot at, but playing Insurgency makes me not want to be shot at.-Tactical, yet fast paced.  While you have the option to play slow and wait for an enemy to run into you, you don't need to, as a majority of people will play fast or switch up their speed of play.  There are many game modes that cater to the individual's play style.-Difference in modes.  Want to die and respawn a lot? Play push.  Want to still die but not as much? Play skirmish.  Want to be the last guy up, realizing that your teammates are talking crap about you (and calling you ugly) in the chat you cannot hear while they are dead and you are not?  Then play firefight, elimination, or ambush.-Lack of Clutter.  Insurgency, by default, has no HUD, no kill indicators, no ammo counts, etc.  It is about as bare bones as it gets.   You have the option of bringing up a small compass now, but it will do you no good when you are getting shot at.  You also need to learn to count bullets, as mags are independant from one another, meaning no bullet cross over.  If you take a couple shots with each mag, then reload, and do that 4 times, you are going to find yourself with half empty bullet holders.-Great dev support.  The devs are always tweaking things, updating maps, guns, etc.  The game feels different from when I started.Cons--The (making a generalization here, no hate please) community can be a bit childish.  If I had a dollar for every ""Allahu Akbar"" I have heard, I wouldn't be writing reviews, I'd be on a beach with beautiful women.  Granted, its funny the first few times, but the next 1000, it gets old (Positive here - MUTE BUTTON!!!).Overall - BUY BUY BUY, and join the comp scene to have some real fun.			"

YouTube™ Video: A Talk on Insurgency - Tactical FPS 

			Views: 144		

			My thoughts and insights on Insurgency, a title released earlier this year which provides a real challenge for a coordinated teamplay that proves to be a welcoming change in the current FPS market.		

I've never been into FPS games. Can't really say why, I guess because they were too fast paced, too hectic and based on individual achievements rather than anything else. So I was quite surprised to find myself saying ""I think I want to try this"" after watching one of many presentational videos about Insurgency. Since then, almost two months later, I can easily say that Insurgency is a great game. Not a perfect one, as just like anything else it has its flaws and such, but I'm not here to capitalise on that. Instead, I would like to underline the main component that makes this game very enjoyable and rewarding - teamplay. Because the whole game, no matter what mode you're playing, is built around objectives; you can have an incredible K/D ratio, going through the enemy team as a hot knife through butter, but if you do not coordinate with your team and work towards the same goal it will most likely be futile. You do not have to rush it, in fact it would be advisible to take it slowly, cover your teammates, provide covering fire and work as a unit while moving towards the target. And even if you don't get a single kill but instead create a distraction at the other end of the map, distracting opposing players and thus creating an opening for your teammates to capture an objective it is incredibly rewarding. Personally, I will choose this over a great individual performance any day.			"

												Great FPS, like how the small group of developers are dedicated to this project. This FPS takes ""teamwork"" and ""communication"", with out it, you probably won't live long. Being the last man standing in ""PUSH"" gamemode, and capturing the objective, so you team mates can respawn is very rewarding.			"

												The single most dedicated, consistently quality-producing and generous indie dev team I've ever witnessed.These guys actually play their game and do nothing but *improve* the game with fixes and content.If you've ever played the original Insurgency mod, which was provided free of charge, you will appreciate this game. Considering that there was much to be expected, coming from the original, this reboot is more of a rebirth - improving greatly upon the beloved original. If you've not already picked this game up by now, they offer insane discounts on sales via Steam and elsewhere. Where greed seems to be the general motive for most game developers, these guys just keep on giving and giving, reinvesting their revenues back into the game to continually add value to existing customers.One of the best FPS shooters you will ever play, hands down, Insurgency brings something to the table that many well-polished and well-funded AAA titles do not.

												This is an amazing addition to the first person shooter genre. After 650+ hours of playing this game I still have a lot to learn and have never gotten bored playing it. The community for this game is small and friendly. An everyone knows everyone world which isn't hard to join. People are very welcoming and willing to help you out with things you don't know. But, most importantly the gameplay is amazing: accurate shooting with low health can lead to tense firefights where everytime you pop out you know you can die. Playing mods like Ambush and Firefight (my favourites) dying is highly punished, as it should be, and due to the lack of crosshairs when not aiming, slow movment and low health running and gunning is punished and all your moves are steady and deliberate. The lack of spotting leads to a focus on teamwork, so having a microphone helps (but please don't shout ""allah akbar"" all the time). For fans of the FPS genre or people new to it I would highly reccomend this game for the standard price of £11, so long as you aren't expecting a game like counter stike or call of duty			"

												You will think that you don't know how to play shooting games when you start playing this game. The game is totally concentrated on realism so a single bullet can kill you or if you are wearing a heavy armor then max 3 bullets. There is no health percentage. Also the recoil while shooting is a lot. So I'm sure you will LOVE this game after like 5 hours of gameplay. For me this game beats COD in all sections!!			"

Simply put: this is the game that EA and DICE tried to make but instead created a flaming pile of horse♥♥♥♥♥♥ Insurgency is the delicious air freshener to cover up the aroma of mistake and disappointment that EA and DICE have created.This game is literally a Source Engine Battlefield that actually works as a game. Plenty of maps and gamemodes but a map, minimap or health indicator are nowhere to be seen - in fact, the only HUD elements in this game include the CTF-type objectives (just one of many game modes), squad members and a mag count,  that is all . It encourages you to guess where the enemy is and to keep up to date with teammates on the whereabouts of said enemies.There are a decent amount of weapons to choose from. Instead of getting a weapon for each slot (primary, secondary, explosive etc.), you get equipment tokens (not sure if thats what they are called). They do not cost anything but are reduced everytime you equip a weapon, explosive or attatchment (some equipments are worth more than others, for example, a laser sight uses 4 tokens where as a red dot sight uses 1). If you remove an attatchment, for example, then you get your tokens back.This system is such an effective and streamlined mechanism which, at first, I thought would be a mediocre and half-arsed twist to another FPS title.To conclude, this game is the greatest alternative to EA's latest installments of Battlefield. Especially since this game isn't £50 and can go as low as £2! It nurtures a community that is not so salty, a rarity in the FPS genre. Just grab it or go and lick the♥♥♥♥♥♥stain that has been left behind.			"

												I've played a lot of games in my time, most first person shooters.Sometimes I like them funny (borderlands) sometimes I like them cartoonie (Team Fortress 2) but Insurgency fill the ""realistic"" gap.Based basically in the middle east conflicts this is absolutely the closest thing I'll ever get to real combat. (I'm not in the armed forces for the same reason I don't play hockey: that ice is so slippery! (In other words, the nature of war is death and I'm...not up for that.) The realism is great, it's also not overwealmed with 500000000 guns that don't exist. It's realistic in both the gameplay and the types of guns that are available.The amazing thing is that the content is far extended by the players community where you can for free, download new maps and customized guns. If you've only ever played the original maps, you NEED to play the user created ones as you haven't even scratched the surface without playing them!If you want a game that will start by frustrating you but then quickly turn around and help you become a better player/shooter, get it!

												An excellent game overall.Graphics are overall lackluster, but far from unenjoyable. You can also download user-made skins.SOUND. MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING SOUND. I'm a Marine Veteran, and I cannot put into words the feeling I had when I fired a M203 HE round, and heard what is only describable as a perfect recreation of the ""pfthoomp"" sound they make exiting the barrel. The sound in this game alone makes it stand out, for me at least. Not to mention hilarious and badass voice acting. Gameplay is a fresh take on FPS, with realistic damage models. A bullet to the head? You're dead. No matter the weapon. Two to the chest will drop almost any target, unless they have heavy armor (I think.) Very minimal HUD, No crosshairs, Co-op online that you actually enjoy playing. Decently balanced PvP, this game has everything I've dreamed of in a mil-sim/older COD-esque hybrid shooter. Community is by far one of the best I've found. Very helpful, little/no ragers or trolls. Overall: 9/10, only held back by current low volume of skins, and outdated graphics.			"

												Insurgency is a pretty sharp looking Multiplayer, Team-Based Tactical Shooter. Playing it felt very similar to Black Ops, it was challenging and the queue times were fairly quick. It felt like a lot of other tactical shooters, except a little better looking than most out there I have played. Not usually my type of game, as I prefer to solo play, but as far as Tactical Shooters go it was fun. Fairly realistic and it looks like they are actively working to fix exploits and bugs, so at least you know the Dev's care about the game. If you like Tactical Shooters, give this one a try.			"

												I am a veteran Battlefield player on console, and the casualization of the battlefield franchise pushed me into the more hardcore and tactical shooters of PC. Coming to PC with this as the first game I sucked, really bad. I would go 0/10 in games.After putting hours into the game and getting used to the tactical feel of the game, I've gotten better and it's now one of my favorite games to play. It has that close quarters gameplay without getting wrecked by shotguns like you do in every other FPS. One thing that you have to watch out for though when playing this game is people shouting at the end of the matches, so keep the voice volume down a bit, trust me I'm saving your ears.

												I love this gameI've been playing this game for a while, you will not find a better game for the money spent on it. Initially I played the default game on random servers, met people formed bonds still unbreakable til this day. There is something about fighting as a unit, when someone has your back and you have theirs. The defeat is heartbreaking but the victory is rewarding. Eventually I decided to make maps for this game, it's the only game I really play. I may play others from time to time but I always come back.Give this game a try, you won't regret it.			"

												I am a veteran Battlefield player on console, and the casualization of the battlefield franchise pushed me into the more hardcore and tactical shooters of PC. Coming to PC with this as the first game I sucked, really bad. I would go 0/10 in games.After putting hours into the game and getting used to the tactical feel of the game, I've gotten better and it's now one of my favorite games to play. It has that close quarters gameplay without getting wrecked by shotguns like you do in every other FPS.

												Sorry for the very long review, it's hard not to write about my second favorite game of all time. TLDR: This game is worth a purchase, but playing the game too much will kill the spirit of the game and make it bland.After 1500 hours, there are a few major things to note if you're looking at buying this game.One. There are elements of this game that are amazing. The lack of knowledge when first playing will be brutal, but enjoyable. One you understand the flow of the game, Insurgency will blossom into the hardcore FPS experience that Insurgency perfectly captures. Also, this game's ""free aim""  from titles similar to Red Orchestra is there, but hardly noticable then previous updates. I fail to sense the difference between this title and the original mod, and in both I can't see/feel any ""free aim"" with non ADS weapon handling.Two. This game, once played competitively in PUG's and proper teams, will make the entire game different. I'm not even sure if it's better or worse. There's no more suprise or really enjoyment anymore, which I'm sure is in part to how much I've played the game.Three. The game itself has a wide spectrum of play styles and servers to accomodate. Play for speed and aggression? Competitive is what you're looking for (potentially).Like to take it slow and steady? Coop and realism servers have what you're seaching for. This game is extremely accomodating between arcade and realism ( most are more of a 70 arcade /30 realism mix imo.)Four. Previously I stated that I though DOI (Day of Infamy, a WW2 Style shooter with alot of loving ties to Day of Defeat)  held back the supposed ""Competitive"" update,  we finally received something that is better than nothing in late June of this year.  Five. The lack of communication from developers to players is really a problem. I don't know if it is because they're working hard on three seperate games ( stuff for insurgency is still in development, right? Stuff like LUA, the sound thing with walls?...) but it's hard to continue to play a game that feels lke it spurts into life every 4-5 months, then slowly dies down into a weird niche.  All I'd like to see is what they're working at least once a month if that, just something to show they're still there and that they're listening to the players. Hell, I'm sure there are some Insurgency players out there that can help with development. Six. I love this game. I love the competitive community. Hell, I even love lamp and the RPG's. But it's the kind of love that fades away into realising how shallow and empty the whole thing really is. It's hard to describe this game to people verbally, I'm at a weird place with this game.Still definitely worth the money and time though :^)			"

												Insurgency is a Modern Day tactical military shooter between Insurgent (terrorist) forces and Security (US army). The best comparison would be Red Orchestra and Rising Storm but with less class orientation, and multiplayer only. The game improves in many aspects upon the original Counter Strike Mod and it’s now a really unique, realistic game.The scenery and the graphics are nice (using Source engine) but nothing groundbreaking compared to AAA games on the market. Never the less it gives a good overall look and feel and works great.The true focus is the gameplay, which is downright excellent and fun. It is realistic, unforgiving and challenging but really fun and heart pumping. Team play is a must and you will need tactical thinking to survive. There are many game modes, where you either fight for control points or destroying enemy caches (or annihilate the opposing forces). There is also Co-op against AI enemy (terrorist hunt) which is really fun to play with few of your friends.The weapon designs are fantastic and there is a ton of customization to go for, as well as Workshop support additionally. Each weapon sounds and feels realistic so you can almost feel the force feedback in your mouse.The best thing is the free DLC policy and the Continuous support with updates featuring new maps, enhancements, weapons and so on every week. If you are looking for a game which holds more tactical thinking and realism than Counter Strike or Battlefield than you MUST buy this game. Allah Akbar!9/10 Excellent "

												Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat was a free multiplayer first person shooter mod for Valve’s Source Engine that was released on Steam back in 2007. The mod placed an emphasis on realism and teamwork, and cultivated a loyal fan-base of dedicated players. Indie developer New World Interactive, which consists of members of the original mod team, has brought the concept back, now as a standalone game simply titled Insurgency. Despite a failed a kickstarter campaign back in 2012, the game has now made it to full release on Steam.The core fundamentals of what Insurgency aims to be are very similar to those of the original mod. The game’s prime focus is to provide a realistic portrayal of modern combat with objective based gameplay and an emphasis on teamwork, and in that respect it is a success. The obvious aspect of Insurgency that really lends to the realistic feel and distinguishes it from most other multiplayer shooters is the damage model. Weapon damage is handled much more realistically than most other shooters, meaning a single shot will more often than not be enough to kill you. This gives the game an outstanding sense of urgency and brings the need for careful and tactical play to the forefront.Complimenting the tension the fragility of your character provides, the majority of the game modes in Insurgency feature either limited or no respawns, so staying alive is of paramount importance. On the topic of modes, the game has good variety of different game types, though interestingly there is no deathmatch. The standout mode is “firefight”, which is a mix of “last team standing” and a territory capture mode. The goal of this mode is to either capture all three territories on the map or eliminate the entire enemy team. The twist is that every time you capture a territory all your teammates respawn. This gives the mode an outstanding intensity, where the tide can turn in the blink of an eye. We had instances where only a single teammate remained against overwhelming odds, but he managed to capture a territory and bring our entire time back into the fight, suddenly shifting the odds back into our favor. Rounds in this mode can be very brief or last quite a while, with hard swings and a tug-of-war feeling to the back and forth nature of the mode.Not all of the modes are as unique as firefight, but even the ones that are typical FPS game types are enjoyable due to the tactical gameplay and solid weapon handling. Weapon handling is one of those intangible things in shooters that can be hard to quantify, but you know when it feels it right, and it definitely feels right in Insurgency. The game has absolutely phenomenal sound effects that give the weapons a satisfying punch when you fire, but it’s also little things that really stand out, like the subtle and believable way the weapon sways while you move. Recoil also feels just right, and the different types of weapons all sound and feel different. Having weapons that are enjoyable to fire is one of the most important aspects of a first person shooter, and Insurgency completely nails it.When looking at the core pillars of what makes a multiplayer shooter great, you’ve got the actual shooting mechanics, the game modes, and the maps you play them on, and unfortunately Insurgency isn’t quite as strong in the latter department as it is in the two preceding areas. The game features a decent number of maps, but none come across as being especially memorable, and too often they are hard to even tell apart. The majority of the maps take place in urban middle eastern environments, and overall just feel too similar. Visually, the game isn’t super impressive, possessing that distinctive look of the source engine in terms of environments and geometry. It isn’t just that the maps are visually unimpressive, but that they don’t feel as thoughtfully designed as some other games. The maps seem to be designed to appear like realistic locations more than as arenas for gameplay to take place in. That’s certainly a valid approach, but often there will be rooms that feel pointless and paths that seem as though they should be passable but aren’t. The maps don’t hurt the game all that much, as the other aspects of the game are very good, but they could be better.These days, the majority of multiplayer shooters feature customizable loadouts and a persistent leveling system, but Insurgency takes a different approach. Instead of having weapons that are unlocked through the course of play, you have all equipment and weapons available from the outset. When a match first begins, you choose a class, but there are only a certain amount per team. Each team consists of two squads which each have a set of classes to choose from (determined by the game mode). Once a player selects a class, it is claimed and can’t be selected by anyone else. Once you select a class, you will start with a set loadout, but you have the opportunity to customize if you so choose. Each class has access to specific weapons and equipment, which each have a point value associated with them. Everyone starts with the same amount of points, which gives you the freedom to customize without sacrificing game balance.It’s not just that the game doesn’t tie the loadout system in with player progression, but that it doesn’t have any form of player progression at all. Some purists may be in favor of this, distilling the game down to gameplay and forgoing all the “carrot on a stick” external hooks, but many are going to find the lack of any persistence disappointing. Lacking a pointless number next to your name that goes up just for playing isn’t a huge loss, but the game doesn’t have any form of stat tracking or ranking system whatsoever, which is a kind of expected at this point. The lack of persistence is just one of the ways in which Insurgency feels a bit dated. Another, and a fundamental issue with the game, is that there is no easy way to play with your friends. The game doesn’t have any sort of party system or friends list integration. If you want to play with friends you are going to have to find a server with enough space to get everyone in and then scramble around trying to get everyone on the same team. It’s a minor inconvenience, but one you’re going to have to deal with every single match if you plan on playing with friends.Closing Comments:With the absurd number of multiplayer shooters available on steam, Insurgency stands out as one with both great gameplay and some degree of uniqueness. Yes, it’s yet another modern military shooter set in the middle east, but it’s adherence to realism and objective based teamplay to go along with satisfying shooting mechanics help it rise above its tired template. It lacks some features most would expect from a shooter released in 2014, most notably any sort of party system, but its tense and exciting tactical gameplay more than makes up for it. If you’re sick of the run and gun nature of Call of Duty but find the simulation aspects of something like Arma a bit too daunting, Insurgency is the perfect middle ground, and a supremely enjoyable multiplayer experience.Rating: 5 of 5			"

												Insurgency is the thinking man's FPS.  The bullet ballistics are A+ and the constant presence of danger around ever corner really puts urgent feeling into the gameplay, regardless of what type of game mode you are in.  Unlike shooters like Counterstrike, Insurgency excels not only in it's multiplayer PvP, but in it's co-op game modes like Hunt and Checkpoint, where players either have to eliminate the enemy AI situated throughout the map, or proceed forward and capture points to progress.  The AI in these modes are ruthless and cunning, and overcoming them requires real teamwork and communication.Insurgency also has an implemented Steam Workshop support, and the modding community has a plethora of available weapon skins, maps, and other downloads to help keep the game fresh.  While the game has a varied and wide selection of weapons available, I hope in future patches and updates they add extras, but that hardly takes away from the game experience.			"

												Insurgency started off as a CS:Source mod in 2007 and is now a standalone indie game that appears to be built on the CS:GO version of the Source engine. The best thing about modders as developers is that they're gamers too. That means this game has an FOV slider, no wonky mouse acceleration on by default, and it's balanced for competitive play.Gameplay-wise, it feels like a combination of Counter-Strike and old CoD ""hardcore"" mode. The characters can peek around corners and go prone, and it usually only takes one or two bullets to kill a player. The game also has a very minimalist HUD with no obituary - the only way to confirm you've killed a player is to see his dead body.Being that this is something of a core gamers' game, you'll find a lot of players who use their microphones and focus on strategy and teamwork. This is not a run and gun deathmatch game, although you could probably have some fun playing that way if you insisted. Unlike most tactical ""hardcore"" shooters, this game doesn't have slow or clunky character movement. The movement is smooth and fast, and the gunplay is satisfying with just the right amount of recoil.			"

												I've had so much fun playing this, but I just deleted it. The gunplay is amazing, the scope sway and rifle kick are proper, and the netcode is optimized to prevent bs things from occuring. It's challenging, and unforgiving, and I really like those aspects as it's what kept me going back to it. That and you can mod the hell out of it with all sorts of different optics, firearm models, audio packs, among many other things without breaking gameplay ""balance"". But I have had enough: The movement is awful. Worst in any FPS game I've ever played. See that little brick on the ground next to you? You will get stuck to it, for some reason your incompetent guy just can't seem to navigate around that brick, it's anchored to the ground and you're stuck to it like a fly in a spider's web. I've died so many times just bashing away at them mouse when an enemy is right in front of me but I can't shoot because I'm in the middle of changing stance and apparently the guy I'm playing as is too mentally deficient to process pulling a trigger while getting his♥♥♥♥♥off the ground. Your mentally slow character limits how well you can channel your skill into performance. That limit doesn't exist when you're aiming and shooting, but movement is SO clumsy. An FPS game with awful movement mechanics becomes an arcade shooter except instead of a plastic gun you get a mouse and keyboard. Once you know the map, you start to do really well, and the game shines. Once you know all the spawnkilling locations, you start to do TOO WELL, and the game is ruined. I can't tell you how many times I've played through a whole game and just can't get out of spawn because an RPG flew into it, or C4 was planted right in front of everyone, or just some guy lying prone in a hall of death. It's non-stop dying until the match is over-no fun at all. Supposedly all of the problems should be solved when everyone can vote for whatever they want. Want to change the next map to XYZ? No problem. Want to kick player XYZ for being afk or excessive teamkilling? No problem. Want to kick another player on the other team for spawn-killing your team? Oh you can't do that, because that would be broken. You could kick the entire other team this way. This democratic system is completely dumb, even if someone is breaking server rules and spawnkilling the other team on your team, nobody is going to votekick them. That guy is the best person on the team, denying the opposing team any sort of action to attack or defend an objective, so nobody except for the nonexistent moderators will try to get them kicked. I'm not going to lie, I found myself sometimes being that♥♥♥♥♥♥in the corner gunning down unwary folks running out of spawn, and every time I hate myself afterwards for doing it even if my team rejoices after winning and complements me. It feels sickly wrong. How could I forget to mention, that some of the maps are FAR from balanced. Yes it's a difficult job to balance each and every map in the game, but it's absolutely crucial in order for the game to have any chance of being fun. For example, on Seige, if you're insurgent and you sit in A and hold that one position behind c4-proof cover, you win the match. If you're defending B on Dry Canal, just get to the rooftops and camp. Buhriz, Sinjar, Dry Canal, and Panj are awful on Push, if you're attacking and your team doesn't know how to use smoke, you're either going to do the smart thing and sit in the back and not play the objective, or you're going to be used as a meat shield. Because of the voting system, those maps will ALWAYS be picked by people who want nothing more than easy kills and wins. It's not to say however that you will always lose if you're on the wrong side, rarely you will find yourself on a team that knows how to use smokes and how to clear objectives with explosives. It's such a gratifying experience to play on that kind of team, but particularly rare. I will not advise this game to anyone, sure it's cheap as dirt and it's a full-featured multiplayer game, but it's not worth the endless frustration you invest into a game where everywhere where you turn you will be stuck on a pixel, be given an explosive dental treatment every other time you spawn, and have your vote never matter because it will always be overturned by a stupid majority of players who think every damn game is TDM. The mechanics of this game are so easily abused, there is good incentive to abuse them, and although the developers actually adhere to feedback from the community, they don't address fundamental flaws. Seeing as progress is kind of slow, I will reinstall this game in one year and see if I can be proven wrong. I really want to be proven wrong.			"

												Honestly this is a huge improvement on the original mod, great game and tons of fun.I played back through the beta, when plastic bags looked like paper blowing in the wind. I've watched this game as it became the masterpiece it is.Running the CS:GO Source Engine it excells at displaying a beautiful game, while keeping it very tacticle. 9/10			"

												I chose to be the rocketeer for the ISIS team and I went round shooting rpgs while shouting ""ALLAHU AKBAR"". One day as I was firing rpgs, ending lives of innocent men sent to fight, my team were dropping dead like flies. Being the last one left, I ran like hell all the way to base but they found me and killed me, I failed ISIS, we had lost.Then I went back home to play Insurgency, its kinda fun I guess.			"

												I've decided to post a review, after a very unsettling event.I bought this game, purely to re-live my long lost Socom dream. Mod developer (and now official developer), @redline, created this wonderful mod that brings back the classics and memories of our favorite Socom 1 and 2 maps. My first day logging in, I was so full of excitement I spent time running around the maps in the ranked rooms just enjoying the feeling. It was wonderful! They've taken good care and have done a wonderful job in the creation of how the map designs are, to how smooth the game play feels.I had started playing on Dec 13th, the day I discovered the game. I was hooked. I was logging in 8+ hours per day. I managed to get onto the leaderboards at probably 25 or so (due to how the tcs system works). Then they did their first ranked leaderboards reset. I managed to play a few days after the reset, and I popped into rank 1! It was pretty cool, but I had to go onto holidays, so my rank eventually plumetted. When I returned from holidays, on about January 8th, I began to play hard and focus on returning to that top rank. It was a struggle. I seemed to loom around rank 10-15 for a week or so, then I found a friend whom I got along great with and we were really great at communicating. Calling stuff out in Teamspeak; watching eachothers back (yeah, it may be a dirty trick, but you can't really avoid it, in the online world).After a long grind, of many hours played per day (I'm talking now, like 8-12+ hours per day; of pub stumps (destroying noobs), planting bombs, extracting hostages constantly, with the assistance of my fellows, I managed to re-emerge to that rank 1 position. This was achieved on Jan 17, late-night, around 11:00PM EST. I proceeded to farm more TCS in order to attempt to maintain this position for as long as possible. The day now, is Jan 19th. I get off work, decide to pop into play more Socom Source, and boom... Banned.I'll be honest, at this point I'm kind of depressed about the matter. There has been spectulation about me using code 9 (i.e., hacks -- such as wallhacks and aimbots) but that couldn't be any further from the truth. Anyone who knows me, knows I play games on a competitive level. I've been playing SBG's (Skill-based games) since I was a kid. I never came to Socom to be the best player, on the console I never was. I will never be as good with a controller as anyone with a kb/mouse combo. Alas, I managed to emerge as #1 again, only to find myself banned.Of course there was no discussion on the matter, and no, I will not appeal to have myself unbanned. While I want to say that it is unfair judgement, I believe they have decided based on a majority of community decision. People have been reporting me often, for what I can't say. I rely on communition and I call out every position I see. If communication out-side of game dictates what people call as wallhacking, then I am an abuser.All-in-all, I want what is best for the Socom community, and if that means that they want me removed from it, then so-be-it. It has been an absolute pleasure being able to re-live it, and redline, BigZ (and any others), you guys have done a tremendous job, keep up the great work. I look forward to watching some streamers/youtubers in the future to see how much you are all able to pull off.;;TL;DRI highly recommend this game to people who are interested in re-living their Socom fantasies. The mod developers at Socom Source have done a tremendous job and they deserve every bit of credit they have done.			"

												I can't wait to see how this game will be when it is fully released it is so nice right now. Minimal HUD Real Firing mechanics, Nice teamplay, it is as is I am in combat everytime, I litterly move in my chair when I am under fire taking hits trying to skimp to cover, my heart races. This is like the modern RO2, almost a battlefield feel minus the vehicles. Real practical maps that make real world sense. It is so nice to duck in cover while enemy spreys, and then mid-late sprey pop out and semi fire 3-4 shots of insta death! I feel so powerful, I really feel like I am operating in the game.EDIT: I am editing this now with it's release, the polish they have added, the interface for changing your gun, the character variety, and so much more! New maps on the way every 2ish months! I am still enjoying this purchase, and with it's new permanatly discounted price, it has never been easier to purcahse a game without a sale % tag on it.Check out my Guide for Easy Tactical Breakdowns of possible encounters and teamwork scenarios:

												If ARMA, Red Orchestra, and the likes of Ghost Recon and Counter-Strike got together and had a lovechild, its name would be Insurgency. Its very first iteration started out life as a mod for Half-Life 2, but a turbulent post-release development period ultimately led to its demise. Luckily, its lead developers banded back together at New World Interactive, and following a failed Kickstarter but a remarkably successful Early Access campaign, Insurgency (initially titled Insurgency 2) is now one of the greatest multiplayer shooters on the market.Its gameplay offers realism and authenticity of a tremendous caliber, with tense gunplay that relies on tactics and teamwork above all else. A huge offering of game modes that subtly change the game without detracting from its core formula, and a solid selection of maps. There's even a surprisingly excellent co-op component to the game. Add to that consistent and remarkable post-release support with great content updates to this day (even a competitive matchmaking system is apparently in the pipeline, which will be an incredible addition to the game) and we can start to see why NWI's commitment to putting Insurgency on the map deserves some attention. Pick this game up, because it's worth every penny.			"

Instead of running in and hoping you kill someone, you have to really be tactical and very precise with your decisions to kill the other players. You really have to use everything around you to your advantage to survive against your foes and get to the objectives. 8.5/10 in my opinion.			"

												So, I've logged a lot of hours into this game because honestly it's my favorite shooter and I say that wholeheartedly. The graphics are great even on the lower settings, and the user interface is the epitome of barebones. The only thing that really shows on your screen is how many magazines you have left. There's no minimap, no radar, no ""23/30"". It's great because it makes you rely on what you're seeing going on in the game universe around you as opposed to looking at a gadget in the corner. You can tell when you're being fired at because tracers will be lighting up the world around you, and you'll know it's close because you'll hear a hiss or a snap. You note that green tracers are used by the insurgents and red are used by the Security. Something like that I can appreciate because it is more immersive. The gameplay itself is usually pretty hectic and a good number of the times in PvP you'll find yourself wondering what's going on. PvE is fun because there's nothing like slaying 40 insurgents with your friends, and the last one fires an RPG and every single one of you dies. The workshop community is great, you can get anything from graphics updates to new skins for your weapons or even sillier mods that change your grenades to pokeballs and your weapons sounding like anime girls when you reload them. Since I purchased the game back in November 2014, the devs have been meticulous in updating their game, they add new maps, fix glitches, and cosmetic changes like scope reticules and the like. As far as I can tell if the fanbase wants something, the devs will try to add it in if it's a good idea. So basically it's a current game with fantastic gameplay and a dedicated dev team who actively upkeep their work. 10/10.			"

												(8.3/10) Insurgency is a tactical first person shooter focusing on short CQB and objectives. This game features a variety of things to spice up the generic genre including: free-aim system(your gun isn't pointing in a constant direction such as in games like Counter-Strike), customization of guns, equipment, armor, etc., a supression system(rewarding for various high ammunition guns such as a MG to supress enemies being cover causing them to blur vision, increase sway, etc.), dedicated server support, multiple gamemodes, etc.               Combat is simple and there's a fair learning curve, with a few factors that affect your combat such as hitbox multipliers and whatever gun you use. Focuses a lot on taking objectives(this is visible especially when you earn a proportionally higher score for taking an objective opposed to getting a kill(100 for securing an objective opposed to 10 points for every kill). Customization of your class would present new and diverse classes that fit your playstyle the best(start with a set amount of inventory points depending on your class, and then choose your gun, its attachments, armor, vest, explosives, etc. which is only limited, by then, a weight system). Decision-making is generally a big part of the game as well(ex1. should I turn on my night vision goggles or not(because it takes a few seconds for it to be useful and not blind you), ex2. should I go capture B or defend A), and like most games you'll lose the game/round because of poor decision-making                 A new DLC, not too long ago, brought the expansion of night maps with the addition of night vision goggles, flashlights, flares, flare guns, etc. to the battlefield. Maps are well-made and detailed for combat.                 The general community is above average, considering toxicity only comes from general trolls.  Communication is a lot more useful in this game compared to other games in the genre.                  Some of the cons are a lack of a definitive leaderboard/ranking system(the one right now is purely aesthetic and is based on how much score you accumulate). Another one being a few exploiters(not much, but there are still some), however VAC and server owners/admins handle them quite well. TL;DR: Fun, challenging game in the shooter genre that builds and tweaks off of  minor features to create realistic gameplay			"

It is amazingly good, simulates real life combat and the best part is that the community of players is not ocean like big. So it's kinda like "" everyone knows everyone"".

												This is the most awesome, realistic and tactical-based game I've ever playedOnce you get into Insurgency, you feel like you're the soldier you're controlling, placing you between two factions that are, in real life, aslo in conflict. The gameplay is basically flawless, you just keep your♥♥♥♥♥down just like in real life. Therefore, you absolutely need to follow your nco orders in order to win the fight. Shooting a man does put him down, even in one hit so the game is basically in hardcore everytime (which is amazing). The game also takes it most of the irl soldiers gear and accessories so that you can enter hostile buildings by throwing flash or smokes and even customizing your weapons with mounted red dot, rigid handguard and suppressorsSpecial mention to the sound which is AWESOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMEIt puts you well in the core of the action, the gunfires are realistic: Heavy and loud, just like I like itExplosions are pretty amazing, getting you deaf for a bunch of seconds if it does explode near your earsAnd also. Coop mode, man.Going from Attack against A.I or stealth based maps, the coop mode is truely one of the best I have experienced.The people in here also are very nice and amazingly well fit into the action aswellThey will follow any orders and/or give you some, they will throw flashs aswell, all this to say they're pretty tactical and amazing.If I had to put a rank to this game, I'd put 11/10I really recommend it			"

I playin this game for few months and I don't have a enough words to describe the beauty of it... this is the game that I was waitin for a years and thx to the guys from NWI I finaly got it.... It have everything what FPS game should have. I recommend this game because it's hard to play regardless of that are playin coop or pvp, because there are mods where are bots even harder that humans (flanking, marking, precise shooting, etc) making those bots sometimes nearly impossible to beat... All in all it's the BEST game on the market, in my opinion... if you buy it you won't regret it....			"

The workshop community is great, you can get anything from graphics updates to new skins for your weapons or even sillier mods that change your grenades to pokeballs and your weapons sounding like anime girls when you reload them. Since I purchased the game back in November 2014, the devs have been meticulous in updating their game, they add new maps, fix glitches, and cosmetic changes like scope reticules and the like. As far as I can tell if the fanbase wants something, the devs will try to add it in if it's a good idea. So basically it's a current game with fantastic gameplay and a dedicated dev team who actively upkeep their work. 10/10.			"

												(8.3/10) Insurgency is a tactical first person shooter focusing on short CQB and objectives. This game features a variety of things to spice up the generic genre including: free-aim system(your gun isn't pointing in a constant direction such as in games like Counter-Strike), customization of guns, equipment, armor, etc., a supression system(rewarding for various high ammunition guns such as a MG to supress enemies being cover causing them to blur vision, increase sway, etc.), dedicated server support, multiple gamemodes, etc.               Combat is simple and there's a fair learning curve, with a few factors that affect your combat such as hitbox multipliers and whatever gun you use. Focuses a lot on taking objectives(this is visible especially when you earn a proportionally higher score for taking an objective opposed to getting a kill(100 for securing an objective opposed to 10 points for every kill). Customization of your class would present new and diverse classes that fit your playstyle the best(start with a set amount of inventory points depending on your class, and then choose your gun, its attachments, armor, vest, explosives, etc. which is only limited, by then, a weight system). Decision-making is generally a big part of the game as well(ex1. should I turn on my night vision goggles or not(because it takes a few seconds for it to be useful and not blind you), ex2. should I go capture B or defend A), and like most games you'll lose the game/round because of poor decision-making                 A new DLC, not too long ago, brought the expansion of night maps with the addition of night vision goggles, flashlights, flares, flare guns, etc. to the battlefield. Maps are well-made and detailed for combat.                 The general community is above average, considering toxicity only comes from general trolls.  Communication is a lot more useful in this game compared to other games in the genre.                  Some of the cons are a lack of a definitive leaderboard/ranking system(the one right now is purely aesthetic and is based on how much score you accumulate). Another one being a few exploiters(not much, but there are still some), however VAC and server owners/admins handle them quite well. TL;DR: Fun, challenging game in the shooter genre that builds and tweaks off of  minor features to create realistic gameplay			"

												What i love most about this game is that it gives you a blood rush that no other shooter games managed to give me so far. It is amazingly good, simulates real life combat and the best part is that the community of players is not ocean like big. So it's kinda like "" everyone knows everyone"". Plus it's really picking up popularity, so you won't have trouble finiding people to play with.			"

												This is the most awesome, realistic and tactical-based game I've ever playedOnce you get into Insurgency, you feel like you're the soldier you're controlling, placing you between two factions that are, in real life, aslo in conflict. The gameplay is basically flawless, you just keep your♥♥♥♥♥down just like in real life. Therefore, you absolutely need to follow your nco orders in order to win the fight. Shooting a man does put him down, even in one hit so the game is basically in hardcore everytime (which is amazing). The game also takes it most of the irl soldiers gear and accessories so that you can enter hostile buildings by throwing flash or smokes and even customizing your weapons with mounted red dot, rigid handguard and suppressorsSpecial mention to the sound which is AWESOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMEIt puts you well in the core of the action, the gunfires are realistic: Heavy and loud, just like I like itExplosions are pretty amazing, getting you deaf for a bunch of seconds if it does explode near your earsAnd also. Coop mode, man.Going from Attack against A.I or stealth based maps, the coop mode is truely one of the best I have experienced.The people in here also are very nice and amazingly well fit into the action aswellThey will follow any orders and/or give you some, they will throw flashs aswell, all this to say they're pretty tactical and amazing.If I had to put a rank to this game, I'd put 11/10I really recommend it			"

												Insurgency is a game reminding me of the golden age of shooters. It's a tactical realistic shooter, and it's a step in the right direction. As in 2014, it's a one of it's kind. And it is unique.It looks really good to be on the Source Engine compared to for example Titanfall which uses the same engine.The textures and especially the gun models are some of the best I've seen, to be honest. But, the player models lack quality.The maps looks nice. It's just that. They look nice, but nothing more. They're not good at all. Most of the maps are unfair, so one of the teams has an advantage so their weapon caches for example are in an open field. Easy for their snipers to prevent people from destroying them. And then the other side /team's caches are inbetween buildings and in cover, so the other team can easily go there and destroy the weapon caches without being sniped. On most of the maps, there will usually be one team that has the advantage.This pretty much ruins the experience for me.So, all in all.. It deserves a strong 8/10 as maps in a multiplayer-only game is very important.			"

												I just want to say a few words about the truly amazing policy of NWII haven't seen a game in a long time that lives up to the immense support insurgency gets from its developers. Not only do they update the content (maps, weapons, gadgets, gamemodes... you name it) and gameplay frequently, they also don't cash any money for their DLCs. While we live in times where companies charge money for DLCs that come out at the release day of their games, NWI really shows how it should be done. This game is an example of true customer service that stands out in a world of greedy game companies.great FPS.			"

												Tactical Shooter is the most accurate tag for this game. Bullets and explosives kill enemies, but with strategy,teamwork and a slow pace you can take on an army. This game comes as close as possible to real war where you have no HUD or magically healing bullet wounds in a matter of seconds. It may not have as many players as Battlefield CoD or CS:GO but it brings something else to the table which the others fail to provide, hardcore and realistic strategic cover and fire.			"

												Another military online shooter? Don't groan and roll your eyes just yet. Despite being a stand-alone update on a seven-year-old Half-Life 2 mod, Insurgency's freshness runs deeper than its familiar urban warfare settings and ""good guys vs. the terrorist infidels"" trappings might suggest. This first-person multiplayer killfest pushes cooperative team play in interesting directions, using hyperrealism and a unique team role structure to drive its frenetic team-based firefights. Granted, it's not the slickest-looking shooter, but the dated look of these battlefields melts away as the intense tactical encounters heat up.Like being shot in real life, it takes only a bullet or two to end your life in Insurgency. This makes getting dropped as you sneak out from cover or dart across an alleyway a jarring experience. Without any sort of map or radar system beyond your current objectives, you never know when you'll be caught in the crosshairs, or whether those bullets will come from the enemy or a trigger-happy comrade who mistook you for one. That alone doesn't make Insurgency's 16-on-16 team matches particularly unique, but the way this welcome realism extends throughout and enhances other aspects of its design certainly does.Direct shootouts are a thrill in their own right when you've got a large mass of opposing squad members pressure-cooking an objective zone or a pinned-down group working together to escape alive. Outside of these heavyweight encounters, it's rare that you get to see your attacker until it's too late--at least when you set off on your own. By the time you hear the pow-pow-pow of gunfire and catch a quick flash in your peripheral field of view, you're on the ground bleeding out. Racking up kills requires great skill, and thoughtful teamwork often plays a critical role in how long you stay alive.Insurgency's cool squad system is well designed to nudge you toward team cohesion without making it mandatory. You can go lone wolf and try to tackle objectives on your own, but working with your comrades is a far easier way to stay alive and push your squad across the victory line. It's also a lot more fun way to play that way, too. From the many numerous matches I dove into, I found that the online player community is far more engaged and communicative about combat tactics than in some other similar-themed shooters.Plenty of classes offer distinct loadouts and roles to choose, ranging from assault and heavy support forces to snipers and demolitionists. The twist here is that there are a limited number of slots on a given squad for each class, and everything is on a first-come, first-served basis. You can use limited supply points to customize your class loadout with a few different guns, weapon upgrades, and secondary gear, but these upgrades stick within the wheelhouse of each class type.Team makeup specifics change depending on the map you're playing and the side you're on, but everyone has a role to play. For example, you might find yourself to be one of the only two snipers in your group or a soldier who has smoke grenades or a particular type of explosive needed to complete a mission. This encourages each team member to step in line or face the wrath of your squadmates. It's not just about playing your part, though; your team can't persevere if everyone is dead.Sneaky tactics are encouraged.Most of Insurgency's game modes use permadeath as incentive to play super strategically and minimize the run-and-gun mentality of other shooters. In tactical operations, like Firefight and Search & Destroy, dying once kicks you into a spectator slot. You're stuck on the sidelines until your squad captures an objective zone, which allows you and your dead comrades to respawn as reinforcements. It's another neat wrinkle--one that makes matches feel fresh and entertaining but can also bog down the fun when you're just itching to shoot things. Sustained combat matches, like Skirmish, Strike, and Push, loosen the reins on this mechanic a bit, giving you more ways to earn reinforcements and stay in the action. Not every game mode is readily available on a consistent basis, however, if only because there are not a lot of players gravitating toward certain matches. VIP escort missions and the cooperative humans vs. swarms of AI mode are hard to hop into as a result.A dozen different Middle Eastern map locales let you fight it out everywhere, from abandoned cities with tight alleyways and lots of structures to open forested mountaintops and snowy villages. Each area is well designed and full of nooks and crannies to use to your tactical advantage, and a handful of nighttime maps also add some nice variety. While the scenery and characters get the job done, they're nowhere as crisp, detailed, or stylized as those in other recent shooters. It can be an initial turnoff if you're used to more visually appealing offerings on the PC, but delving beneath the surface reveals Insurgency's strong team-driven focus and realistic gameplay to be the real gems here.Intense tactical encounters filled with firefights and flying bodies prove thrilling enough to make it easy to look beyond Insurgency's less impressive visual design. The team dynamic and unique squad system inject something different into the mix too, offering match after match of absorbing cooperative killing that proves good looks aren't everything.Overall, I give it a 10/10 for realism and 9/10 for gameplay.

												Insurgency is the best tactical shooter out there right now, hands down. The gameplay is a nice mix of arcade action and strategic position holding, the weapon handling is the most realistic of any game I've played, and the sound design is simply the best I've heard on the Source engine (with the excellent Resistance and Liberation coming in a close second). Its mixture of one-or-two shot kills and a fast round-based game structure make it a great compromise between Counter Strike's arcade style of gameplay and the realistic/extremely tactical nature of games like Red Orchestra and ARMA. Also, while this is entirely unrelated to the quality of the game itself, I may as well mention that if you're a Coloradoan I'd recommend buying this just to support the fledgling game development scene that's slowly emerging here. C'mon, we can't let California and Washington dominate the market forever. One last thing: NWI's DLC policy is fantastic; I highly recommend reading up on it.Edit: as everyone's panicking over BattleEye's implementation right now, I just thought I'd pop in and mention that it's one of the most popular anti-cheat programs in the industry, and half of the people who're paranoid about what it might do to their computer likely already have it installed. In any case, I wouldn't be too worried about it, as it's a pretty big deal in the games industry right now. It'd be pretty strange of them to mess up and leak all of your data or anything like that - just as it would for most any widely trusted business to.			"

												This is by far the best shooter I have played. It is definitely different and took me a fair while to get used to. I wasn't happy with it at first, with all the serious differences it has to others, but I pushed on and got through it. Now I love it. What do I love about it? Well just the overall hardcore style of it, which makes it feel like a proper shooter. What makes it hardcore (feel free to add to this list guys)?:- No mini map- No radar- No health bar- No ammo count- No hitmarkers- 1-3 shots to kill- No obvious ally/enemy tagsThose are just a few. This game is brutal and the wrong move can result in your instant death. INS teaches you to be situationally aware at all times and to always expect an enemy around every corner. It balances every weapon quite well and each map requires the use of different weapons for ultimate effectiveness. Some people like the run and gun style like CoD. This game offers that to a limit which I feel is great. You can't just run around and gun down everyone you see, you will die. But you can go from cover to cover at a fast pace, stay alive and still get kills.Some people also prefer the camping style like BF and even CS. This game does reward that style of play. But it is boring to camp in a corner for the entire round, so most don't do it. What I like to do is; if I know, or at least have an idea, that a few enemies are going to run into a room that I am in, I will prone in the corner and shoot them. I will then move on and continue fighting. No camping around forever.I feel INS is much better than the other shooters out there, with its realism making it so. It's not arcady, yet still competitive. I hope that INS does well in the future because I honestly love it to bits.9/10			"

												Insurgency started out as a Half-Life 2 mod, and its developers created it into a standalone game.  The developers focused on creating a game which was a realistic hardcore military shooter, and they succeeded.   As a player you are not given any benefits of having a HUD like in other shooters ie. Counter Strike or Call of Duty; not knowing how many bullets are left in the chamber or who is friendly.  Additionally, friendly fire is always turned off so be careful. Pros:+ The graphics are spectacular everything from the blade of grass to the smoke grenades.+ The sound effects are intense, not many games pull of realistic sound effects like gun shots and grenades.+ As a player you have the ability to play as both Security Forces & Terrorists - Similar dynamic as in Counter Strike.+ You have the ability to customize weapons, due to the fact this is a realistic simulation you can only customize by weight & points system.  This system makes it so that you have to decide if you want features like a scope or silencer etc.+ Each player has to pick a specific class upon joining a team. Each class has specific weapons types and gun modifications, making it a unique game experience with each class. -- Being a realistic simulation each team only has a select number of people in each class - ie. no more than 2 snipers per team.+ Insurgency has a fully functional party experience.  Joining on friends is simple.+ Insurgency provides many modes between co-op and regular multiplayer gameplay Cons:- As discussed before, each team limits the number of individuals who can play a specific class, due to this, if you wanted to switch classes with another player the only way to switch is if you or the other individual were to swap to the spectator position. I wish there was a request option to change positions with another player.As all hardcore games, the quality of the gameplay will depend on your team and communication skills.  This game is hard to master, which can make it both fun and frustrating.  Tips: Always reload when you can, beware of your surroundings, and keep your ears open.Verdict 9/10			"

												This shooter has pretty much everything you want.- Aiming down sights- Prone- Sprint- Sliding on the ground- Leaning to side to side- Customizable loadouts- Plenty of different game modes- Coop mode against AI- Dark maps that use nightvisionThere are no killstreak rewards/mechanics or vehicles though, but maybe that's for the best.Developers are updating the game on a regular basis and the game just keeps getting better and better!Conclusion: This is a criminaly overlooked shooter that you shouldn't miss out on!

												CS meets ARMA?The learning curve may be steep at the beginning, but suprisingly the actual skill cap isn't that high. That's because with a very low TTK the game focuses less on twitch shooting and arcade skills but more on tactics and teamwork. Also the game is objective-based and playing the objective is a lot more important than K/D ratios.The gunplay and controls are pretty solid and easy to understand (it's a Source game - everyone knows this engine). Once you learn them you need to master 3 things: tactics, teamwork and map knowledge.Tactics - Start by reading the Steam Guides. This game features some real CQB tactics which is nice.Teamwork - Use a mic. If you don't want to use a mic, don't buy this game. For best effects, either play with your friends or join a clan (there are some good ones.. like the one called TAW or sth). This game requires teamwork and finding team-oriented players on pub servers is a hit-or-miss.Map knowledge - this comes with experience. The maps are pretty good, small but detailed, with many flanking routes.The game's technical quality is ok. I mean it's what you can expect from an indie Source engine game.The devs are great and really supportive and constantly add new content to the game. New updates are released more than once a month!Generally it's very good online FPS. Quite fast-paced, very tactical, not overly complicated. For me this game is a perfect mix between realistic and arcadey.			"

At first Insurgency was a great source mod, fast and intense yet really gave it a unique feel, not just another source mod that felt like Half-Life 2. I've sunk many hours into the mod version on my old account,but the tense combat just never gets old.Now the new version,This FPS is a great example of what modders are capable of making. WIth the community helping the devs over the course of the early-access campaign, the effort is clearly visable. The difference from the beta was a huge leap forward as the game offcially released on steam.  In terms of quality, the game and the art beheind it is amazing, even more so for being an indie title. Finding yourself caught in a eerie situation; such as being the last man alive, and the only audiable thing is ambience yet you know you will die or kill any second in this damn desolate schoolbuilding.The standard server browser is still here, along with a simple matchmaking system providing different modes of play. Co-op is actually a blast, your entire team has to be on eachother's back since this has some of the scariest bots ive seen at times. (like just charging you outa nowhere)The game has been offcially released, but at the time of this review there are still bugs and other issues still present in the game. None seem to be gamebreaking, it's just it can get annoying if you just exit to the desktop with no error.There's alot of hope for the future in this game if it's done right.Id reccomend this game if you like: Red Orchestra/RS, Counter Strike, America's Army, Battlefield (If you liked the hardcore mode combat).[/b]tl;dr it's kinda like Red Orchestra, except on speed and more objectives "

												While not without some minor faults, Insurgency is really worth the buy. Extremely punishing for people who don't work as a team. One mistake and you're dead, this game is all about teamwork and supporting one another so you can come out on top. There's a great amount of tension within each game, you have to be aware that someone could be waiting around every corner, blitzing through the map and thinking you can take everyone out yourself just won't happen, it's a much slower paced game than other modern warfare multiplayer shooters, but by no means does it mean it's boring. Just watch out for the few elitists that are good at this game and feel the need to berate any 'noobs'.			"

This is not like other fps titles like Battlefield 4  which gives u unlimited respawn and kills the tactical play, this game requires patience, tactical mind and is played at a slow pace. The graphcis arent the best since its made on source engine but its very impressive still cause even tho it is on source, it looks factastic, the supressing effects are awesome.

Everyone rushes to a point and worst of all no one knows how to play VIP, always an player running in guns blazing trying to get a kill, but ends up dying! Game is outstanding in all with the gun work, but needs some better team work and communicating.			"

												A wonderful realistic military shooter that has some aspects of ARMA, Rainbow Six and CS that I enjoy. If you like the map styles of Counterstrike you will probably enjoy this game. If you like the simulation/realistic shooting in ARMA or Rainbow Six, I have a feeling you will enjoy this game. If you liked the old Ghost Recon games you will probably enjoy this game.The atmosphere is top notch, the gunplay feels very very good (it has literally my favorite handgun/pistol gunplay ever), the controls are right where I would like them, the levels are well designed and most importantly it is just a blast to play.After the horrible garbage that was Takedown: Red Sabre, it was so good to see another indie shooter that was gunning for the same crowd come in and just NAIL it, near perfectly. Every single aspect is better in this game, so fans of any of those games i mentioned above now have another modern style sim/realistic shooter that is fun to play with friends and calls for teamwork.The ai is good in this game so you really have to take you're time and be ready for some intense firefights. I enjoy playing coop on this as I did in Ghost Recon/Rainbow Six back in the day, a ton of fun with friends! In the end this is a shining example of how to do a indie shooter in a niche area and do it well. Also this was a early access game and another good example of how EA games should be. What are you waiting for? Pick this game up asap and support some pretty awesome devs! Two big thumbs up!			"

												First review ever, so forgive me if I lack some stuff.Before I get into the typical pro's and con's, let me tell you a bit about the game. Forgive me if this sounds like a trailer for the game.InsurgencyThis wonderful game known as Insurgency has a lot to offer, if you're up for a challenge. Before we get into the main game things, let me tell you one thing. This game is NOT the most graphically appealing game out there. To be honest it looks like a game from 5 years ago or more, but obviously, there's a lot more to a game than graphics. This game has some very, very nice weapon behaviour. The weapon will kick very hard, unless you have a foregrip, but if you get a foregrip, you might not be able to get a sight, or some AP ammo. The game needs you to decide what you want to bring into the battlefield with you, but you'll only be able to bring what you really need. There's different classes to suit different playstyles. I personally will go for the Rifleman on Security (CT) side, and the Sharpshooter on Insurgent (T) side. TRUE SNIPERS GO MOSIN AP AMMO IRON SIGHTS ONLY. This game also greatly rewards teamwork. On most gamemodes, if your team is communicating properly, and you're all decent players, you're chance of victory is extremely high. Talk to your teammates, help people, and don't become a salty burden for your team, it helps nobody. The maps are pretty big, and will sometimes live to the most heart-pounding moments of your life, you're a small group of five people, the enemy has 1 wave left, you have 0. You are all running low on ammo, and somehow, you win the round. When you do things like that in this game, it's incredible satysfing. One thing though, this game, is very tough on beginners. You'll be a burden to your team, people will get mad at you, some people might roleplay like terrorists (join them, it's fun). Don't mind them, skill comes with practice, and one day, you will too be the MVP. The community is very nice for a game like this, of course you have your salty people like in every game, but most people are nice. One of my gaming and skype buddies, I met through Insurgency. I love this game, I love how it's not made to be as fair as games like CS:GO, yet it is, I love the community and modders. I give this game my 10/10 for sure. If you're up for a realistic challenge, buy it.Pros- Realistic mechanics- Tactical gameplay- Good community- Mods (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=604003221, my collection ;] )- Active developers (competitive mode coming up!)Cons- Graphics- Panj (You'll get this when you buy the game ;] )			"

One round to the head will put you down, and a machine gun round to the chest or stomach is likely to end the round. The animations are very good. The graphics are more than decent.

Then, BattlEye was added and things changed.FIrst of all, I wasn't planning on reviewing this game anytime soon, or at all, because 40 hours of playtime just isn't enough to review it in a way that would be ""acceptable"" to the majority of the community, and before I'd get to that level, I assume Sandstorm would be released. But, rather than ever giving it a positive review, here I am giving one of my favorite games on Steam, one of my favorite FPS games ever a negative review. All because of some dumb software that I never saw people requesting.Insurgency never had a cheater problem. Ask anyone with hundreds of more hours in this game than me. They all talk about seeing only one cheater in the game ever, or none at all. VAC was enough for this game. Seriously, it was.On February 8th an update was released bringing a lot of changes that were well accepted, for example I was really happy to see the pitch-black nighttime setting of Dry Canal being fixed. However, BattlEye was also added, an anti-cheat software that nobody who bought the game before its implementation had agreed to have it included.There will always be people who don't have a problem with BattlEye in any sense and consider everyone who does paranoid. And there will, of course, always be people who either have a personal issue with the software, or technical.The main reason why I don't support BattlEye, never have and never will is quite simple. It is way too INTRUSIVE. You can argue with it NOT DOING things that an anti-cheat software shouldn't, but you have to agree it CAN do way more than it's supposed to.Another thing, way too many people are experiencing issues with Insurgency after installing BattlEye, from major gameplay issues to not being able to start the game.Now, you don't HAVE TO install BattlEye, which of course, I didn't, BUT if you choose not to, you will be shown the middle finger. You are only allowed to play Cooperative and Singleplayer game-modes (against bots), along with game-modes included in unofficial Multiplayer servers.Insurgency won't be so kind to let you know that you are about to join a server with BattlEye enabled, so trying to join it without the software installed will violently lock you out with a gray screen, and there's nothing you can do except force your way out of the game.If you do however want to connect to Multiplayer servers knowing they don't have BattlEye, then you will have to ensure that manually, through the server browser, selecting ""do not include"" - ""battleye"". Now you are just left with the wonderful task of not joining a match that forces you to download Workshop items.Great move, developers. I hope the constant flow of negative reviews will at least get you thinking...			"

Public Review on behalf of the Opium Pulses Steam groupFew words about the gameInsurgency is really well made first-person shooter with probably the most realistic experiences I've encountered in games. It's different than let's say CS for example, playing Counter-Strike you're aware that it's only a game etc. but here... here YOU are directly in game. There is no minimap or bullet counter, there is no hit markers, when you're being suspended behind your cover by enemy fire, you simply experience being trapped in there. Watch out for yourself and good luck!Advantages - Stunning graphics, not made to look pretty, made to look realistic - Sounds are really great, you'll understand what I'm talking about when you will hear those bullets flying right next to your nose - Impressive variety of detailed and greatly designed maps. Night modes for most of maps, what is something really nice - Constantly updated content with steam workshop access, what makes game so customisable as almost none other game - Fair price for that kind of game - The most authentic mechanics I've ever encountered - It's literally tactic shooter, not like ""rush B fast"", but you really need to think tactically to defeat your opponent - Pleasant co-op modeDisadvantages - Little bit buggy - Probably the most toxic comunitty I have heard in a long timeIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!

												An anti-cheat program watching me play is fine. An anti-cheat program reading the files on my computer is okay, I guess. An anti-cheat program that saves data taken from my computer on their servers is fishy, but I can deal with it. What I can't deal with is an anti-cheat program reserving the right to share that data with business partners. I don't care how much they stress they respect privacy and don't record personal information. The most recent update implementing Battleye was a terrible choice by devs. Don't support them.From the Battleye EULA:- Licensor stores all information collected by BattlEye on servers located in Europe and/or the US. Licensor may share the information with its partners and/or affiliates.			"

												TL;DR = This game is probably one of the best FPS's of 2013-2014. I highly recommend it.When I first played this game, it was back when it was a mod. I enjoyed the mod, but it felt lacking. There was something about the way that it played that removed depth and I think it was that it was the lack of ambience. It just never had the depth in sound that this game does. Sound makes a difference, a huge difference. However, I assure you that this isn't the only gripe with the mod. Anyway, back to this game.When I first loaded the game back when it first came out, it didn't feel any different from the mod. There were game breaking glitches but they have been corrected now. There aren't as many glitches if there are any. It plays smoothly and very well.The matchmaking portion of the game works like CoD Ghosts AND TF2. It being a source game, you can opt out of the matchmaking and use the server menu. The matchmaking isn't bad, though. There are a few options you can choose when selecting a server, such as ""Do not join full servers"". You can also choose which maps you want to filter out. I have yet to have be added into a game with higher than 100 ping, although that could do with my location (East Coast U.S.A.). The game plays like the mod, but there are new changes. They've added suppression and dive sliding. You can further customize weapons like add different ammunition types (AP, HP and Tracer rounds). AP rounds do more damage to armored targets and HP does more damage to unarmored targets. There are a few different types of scopes you can add on your gun such as a holographic sight or an acog sight. You can purchase these attachments with supply points that you earn after every round.All of the guns handle pretty realisticly and force you to focus on range and accuracy rather than fully automatic fire. On maps like Peak, it is all outside and it forces you to use single fire, but in maps like Ministry where you battle through hallways, you can use automatic fire. When you use automatic fire, your accuracy suffers. It can also be noted that being shot at lowers accuracy due to suppression.There are four different game-mode categories. Tactical Operations, Sustained Combat, Adversial Match and Cooperative Vs. AI. In Tactical Operations it focuses on one-life battles. If you die, you must wait until the round ends to respawn. In Sustained Combat, you respawn every 15'ish seconds until your reinforcements run out. In Adversarial Match, you respawn every captured objective. Cooperative Vs. AI plays like Adversarial Match, except it is played against bots. Each of these categories have their own sub-gamemodes that include: Firefight, Flashpoint, Infiltrate, Occupy, Push, Skirmish, Ambush, Strike, Vendetta and Checkpoint.Firefight is an Adversarial gamemode in which you must capture all of the enemy checkpoints and reinforcements are replenished every objective captured.Flashpoint is an Adversarial gamemode in which you must overpower the enemy team and destroy their weapon caches which are scattered around the map.Infiltrate is an Adversarial gamemode in which you must capture the enemy's intelligence and it plays like Capture the Flag.Occupy is a Sustained Combat gamemode and it plays much like capture the flag.Push is a Sustained Combat gamemode plays like the mod's original gamemode, it is a Sustained Combat gamemode in which you must capture checkpoints and push back the enemy force. Skirmish is a Sustained Combat gamemode which plays out like Domination on CoD, you must capture and control all of the enemy's points and destroy their weapon cache. To win, you can also eliminate all of the opposing force.Ambush is Tactical Operations gamemode in which a team must escort a high valued target to safety. If the high valued target dies, the escorts will lose the match.Strike is Tactical Operations gamemode where both teams fight to destroy eachothers weapon caches. When a cache blows up, the round ends.VIP is Tactical Operations gamemode works slightly like Ambush, except in this game mode you must find and capture each of the enemy's control points without letting your leader die.The HUD is very immersive and shows you how many magazines you have left and your current fire mode. It also shows you your supply points. It also shows you the captured points and where the points are. If a team member spots an enemy player it will show their location. When you join into a game, you are shown two different squads each with their own different ""Loadouts"". They're all customizeable and they all play a different role in combat. There are specialists who specialize in SMG's and Carbines and fight at close range and then there are Riflemen who specialize in rifles and fight in medium to far range. Those aren't the only squad loadouts, but I won't go into the others.It features a fully 3D voice chat system in which friendlies and enemies can both hear you if you're in the vicinity. It can be pretty intense hearing the enemies at a distance. The sound is also pretty intense. The guns sound really good and they echo around the map so when small skirmishes are happening, you can hear them going on from across the map. In a few maps, you are able to hear background noise such as car horns, people talking, babies crying and it really adds to the effect when you're fighting in a city.There (As of this review) are about 12 maps which are different in their own ways. They all require different types of tactical approaches. Anywho, this concludes my review, I hope that this helps sway your opinion towards buying this game. I wouldn't exactly base your entire opinion off of this review, so make sure you watch videos on the game. I HIGHLY recommend it. It's EXTREMELY fun.EDIT 2: Changed the review from No to Yes and edited it to say what the TL;DR message says.EDIT 3: I have decided to add everything that comes after the TL;DR message			"

												One time when I was a small child about 8yrs old, my father took me to an amusement park. At this amusment park there was one of those game stands. How you beat this certain game was by throwing a ball into a bucket slightly tilted downward. Simple right? Sure, simple, and by simple I mean the biggest ♥♥♥♥en scam I've ever seen in my life. I spent my entire years allowance on this game which amounted to 20$ (Which is like 1000$ in the hands of a 8yr old) and every time i missed and it would make me extremly angry. I cried, i threw a fit, I was not a happy child. That game changed me when i was 8, I would stay awake at night thinking of different ways to throw the ball and every year I would come back to try the same game again, but everytime I failed.After a while i figured it was hopeless and i would never play that game again because it was the hardest thing i ever had to do at such a young age.*9years later*I get on steam and go to my library and there lay the game Insurgency, a game i bought a year ago just for the sake of it being on sale. *Launch Game*One time when I was a teen about 17yrs old, I logged myself into my steam account. In this steam account there were many games, this game was an FPS that resembled any other multiplayer FPS. How you beat this certain game was by killing everyone while constantly being shot at from every single ♥♥♥♥ing direction while your team yells at you. Simple right? Sure, simple, and by simple I mean the hardest ♥♥♥♥en multiplayer FPS I've ever played in my life. I spent my entire years allowance on this game which amounted to 10$ (Which is like 100,000$ in the hands of a 17yr old) and every time i didn't destroy an objective or got shot the second i left the spawn point it made me angrier. I cried, i threw a fit, I was not a happy teen. That game changed me when i was 17, I would stay awake at nigh thinking of different ways to aim or take an objective every day I would come back to try again, but everytime I failed.After a while i figured i was hopeless and i would never play that game again because it was the hardest thing i ever had to do at such a young age.Rip:( "

												Insurgency is that one game between a mix of Arma, Counter Strike, and Call of Duty. The shooting mechanics literally make you bounce off your chair in some cases. Bullets whiz by and you really want to avoid them, and you take yourself with greater care when you want to cross a street. You die so easily that you make sure to yourself that every corner, nook, and cranny is clear before you get into opening up. Even so, people can get lucky by running away from bullets in certain cases. I found myself literally hopping away from AK fire like I did in CS:GO. While the shooting mechanics make it have that realistic feel, it still has it's casual elements aswell. If you ever play in a public game, be sure to pick the ones that involve long respawn times (or none) because it attributes to much more team work and strategy. If you pick a casual match where everyone spawns seconds after death, you're talking about a free run shooting gallery in a nutshell. Surprisingly, Insurgency can run on my single slot toaster thanks to the Source Engine. It's a great game, and definitely a thrill that is unique to the shooter genre.			"

This game is amazing.Forget what you think you know about first-person shooters, this game changes all that. Based around realism, and coupled with an amazing community of players, this game is exciting and a much needed refresher on the beaten, dead horse of FPS.With huge and detailed maps and an array of gamemodes, Insurgency never gets boring. Play agains other players, or with them, but I guarantee you'll have fun. This game is pretty polished, with only a few minor glitches, none of which are game - or deal - breakers.If you've got the cash, and nine or ten days free on your schedule, this game is a must have. In fact, grab the four pack, cuz once you get this game you're going to want your friends to play it too.			"

												This game is quite fun and worth every dosh spent, its pretty realistic until you play co-op where the bots kill you near istantly from across the map without aiming but that does add more of a challange to the game. The multiplayer can be quite hard but still very fun. All together this game is very challenging so if you're looking for a harder type of fps i would recommend this.			"

Components+ The gameplay makes you feel like an actual soldier, there is a very scarce HUD, barely telling you♥♥♥♥♥♥as to where you are or how many bullets you have left in your mag, though it doesn't matter, this isn't Call of Duty where you can spray and reload mid mag and have not wasted an entire magazine. Once you reload, that mag is gone and you have spent it. You have to make decisions carefully, spending bullets wisely. And unlike call of duty, when you are in a firefight between you and the insurgents, they are spraying bullets and not hitting you. Instead they conserve ammunition like actual shooters, and when they do fire, they have a higher chance of hitting you. Which allows for tactics to be used between teammates.+ It is also very tactical team shooter, having to rely on teammates to get to your objective, distracting so you can flank. Or providing cover fire so you can have time to heal. It requires quite a lot of communication between teammates if you want to get the best result of a match or hunt. Knowing that you have someone’s back and someone has yours, really embraces the team tactical atmosphere.+ The sound is very realistic, unlike most shooters, there is not background music playing. Instead it sounds like an actual war, if you stand still and listen, you can hear gunfire in the distance between your fellow soldiers and other insurgents. Giving you the sensation of being in an actual war against another country, it actually sets the atmosphere for a war. It is no Normandy in 1944, but it is more like Black Hack Down.+ The graphics are amazing, to the level where it seems to match battlefield 2142. Saying Battlefield 3 would be too much, as EA wants to make Battlefield the most realistic game out there and they are. Not only do the graphics look amazing, but it doesn’t run your FPS into the ground, making the game very smooth but the client does have a few crash problems. I expected for such a realistic looking game, it would be quite laggy for computers not that powerful, but somehow it does not do that and runs amazingly.+ And it is also very balanced and lacks bias between players; you don't level up, you don't pay for better guns, you start with the same armoury outfitted for your class selected in class selection, you just choose which one you want and what you want to customize yourself with, whether it be with extra mags to a laser sight on your rifle. Insurgency is one of the best realistic shooters I have ever played, Battlefield and Call of Duty play around on the fictional side of games, where as Insurgency plain focuses on the realism of war. All Insurgency needs is a no heal mode, where you don't just stand and you heal yourself gradually like in COD, it needs to have a zero heal factor and the only way to get yourself out of the red, is a medical kit provided by a medic, that is the only thing I think is a very good idea.+ There are a lot of diverse game modes for Insurgency; normal team deathmatch, then Co-op Terrorist Hunt, and other Co-op modes. That is what Insurgency does well; it doesn’t fully rely on its PvP multiplayer, but embraces the cooperation multiplayer. It allows players to act as a team and feel like actual soldiers within the game, it is no Call of Duty Co-op Campaign, but it does a lot better than the Modern Warfare 2 & 3 Co-op game mode.OverallWhen I first played Insurgency, I didn’t know what I was in for, but I do not regret it. Insurgency is a realistic shooter that parts away from shooters like Call of Duty and Battlefield where it is constant shooting and unlimited ammunition. Insurgency makes you question each movement and think about each decision, gives you a reliance on your teammates and need for cooperation. That is the best part about Insurgency. It allows and embraces the need of cooperation.If I’m not mistaken, there had to be veterans advising the developers of the game to give them the most realistic war shooter game out there. They tell them, “In war you don’t just go guns blazing into a room, you tactically enter it, checking corners and make sure it is clear before moving to the next door” or “We don’t spray our entire mag, we fire at most 3 bullets at a time, we are wary of our ammunition, it is limited”. If they weren’t told that by veterans, they must really have a good understanding of realistic war.Insurgency seems like a young game and has a lot of room and time for improvement, consider a bigger aspect, like the use of vehicles and separate tactical teams, inserting from different areas, try learning from Rainbow Six or more from real life warfare even though they are doing an amazing job so far. I strongly recommend this game and Insurgency needs a much bugger audience than it does now. I bet Captain Price would be proud of the players of this game; you actually constantly check your corners.			"

You have to think about what you're doing, keeping track of deaths, how many bullets left you have in your magazine, etc.This isn't a game where you can just run around just shooting your weapon all crazy like. It's a game of teamwork and playing smart.I would have easily payed full retail price of what most games are these days for this honestly.

												This is more along the lines of what a competitive FPS should be. This isn't a pick up and play and have a jolly good time with your friends sort of fps. This is a highly competitive fps with a steep learning curve that promotes team based gameplay and punishes the kind of gung ho idiots who think they're Rambo like many other fps games.Insurgency is a game that promotes skill based game play and rewards those that work with their team, communicate and work the objectives most effectively. If you're caught and shot you're probably going to die. If you rush in without thinking and guns blazing you're just going to spray ineffectively and take a round to the head. You have to think whenever you move up, clear you corners, work with your teammates, and don't miss when you encounter the enemy because you will not get a second chance. There are no hit points or medkits or power ups. There is no kill spam to tell you how your team is doing or if that grenade you tossed in that door got anyone or not, or even a kill cam to expose that enemies position once they got you. There's no magical crosshairs floating in the middle of the screen either; if you want to aim you'll have to draw your gun up and use its sights.In many ways the game lacks features, and that's what makes it competitive and the quality game that it is. It doesn't flood you with information you don't earn and don't deserve. Games like TF2 are all well and good, but they are very arcadey and don't necessarily reward skill or teamwork. Heck, if I'm a sniper in TF2 I can get a kill, and then the killcam will simply tell him and everyone where I'm sniping from. If I'm sniping in Insurgency, as long as I'm cautious and avoid anything that might make my position obvious I can snipe all day long until someone actually spots my position.Insurgency is also very well rounded when it comes to game modes. I'm a fan of the push mode myself (attack/defend), but there are an abundance of modes from fighting for control points, king of the hill types, capture the flag, or even defending/intercepting an MVP. The maps aren't always the most balanced for each mode, such as Buhriz and Sinjar being extremely bias in favor of the defenders in push mode, but 100% map balance is a myth in any fps. Over time you'll learn which maps to vote for and which to avoid. I would say the maps are probably the games major weakness, in that there are not a lot of them and some are simply not balanced for all the game modes available on them. Only other weakness I would point out is the game runs on Source, and sadly suffers from some of the issues that Source has; like alt+tab problems, graphical crashing, cheats, and so on.All in all though the few negatives are easily outweighed by the games positives. I easily recommend this game, so long as a challenging and competitive FPS is what you're looking for. If you're hunting for another TF2 then this might not be your cup of tea.			"

												Very fun game that reminds me of the old school days of Counter Strike, although it is a lot more tactical than Counter Strike and often uses a lot more teamwork, and people have to actively perform the role of their class.  I'd recommend it for any fan of FPS games, but remember that is isnt COD, and it's not team deathmatch. Capturing the points and completing objectives is mandatory in this game! If you're looking for an arcade style shooter then stay away from this one, as this is a lot more tactical and intense than similar FPS games. This game requires teamwork, so make sure to have a mic as well.			"

Dont use it if there's only one enemy ahead .-if u want to destroy caches that's in a building  , DON'T USE RPG !! Because if u use RPG u'll commit suicide .I'm writing this because everytime i play multiplayer , i got killed by my teammate because he/she is too clumsy XD .

												They need to make a hardcore mode for this game. No HUD or kill confirm. No team markers either. Other than that it's a real fun game. Not having a HUD or kill confirm will make the game more realistic and fun. I've heard that the game used to be like this but they changed it for some reason. I hope it was for a good reason because changing that made the game feel like call of duty or battlefield. If they want to appeal to the COD fans then they can go right ahead an do that. But for the audience who prefer a more realistic game with teamwork and strategy, please add in a hardcore mode. Do it for us. Please.			"

												I will start by saying that this game is not for everyone. It has a very similar feel to CS:GO, but with a much more realistic and dramatic play style to it. Kills and deaths are more significant, and more rewarding. This is NOT a game where you can sprint around with a knife or run head first into their whole team and shotgun the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them.This game is very fun if you can be patient and tactical. Communication and teamwork is the key to success, and makes the game much more fun to play. It's also important to note that the game does a great job at keeping people occupied with defending or attacking objectives (most of the time) - since capturing objectives allows your team to respawn.For those of you who have played and enjoyed Red Orchestra/Rising storm, you may want to consider this game. If you were to take the mechanics and realism from Red Orchestra and apply to to CS:GO, this game is what you'll get. For $15 bucks, I'd say I've gotten my money's worth already, and I haven't put many hours in, just know that you probably won't get the hang of it right away.			"

												I have played CS since it came out.  I've tried finding substitutes, e.g. Call of duty, Battlefield etc but none live up to the skill that is required in CS.I'd recommend inrugency to anyone who likes CS, especially if they are getting bored, tired of matchmaking, bad bullet reg etc.Insurgency requires a high degree of skill when moving and aiming, although the mechanism is different to CS.  In Insurgency you can for example fire from the hip, or look down your sights.  Sounds like COD or Battlefield right?  Except in Insurgency a stray bullet could take you out instantly- you will only be forgiven if you can think and move on your toes, both as an individual and as a unit.The game is extremely smooth and based on the Valve Source engine.  It also looks the part- making CS:GO look and feel dated.At the end of the day you cant go wrong at the current price.  Insurgency is a true realistic tactical shooter unlike any other, which in my opinion as a CS veteran is not something you come by everyday.Recommended? If you like 1st person multiplayer shooters- you need this game.			"

												You shouldn't be reading this. Instead, you should be purchasing this game!Listen, it can be frustrating at first. For the first 10-20 hours or so, you are going to want to throw your computer across the room... You'll yell in frustration as you have no idea why you are dying, struggle to come to grips with the idea that bullets hurt, and wonder why tatics you've used in other multiplayer FPS aren't working. It's going to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. But stick it out! Once you start to learn some of the tricks, you'll find an intensly rewarding gaming experience. Having well over 200 hours on this game, I still look forward to playing, and it never gets old. You have to remember this is a tactical shooter, so you have to be thinking with that mindset. Your job is to outsmart your enemy and complete objectives. Your K:D ratio isn't the focus of the game, and with the lack of crosshair, your going to have to aim down your sites if you hope to hit anything. Play the objectives, learn the maps and your K:D ratio will go up. I'm still learning, but a few tips that may help in your adventure: Take it slow. If you try to rush into the firefight, you will die. Quickly. Check your corners, and re-check them. Play the objectives, and the kills will come naturally. Communicate, communicate, communicate. Most imporantly, have fun and don't let the frustration get to you!			"

												What are you gonna get when you mix CS:GO + TF2 Role System + ARMA Franchise Realistic Military Simulation + Overly Manly Man Players? Obviously, this game.Insurgency is a Tactical Realistic First Person Shooter game. There are 2 teams in this game. You're going to play as ""US ARMY THAT SHOOT 100 FREEDOMS PER MINUTE"" or the worst case is you're going to play as ""SUICIDAL MUJAHIDEEN"" (don't get me wrong, im a Muslim). You are going to be forced to play as a team, not being a f*cktard lonewolf.  With the realistic bullet damage, you might not survive your first minute in this game if you're not playing like an Overly Manly Man. Even it's only a heavily mod source engine game, this game has stunning graphic. Final Score: 8/10			"

												*Edited*Insurgency is a FPS game made in improved source engine, like CS:GO.Much like CS:GO the game likes to separate itself from other FPS games on the market making in very unique and generally fun.What makes this game so unique is the aim for realism and it's tactical approach, this means stuff like no HUD, kill & get killed with few bullets.This sadly means a lot of new players will start to hate the game right off the bat because there is simply no easy way to learn this game that fast, start calling out ""hacks"" and similar because there are no kill cams/replays of your death. You should not jump on the hate-train, yes the game will probably irritate you at first just like CS:GO but if you give it some time and try to understand how to cope with the game you will start doing fine.The game has both PvP and PvE content.How the game works/General:You will start on your spawn point where you can choose what weapons you will carry with you into the fight, this will cost you ""Supply points"" the supply points vary from PvP to PvE content, but in most cases you will NOT be able to carry all the stuff you planed in your head and will have to choose wisely. After you are done choosing the equipment you will clash with your opponents to take on various objectives. There is an excellent number of map variety and same goes for weapons and their extremely well done customization (scopes, ammo types, fore-grips, barrels, etc.). Once you die in this game you are done, unless your team captures/destroyes one of the objectives which will respawn you, additionaly in PvP you can get respawned if the game mode is using ""Reinforcements waves"" (in most cases it does) which will simply respawn you after some time. All explosives, from simple granade to C4 & RPG are HIGHLY deadly (in most cases will one shot you if too close). No game has such strong (realistic) damage on explosions. The game also uses simple cover mechanic, on example bumping into a corner wall then holding E or Q will lean you in appropriate direction so only half of you is targetable to the enemy, if crouched near a small wall you can simply aim into it and your character will rise above it in appropriate manner to peak, so only your head is visable while you can shoot at the same time. You can also use in both PvP & PvE in-game voice commands your character yells, like: ""Need backup! Covering fire, Affirmative, Negative, etc.) they are voiced really good.PvP:PvP more often than not, ends up in very fast time (around 5mins) unless you are playing ""Push"" (which is the best imo) play style which can take up to 15+mins. It's hard to say much about it as the game will ALWAYS vary from player skill. In PvP you can play these modes: Push - Attackers must capture 3 points (1 at a time) and then destroy the weapon cacheStrike - Attackers must destroy 3 weapon cachesAmbush - One player is the VIP (chosen randomly) and must be escorted to one of the 2 locations, he mustn't be killed or defenders winSkirmish - Both teams have 1 weapon cache, and in game there are 3 capturable pointsOccupy - Both teams must charge one point in the center of the map, and hold itFlashpoint - Each team has 2 weapon caches and there is one point in the center of the mapFirefight - Each team starts with one point captured, there is one extra in the center that is neutralInfiltrate - Each team has a little laptop, defend yours and take theirs to your laptop (CTF)PvE:In PvE you will make a team of 4-8 players and go through the map killing loads of opponets and destroying weapon caches along the way or capturing objectives that once captured could go into a counter attack where you will have to hold out against swarms of enemies. While it's much easier to take on the bots they go in big numbers and sometimes fire RPGs, use granades, molotovs and similar. It's noticable that bots use a lot of suppression fire, forcing you to move from place to place. PvE is hardcorish style, makes the mode more challanging but more fun too.Side notes:Never had FPS issues, the game never crashed, the community keeps modding the game for various maps & content. VOIP can be cancerous sometimes, but hey, in what game it isn't. The game keeps getting updated by devs. even though a lot of time passed which is nice (the updates are free), I don't know why but game is almost always on sale (from 5-10$)Negatives:There are a lot of modes for the variety but in the end they all feel-ISH the same, graphics are mediocare, it feels like some weapons just have different skins, enemies can sprint near you and you probably won't hear the foot steps, shotguns sometimes even on point-blank won't kill (almost useless in this game), some PvP maps are small and force you to go to ""A"" or ""B"" path, both Security and Terrorist look pretty lame (thankfully there are mods for that)Overal score for me: 7/10 - You should DEFINITELY get it on ANY sale.

												Extremely intense one of my favorite games. i didn't play it alot until one of my friends got it and lately its all we've been into. The only downside is that due to the intensity of having a rainstorm of bullets pepper your position to the point where you can't see and immiedeitly run to try to get away I can no longer handle playing modern shooters due to the lack of realistic intensity. Great game.			"

												This game is probably one of the best first person, realistic combat shooters, on the market. This game is not like Call of Duty or Counter Strike, where you will scream because of cheap or unrealistic kills. This game is almost exactly to the point of realistic warfare. (Not saying i have been in war, because I never was) but this game is almost exact. No killfeed, no 20 bullets into someones head and they dont die, no rediculous kills, this game takes pure skill. You need to have the right state of mind to play this game. You cant just run in and expect to go 20-4, no, you need to play this game smart like you are in war. If you do not keep your eyes peeled or pay attention, a bullet will go right through your head. Simple as that. You need teamwork, you need skill, you need to play smart. This game needs real life warfare tactics to play. If you are serious enough to play a game like this, then I will 1000% recommend this game. This game is always on sale, and can possibly be one of the most top played games on steam.			"

												Somehow, this has managed to be one of the most refreshing online shooters I've played in a while. Despite the fact that you have shooters like ARMA, as well as games like Red Orchestra 2 and Battlefield 4 that encourage tactics, Insurgency manages to find it's own place that helps distinguish it from the rest while feeling every bit as deserving of a spot in your library. While running on the aging Source Engine, the games visuals consistently manage to surprise, especially considering how well it handles some of its more open environments and medium to long range combat without the slightest framerate hitch. For those who have managed to read this far, the game offers several games modes. Two for co-op, one of which is a survival/horde mode, three that are similar to Counter Strike's round-based gameplay, and three that have a limited number of respawns in the form of waves, closer to Red Orchestra. 32 player limit, a decent number of maps that offer a lot of different play styles, a unique loadout menu, NO PERKS/KILLSTREAKS (yaaaaaaaaay!!!), and incredibly well done sound effects.Again, this game definitely gets my seal of approval, and don't forget to try to convince some others to check it out too!

The devs need to sort out some things regarding performance, and the changes to some maps on Ambush were completely unnecessary. Also, why does the Model 10 exist?But yeah, good game. Give it a go, I've had some fun times with this one.			"

Components+ The gameplay makes you feel like an actual soldier, there is a very scarce HUD, barely telling you♥♥♥♥♥♥as to where you are or how many bullets you have left in your mag, though it doesn't matter, this isn't Call of Duty where you can spray and reload mid mag and have not wasted an entire magazine. Once you reload, that mag is gone and you have spent it. You have to make decisions carefully, spending bullets wisely. And unlike call of duty, when you are in a firefight between you and the insurgents, they are spraying bullets and not hitting you. Instead they conserve ammunition like actual shooters, and when they do fire, they have a higher chance of hitting you. Which allows for tactics to be used between teammates.+ It is also very tactical team shooter, having to rely on teammates to get to your objective, distracting so you can flank. Or providing cover fire so you can have time to heal. It requires quite a lot of communication between teammates if you want to get the best result of a match or hunt. Knowing that you have someone’s back and someone has yours, really embraces the team tactical atmosphere.+ The sound is very realistic, unlike most shooters, there is not background music playing. Instead it sounds like an actual war, if you stand still and listen, you can hear gunfire in the distance between your fellow soldiers and other insurgents. Giving you the sensation of being in an actual war against another country, it actually sets the atmosphere for a war. It is no Normandy in 1944, but it is more like Black Hack Down.+ The graphics are amazing, to the level where it seems to match battlefield 2142. Saying Battlefield 3 would be too much, as EA wants to make Battlefield the most realistic game out there and they are. Not only do the graphics look amazing, but it doesn’t run your FPS into the ground, making the game very smooth but the client does have a few crash problems. I expected for such a realistic looking game, it would be quite laggy for computers not that powerful, but somehow it does not do that and runs amazingly.+ And it is also very balanced and lacks bias between players; you don't level up, you don't pay for better guns, you start with the same armoury outfitted for your class selected in class selection, you just choose which one you want and what you want to customize yourself with, whether it be with extra mags to a laser sight on your rifle. Insurgency is one of the best realistic shooters I have ever played, Battlefield and Call of Duty play around on the fictional side of games, where as Insurgency plain focuses on the realism of war. All Insurgency needs is a no heal mode, where you don't just stand and you heal yourself gradually like in COD, it needs to have a zero heal factor and the only way to get yourself out of the red, is a medical kit provided by a medic, that is the only thing I think is a very good idea.+ There are a lot of diverse game modes for Insurgency; normal team deathmatch, then Co-op Terrorist Hunt, and other Co-op modes. That is what Insurgency does well; it doesn’t fully rely on its PvP multiplayer, but embraces the cooperation multiplayer. It allows players to act as a team and feel like actual soldiers within the game, it is no Call of Duty Co-op Campaign, but it does a lot better than the Modern Warfare 2 & 3 Co-op game mode.OverallWhen I first played Insurgency, I didn’t know what I was in for, but I do not regret it. Insurgency is a realistic shooter that parts away from shooters like Call of Duty and Battlefield where it is constant shooting and unlimited ammunition. Insurgency makes you question each movement and think about each decision, gives you a reliance on your teammates and need for cooperation. That is the best part about Insurgency. It allows and embraces the need of cooperation.If I’m not mistaken, there had to be veterans advising the developers of the game to give them the most realistic war shooter game out there. They tell them, “In war you don’t just go guns blazing into a room, you tactically enter it, checking corners and make sure it is clear before moving to the next door” or “We don’t spray our entire mag, we fire at most 3 bullets at a time, we are wary of our ammunition, it is limited”. If they weren’t told that by veterans, they must really have a good understanding of realistic war.Insurgency seems like a young game and has a lot of room and time for improvement, consider a bigger aspect, like the use of vehicles and separate tactical teams, inserting from different areas, try learning from Rainbow Six or more from real life warfare even though they are doing an amazing job so far. I strongly recommend this game and Insurgency needs a much bugger audience than it does now. I bet Captain Price would be proud of the players of this game; you actually constantly check your corners.			"

												Great game. Similar to Arma, though some say it's comparable to CS:GO. If I'm in a more realistic mood rather than arcade, Insurgency is great for that. Now the game isn't THAT realistic compared to others like Arma, but relative to CS:GO, it has a much more realism to it.The game is being constantly updated and keeps getting better.-Downloading community made wep skins and snd skins is a MUST. It allows you to customize the looks of the game according to your tastes. The community consistently provides more options and there is already a wide range of things to pick from. Definitely recommending this a less expensive alternative to CS:GO with a more realistic feel to it.			"

												Insurgency. Should you buy it? Short answer: Definitely. For those interested in knowing why, read on...In a time where modern shooters are a dime-a-dozen, it can be very difficult for a company to break the trend and still be successful. The reason is simple - a company needs to make money. Hardcore games, generally speaking, will never make as much money as mainstream games. You'd be insane to believe that. So, when a game like Insurgency comes along, claiming to provide the hardcore feel, the gritty realism, the (actually) competent AI, it's easy to dismiss as a title that will enjoy some brief limelight, only to disappear into the ether moments later.Insurgency is not one of these titles. Enemy players and AI bots alike, will strike you down with fierce determination time and time again. You will forget to reload at the worst possible time. You will attempt to hip-fire a machine gun, and die. You will try to sprint from cover to take an objective, and die. You will try CoD moves, and die. You will try BF4 tactics.... and die. You will quickly be perforated if you don't carefully round each and every corner. Death will come swiftly and frequently.You will curse yourself for failing your team, and swear to be better the next time.You will learn.You will fire deliberate and aimed shots. You will fire accurate bursts. You will move quickly and precisely. You will conserve your ammunition. You will communicate. You will become one with your team. You will coordinate your assaults. You will master any role you are assigned to. You will listen. You will watch. You will take your objective with real tactics. You will survive.You will succeed. In a game like Insurgency, victory never feels hollow. You will always feel like you earned it. I give Insurgency 9.5/10.You will win.			"

												How does one start with a game like Insurgency. It is amazing. The game is unique, taking aspects from other games and forming its own distinctive game. The realness in the game make you, the player, feel like you are there in combat. From the depth in weapons (more weapons will be added in the future), to the structure for each class, this games stands on its own legs. I highly recommend Insurgency for any player.However, it does take a while to get used to. With its uniqueness comes a period of multiple deaths over and over. You need to get used to it to excel.

												I would want to start off by stating that Insurgency is the first multiplayer FPS game that I appreciate playing- yes, I played Counter Strike (via LAN with friends) but the physics, gameplay, and game mechanics does not meet my liking; same with Call of Duty, I like the single player mode but I do not like most of the game's multiplayer mechanics where you apply perks, radar tracking, unrealistic humam speed (considering weight from all the gears) and things like that.In Insurgency, you get to play like real men. Tactical and hands-on to say the least. You get to the action or you are done for. Physics are great, mechanics are realistic - no perks, bonuses or any BS like such. You play fairly with other players with basic loadout options given to you and balanced gear management where YOUR SKILL is your best edge.If you want realistic FPS combat, buy this game.Keyword would be REALISTIC.11/10, I don't see my self stopping to play anytime soon.

Review on Portuguese and EnglishAnálise em Português e InglêsReview on EnglishAnálise em InglêsSUMMARY: Insurgency is a FPS (First-Person Shooter) game with tactical elements that tend to realism but can be configured to become arcade (this depending on the server). Even the game not having a campaign to get more interesting, it's exclusively focused to the cooperative (against AI-controlled bots) and to the Multiplayer (against real enemies).Entering the game, the player can choose to join the Insurgents team or to the Security team, both have their own classes, weapons and customizations, but even so, the game can keep very well balanced during the match.Currently, Insurgency has 7 different game modes in the Multiplayer, which the maximum server capacity is 32 players, about the cooperative match, the game has 5 different modes and the maximum server capacity is 8 players.GRAPHICS: As for the graphics we can say that is impressive to see how developers worked to optimize them to the maximum, even with many elements present during a match the game doesn't need a very good PC to run, the graphics stand out for being well modeled and with a excellent finish, the details of the scenarios and weapons also impresses, but it is impossible to compare them to new generation of games, I think the graphics are similar to CS:GO. There are some mods at Steam Workshop that can slightly improve the graphics of the game.SOUNDS / AUDIOS: Another extremely positive point of Insurgency is the quality of the sounds of weapons, environments and explosions, they can make you get fully into the game, because it seems that you are in a real war, and also, you can download some mods in Steam Workshop that will improve the effect and the experience, letting the game more real (or funny). PING / FPS: The game has a really good rendering which makes it possible to run even on less powerful computers (if you can run CS:GO on low graphics at 60 FPS, probably can play Insurgency without any problem), and servers respond very well, even with 200 ping, you can play without perceive any difference or interference while the gameplay.GAMEPLAY: The gameplay of Insurgency is a bit different because it tends to the realism, so it becomes a bit more complicated than other FPS games we are used to, always being very fluid and responding well to the requested commands. If you are new to FPS games, maybe you will pass a bit of difficulty, 'cause you don't have a quick answer against enemies or even an advanced coverage notion yet. To the veterans on FPS games can be sure that Insurgency will make you become better at basically every other FPS you play or have played.The physics in the game is a little weak, it tries to hide some mistakes but it doesn't work so much, for example the bodies don't react too well to bullets.I didn't find any individual cheating, or doing some bug.DEVELOPERS: Assets and attentive, the Insurgency Support/Development Team is an example, always trying to help you with any questions or problems you have in the game, unlike many other games, the Developer/Support Community of Insurgency tries to maintain a intense contact with the public, as an example, they play matches with us. You can contact them through Steam if you need something, which makes the service be much faster and easier.COMMUNITY: In the sense of Insurgency Players Community, I can not analyze in relation to Asian, Oceania or Africa servers, but the American (all the America, not only U.S.A.) and Europe community are very warm and friendly (also very funny, ALLAHU AKBAR) at every match that I played I didn't find any rager or any that harm your gameplay (such as abusing the voice chat, abusing the chat, or kill his own team with intent). The players community created and are creating a lot of mods to improve or vary your gameplay (some mods are very hilarious), also the artworks and screenshots created from players are very cool.Análise em PortuguêsReview on PortugueseRESUMO: Insurgency é um jogo FPS (First-Person Shooter) tático com elementos que tendem para o realismo porém podem ser configurados para deixá-lo bem arcade (isso dependendo do servidor). Mesmo com o jogo não tendo uma campanha para ficar mais interessante, a sua proposta é exclusivamente focada para o cooperativo (contra Bots controlados por IA), e para o Multiplayer (contra inimigos reais). Ao entrar na partida, o jogador poderá escolher entre se unir ao time de Insurgentes ou ao time de Segurança, ambos possuem suas próprias classes, armas e customizações, mas mesmo assim, o jogo consegue manter um balanceamento muito bom durante a partida.GRÁFICOS: Em relação aos gráficos é possível afirmar que é impressionante ver como os desenvolvedores trabalharam para otimizá-los ao máximo, mesmo com muitos elementos presentes durante uma partida isso não o torna pesado de maneira alguma, se destacam por serem bem modelados e com um acabamento excelente, o detalhamento dos cenários e das armas também impressiona.SONS/ÁUDIOS: Outro extremo ponto positivo de Insurgency é a quantidade de riqueza e qualidade dos sons das armas, ambientes e explosões, é possível você se imergir totalmente ao jogo, por conta destes que o fazem parecer que realmente está em uma guerra, no Workshop também é possível você alterar alguns sons de armas, explosões, e outros efeitos para deixá-lo ainda mais real.PING/FPS: O jogo possui uma renderização muita boa a qual o faz ser possível de rodar mesmo em computadores menos potentes (se você consegue rodar CS:GO com gráficos baixos a 60 FPS, provavelmente conseguirá jogar Insurgency sem nenhum problema), e os servidores respondem muito bem, até 200 de ping é possível você jogar sem nem mesmo perceber diferença ou interferência durante sua gameplay.JOGABILIDADE: A jogabilidade do Insurgency é um pouco diferenciada e por conta de o jogo tender mais para o realismo ela se torna um pouco mais complicada do que outros jogos de FPS que estamos acostumados, sempre sendo muito fluída e respondendo bem aos comandos solicitados, caso você seja iniciante em jogos do gênero pode ser que passe dificuldade para conseguir ter uma resposta rápida contra os inimigos ou mesmo uma noção de cobertura avançada. Aos mais veteranos em jogos FPS posso ter certeza que Insurgency fará com que você se torne melhor em basicamente todos os outros FPS' que você joga ou já jogou, por conta da estratégia e velocidade de reação que é necessária durante a partida.Não consegui encontrar nenhum individuo trapaceando seja com programas maliciosos ou com bugs no próprio jogo.DESENVOLVEDORES: Ativos e atentos, a equipe de desenvolvimento do Insurgency é um exemplo, sempre buscam lhe ajudar com qualquer dúvida ou problema que você tenha no jogo, ao contrário de muitos outros jogos, a comunidade desenvolvedora de Insurgency tenta manter um contato forte com o público jogando até mesmo partidas juntos com outros jogadores, é possível contatá-los através da Steam caso necessite de algo, o que faz o atendimento ser muito mais rápido e fácil.COMUNIDADE: No sentido da comunidade de jogadores do Insurgency, eu não posso analisar em relação a servidores asiáticos, da Oceania ou africanos, porém a comunide americana (toda a América, não só EUA) e europeia é muito amigável e receptiva (além de muito engraçada, ALLAHU AKBAR), em nenhuma partida que joguei consegui testemunhar atos que prejudicassem o gameplay de outros (como abusar do canal de voz, canal de texto, ou matar a própria equipe com intenção). O jogo permite que a comunidade poste Mods na workshop para diversificar e deixar o jogo com maior estilo do jogador assim como preferir.			"

												Let me just start off by saying that I have played every FPS under the sun. All the CODs, all the BFs, All the Medal of Honors, all of the Counterstrikes, all of the $5 Big Lots bargain bin shooters, and NONE of them can come even close to capturing the ugly reality of the Afghanistan/Iraq style of combat that we have today. This game does it perfectly. If you watch helmet cam footage, of modern combat, you can see the similarities. For an Indie game, I was very impressed. My favorite for sure. Brutally hard, realistic weapons physics. What more could you ask for? 11/10			"

												Pros:-The game makes you tense.-Guns are well balanced-Damage model is realistic. It is a two shot kill at the most for every gun. (it's a pro if you like those kind of damage models.)-Grenade spam is non-existant.-People work with their team often.-finding servers is easy.-When you ADS the scope itself zooms in and not the outside of the scope.-Game CAN be played on older hardware.-Nice selection of graphics options.-HUD is minimal (the only thing that shows up on screen is where the objactives are.-You must rely on sounds of gun shots and foot steps to out smart your enemy.Cons:-Grenades are not very effective it most situations.-If you do not know the maps you will be killed often.-Co-op bots are not the greatest sometimes. They can seem to have aimbot. Or just be really stupid.-Co-op does not give you very many respawns unless you are playing checkpoint.-Some people can be a jerk to you when you make a bad descision.-There is no match making that allows you to play with lower skilled players.-No unlocking weapons or anything like that.-Graphics are not the greatest as it is running on the source engine.-Key bindings can sometimes clear themselves and not work when you are rebinding a key, or reopening the game.Summary:This game is great overall for the price! Humble Bundle boosted the games popularity and made it so much easier to find servers. i have 23 hours into the game as of this review. and I play this game often! It is a great FPS that beats CoD and Battlefield. My major complaint it there is no skill based match making, as it makes it difficult for new players to get a feel for the games mechanics. Do I reccomend this game? ABSOLUTLY YES!			"

												I would like to start this review saying that this game is exceedingly difficult. Whether you are playing Co-op, or multiplayer. It requires a lot of attention, ""game sense"", and also some previous first person experiences. Even then, for your first 1-3 hours, you will rack up very few kills. But be patient, and you will pull through. It is amazing value for money, with a ton of gamemodes to choose from, including checkpoint, which is where you move through a map, neutralising enemy forces, capturing points and destroying weapon caches. Yet there are a few gripes I would like to warn you about.1) The character models. This is not massively annoying, but they seem a little dated. I would like it if they were improved to CSGO standard, or even better.2)The superhuman AI. The AI in this game are very good. So good infact, that they can see you through a bush, in the middle of the night, without a torch or nightvision. I have been playing some of the survival missions (capture points to respawn allies, try and survive) at night, and have discovered that they are nearly unplayable as you cannot sneak down the edges of the maps, or take down AI from behind with a knife, or be stealthy at all. It is almost as if they have wall hacks.3. ""Phantom Bullets"". This is a rather big thing that annoys me greatly. If you are at point blank range, and empty a pistol clip into your opponents body, they will sometimes just shoot you in the face with a machine gun after. It is almost as if you miss all the shots, or they go though the body of your enemy and inflict no damage. I have lost many rounds like this, and is very annoying.Yet there are many great features of this game too.1) Realism. This is a super realistic game. You die from 1, sometimes 2 shots from an assault rifle, and 1, sometimes 3 shots of a pistol. It is a very tough game, and doesn't hold your hand through it at all. 2) Maps. The maps for this game are amazing. They are detailed, large, different from eachother, and support getting to objectives in multiple different ways. Not only this, but they are beautiful, with snow falling, dust being kicked up, buckled cars lying around. They are truly something to admire3)Being Immersive. It's an immensly immersive game, which many fans of it will likely point out. It is as close to a real firefight as I want to get, yet it does it well. 4)Suppression. Have you ever seen in a movie when the protagonist is about to look over a piece of cover, when bullets fly over his head and he ducks back down again? This is called suppressing fire, and this game has a very nice suppression engine. Similar to the one in Verdun (another of my favourite games), when bullets fly past you, you flinch a little bit, and your screen goes a bit blurry and grey tinted. It adds realism to the game, and that is the reason why you should save up £11, and buy it. I would reccomend it to any gamer, but if you have no prior FPS experience, then this probably isnt a good starting point.			"

This is like CS:GO but with missions like bring the ViP to a safe place that is my fav mode.The realism is above other tactical fps games ive been trying out - and with the new night maps where u can either choose to blind close by enemys with ur flashlight or use Night Vision Googles takes this game to hole new level!!If u like games where voice communication is a ""must"" to complete tactical movement...Then this is absolutely the game for you!!!Beware that the movement of your char is a different from CS:GO and takes 1-2 days to get into....but when you master the controlling then you can start living yourself 110% into the game.Voice is turned on auto with push to talk and you can communicate in both lobby and in-game.

I got killed too much by it XD-please use it wisely , use it when there is a group of enemies for example . Dont use it if there's only one enemy ahead .-if u want to destroy caches that's in a building  , DON'T USE RPG !! Because if u use RPG u'll commit suicide .I'm writing this because everytime i play multiplayer , i got killed by my teammate because he/she is too clumsy XD .

												This game is fantastic!!!!! In COD, people would brag about they're ""MLG 360-no scopes"" or spawn killing.But when they step into Insurgency, they cant brag about anything cuz u need ur team, teamwork is incredibly important in this game, and it teaches u to play with ur teamates and respect them rather that just go in guns blazing and then shower ur self in self-pride. Insurgency provivdes realistic gameplay of how a team of military personel help each other, and u will need to form creative tactic along the way. I will put emphasis on ""teamwork', and ur wit and quick thinking. It does not matter if ur incredibly good in COD ( except for the fact if ur a good shot) u WILL need ur team and ur thinking to win, and of course ur gun.... FOR me, i give it a 10/10			"

												This game is an awesome time. It can appeal to many types of players with the different game modes, especially with the WIP Co-Op mode which is already fun as it is for a group of friends. The gun play is very nice, no 'headshot lotto' type gameplay as aiming for the chest you will find more success.After the last update I felt the need to write this, also as it's become so close to release. It is still yet an undiscovered gem by most of the masses, and I truly hope that will change soon. The Developers cleary want this game to succeed, going by the change log alone you can see this. Almost every concern I had with the game was crushed by the latest update, and although I'm not giving them praise as the best shooter to ever hit the market - they are well on their way to make a name for themselves as a company who actually cares about the players.Great to hop on and go rambo in a sustained match, or an axiety filled tactical clan match where around every corner could be a bullet through your skull. See you on the field!			"

												I would want to start off by stating that Insurgency is the first multiplayer FPS game that I appreciate playing- yes, I played Counter Strike (via LAN with friends) but the physics, gameplay, and game mechanics does not meet my liking; same with Call of Duty, I like the single player mode but I do not like most of the game's multiplayer mechanics where you apply perks, radar tracking, unrealistic humam speed (considering weight from all the gears) and things like that.In Insurgency, you get to play like real men. Tactical and hands-on to say the least. You get to the action or you are done for. Physics are great, mechanics are realistic - no perks, bonuses or any BS like such. You play fairly with other players with basic loadout options given to you and balanced gear management where YOUR SKILL is your best edge.If you want realistic FPS combat, buy this game.Keyword would be REALISTIC.11/10, I don't see my self stopping to play anytime soon.

												How does one start with a game like Insurgency. It is amazing. The game is unique, taking aspects from other games and forming its own distinctive game. The realness in the game make you, the player, feel like you are there in combat. From the depth in weapons (more weapons will be added in the future), to the structure for each class, this games stands on its own legs. I highly recommend Insurgency for any player.However, it does take a while to get used to. With its uniqueness comes a period of multiple deaths over and over. You need to get used to it to excel.

												First Impressions:Certainly a more hardcore experience than say, the ""Battlefield"" games.  There are no hit indicators, nor can you see how many bullets are left inside your current mag.  This game is heavily focused on multiplayer, though there is a practice mode where you can play against bots.  I had a relatively good time with the bots as I'm not big on multiplayer.  I picked this up for a dollar during a Humble Bundle sale and don't regret the purchase.  I would be interested to see if there is a co-op vs bots mode, though I haven't seen anything on the main menu that allows me to do that.  Feel free to leave a comment if you folks happen to know how to set that up.

Some things that need to be fixed is hitboxes on enviroment, getting caught on the doorways and the enviroments at times, also better Workshop intergration E.X. sound file replacements you have to type snd_restart (or reset) into console upon startup to get it to play the custom sound files			"

												I would like to start this review saying that this game is exceedingly difficult. Whether you are playing Co-op, or multiplayer. It requires a lot of attention, ""game sense"", and also some previous first person experiences. Even then, for your first 1-3 hours, you will rack up very few kills. But be patient, and you will pull through. It is amazing value for money, with a ton of gamemodes to choose from, including checkpoint, which is where you move through a map, neutralising enemy forces, capturing points and destroying weapon caches. Yet there are a few gripes I would like to warn you about.1) The character models. This is not massively annoying, but they seem a little dated. I would like it if they were improved to CSGO standard, or even better.2)The superhuman AI. The AI in this game are very good. So good infact, that they can see you through a bush, in the middle of the night, without a torch or nightvision. I have been playing some of the survival missions (capture points to respawn allies, try and survive) at night, and have discovered that they are nearly unplayable as you cannot sneak down the edges of the maps, or take down AI from behind with a knife, or be stealthy at all. It is almost as if they have wall hacks.3. ""Phantom Bullets"". This is a rather big thing that annoys me greatly. If you are at point blank range, and empty a pistol clip into your opponents body, they will sometimes just shoot you in the face with a machine gun after. It is almost as if you miss all the shots, or they go though the body of your enemy and inflict no damage. I have lost many rounds like this, and is very annoying.Yet there are many great features of this game too.1) Realism. This is a super realistic game. You die from 1, sometimes 2 shots from an assault rifle, and 1, sometimes 3 shots of a pistol. It is a very tough game, and doesn't hold your hand through it at all. 2) Maps. The maps for this game are amazing. They are detailed, large, different from eachother, and support getting to objectives in multiple different ways. Not only this, but they are beautiful, with snow falling, dust being kicked up, buckled cars lying around. They are truly something to admire3)Being Immersive. It's an immensly immersive game, which many fans of it will likely point out. It is as close to a real firefight as I want to get, yet it does it well. 4)Suppression. Have you ever seen in a movie when the protagonist is about to look over a piece of cover, when bullets fly over his head and he ducks back down again? This is called suppressing fire, and this game has a very nice suppression engine. Similar to the one in Verdun (another of my favourite games), when bullets fly past you, you flinch a little bit, and your screen goes a bit blurry and grey tinted. It adds realism to the game, and that is the reason why you should save up £11, and buy it. I would reccomend it to any gamer, but if you have no prior FPS experience, then this probably isnt a good starting point.			"

												Let me just start off by saying that I have played every FPS under the sun. All the CODs, all the BFs, All the Medal of Honors, all of the Counterstrikes, all of the $5 Big Lots bargain bin shooters, and NONE of them can come even close to capturing the ugly reality of the Afghanistan/Iraq style of combat that we have today. This game does it perfectly. If you watch helmet cam footage, of modern combat, you can see the similarities. For an Indie game, I was very impressed. My favorite for sure. Brutally hard, realistic weapons physics. What more could you ask for? 11/10			"

												Pros:-The game makes you tense.-Guns are well balanced-Damage model is realistic. It is a two shot kill at the most for every gun. (it's a pro if you like those kind of damage models.)-Grenade spam is non-existant.-People work with their team often.-finding servers is easy.-When you ADS the scope itself zooms in and not the outside of the scope.-Game CAN be played on older hardware.-Nice selection of graphics options.-HUD is minimal (the only thing that shows up on screen is where the objactives are.-You must rely on sounds of gun shots and foot steps to out smart your enemy.Cons:-Grenades are not very effective it most situations.-If you do not know the maps you will be killed often.-Co-op bots are not the greatest sometimes. They can seem to have aimbot. Or just be really stupid.-Co-op does not give you very many respawns unless you are playing checkpoint.-Some people can be a jerk to you when you make a bad descision.-There is no match making that allows you to play with lower skilled players.-No unlocking weapons or anything like that.-Graphics are not the greatest as it is running on the source engine.-Key bindings can sometimes clear themselves and not work when you are rebinding a key, or reopening the game.Summary:This game is great overall for the price! Humble Bundle boosted the games popularity and made it so much easier to find servers. i have 23 hours into the game as of this review. and I play this game often! It is a great FPS that beats CoD and Battlefield. My major complaint it there is no skill based match making, as it makes it difficult for new players to get a feel for the games mechanics. Do I reccomend this game? ABSOLUTLY YES!			"

												Insurgency. Should you buy it? Short answer: Definitely. For those interested in knowing why, read on...In a time where modern shooters are a dime-a-dozen, it can be very difficult for a company to break the trend and still be successful. The reason is simple - a company needs to make money. Hardcore games, generally speaking, will never make as much money as mainstream games. You'd be insane to believe that. So, when a game like Insurgency comes along, claiming to provide the hardcore feel, the gritty realism, the (actually) competent AI, it's easy to dismiss as a title that will enjoy some brief limelight, only to disappear into the ether moments later.Insurgency is not one of these titles. Enemy players and AI bots alike, will strike you down with fierce determination time and time again. You will forget to reload at the worst possible time. You will attempt to hip-fire a machine gun, and die. You will try to sprint from cover to take an objective, and die. You will try CoD moves, and die. You will try BF4 tactics.... and die. You will quickly be perforated if you don't carefully round each and every corner. Death will come swiftly and frequently.You will curse yourself for failing your team, and swear to be better the next time.You will learn.You will fire deliberate and aimed shots. You will fire accurate bursts. You will move quickly and precisely. You will conserve your ammunition. You will communicate. You will become one with your team. You will coordinate your assaults. You will master any role you are assigned to. You will listen. You will watch. You will take your objective with real tactics. You will survive.You will succeed. In a game like Insurgency, victory never feels hollow. You will always feel like you earned it. I give Insurgency 9.5/10.You will win.			"

												Great game. Similar to Arma, though some say it's comparable to CS:GO. If I'm in a more realistic mood rather than arcade, Insurgency is great for that. Now the game isn't THAT realistic compared to others like Arma, but relative to CS:GO, it has a much more realism to it.The game is being constantly updated and keeps getting better.-Downloading community made wep skins and snd skins is a MUST. It allows you to customize the looks of the game according to your tastes. The community consistently provides more options and there is already a wide range of things to pick from. Definitely recommending this a less expensive alternative to CS:GO with a more realistic feel to it.			"

												I haven't been so excited while playing an First Person Shooter in a long time. This is because unlike other games on the market offering lots of niche features, Insurgency excels because it has fantastic gameplay that is both tactical and intense. Insurgency feels more complex than it actually is thanks to some well thought out map design and modes to boot, in both Player vs. Player and Co-operative modes. There is never a moment where I have thought the game was unbalanced and that's thanks to the Classes and Supply systems. Squads (usually 2 per team, consisting of around 8 players) consists of one of each class, with the exception of sometimes 2 Riflemen/Fighters (straight up assault rifles, pistols and grenades), so you won't get a whole team of Sniper classes not playing the objectives or Demolition classes constantly RPG-ing from afar. Weapons feel lethal as it takes about 1-2 body shots to take someone down (3+ if your lucky, usually when you get shot in the legs or through cover) and explosives are capable of eliminating an entire team if everyone bunches up (a hard lesson you will learn in Co-op where an Insurgent sees 2 or more of you and takes you all down with one RPG shot, so don't bunch up!). To compliment all this is some great sound design and soundtracks. Guns don't sound limp or synthesized, they are realistic and sound like they can do some real damage. The same goes for explosives and bullets pinging off of nearby walls.This is also one of the best looking games running on the Source engine, looking as good (if not better) than Counter Strike: Global Offensive especially when it comes to weapon models. Great use of lighting for both day and night time scenarios. Only thing I would fault are the character models, which aren't at all bad but could do with some more work as the textures on them look a little flat. There is also mod support through the Steam Workshop, which allows you to make new guns skins/animations/sound packs, levels, characters skins/sound packs and so on which is a great bonus. The game is also regularly updated too with bug fixes and free content such as new maps, modes and more.To summarise: For me, Insurgency gets a lot of things right and I really can't fault it, it's a great package at a great price (I bought it at half price on a free weekend, but at full price it's still very much worth it!). Highly Recommended! Even better with friends!			"

It is simple in its design, meaning:+ Easy UI+ Easy setup of your gear and unit selection+ Beautiful designMy personal favourites to highlight, are especially:+ Awesome graphics and physics+ Massive effects with lots of noise and distortion+ Hammering sounds+ Dynamic but solid gameplayWhat you have to be aware of, when starting this game - considering you were playing other FPS or even come from back in the days when 1.6 was still kickin:+ No crosshair and floating area of your rifles and co+ Very empty HUD - you get a complete new perception of sound and movement+ If you get hit, chances are 9/10 you are biting the dirtSome negatives... not really. Maybe its too addicting.tl;dr: Take cover, supress, stand too close to the window, RPG hits the outside wall, die.			"

												Insurgency is one of the best shooters out there with it's realistic competitive multiplayer that has no crosshair, no ammo indicator (it only shows how many mags are left), and no regenerative health. Co-op is also very fun and challenging, and strongly encourages you not to run and gun, with the AI's ability to damage you quickly. Before starting or while respawning after dealth in a multiplayer or co-op match you can chose your class, customize the optics, type of ammo, attachments, grenades, armor, and other equipment in your loadout. The game limits the amount you're able to have so you have to choose wisely before heading into battle. The game also has night maps, which makes it more difficult to see allowing you to equip night vision or a flashlight that can also help blind enemies. There's a workshop with some nice visual mods, Custom maps, skins, and alternative sfx changes. The game runs fairly smoothly although there is an issue that your anivirus software may mistakingly detect a file in the game as a virus, which has happened to numerous players including me. Pros: +Realistic gunplay and mechanics+Wide variety of modes, each are really fun (there isn't any modes that are boring, they're all really enjoyable)+The co-op is surprisingly challenging too and allows for strategy and planning+Runs mostly smoothly +Steam Workshop for awesome mods and custom maps like a WW2 conversion pack called Day of Infamy, which basically turns the game into a classic WW2 shooter to a zombies mod to Star Wars gun sfx and much more+good balance between weapons and attachmentsCons- Antivirus issue, easy fixOverall, Insurgency is one of the best shooters out there and for $15 it's a must buy and worth every penny IMO. The game is also constantly being updated with maps and tweaks to improve the gameplay. I would highly recomend this game for anyone looking for a good military shooter.			"

												Insurgency is a fast-slow-fast-slow paced millitary game that puts you in the boots of either Insurgents or the Millitary, which come with fun, realistic weaponry and gadgets to fight eachother with.For some reason I suck at online multiplayer sometimes, and that is probably the reason I prefer the co-op gamemodes.YES I SAID CO-OP, THATS RIGHT.Let me SWAN DIVE, INTO THE MYSTICAL REALM OF CO-OPIn co-op you take up to about 8 players on your team for each gamemode, my favourite gamemodes for co-op are:Hunt:You scower the map, defeating enemies stealthfully or guns blazing, destroying objectives as you go. (Objectives are names via the Phonetic alphabet, for those who don't know is Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Echo, Foxtrot, Golf, Hotel, India etc.)and Checkpoint:This gamemode is like hunt, only you capture/destroy an objective, and most of the time there is a counter-attack from the AI team, and you win by capturing/destroying all objectives.One of my friends said before I bought it,""It is like Arma and Counter-Strike mixed together""This, is very accurate I might say.This game is not however like other games with its damage system, if you get shot once or twice, you are dead, kapoot, dood, 死, morto. This is a game totally worth all the praise and money it gets, plus some more.I picked up this game on the Steam Summer Sale 2015.I totally recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun game with their friends or trying to show off their ""SKEELZ"" in online multiplayer.

												An absolutly thrilling FPS. This game takes tactical fps shooters to the next level. With it's realistic damage system, it makes every round, every turn of the corner, and every shot suspensful. I highly recommend this game, especilly for those of you looking for a game that knows when you get hit with a 7.62x54 bullet in the chest...you drop. This game is not for the typical run and gunner, its for that special breed of fps players that like a challenge, and have some patience. This game will blow you away.			"

Quick SummaryA surprisingly amazing realistic indie-FPS that has become quite popular.Purchase Verdict: YesPoints of Interest: -This game focuses on realism. You're not going to be eating bullets, even with heavy armor. You're not going to take precision shots while under fire. You're not going to carry more equipment than humanly possible, every weapon, attachment, and accessory has a weight, where the more weight you have, the slower you move. -Players work as a team, tactically.-The community is actually pretty decent, with many mature people.-Plenty of different gamemodes to keep you busy and match the type of game that you want to play.

												This is a pretty cool game, it is more tactical than counter-strike but not overly tactical like ARMA. Things to note are that there is no ammo or health or radar overlay and that the game supports leaning side to side. Teamwork is OP and rushing in guns blazing will result in expedited termination.

												From being a mod, to finally being standalone; this is a game that went through alot to get where it is now. Game is very stable for just being officaly released a couple of weeks ago. Tactics and team communication is a MUST, if you don't plan on doing that I wouldn't bother picking up the game since you will not be gettin the full experiance. Class systems are very balanced thanks to the new 'supply point' system. Overall this reminds me of Hardcore mode on Call of Duty 4 with more emphasis on team strategy and objectives.			"

												This is a very well made realistic FPS tactical game. It's like a modern version of Red Orchestra/Rising Storm, in the way how the game works, and this game works very well. It has good graphics, awesome game sound, and it runs very smoothly. Here I have an Intel core 2 duo @2.66GHz with GTX550Ti and the game runs very well at 1920x1080. I got this game since it was in early access, and recently I returned to play again. The game evolved so much in about one year since the alpha/beta days, the developers really take care about the game.The coop mode is a guarantee of several hours of fun, even more if you have a clan or play with friends online. The multiplayer mode has several game modes. Stay focus, keep your eyes and ears attention, play with your team, and you get a very nice experience. It's a tactical, hardcore, realistic, challenging and fun game.EDIT: The above review is from april 2014.Now, december 2015, I just want to append:The game developers did, and still do, a very good job.It's getting better and better and better after every update. New maps, new weapons, AI improvements...   it's an amazing work!I still, for sure, recommend this awesome FPS game, I think it's one of the best FPS you can play at this moment. No regrets.			"

												This is probably the best modern warfare FPS on the market. A beautiful blend of Red Orchestra-style realism and Counter-Strike-style environments, this is the hardest and most rewarding tactical shooter I've ever played. You are thrown into a vicious battle with little to no information to aid you (the HUD is very minimal) other than the communication of your team mates.+ High level of realism+ Heart-stopping action+ Good variety of maps and game modes+ Very active dev team, constant updates with new maps/weapons- Graphics aren't the best			"

												Updated Review #2: I feel it's time to revisit the review for Insurgency. The game has progressed quite well since it left Early Access. The game has seen a multitude of free DLC map updates and additions to an already rock solid base of a game.The ambience of the game is fantastic. The sound effects, the maps, the characters, and music all culminate into a perfect blend of FPS goodness.NWI clearly has taken pride behind their work and has kept forward with it's ideas for it's game to keep it fresh and rewarding. I can't recommend this game enough as it's one of the best purchases on Steam that comes to mind.Updated Review: I would say this is perhaps one of the best FPS purchases I've ever made. If you are a FPS fan you need to give this a chance and find out why Insurgency is awesome. The studio behind this game clearly had a vision and has supported this game since launch with A+ content updates.Original review: Insurgency is a fantastic source FPS shooter that thrives on realism, teamwork, sensical, and most importantly tactical based gameplay. It's a blast, it looks good, the asking price is a fraction of what most FPS games charge out of the gate, and it's an absolute steal at their 14.99 asking price.With a thoughtful system of each side having set open types of players who have a limited option of weapons that can be adjusted with attachments, secondary firearms, accessories, and points that determine what you'll be able to have and not have the game doesn't let everyone run rampant with the same setups. Each person has meaning to their side and there's none of that over the top arcadey FPS stuff here with streaks for assists and kills.It's what I've wanted for a long time in a shooter and if you have found enjoyment with Red Ochestra 2 and/or Rising Storm this may be right down your alley.

												Update: Revision pending, stay tuned.---This game is what a tactical shooter should be, or at least, one of the best currently on the market. First and foremost, it is well polished. Glitchs and bugs do exist, nevertheless, NWI was quick address these issues and the game currently has few problems that drastically distort gameplay. Second of all are its graphics, audio and animations; the aesthetic experince. Insurgency is a source-based indie game with one developer in each of the above areas. Don't expect Crysis/Metro level visuals here, or soundtracks performed by a professional orchestra. However, despite the mediocre looks and audios, the game feels nice and alive, which is good comparing to most indie titles. The best of all lies in its gameplay. Insurgency certainly has taken its cue from classic tactical shooters such as SWAT, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six, and their modern counter-parts such as Red Orchestra. This is not a game of action and recklessness, but with that said, you still experince heart-pounding frontline combat. I have to say that no matter how realistic Insurgency is, it is still a FPS game in its core. Unlike ARMA and other ""combat simulators"", Insurgency has traditional domination/CTF/demolition based gamemodes and mostly common fps controls. Some may dislike those elements as non-immersive, I personally find it quite easy to adapt to and doesn't require much adjustments from other shooters.Even if all of that doesn't appeal to you, it can't hurt to try. The game is only $15 regularly and $10 to $5 on discount. If you don't like it, consider you pocket change spent on a new experince.---TL;DRYou can slide up stairs. 10/10			"

												Holy fantastic!  Just got this game and I must say that I have had quite the unique experience (in a good way)!  First of all, the pace of the game, although it's a first person shooter, is a bit slow, however, that is a welcomed change to what has become the norm in the FPS genre.  Secondly, the fact that bullets are actually DEADLY makes you value your character's life a tad more, thus leading to increased cooperation in order to sustain that life.  So far every single server that I have joined has had more than enough players who make use of the mic in order to plan out and execute full squad plays, eg, covering areas X, Y, and Z while the VIP sprints from cover to cover, slowly creeping his way towards the escape vehicle.  The feelings of tension rise often in this game as you may come to realize that the walkies have gone awefully quiet halfway through a round.  Peeking at the scoreboard, you notice that your squad is wiped and that it is up to you to destroy a hidden weapon cache in under one minute.  Overall, thanks to the unique fps experience, communicative teammates, and awesome (IMHO) map design, Insurgency provides for a great tactical FPS experience that does not dissappoint (unless you're an impatient little ♥♥♥♥♥).  Overall Score: 8/10Reasoning:  -Texture quality isn't the greatest, but hey, it's the Source engine.-Sprinting feels a bit clunky which can be problematic in a tactical FPS.-Still earlyish in development (game just released yesterday [Jan 22nd]) so this score is subject to change.

												Tactical, competative, slower paced shooter that is a little more realistic. You are not a bullet sponge. You are not Rambo. If you get shot, you're going down. There is no regening health here. Insurgency has its roots as a mod, and even back then it was awesome. This release improves upon all it's elements and it's definitely a more hardcore experiance meant for veteran FPS players that like to work as a team. The game modes make sense to the theme of the game and feel more like proper mission objectives than the standard. And the gun play feels very good, which is probably the most important thing. Hands down, it's a lot of fun.			"

												This game is the earliest sumprise of this year. At the first sight, it looks like every other multiplayer FPS. But truth is behind its action cover. Missions are unique and entertaining. Unforgiving RO tactics : one shot - one kill make game challenging and full of adrenaline. You must think like a enemy and overthink him to win. Coop is nice bonus to practice your skill. I found only two downfalls: bad AI and unexplained crashing. Anyway, this game is amazing and i am calling it black horse of 2014 in FPS gaming.			"

												Insurgency is the ultimate hardcore PvE and PvP shooter ! This is not a game. This is an infantry simulation. The closest to real urban war experience you can live from a seat ! No mini-map. Mini-map is convenient but so unrealistic. Here you have to watch where your friends are. Don’t shoot them ! They look so much like the enemy. And no crosshair when you don’t aim. Like in real life.Insurgency is about realism. That gives a unique sense of immersion. Sounds and graphics are… realistic. Not beautiful but true.Price is low, another good point.So what’s wrong ? Why is Insurgency not more famous ? Because there is nothing to do except achievements. PvE has no campaign. And missions don’t unlock anything, don’t give any reward, grind, nothing ! PvP ? No ranking. Developers are going to implement it. In modern PvP, matchmaking and ranking are a must-have. Not only for glory but more importantly because it ensures you battle vs players of your level. So that combat is fair and tense.Once the game is more mature, it will enjoy a great success ! "

												This game is more fun than i thought it'd be.At first you will probably die many, many times, since this game is very much different than other FPS games. I hated the game back then and regretted the purchase. After the new patch was released i gave the game another chance to convince me, and it did.You have to play carefully, your life has such a value in every match. I like games which are going more towards realism than plain action and countless 'splosions all over the place. Not that i don't these kind of shooters, i for one play Battlefield 4 a lot but Insurgency is a more adrenaline-filled and strategic alternative.Many people describe it as a mix of Counter Strike, Battlefield and Red Orchesta, and i fully agree on that.I recommend this game to anyone who wants a realistic modern combat experience. It's definetly worth the money.			"

												Tactical, competative, slower paced shooter that is a little more realistic. You are not a bullet sponge. You are not Rambo. If you get shot, you're going down. There is no regening health here. Insurgency has its roots as a mod, and even back then it was awesome. This release improves upon all it's elements and it's definitely a more hardcore experiance meant for veteran FPS players that like to work as a team. The game modes make sense to the theme of the game and feel more like proper mission objectives than the standard. And the gun play feels very good, which is probably the most important thing. Hands down, it's a lot of fun.			"

												Like the mod but with tons of more fun and action.It's no Call of Duty where you can run and gun, you have to have patience and watch your every corner. This game really reminds me of Battlefield and almost feels like a better version of it(no vehicles or silly ammo/health kits to throw around)I absolutely loved the mod and was sad to see the population slowly die. With the release of it as a game on it's own I've been wanting it every day since it came out and the Humble Bundle was just what I was waiting for.The ONLY issue I've had with this game comes from when I alt+tab and come back in to lag(which happens in a lot of games) but this is easily fixed if you set your launch options to ""-windowed -noborder"".I rate this 9/10			"

												Holy fantastic!  Just got this game and I must say that I have had quite the unique experience (in a good way)!  First of all, the pace of the game, although it's a first person shooter, is a bit slow, however, that is a welcomed change to what has become the norm in the FPS genre.  Secondly, the fact that bullets are actually DEADLY makes you value your character's life a tad more, thus leading to increased cooperation in order to sustain that life.  So far every single server that I have joined has had more than enough players who make use of the mic in order to plan out and execute full squad plays, eg, covering areas X, Y, and Z while the VIP sprints from cover to cover, slowly creeping his way towards the escape vehicle.  The feelings of tension rise often in this game as you may come to realize that the walkies have gone awefully quiet halfway through a round.  Peeking at the scoreboard, you notice that your squad is wiped and that it is up to you to destroy a hidden weapon cache in under one minute.  Overall, thanks to the unique fps experience, communicative teammates, and awesome (IMHO) map design, Insurgency provides for a great tactical FPS experience that does not dissappoint (unless you're an impatient little ♥♥♥♥♥).  Overall Score: 8/10Reasoning:  -Texture quality isn't the greatest, but hey, it's the Source engine.-Sprinting feels a bit clunky which can be problematic in a tactical FPS.-Still earlyish in development (game just released yesterday [Jan 22nd]) so this score is subject to change.

												Insurgency is the ultimate hardcore PvE and PvP shooter ! This is not a game. This is an infantry simulation. The closest to real urban war experience you can live from a seat ! No mini-map. Mini-map is convenient but so unrealistic. Here you have to watch where your friends are. Don’t shoot them ! They look so much like the enemy. And no crosshair when you don’t aim. Like in real life.Insurgency is about realism. That gives a unique sense of immersion. Sounds and graphics are… realistic. Not beautiful but true.Price is low, another good point.So what’s wrong ? Why is Insurgency not more famous ? Because there is nothing to do except achievements. PvE has no campaign. And missions don’t unlock anything, don’t give any reward, grind, nothing ! PvP ? No ranking. Developers are going to implement it. In modern PvP, matchmaking and ranking are a must-have. Not only for glory but more importantly because it ensures you battle vs players of your level. So that combat is fair and tense.Once the game is more mature, it will enjoy a great success ! "

			Insurgency: Impressions In this video take a look at the tactical shooter ""Insurgency"". The indie love child of Counter Strike.		

This is my video Impressions of Insurgency.The game is pretty damn good for $15. It has a lot of depth and very deliberate in how you tackle each mission. It's not a run and gun, rather it's slower pace and more team oriented. If you're more of tactics type of player, you might enjoy the game.In my video I show an example of it's game play, I go into the mechanics of the game, and talk about what makes the game worth it's asking price.

												If you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients- To Make the Dough375 grams (3 cups) plain flour1/2 teaspoon salt2 eggs1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) waterExtra flour for dusting - To Make Cheese Filling15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.1/2 cup cheddar cheese2 eggs, lightly beaten1/2 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon pepper- ExtrasYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)Parmesan cheeseBasilFried vegetablesShrimpFish slicesChicken pieces Make the Ravioli filling.- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough.- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!

												Insurgency is a more tactical and ""realistic"" first-person shooter than other titles such as Battlefield or Call of Duty. It is heavily focused on infantry combat in many maps varying from close quarters firefights to long range shootouts. The game forces players to play more cautiously and those who rush out impatiently will die more often. Playing Coop Mode with a full squad of friends is very enjoyable. Community is generally more welcoming to newcomers as well. Definitely would recommend.			"

												I play this FPS game in co-op checkpoint mode, and I'm really enjoying it. It's definately a team-based game, where communication amongst teammates is a must. The aim is to capture or destroy points, and sometimes hold for a possible counter-attack from the AI enemy. It's quite an intensive, more realistic game, and not like other military shooters that I've played (eg CoD). The game is open to the community and many custom maps can be added to provide variety. I highly recommend this game.			"

												It's time to play Insurgency.Insurgency ist ein taktischer und langsamer Hardcoreegshooter der auf der Half Life engine basiert.Eigentlich ist es ein Half Life Mod aber nun wurde er eigenständig gemacht.Mal abgesehen von der zweckmäßigen Grafik, vermittelt er den Krieg zwischen der USA und irgendwelchen Terroristen sehr gut.Vorallem die intensiven Stellungskämpfe vermittelln eine sehr schweren Eindruck da man auch nicht viel aushällt.Nach Ein bis Zwei Kugeln sieht man die Welt nicht mehr.Im Ausrüstungsmenü kann man sich dann für eine bessere Waffe und bessere Aufsätze entscheiden, aber auch für eine bessere Kevlarweste oder für eine bessere Munitionsweste. Die Waffenmodells sehen sehr gut aus. Vorallem wenn man Aufsätze hat sind manche in der Waffe gleich vearbeitet. Auf der Spielerischen Seite ist Insurgency für Anfänger sehr schwer, da man am Anfang oft stirbt und es bis zum Respawn dauert, sollte man dich etwas zu lesen oder zu essen mitbringen, damit es nicht zu langweilig wird. Insurgency hat eine sehr leichte Steuerung und es gibt nix was ein anderer Shooter auch hat. Man kann sich um Ecken lehnen oder auch ähnliches.Insurgency hat keine hohen Anforderungen deswegen sollte es auf jedem PC gut laufen.Ich mit mein 7 std.

												This game really deserves some attention. If you are looking for a solid old school coop fps, this may be the game for you. No crosshair, no health regen, no kill confirmation, no grindy leveling system, friendly fire on (default). The approach is realistic but it's not a sim. Firing rpg or triggering a c4 explosion will get you killed if you don't use them carefully.Focusing on the coop part of the game, you will face unforgiving AI that will throw at you frag, smoke nades and will try to flank you. Speaking about the hardest settings, you may argue with me that AI bots seem like aimbotting but it's just what skilled players would do. If you don't pull the trigger first, they will. Maps are pretty intense and require teamwork, patience and tactical approach. No lonewolf rambo would survive much long here. There is also a nice radial menu to communicate with your team vital info without the use of a mic, which is not required but recommended. This game reminds me a bit of the first Ghost Recon. To me this game is already worth full money for only the coop experience, not to mention that it will get steamworks support.About pvp multiplayer i cannot say much since i didn't play it enough, though the couple of games i played felt good to me. There are like 6 different pvp modes to accomodate most of tastes: some single life modes and some with respawns. There is still no pure team deathmatch but it would not fit this game because it relies on objectives you have to accomplish with your team.			"

The game keeps fine balance between high authencity and high-paced action.Minimal HUD, no hit-markers and lack of kill-confirmation makes firefights intense and realistic, while objective-based gameplay never force you to lie in the corner for 15 minutes without any action.Cooperative mode could strike you as too ""arcady"" for this type of game, but it still fun and a great way for new players to get acustomed with game.If you aren't easily frustrated with dying from nowhere, this game is deffinitely worth it's money.

												Realistic shooter that you can enjoy anytime even for short durations, unlike Arma.More casual though. Still great fun.On a side note.Insurgency players love Trump! Recieved a total of 21 messages of support from in game chat and voice chat and only 2 insults from liberals!10/10 would hold Trump rally in server again!			"

												That's one great multiplayer tactical shooter. The game keeps fine balance between high authencity and high-paced action.Minimal HUD, no hit-markers and lack of kill-confirmation makes firefights intense and realistic, while objective-based gameplay never force you to lie in the corner for 15 minutes without any action.Cooperative mode could strike you as too ""arcady"" for this type of game, but it still fun and a great way for new players to get acustomed with game.If you aren't easily frustrated with dying from nowhere, this game is deffinitely worth it's money.

												Quite frankly, this may be the most fun I've ever had in a shooter.  Maybe I'm exaggerating, but I remember the first time I played split-screen on Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.  That game introduced fresh gameplay into the FPS market, and as much as CoD-style gameplay is hated today, it was undeniably fresh and original at the time.  It was an experience unlike any other for me.  Unfortunately, that game's novelty wore off quickly as installment after installment copied and pasted.Insurgency, like Modern Warfare 2, has caught my attention by introducing FRESH gameplay that I have never experienced before.  It goes in the opposite direction of MW2, though, contrasting the saturated CoD-clone market with slow-paced and weighty combat.So, to sum up what makes this game so good in two words:  Innovative and Mechanical.Allow me to first elaborate on the innovative features that Insurgency has introduced.  First off, the free-aim system.  It's cool.  REALLY cool.  You have no crosshair.  Instead, there is a small deadzone in the center of the screen.  The initial minute movements of your mouse in any direction turn your gun that way, only minimally affecting camera position, and once you have moved your gun far enough to one side of the screen, you begin to turn.  So, instead of hip-firing with a crosshair that guestimates where your shots may land, you do the guestimation yourself.  You move the gun to where it looks like it may be pointing at the enemy, and you pull the trigger.  Not only does this add a feeling of control to hipfire (and really, it's astounding how real this makes the hipfire feel; it feels and looks exactly like what you would do if you panicked in a paintball war.), but it makes movement very fluid and realistic.Now, that is one innovative feature.  I felt compelled to write a paragraph on it because I have seen nothing like it.  I'll try to be shorter with the rest.  A fluid leaning system using Q and E for left and right respectively.  A sliding system that, unlike call-of-duty sliding, is useful for moving to cover from a sticky situation, but realistically ineffective for rambo-killing.  Bullet penetration systems (armor piercing and higher-caliber ammo will go through certain surfaces that other ammo/calibers will not; you can hit people through walls if your bullet can pierce them.).  Intricate player damage (and I'll touch on this later).  Body armor systems.  Serious depth in attachment choices, and they really affect gameplay.  A silencer in this game is useful for different reasons than most games; your flash is suppressed and it's harder to tell where you're coming from.  No minimap concealment needed, because in this game, you use your senses to spot the enemy.  And seriously, this may be the first game I have ever played where not only is a smoke grenade useful, but often I may prefer it to other grenades, as it allows you to change position and surprise your enemies.Now, the mechanical side of the game.  Mainly what I'm talking about here is the graphics and audio combined, as odd as it seems, because they are MECHANICAL.  And it's awesome.  Contrary to what most people say, the graphics are amazing simply because they so accurately represent mechanical aspects of the game.  A real suppression system; your vision blurs on the edges, doesn't affect your aim like battlefield.  Just shakes you up and reduces your awareness.  The body damage.  An armored vest being hit results in an impact sound and a smoke puff, while a bullet hitting an unarmored body/body part results in a bloody wound.  Bullets coming overhead are intense, from the whizzing sound, to the relentless sparking fury of M249 shells hitting the wall behind you, to the splintering wood and hail of bullets of an SMG firing at you through the wooden floor you stand on, to the angry, distraught yelling of your soldier as a bullet pierces his vest.If you're debating whether or not you should buy it: this game is for people who want a fresh shooter.  People who don't play just to kill everyone.  People who appreciate depth, tactics, and more depth in a shooter.  I'll be playing this for a long time.  Much like Chivalry: Medieval Warfare has absorbed me with deep mechanics that I have never seen, and now love so much,  I am infatuated with this new brand of gameplay.  You don't progress by earning a new gun; rather, you pick up tips as you go, and it will soon feel as though you have ""leveled up"".  Once you grasp the tactical gameplay, you quickly become both skilled and absorbed.			"

												I was very pesimistic about it when I first saw it on kickstarter, but some very   nice user videos came out recently so i became more and more interested into trying this game.Just got it during the steam sale, only 5 hrs played so far but i really like it, wish there were more FPSs with 3D VOIP, it's such an awesome feature ! graphics and sound  are very high quality, so immersive, the gunfire the soundscape the bullet cracks .... you name it !  razer surround + 5.1 audio setting works excellent on a pair of  quality stereo headphones, you can soundwh()re people so easily in this game,  it's not even funny !

Did I also mention that the graphics are very good for  a 9yr old  engine ?? :D There is no peristent weapon unlocks / attachments bullcrap, all you have to do it is take it slow and use the terrain to your advantage.Spawn camping is  very not  effective anymore because the game forces you to lower your weapons when you approach the attacker's zone, plus it's very easy to supress the enemy so he can't see♥♥♥♥♥♥:D I don't remember the mod  to feature supression nor crouch  sliding ( really cool ! ) here's the very first steam  player guide

												Insurgency is the best FPS out there as the combat is really intense, filled with brick ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ - monitor punching action which never ends. You could be steamrolling your way through an area, just to walk around a corner and be met by a squad of Insurgents with RPK's and AK74's, or your squad may capture a control point in a market shop - only to be dispatched of quickly by an enemy RPG or F1 Grenade.Test your skills in combat, most weapons kill in 1-2 bullets, checking your corners and watching your angle's is a big part of the game - if you're not careful you could be caught off guard and all it takes is a fraction of a second to make a deadly mistake.I'm an Insurgency mod veteran and I find this game to be as good as the mod - If not better!

												The finest tactical shooter game I have ever played.  Almost 400 hours in and I can easily see myself putting in another 400.  Despite being a relatively small, low budget project, Insurgency does many things better than triple A titles such as Battlefield.  The no-scope mechanic is a personal favorite of mine, where getting hip fire kills actually relies on skill instead of luck.  The suppression is insane, and while the graphics aren't top of the line, they are very playable.  The fire effects are simply beatiful.  Sound is immersive, combat is intense and damage is brutal, the grenade mechanics are unmatched (I mean, where else can you pull the pin and leave in the spoon for worry free cooking?), and the overall experience is simply amazing.  I have nothing but good things to say about Insurgency.  And with steam workshop, you can mod it in whatever way you desire, from the comprehensive World War 2 mod Day of Infamy to the classic Allahu Akbar Soundmod.  Finest $5 I ever spent.			"

												Absolutely brilliant game. It has nice tactical gameplay without getting too slow or complicated.What makes this game unique compared to other shooters are the gamemodes. You have many well balaced gamemodes, like VIP, or search and destroy, who are easy to understand and force the players to play as a team.This game offers a lot more than it cost.If it helps someone for the decision, I usually play: Rainbox Six Ravenshield, Arma Series, Swat4, Natural Selection and Red Orchstra.

												Imagine... Red Orchestra 2 and Battlefield had a child. That would be Insurgency. Insurgency is a highly realistic modern shooter that shines through it's simple, yet effective gameplay basics. Choose a class, invest x points into your weapons, attachements and equipement, spawn into the game, follow the objective. No unnecessary hud, no unlockables, no levels, nothing. Just pure multiplayer fun. Having various different gamemodes in both, PvP and PvE, every kind of audience will be able to enjoy the game. Defending against waves of enemies, pushing through their lines, fighting players in close combat, simulating warfare in cities - there are countless options. The customization is a bigbig plus. You can adjust every class to your needs - some better than others, but all are very versatile. A huge range of weapons (AK, M4, Mosin Nagant, Revolver, M14, AKu, Mp40, ...) and a bunch of attachements liek red dots, silencer, grips etc. allow you to choose what fits you best. The gunplay is highly realistic. High recoil, high damage and a properly working cover system make gunfights very fun! The steam workshop is very active in creating lots and lots of skins to use for your guns - free of charge. Want something different? Go get it! Overall: Recommended. Insurgency is a game for people who enjoy hardcore PvE / PvP fights and can adapt to situations well. This is not a game for Call of Duty fans or alike - Casuals better stay away.			"

												This game can easily compete with the top FPS games out today.It is geared towards squad based gameplay and is set on a 'Hardcore' setting.It has a fresh gamemode that is similar to domination fused with search and destroy.It is similar to Red Orchestra, with modern warfare elements.The bullet hit is dead on; rarely have I been cheated out of a kill due to lag and/or those 'annoying moments' when you think you shot them and you really didn't.There is no 'level up' system, instead you are given points for doing well in-game. You can use these points to put attachments on your weapon. *PLEASE READ*THIS GAME IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART. IT IS NOT FOR 5 YEAR OLD CHILDREN.It is a tactical shooter; It is squad based. There is no room for drop shots, quick scopes or noobtoobs.It uses the valve source dedicated servers, so those of you that enjoy source games and the support. This game is for you.The game is incredibly well made even though it is in the Early Access phase. I'm glad I made this purchase. I will for sure drop Battlefield 4 and put time into this one.			"

												If you like Adult Hide & Seek combined with a cup of ""Gun Porn"" -then this game is a must have.After ""Role Playing"" a bit, you soon realize that working together as a Squad helps you and your whole Team big time. If the Squad knows which Equipment to choose and the Leader knows which Orders he should give- Oh boy! The immersion kicks in your face and suddenly dying seems like a very bad thing. Not many game's actually accomplished this, not even those true ""Realism Shooters"". Sometimes (and especially in this scenario) is using voice-communication a great way to dive into a game.Did i mention that this game is 30% Gun-Porn? No? Well it is! The Weapons just feel like Weapons- not Airsoft-guns (yes, im looking at you CS:GO [96 Dmg in 6 Shots].) They actually shot where you point, you are aware of the different Gun-Sounds all the time (because ignoring enemy fire is just stupid) AND THE BEST PART: you don't even want all the attachments on your gun! Looking at a AK 47 with just a foregrip never felt better!I hope you can forgive me for not even mentioning one bad point, but i just can't see any.I can't even complain about un-added Features, because all the thing that matter have already been promised and are on the way or are already implemented.It's been ages since i sucked a games *ick that much, and i know it sounds a bit wierd- but believe me: Buy it and get ready to fall on your knee's.Early Access is not always bad, and Insurgency is the best example.

												I have spent over 51 hours playing Insurgency just in the last two weeks. I loved this game and so did my friends. However since I play on a Linux platform and  steam has disabled manual updates, battleye was installed (without my permission). Having a forced spyware program  and without my consent or knowledge is not what I paid for.  Battleye does not just scan Insurgency files, it  scans ALL files on the computer. Playing a game should not mean I have to sign away my privacy and security. I will never buy another game from this developer.			"

Now with the re implementaion of C4, class restrictions that make no f**king sense whatsoever, game modes that do nothing to promote teamwork, a convuluted UI and a**♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥the HUD it's just another run of the mill generic shooter. It's worth the money just to mod the theater files if you're going to host or buy a server, but I no longer find it fun to play. It's beginning to remind me of Battlefield Play4Free where the game has serious issues that need addressed but they're more concerned with leaving it broken just to add more content.This from the forums""They took all the good features from America's army...""False. There is no teamwork. There is no BFT. There is no incapacitation. You can jump but you can't vault. Weapons models are incorrect. Loadouts are completely unrealistic, why can I choose a frag or smoke but not both? No ES2 objects to report. No bleeding or damage system requiring teammates to give you first aid to promote teamwork. I could go on and on about how this has nothing in common with America's Army.Another one""Notice: Teamwork requiredThis is a great tactical shooter. It's not so fun when no one cooperates. Work together!""Exactly my point. If there was any teamwork in this game I'd still be playing with over 945 hours logged regardless of the other issues I have with the game. Teamwork trumps everything else.Then there is also the matter of certain developers trolling players in public servers. Not only is it quite unprofessional when you do it wearing a bigass tag next to your name saying DEVELOPER but it puts both the game and the rest of the development team in a really bad light. Same thing applies to asking how to correctly implement a feature that is publicly released from the internal beta branch testing and the only reply is ""that's not how you do it"". That's not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ answer. If it isn't the correct way to do it explain how to do it correctly so you do not need modify the default game theater files to keep clients from crashing when they join your server. All in all the game started out awesome. I can honestly say I thoroughly enjoyed playing it every day. Now that's not the case. Playing for more than 5 or 10 minutes seems like a chore instead of an escape. Any criticism of the game is swiftly met with deleted posts or temporary bans and feedback from a large portion of the community seems ignored in favor of making the game more and more noob friendly for players who might buy the game and play maybe 10 to 25 hours before moving on to something else. I don't see the community having any kind of longevity and it's a shame given the remarkable start this game had for a small indie team.EDIT:After playing Firefight tonight and seeing the teamwork that's still there (maybe it's just that mode) and the influx of new players I changed this to RECOMMENDED. The game is fun when you have people working together. The game is a hell of a lot of fun then. I had thought that was gone forever but I'll be the first to admit I might have jumped the gun. After all, there's gotta be something to this game or I'd have never racked up this many hours in the first place.			"

												For my short personal description, I'll put it as a really slow-paced CS:GO, with more gamemodes and realism. Teamwork and communication between you and them is always recommendable. Maps and weapons in normal pvp, may seen a bit unbalance, but it does not prevent you from playing it. This game will make you pay attention to sounds, to your ammo mag, and force you to be part of team. Graphics are ""OK"" to be a game powered by Source, but you can mod it in the workshop and get better looking textures and lighting.8/10 - It's worth giving it a try, may not seen to be for everyone, but if you like realism, this is a good game to own and play.

Brief ReviewWhile multiplayer shooters are in great abundance these days, the small scale, squad based tactical shooter has been MIA for some time. The series filling this niche that rose and fell in the late 90's and early 2000's like Rainbow Six, SOCOM and Ghost Recon changed with the times, leaving in their wake a demand for a style of gameplay that is largely absent from the impressive yet largely samey environment of competitive online shooters today. Insurgency looks to fill this gap by taking the lethality and realism of games like Red Orchestra or Arma and distilling it down to the most basic components in maps and modes that wouldn't feel alien to a Counter-strike player. Make no mistake though, while it may look like a Counter-strike clone at a glance, Insurgency feels more like the tactical shooters of old, making it a surprisingly fresh experience.Pros and ConsProsThoughtful shootingA true test of skill vs. skillLots of customizationPlenty of modesIntense, methodical pacingGreat focus on teamworkConsDated visualsLethargic movement undersells the intensity (I understand why its like this)An EndingLike Counterstrike but with more bullet damage			"

												Its like a scaled-down version of Battlefield, only much more fun, doesn't have that sour EA aftertaste, and actually requires tactics compared to most of the traditional MP shooters out there. It also has PvE that you can play with other people, so there's a bit of variety to be had. The cheatingly accurate AI (who is guaranteed to kill you in less than 3 shots the moment he sights you down) will give you a run for your money; so staying in strategic cover and taking accurate shots is pretty much a requirement.Its not a heavily realistic shooter like ARMA or the pre-Vegas Rainbow Six games, but does add a lot of other factors that makes shooting a gun a lot more complex than a simple point-and-shoot deal like in CS or CoD. Much like the former games mentioned, there is no health counter; all it takes to kill you is 1-2 shots to the body and no amount of kevlar can help you survive a clean headshot. Body armor helps, but they're not completely reliable. You have no ammo counter, just a count of how many mags you got for one weapon, so you have to get a feel for your weapon to know how many are left in the magazine (Though it kinda doesn't help that the game doesn't have any stats for guns in-game). Knives don't help you run faster, be smart with your loadout and carry light gear to be fast or carry heavy gear to be well prepared. Its warfare as realistic and fun as it can be. Each class does get their own set of guns (which is disappointingly limited), but workable and you can still customize your gun to an extent to fit your playstyle. Mods also aren't given out like candy. You have limited supplies for mods so tooling up your gun is more of a tactical choice than a tacticool one. Guns also sound and feel pretty solid that you'll have fun shooting them at the enemy.Overall, not bad at all to play if you're looking for an affordable breath of fresh air in the saturated FPS market. Think of it as an infantry-only ARMA 2, but more action-ish.			"

												Gun play is very different from most traditional FPS titles. Many people will say that there is barely any hud at all but really there are still plenty of crucial elements on it. Objective markers, where squad mates are, magazine count and a side bar when you're switching weapons. It adds a little bit of a challenge but not having a bullet counter is something that takes little time to get used to any way. I can't speak for everyone but I barely pay attention to mine in most shooters but I digress.Your weapon moves a bit more independently from your camera so if youre one of those people who likes to sprint and around and hip fire for that quick XP you'll be a bit dissapointed. Aiming down sights is crucial to landing good shots and sprinting in any kind of hotzone is just silly unless is keeping your from getting shot. All of the weapons except for rockets and grenades are ray tracing just like any other source game so there's no need to worry about aiming ahead or accounting for bullet drop, none of that is there as far as I know.There are various classes with a decent range of armaments from machine guns to sniper riffles with a weight system so you can't load up on flash bangs with a silencer on your pistol and a decked out riffle. But getting used to this system does not take long and a little experimenting lets you figure out what the optimal set up is for your class. Don't be the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who plays demo for the rocktes and then just tosses it in the first thirty seconds hoping to mimic the AI on a hunt map. Imitating AI Satan does not make you Satan.AI are actually pretty smart and are terrifying at times, decent at laying down supressing fire and keeping you on your toes. They're somewhere between a new human player and a Counter Strike bot as far as actions go. Have fun on hunt maps with friends at night. Arguably the most fun I've had on the game.There are plenty of other game modes besides hunt. Push is the best one for newer players as it plays like a wave based COD with an attack and deffend twist. It doesnt get tiring at all really. Most other game modes have more punishing aspects like no respawns or the defending team has fewer waves than the attacking.Sound is pretty good. I can't say there isn't really a weapon that sounds horrible. The first mod I got off of the workshop was the realism sound mod for weapons. Never looked back. Just watch your volume when you fire an RPK, those ♥♥♥♥ers are loud. Character dialogue doesn't have to much going for it, it's a drier version of battlefield's in comparison. It is funny selecting ""negative"" in the radial menu as the security forces and having your guy yell ""♥♥♥♥ NO"". I can't really say how many times that's given me away and gotten me killed. Worth it.Visually speaking, it's a bit dated. It is a counter strike mod originally so you can get a decent idea of how it looks. Have a good machine to run it on higher settings to get something that looks like less like a source game. Watch your Lens FX quality in the options as well. That is a frame rate killer on weapon machines if you're using a sight on higher settings.Overall it's a solid 8/10. There are a handful of things that could be polished (look at the terrorist models and you'll see) but regardless of it's older visuals it's satisfying and the community is growing quite a bit.			"

												This game is a perfect mix between the Arma and Battlefield series (even if only infantry based), it is full of different and fun pvp game modes, all based around territory control, hunt & destroy objectives, escort and obviously the classics like team deathmatch. The interesting aspect is that it also comes with a full coop team based option, where cooperation and teamplay are fundamental against rather smart and deadly AI enemies.Realism is not far away in Insurgency, one or two bullets put you down on the ground and while gameplay is still pretty frantic, you need to move cautiously around every corner, looking everywhere and listening to every sound clue possible, above all during night missions. You can customize your equipment in every little aspect, from weapon attachments to accessories like granades and night vision goggles, but you also need to keep an eye to your overall weight, based on the kind of mobility you want to have on the battlefield.Technically the game is rather good, graphics/effects are not that far from nowadays triple A titles and levels/maps are pretty well built. Sound design is top notch and you'll♥♥♥♥♥♥yourself out when you'll hear bullets coming your way, but you'll also grin like a little Rambo when you'll hear the power of a full M249 magazine discharge...really great!I don't have particular issues to point out about Insurgency, it always played smooth and I had fun during all my time with it (and will keep playing it in the future). Compared to other FPS communities, players are always willing to play like a team and rarely opt for a mad mercenary approach, putting this game between the top spots of the military/tactical shooter genre. And its developers keep working on it sending out free upgrades and new maps/weapons/modes. Recommended, without a doubt!!			"

												Fun multiplayer shooter. Sort of a mix between Battlefield series and Call of Duty series. Looks similar to COD's Hardcore mode - minimal UI (no ammo counter, no health, no map ect), friendly fire is always on, hard to tell friend or foe at a glance. But has lots of players, like Battlefield. There are no killstreaks, only you, your enemy and your objective. And you can only see kill/death ratio when you're dead. Respawn also happens in waves, like BF, but maps are smaller, closer to COD style.There's almost no single player mode. There's ""tutorial"" mode, where the game explains how to play, and there's ""solo"" mode, which is rather hard (your ally bots are rather stupid).There's a ""co-op"" mode, where a team of real players plays against bots to reach certain objectives, and bots vary in difficulty - from tough to insane.And there's good old multiplayer. Kind of fun, but personally I prefer CS:GO multiplayer. Its much more action-packed and looks better. More vibrant. But thats just a personal preference, Insurgency's multiplayer is more dark, but it grows on you. Its not a masterpiece, but not a complete disaster, either. Overall, Insurgency is a good game to try if you like multiplayer shooters, geared towards realism.			"

												A perfect blend of both strategic and fast paced gameplay. Insurgency does so many things differently from other fps it's a breath of fresh air to someone who has played the genre for a long time. Minimal hud, ironsight only aiming, and no kill indicators make for highly suspenseful and entertaining combat. If you're looking for a shooter that rewards patience, teamwork, and good positioning you will not be disappointed. BCB APPROVED.			"

												Here's my review:So there's this game, where you can noscope people with knifes and kill more people as a guy with a pokeball screaming ""ALLAHU AKBAR"".And there's this VIP, I still don't get what's special about him. He only wears sexy glasses, wears a white shirt or a black vest and he noscopes people with his super-silenced-knife-M9. When he dies everyone stops and are happy/sad because VIP died. This is how war works, boys.11/10 It has awesome Workshop-items -> from pokeballs to ""realistic"" weapons. It has more gamemodes, so don't worry ;P			"

												CS:GO and Red Orchestra 2 bang and have a baby and it is named ""Insurgency"". This game has the best of games, fast paced action, with brutaly intense combat with realistic damage.

												The co-op is fun.  Checkpoint is slow, coordinated room-clearing.  Survival is really fun on maps that aren't wide open.  Hunt is also fun on enclosed maps.  (Bots see in the dark and can also see you and kill you from miles away.)The PvP is really boring, most of your kills will be shooting people in the back, or people that were looking the other way, or people that were just sprinting and can't get their gun up in time, or using an RPG.  It's not like in Counter-Strike where there's the tactical element, but most of the battles are two people shooting each other at the same time.  The person that camps the longest, finds a really good spot to headglitch, or sits at the back of the map with a sniper rifle is the one to get the kills.  Most of my deaths were frustrating, being shot by someone I couldn't see or could barely see.  Most of my kills felt cheap and not rewarding.Not for everyone, but it's pretty good.			"

												Insurgency is a fun and addicting semi-realistic FPS, with a prominent focus on teamwork. It basically has it all; Good graphics, intense gameplay, large selection of maps, etc.   Insurgency adds realistic elements to the gameplay, including limited hud, no killcams, reduced ability of the player to survive multiple gunshot wounds, etc.   It is quite an intense game. The feeling of adrenaline you get when you're pinned down by enemy fire, trying your best to stay alive is what makes this game truly shine. Now, what it lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality. There aren't a whole  lot of weapons, but the game makes up for that in the quality of them. Most guns (excluding the sniper rifles and pistols) have the option of changing their fire mode. Usually the choices are Semi, Burst, and Auto, so you can choose whichever works best for you.   Since Insurgency is semi-realistic, you the player can die in just a blink of an eye. It only takes 2-3 shots and you're dead. It only takes one stray RPG rocket to take you and your whole team out. In this game, you are not a walking tank that games like Call of Duty make you out to be. In order to survive, you need to work with your teammates to finish the mission.   The game's Online community is usually pretty active, so you shouldn't have too much trouble finding some teammates to pair up with. In general, if you're a fan of games like ArmA and Rainbow Six, definitely check this game out.Pros: - Good graphics- Large variety of maps- Semi-Realistic gameplay- Active communityCons:- Can be frustrating, especially if playing by yourself- Rather small selection of weaponsFinal Rating: 8.5/10			"

												Thought u were THE PLAYER in BF/COD.NOW be prepared to DIE. ALOT. LONE WOLF PWNER? YEAH try that then sit for 15 minutes and watch your mates die. AWESOME. This games brings back teamwork in a way that BF has lost, and COD never had. (yes ive been a LONG time player of both).  It's serious, slightly fun and at times, hard work. One shot to die. Long time to sit it out. Pressure on you when you get the 'last man standing' warning, as you have the chance to respawn the whole team. CHeck the corners, reload asap, look behind. This game is *&^&%&@!! hard, and TBH most of us playing it love it. Sure, the graphics are 2005, the animations are 2001 but the weapon sounds, the balance, the teamwork is what we all wanted in the AAA titles. I for one dont want 16 different grips, 45 different weapons, 55 different camo's etc. OVERIT. ♥♥♥♥ that give us a simple choice, keep it balanced and let skill decide the game YEAH? I died alot in the beginning, but with time and a good squad or two, oh the joy. As a long time advocate of BFBC2, this game reminds what devs can do to bring back simpilicity, TEAMWORK and awesome fun times all at once. BEWARE no killcam, no HUD, no MAG COUNT. Awesome again. Its hard and its challenging BUT that kill, that POINT CAP, can be soooo >>>REWARDING<<< because, you actually earnt it.This game is a good balance between ARMA, BF. CS and RO. Can't recommend highly enough for those in the FPS community who are looking for an extra challenge. You'll mostly find a good community of players who understand Friendly Fire, Teamwork and VoiceChat as you'll need all to succeed :PEnjoy			"

If you're looking for a shooter that rewards patience, teamwork, and good positioning you will not be disappointed. BCB APPROVED.			"

												Its like a scaled-down version of Battlefield, only much more fun, doesn't have that sour EA aftertaste, and actually requires tactics compared to most of the traditional MP shooters out there. It also has PvE that you can play with other people, so there's a bit of variety to be had. The cheatingly accurate AI (who is guaranteed to kill you in less than 3 shots the moment he sights you down) will give you a run for your money; so staying in strategic cover and taking accurate shots is pretty much a requirement.Its not a heavily realistic shooter like ARMA or the pre-Vegas Rainbow Six games, but does add a lot of other factors that makes shooting a gun a lot more complex than a simple point-and-shoot deal like in CS or CoD. Much like the former games mentioned, there is no health counter; all it takes to kill you is 1-2 shots to the body and no amount of kevlar can help you survive a clean headshot. Body armor helps, but they're not completely reliable. You have no ammo counter, just a count of how many mags you got for one weapon, so you have to get a feel for your weapon to know how many are left in the magazine (Though it kinda doesn't help that the game doesn't have any stats for guns in-game). Knives don't help you run faster, be smart with your loadout and carry light gear to be fast or carry heavy gear to be well prepared. Its warfare as realistic and fun as it can be. Each class does get their own set of guns (which is disappointingly limited), but workable and you can still customize your gun to an extent to fit your playstyle. Mods also aren't given out like candy. You have limited supplies for mods so tooling up your gun is more of a tactical choice than a tacticool one. Guns also sound and feel pretty solid that you'll have fun shooting them at the enemy.Overall, not bad at all to play if you're looking for an affordable breath of fresh air in the saturated FPS market. Think of it as an infantry-only ARMA 2, but more action-ish.			"

												I'm really loving this game, unfortunately rounds are way too short which doesn't really give you long enough playtime to become properly immersed. If this game had longer lasting matches, and I don't just mean rounds per match, I mean time to complete a round in each match, then I think I'd enjoy this more than CS:GO, until then I'll stick with CS because the length of matches just feels more competitive and rewarding to win. This will be one of those games I start up to play casually and have fun on, which is a shame, because I think it has a lot of competitive potential.			"

 INSURGENCY [/tr] Developer New World Interactive Release Date January 22nd, 2014 Genre Tactical, First Person Shooter Mode(s) Online MultiplayerInsurgency is the sequel to the 2007 Source Engine mod, Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat. This review is NOT for the mod.     TLDR VersionInsurgency is an adreneline fueled tactical multiplayer shooter that will have you making tactical decisions, matches escalate from organised pushes into objective territory to organised chaos of fast paced close quarters engagments. Game gets frequent free add-on content so it's a pretty good deal. Also you can die really fast but so do bad guys so it feels like you really are accomplishing somehing, in other words you get better the more you play. 11/10_Bretty Gud.          Insurgency is a multiplayer team-based game in which players take the role of Security Forces or Insurgent Forces, the game includes several objective oriented rule sets which each team attempts to complete. Most PvP modes consist of variations on capture and hold objectives where the teams attempt to move into the objective area and hold position in the area until it is captured; the ultimate goal is to hold all of the areas. Carrying over from the mod is the 'Push' game mode, an attack and defense game mode were one team must move in and capture a number of areas in a set order while the other team defends the position attempting to drain the attackers of their reinforcement waves.On the less competitive side is an adictive Co-Operative mode in which a small group of players work together to battle AI insurgents and capture areas as well as hunt and destroy their weapons caches.     Infantry combat is the core focus of the game, but make no mistake this isn't your standard shooter affair. Bullets pack a real punch and the damage system is universal, you can almost always takeout a player with one or two well placed shots and that applies to you as well. The matches in this game often work from careful advances towards objectives before erupting into deadly firefights with gun fire and explosions,  the excellent map design  really gets shown off here, in general there is always more than one way to reach a position and there is nothing quite like working your way around the flank of a position carefully scanning for targets while another group of players are in a heated battle; you go from that subtle approach and then burst into a fast paced assault on the capture point. There is a good selection of weapons and equipment which can be fitted to your liking as long as you have enough supply points, during a match you will earn supply points by helping complete objectives and helping your team. You also have two types of armor (effective against a few more shots from certain weapon calibres) but your choice ultimately effects your movement speed in some way.Maps are mainly focused around urban areas with some exceptions being a snowy mountain top village, the approach across a large bridge into a dense patch of buildings and an assault along a highway as you narrowly escape death by using abbandoned vehicles as cover. Don't get the wrong idea, although many of the maps are in urban cities they are all unique, each with defining characteristics. Revolt is a seaside city with dense building interiors and streets littered with debris from explosions while District has you in twitchy firefights through the alleyways on two sides of an open boulevard prime for marksmen to take shots at unlucky players. The map design is really some of the greatest I've personally seen and since the game supports Workshop mods some servers run custom ones.Since the release of this game three major updates have been released (there have been other patches of course) and with each came new weapons, equipment and official maps & game modes, most recently was the implementation of stats tracking system along with the main menu UI displaying the insurgency news feed so that players can stay connected. Finally what makes this game so great is the communication between developers and players, the beta client is also availble with the purchase of Insurgency where the devs have open beta tests of new maps, modes and weapons and listen to the player feedback and also play the game with you. To wrap this up I would highly reccomend Insurgency to anyone who is looking for a satisfying tactical online shooter experience that is both very accessible and challenging with a pay off for success that is undeniably one you earned  "

												10/10. This is an awesome game. I'll be honest it looked a little cheesy at first, but once you play it, gosh man this game is harsh.  You really have to play it safe, or you’ll get your head shot off. Even the AI is great, always trying to outflank you, and I’ll tell you, for a bunch of untrained rebels they can really shoot. Story time: So we're all in this objective and the enemy is counter-attacking us. Bullets are flying through the windows, so we all hit the deck. They’re downstairs too, so we’re stuck upstairs in our little room. Someone gets smart and sticks his head in the window, only to get it shot off. At this point an RPG comes in right where he just stood, explodes inside, and kills our entire team. Also the game has sound delay, the explosions sound a couple seconds off depending on distance, very pleasing. You’ll learn very quickly not to go near windows, or stay in a group of 2 or more, or get cornered in a room, those RPGs are murderous, however realistic. The game is well balanced, always interesting. At time is feels like the guns are a little unbalanced, the RPG for example is just so powerful, but the more I think about it, the more it seems to add to the game, it makes it interesting. Another think you’ll learn quickly is teamwork. You won’t accomplish♥♥♥♥♥♥in this game if you don’t work together, it just won’t happen. Always have a backup plan too. This game is awesome on many levels and I strongly recommend it to those who like the tactical games. Just keep in mind it’s only tactical if you make that way.  "

												Throughout the game development, I've loved this game, then hated it.  At this point, I'm loving it.If you are into realism, this is up your alley.  You must aim well and move tactically.  Running & gunning like Call of Duty kids will get you killed very quickly in this game.  Good team work will make a smooth win, and no team work - or bad team work - proves to be a definite failure time after time.I like to think of Insurgency as a slightly arcade version of ARMA.  It's not as technical as ARMA, but it definitely tries to stand on realism.  One or two shots take down enemies, and that's all you can normally take as well.I prefer Co-op (players vs bots) and for now it's pretty good.  The bots do need some work in places, but it's better than it used to be (and better than some other games that utilizes bots).PvP is pretty good too, but due to my lack of experience in that area, I won't comment.There are finally a good amount of custom maps for this game.  No more playing 5-6 maps over and over and over.  There are several game modes for both PvP and Co-Op.  For the price, you can't go wrong.  Even some of the CoD kids might like this.			"

												Insurcency is a Tactical FPS realistic game which (in my personal opinion) aims to create a game between a shooting game, and a tactic simulator guerrilia warfare.It's ok to buy this game, as running Source engine it will gives you a right balance between graphics and performance. The things this game needs is to update. Insurgency has kept the same gameplay, graphics, design since its relase. Im sure it will be better with some improvements.However, if you're looking for strategy and cooperative game with the right ""ingredients"" such action, tactic, strategy and personal skill based on your class; this game could be for you!

												I'm slowly putting hours into this game and I have to say it is a gripping game. You don't get a sense of Call of Duty where you are the chosen one that has amazing armor/armour, one shot kills happen, that prevents you from taking real damage. Teamwork is also an essential must in this game. Sure it's nice to have a higher K:D but let us get real for a second...Kills alone can't win an objective, sure it can't hurt and it will help all the time, you have to be conscienous of what you're doing and where your teammates are. I've pulled all nighters playing this game and it just is different everytime. I like the rush I get from an intense firefight that i ran through, an ambush I surived (just barely) the grenade blast that came out of nowhere as I thought I was about to cap an objective. This game gives you a great rush, it has it's quirks to work out but I only have high expectations from here on out. Great product would recommend to anyone that wants the feel of realisim mixed with teamwork and fun.			"

												  Insurgency is what modern shooters should strive to be like. Setting the standard with extremely difficult but fair gameplay it draws you in by making you actually think about your decisions in game. ""Should I lean around this corner?"" ""If I take this path will there be more enemies?""   The game presents you with tactical decisions that most of the time can and will  decide if you live or die.  The core mechanics of the game rely on teamwork, you have to communicate, you have to be vigilant and watch each other's back. Failure means somebody was not doing their job properly. I've been playing Insurgency since the early beta and I'm extremely happy with forward progress that New World Interactive has had. Despite that however, there are still some things left to be desired. PROS:Extremely tight, precise controls.Good balance of classes and weapons.Variety of games modes to play.Very accurate representation of real world firearms. Fun but challenging gameplay.Great community of modders.CONS:Somewhat hostile PvP and sometimes PvE communties.Bots that can snipe you from half a mile away with AK irons.Random heatseaking RPGs out of nowhere. Alt+Tab sometimes completely crashes the game. Online Servers can be finnicky at times. Hit detection can sometimes fail completely. Suggestions :More general profile stats; Games played, won, lost, accuracy.Improved party system. Better server search function. Reworking the damage and range of shotguns. Most of the time I completely disregard the shotgunbecause of it's tendency either not hit an enemy from 5m away or just not do any damage if I hit them at all.Reworking some maps, I.E. Heights.  Overall, Insurgency is a great game with a huge learning curve. You cannot jump into this game with the intention of running through and mowing down anything in your path. The decisions you make result in how much fun you have with the game. New World Interactive does an extremely good job of updating the AI's pathfinding and combat skills. I feel with every update the games becomes more challenging, and with that more rewarding when you finally beat a map. This is not a game for people who are used to Battlefield or Call of Duty play styles. Once you get past the gigantic learning curve Insurgency becomes a game that you simply cannot put down.   "

												Insurgency is a limited UI multiplayer only first person shooter that pits insurgents and security forces against each other in armed combat.I am a casual gamer. I am, however, a very passionate casual gamer. Some would say that is an oxymoron, but I disagree. You see, as a casual gamer I value my personal time greatly. When I play a game I don't want to feel restricted or held back by the game. As a consumer of a product I also do not want to feel alienated or swindled by pomp and circumstance of flashy and obnoxious things such as character customization and  inventory micromanagement everytime I get a new item. I also don't want to have to play 40 hours a week to level up and get the items I need to compete with the other ""top"" players. I want to be able to sit down, log in and shoot people in the face with the same gun, same equipement that everyone else has, and log off with a grin on my face when I'm done. I want my personal experiance and skills to be my only limitations.Insurgency is the game that if counter strike took that next big step it would be. Character graphics are not highly detailed and beautiful as the ""AAA"" shooters, but as cliche as it sounds, that doesn't matter. The environment that you have to actually look at for more than 2.5 second before you blow it's balls off is gorgeous. I don't like using the term ""realism"" when refering to military first person shooters, but as such it feels realistic and sounds realistic, it feels gritty and raw. You scream for mercy when you've been hit, you breathe heavy when you run, you can only sprint for a distance that matches the weight you carry. Bullets are precious and even though it's not always one shot one kill, you are likely to die in one to three shots. Hip fire to taunt and make noise, aim to kill - retical and iron sites are  your only real options for a good clean shot. Virutally no UI, no hit markers (just look for the pink mist), no on screen crosshairs, hold your breath on exhale for accuracy - not some weapon addons that turns even the ♥♥♥♥♥iest firearm into a fully automatic sniper rifle.  There isn't healing, there isn't resupplies; BF and COD fanboys need not apply for this game. You will not get the action packed shooter hero feeling with this, there is no ""leveling up"", there are no ""character customization"", there are not achivements. You live and you die by the limited lead that is carried into each battle. I'd like to think the most important thing about insurgency is that team work and the strategies within wins (at least in most game modes). The game is not perfect, devs are constantly tweaking things, so something that worked great for you last month may not work all that well for you now. It can be frustrating, but you make it work. There were severe balance issues with certain maps (S(w)injar), but that has been revamped and is much more balanced now. The second most imporant thing is the community. Dedicated community servers made by people for people to play an awesome game. I have personally purchased and gifted this game to 7 different friends in hopes that they not only would find it as enjoyable as I do, but also to show them what a truly good FPS experiance should be like.

												The best multiplayer First Person Shooter I've ever played. Here's why:-When I play a game that involves guns, I want to feel like I'm shooting an actual gun. This game does just that plain and simple. Long gone are the days of unloading an entire magazine of 30cal rounds into someone only to be knifed in the foot and die. In Insurgency, based on what caliber you're using, and where you hit them, most of the time if the enemy takes 1-2 hits they are going down. Sound design for the weapons impressed me as well - shots sound more like real guns shots when compared to other game's airsoft sounds. One last note about the guns - this game has gotten suppression down really well. It's not a new concept for shooters, but Insurgency does it in a way where you really don't want to poke your head out when hot lead is flying your way.-Teamwork plays a big part in this game. If you are used to being a lonewolf, one-man-army, xx3p1c Kwiksc0p3rxx type of player, you're gonna have a bad time. There is nothing to help you but the people on your team; that's a good problem to have in my opinion. There's no minimap with magical radar, no killstreak bonuses, no floating crosshairs, no BS. Not even an ammo counter. Just you and your team vs the other team. It's simple, intense, and fun.-Every player is equal in this game. Everyone has access to the same weapons depending on which side you're playing on.    -Map design is pretty solid. Nice mix of close quarters, medium and long range.(Bonus: Night maps are great. NVGs, flashlights, flares, the works)Can't recommend this enough if you like a good shooter. You just have to keep in mind this isn't arcade style where you can run around and lunge at someone 3.25 football fields away and knife them. This is a good mix between realism and competitive fast paced action.9/10.			"

												I've always liked hardcore shooters like battlefield where its super realistic and enivonments are destructible, is what what i would have still been saying if i never played this game. I came scross this game as i was new to steam and wanted to find a legit shooter. And i came across this, saw the images and videos, looked up and read reviews, and i was immediately hooked. I bought the game and of course, i ran in guns blazing like COD or BF, but i immidieatly realized that was the worst possible decsion. One shot one kill now runs through my head when i play this. I love this game. This is all i play now and i cant get enough of how badass this game is. I would highly recomend to any gamer looking for a little challenge or wanting to try something new. Takes a while to get used to how actually not die all the time but when you learn the strategies and tactics, it's a very rewarding experience. This game also HIGHLY requires communications with your teammates or else everything will go horribly wrong.			"

												If your looking for a super realistic FPS you will most likely love this game, there is no crosshair, healthbar, ammo count or minimap, making for a very different experience from your average fps game. However if you get frustrated easily this game may not be for you, as you can get shot and not know where the bullet came from and be dead before you have any clue of whats going on. One of the problems I have had with this game are bad teams (not the games fault) and badly balanced maps, most maps are good but some are really poorly designed where one team will get hammered by the enemy (not due to teams), because the other team just starts off with better positions; but this is true to the real world, war is never fair. Also to get the most out of this game use a mic and comunicate, it makes the game more fun and helps your teamates. It runs on the source engine so you will get good FPS if you are on a low end computer and is supported by multiple operating systems. Graphics are decent but will not compete with bigger franchises like Battlefiled or Call of Duty. For the price (when I bought it on sale it was $4.50) it is extremely good value and I highly recommend it if your are interested in it.			"

Most times you only get to see a muzzel flash to show someones location, and again most times, thats all you get to see! lolThis is an excellent game all round for all gamers!The only thing I can complain about would be the ranking system. Its overly basic and dull. Some real custom ranks and a better scoreboard system would be amazing! But the ranking system does not take away from the overall game enjoyent!			"

												""The game that totally made me don't want to get into a firearms fight in real life even though it doesn't show spilled guts and smells of death.""Insurgency is a tactical modern infrantry combat simulator. No fancy health regeneration, hit markers, crosshairs or even ""enemy killed"" pop ups or health bars. All you have is your team, bunch of enemies spred in usually urban environment, objectives to capture and nicely looking and well animated weapon that feels like real one (I've been shooting real AK, M4, a pump action shotgun and a bolt action rifle IRL and I can tell you what feels real).There also is flexible inventory letting you chose equipment and weapon modules, letting you invest on silence of you weapons, heavier armor and weapons or extra explosives used as tactical advantage. It doesn't work the same way as in other  shooters - all your abilities are determined by your chose of equipment, not by silly ""perks"".You might think that Battlefield multiplayer in hardcore mode can give you more than Insurgency, so what's so special?The realism and the game design. You camp instead of running in the field killing everything that moves, you wait instead of rushing forward the enemies ""to get easier kills"", you are careful instead of being a rambo, you move out when other guys cover you otherwise you're in bigger risk, you work as a team and you get rewarded if do your best. If you don't, then the life is short. The game in unforgiving - every mistake is a deadly risk, every move gets even more risky as you get closer to your target. It's like chess where you're just one of the figures when all the other figures do their moves at the same time. The tension is always high while both teams are careful and try to find perfect balance between safety and mobility...And then the opposing forces meets, and the skrimish begins and concrete dust raises... The first act may only take a second and few fighters are down, while the others try react and understand the situation so they can and regroup to meet the threat. You only survive long enough if you do as people do on real war: ""you hope that other guys get killed instead of you"". You only love this game if you play it like if it was a real war... and I say it's immersive not because it looks great, but because it feels great. If it looked as good as it feels, you would get PTSD after a short while. Looking forward for VR edition...			"

												Really swell game! Good graphics if you don't look at them too close. Great weapon system. Co-op is good, though the bots can sometimes pull off insane kills with unlikely guns from far away (shotguns, full-auto gunfire, rpgs, ect...). Though the maps are similar, the gameplay is always different and your actions have consequences. Not guarding a flank can kill your whole team.     Several aspects of the game do need improvement though, especially in co-op. There are pretty much two types of bots out there. Those that suck and stand there (even sometimes run out in the open) with their guns pointed in the air. And those who corner camp and/or can headshot you before you can see them, with a shotgun. The bots also need a little tweaking in the molotov department, as they can accurately aim a molotov at you and throw it as high as possible and hit you with it. Also, the armor system is a bit odd. Sometimes you can survive insane amounts of gunfire and think, I should be dead. While other times you can be wearing the heavy armor and die from one pistol shot.     Overall , I would reccommend this game, but caution people too. If you don't like long respawn periods, then DO NOT buy this game. The consequences I mentioned earlier are basically very long times of sitting in your chair spectating another player because you died and there aren't any more reinforcement waves. Even though many people would consider this a con, I consider it a pro because it gives you a better sense of mortality and that you actually need to be aware and careful. I'd give this game a 8.5/10, it truly is my favorite hardcore fps out there. Buy this game while it's on sale!			"

												Tl;Dr ""If you like CS:GO or tactical shooters then this is definitely worth a try.""Insurgency is a tactical shooter game made by New World Interactive and is based on the source engine.The game is based on the Half Life 2 mod insurgency and takes lots of inspiration from the Battlefield 2 mod: Project Reality.Gameplay:The gameplay is set around online multiplayer adverserial with gamemodes which revole around capture points, VIP's and intel.Each gamemode has its own playstyle and challanges.Insurgency calls itself a tactical shoot and it really does the genre justice. You usually die in a few hits and cant afford to run and gun, since it will get you killed. In other words not a game for the faint hearthed, because this game will make your hearth raise when the time is ticking and you're the last person on your team to make the difference between winning and losing.The map design is done just right there are no real choke-points and there is always a way of breaking though the enemys defence without making it unfair for either team. Even though they did nail the map balance there are still some nasty bugs with terrain clipping and invisible walls (specifically on the map ""Peak""). The loadout system has an interesting balance, it gives you set ammount of points to spend on weapons Counter Strike style, but instead of earing those points, it will give you them upfront. I do really like this system, it makes it so that there wont be inbalance due to firepower and the combinations are practically endless. Gunplay:The gunplay is done really wel in this game, the bullet goes where you aim, but the kick of the weapons make sure it wont be a simple fact of point and click. All the guns come with their own sounds which are really well done and give you a real sense of immersion. Each weapon also has its own animation and every reload will be a joy because of that.Severs and matchmaking:The matchmaker is definitely one of the game its flaws, it works fine when theres is plenty of people online, but when theres not it tends to throw you in to servers with one or two people on it. Luckily there is the sever browser which makes it so you can always find a game you like. Another important note is that sometimes the game does have laggspikes, however not very often, this will is something really annoying when you're trying to line up that perfect shot and it just laggs out at that one crucial point.When you enter the game you will probably also notice in the mainmenu that there is a player tier and rank, however these ranks do not influence the game or matchmaking in anyway (but it does give some nice bragging rights).Verdict:I will definitely recommend this game to anyone who has played first person shooters before, people who want to get in to tactical shooters or someone who is looking for a challenging and competetive game. I'd definitely not recommend this game for anyone looking for something light and/or easy to play. Even though the minor complaints about your casual lagg-spike or a bad hitbox here and there, this game is a definite buy for me and delivers hours (if not days) of fun and replayability.			"

												It is one of the best games i have played. It is pretty realistic, if you shoot someone you won't get a message (In other games like Call of Duty and Battlefield you will be noticed if you have shot someone). Also, if you hit a enemy 2 or 3 times he will be killed. This is much more realistic than allmost every other game.Especially the COOP mode is awesome, it is nice to play with friends. 1 thing, if the bots are at unforgiving it is allmost impossible to reach the end of the level. Another point i love about the game is the possibility to adjust your weapons. It differences from the weight you can carry how much attachments you can use. If you play in COOP and everyone is killed in your team the weight you can carry will increase by one. This makes it easier to play the level, because you can carry more explosives or more ammo. I can totally recommend the game! I would give the game a 9/10. It is a shooter how it should be, simple to play. You can make it to the end of a level without using tactics, but it is the smartest thing to do if you want to survive as long as possible.			"

												I've always liked hardcore shooters like battlefield where its super realistic and enivonments are destructible, is what what i would have still been saying if i never played this game. I came scross this game as i was new to steam and wanted to find a legit shooter. And i came across this, saw the images and videos, looked up and read reviews, and i was immediately hooked. I bought the game and of course, i ran in guns blazing like COD or BF, but i immidieatly realized that was the worst possible decsion. One shot one kill now runs through my head when i play this. I love this game. This is all i play now and i cant get enough of how badass this game is. I would highly recomend to any gamer looking for a little challenge or wanting to try something new. Takes a while to get used to how actually not die all the time but when you learn the strategies and tactics, it's a very rewarding experience. This game also HIGHLY requires communications with your teammates or else everything will go horribly wrong.			"

												After missing the old days with Americas Army 1, i ve tried this one and was stunned. Played the MOD some years ago and it was quiet fun but nothing special.But this more polished game is exactly what i liked most about other substitutes in competetive tactical gaming in the first place.Everything you ve liked about tactical and competetive gameplay will be served by this game and far moreIts awesome, more tactical more teamoriented and rewarding but at the same time  less forgiving when running pointless around. Teamplay is a must have in this one and will be forced upon you in that moment you will try something without your mates. I strongly recommend this game to people who liked the competetive and tactical aspects in rainbow six 3, americas army 1, battlefield 2 and arma 2 or 3 maybe red orchestra too, most.no hudno countersno radarno crosshairbutteamplaytactical progressionbelieveable surroundings an immersive gameplay:) kind regards			"

												I have been playing shooters for as long as I can remember and as far as this one goes, this is the best one I've ever played.The game is Tactical, Intense, Fun, and a little bit realistic. What stands out to me the most is how realistic the guns are. For example, it'll only take 1-2 shots to kill a man with an Assault rifle in the torso area. The game has multiple game modes suited for all types of players. There are Player V Player game modes, and even COOP(I myself go on COOP most of the time). The game is well balanced, and I just love it.For those who want a some-what realistic, tactical shooter, get this game. Call Of Duty players, stray away. Your running and gunning won't work in this, fantastic shooter.10/10Love it.			"

												Holy hardcore batman!This game is what COD or BF should be!There are private servers, modded servers, custom maps, party system, and more!It is very realistic as far as weapons and gameplay. The sounds are incredible, and the choice of loadout is quite good. I really like the differences between all the guns and attachments.It is not run and gun at all, so some people may be put off by that, but they need to play it more to appreciate that.I received it as a gift from a humble bundle, and then turned around and paid full price for a copy for my son as this game is worth the money and then some.Recommended 110%!!

												With the execption of the map Peak, this game gets so many things right. The brutally immersive gameplay is unparalleled in the way that it balances realism and controls. Unlike a certain game, you won't find yourself having to learn a bunch of controls to do simple actions. One of my favorite things about this game is its accessibility. Although you probably won't start out super good, if you learn from how you died the last 25 times you'll improve. If you put in enough time, you'll stop treating most FPS as ""run-and-gun"" games. This game forces you to be tactical and thorough with the penalty being death.  The most noticable disadvatage new players have is map awareness.I'm constantly surprised by the AI in Insurgency's Co-op modes. The AI are neither easy nor predictable and I guarantee you'll be surprised by how challenging they can be. They won't just gun you down if you're standing directly in front of an AI bots; they will flank you, surpress you, snipe you, toss smokes at you, and even incendiaries/molotovs. Beating the AI actually requires a level of teamwork that makes lone-wolfing it rather difficult. On ""forgiving"" or easy, you can easily cut through bots with a team that communicates so once you beat the maps, change it to ""unforgiving""/medium or ""brutal""/hard. I'm always suprised by how many times I can play a round of Checkpoint on the same map and have it play differently (except Ministry... it's pretty linear on Chekpoint).I could go on and on about the various PvP modes... To keep it short, there's a mode for everyone.This game is a value buy. Even though it is only priced at $14.99 USD, it usually goes on sale on Steam for something like $7 and sometimes cheaper on Humble Bundle. and... that's it. You won't find yourself purchasing a bunch of DLC packs. New World Interactive (the developers) release new content in free updates. That's not to say that the game never changes though. Not only are there a lot of brilliant works on the Steam Workshop, there are also servers that run custom maps too. Although I originally thought that the New World Interactive cheaped out on this game- I've come to learn how the simplicity of Insurgency is quite fitting. In a realistic way, it doesn't give you an abundance of information. The HUD is very minimalist and clean. However, there are many details which make the game visually appealing as well. This includes smoke trails from your gun, really intense surpression, and tracer rounds that give away the position of the shooter.Did I mention there are no kill indicators (with the exception of a few servers)? Have fun checking corpses to confirm your own kills!!!...and running/sprinting only brings you closer to the gates of hell. You will be gunned down without mercy- True Story.			"

At first it causes some frustration, but after a few hours, more frustration awaits.And a few quotes from a players:- ""I don't get what I'm supposed to be doing""- ""Where are they shooting me from""and finally of course:- ""Allahu Akbar!""

												I just want to say a few words about the truly amazing policy of NWII haven't seen a game in a long time that lives up to the immense support insurgency gets from its developers. Not only do they update the content (maps, weapons, gadgets, gamemodes... you name it) and gameplay frequently, they also don't cash any money for their DLCs. While we live in times where companies charge money for DLCs that come out at the release day of their games, NWI really shows how it should be done. This game is an example of true customer service that stands out in a world of greedy game companies.love it.(PS. I would not say this the most realistic game. As fun as it is and most people that play this game ofton will agree with me, its a spray and pray. You get shot a few times and for the most part you die but if they are wearing heavy armor it could take up to nine shots to take him down. Everyones gun is pretty much always on full auto when in he military it is almost always on semi automatic. If it is on full auto its in short controlled burst and in insurgency its let me spray the ground the walls the bushes and anywhere near you Iand hope they died and go onto the next obj. But the game is amazing besides the few cons I mentioned. Gr8 game  IR8/8)			"

												I love 1st person shooting games.  Had been playing CS with countless of hrs and when I tried this Insurgency, I stop playing CS.  Love this game so much.  Love the smart bots.  Love the fire fights. Love the map.   Just got nothing bad to say about this game but damn.... everything is so damn realistic!			"

												Insurgency is one of the most precious First Person Shooters we have today, its a Realistic and Tactical game, wich needs team cooperation to win the match.Its a very intense game, it makes you go crazy while your killing, and make you fear when under fire.So Welcome to Insurgency, a TRUE FPS, with , no Hit Marks, no MAP, no HP, no MEDIC'S, no HELP and not ridiculous Killstreaks, its a true firefight Bad guys vs Good guys.The game counts with a Squad system wich both teams have 2 Squads, each squad have a number of classes that you will use in battle, nothing changes class to class but some classes have Guns that others not, such as Sniper and Support, also the game has Very good maps and map voting system, and one of the maps are from the Mod : Insurgency Modern Combat, wich is great too.It has 8 types of Game Modes like Push, Skirmish, Strike, Co-op or even Search And Destroy. all of then extremely balanced for both teams.Guns in this game have a incredible realistic damage, so you kill with 1 bullet using a pistol, but you also die with 1 bullet, so do not run arround the map, stay with your team and try to complet the objectives.The Graphics and Sounds are great, i'm really impressed what source engine can do with big jobs, that game has a lot of details, and a lot of Post-processing effects.If you guys enjoy this game such as me, try to play the MOD, Insurgeny: Modern Combat, its great, and show how much work this guys did to make such good game like this, years of work made a exepcional game.So, i'm going to tell you that if you are a Battlefield or Call of duty player, please don't run, try to learn how to play this game, you will be a better player in the future, i promise, but first you going to play Insurgency, and die a lot....A lot.But also Red Orchestra or Arma players are going to be good in this game, they have pacience to play it. so Just 15$ for that kind of good game? what the hell are you waiting for? buy it...Now!

												I mean, the game itself is a whole lot of fun.  It's intense.  You don't see how much ammo or health you have and lives are precious.  Graphics could be improved though.  If you're looking for something in between arma and battlefield with a hint of counterstrike, this is it.  I only hope they fix the latest bug which doesn't allow me to play the game.  It says play now and when I click it a grey box appears.  The game is fantastic though.  DEFINETLY worth $15.			"

												For new players who haven't played shooters in a while, or at all, This game is a (fun) never-ending panic attack until you figure out what you're meant to be doing. For those coming here from Counter Strike, you'll be frustrated to realise yolu won't be able to survive 12 hits. 2, at most. Don't even expect to be extremely useful with a bolt-action rifle (like the AWP), as Insurgency is based more towards fast paced close quarters combat. You often find yourself right up in your enemy's face, shooting from point blank and hoping he doesn't fire first. Just remember that YOU HAVE TO CAP POINTS TO RESPAWN YOUR TEAM unless it's a game mode with ""Waves"" of reinforcements. But even then, once you run out of ""Waves"" you WILL HAVE TO CAPTURE A POINT OR OBJECTIVE TO RESPAWN YOUR TEAM. Pros:-Fun-Fast paced-Realistic damage. 1-2 hits usualy does the job.-Proper accuracy. None of this ******** expanding reticule stuff. Firing from the hip will screw your acuracy. Aiming does make it easier.-Gun/kit modification. As long as you have supply points, you can change your loadout and primary mods.Cons:-WHAT AM I DOING?! Little bit panicky at the start. Though I like that, others may not.-No railguns. Railguns make everything better. <3			"

												Such a satisfying game to play. Rushing into an objective or successfully flanking an enemy is one of the most fun things I've done in any gaming experience. Hearing sniper shots fly over your head or friendly/enemy bodies falling into the ditch you're crawling through makes you feel like a real soldier, which makes getting kills that much more badass. Gunplay is probably the best thing about this game, being that it is on source engine. Guns are heavy, feel real, have good recoil, and work like they should. Most guns sound very similar to how they sound in real life, and enemies die in 1-2 shots from almost every gun aside from sidearms. Depending on if you want to use the workshop, you can get different player/gun skins, different blood textures, etc. Such a fun game to play with friends as well, to talk tactically and push up. The VOIP system in game leaves something to be desired, as it doesn't fully capture the quality of your microphone, so I reccomend playing with friends and using something like teamspeak. A game fully worth the cheap price, buy it today and become that badass soldier you always wanted to be.			"

												After playing the game alot in the past days, I can tell it's really good.In my opinion, this game is a combination of Red orchestra, Call of duty and Counterstrike.Playing smart leads to satisfying victories and it never gets old.The map design is fun and well made.The game isn't perfect, but the devs are regularely patching the game.Amongst things I hope they improve, customization of a few weapons seems to be overlooked. Most assault rifles and weapons have alot of attachments and modifications available, which makes you able to make your own kit and personnalize it towards your role and your gameplay. However, The sniper rifle only has a single mod available, AP ammo. yep. That sucks. Not that Ap ammo is bad, but it just doesn't feel like it actually changes anything. Why didn't they add options like the red dot like every other weapon in the game has, or the laser sights. or the silencer. you get the drill.the game seems and feels balanced overall, but there are some things I can't get my head around as to why they even did this. An example is that in order for a Insurgent to get light armor, he needs 2 supplies(currency used to make your weapon kit, you have 10 by default). If he wants a heavy armor, he needs 4 supplies. Seems good, however, Security forces can get the light armor for free and the heavy armor for 2 supplies, while the insurgents dont seem to get any advantage besides the fact that their special ammo types( AP and HP) cost 1 less supply. These are only minor flaws and can be changed in a flash, So it's no big deal for now.TL:DR Fun game, give the devs some breathing room,Balanced gameplay with weird elements. 8/10.			"

I feel this is due to not enough people setting up servers.Co-Op against AI, 6  different Multiplayer modes and some real nice gunplay makes for a pretty fun game.With friends, or with a team that works together and communicate, it's excellent.If you like AA:PG, Rainbow 6,  and CS:GO I would imagine you would like Insurgency.

												I would compare Insurgency to ARMA mixed with Counter-Strike on Battlefield maps.I don't know if that's accurate... There is no HUD, no HP bar. There is no mini-map, and there is no real tutorial.This is a tactical shooter that is honestly very reminiscent of CoD3 for me, and that's a good thing. I remember CoD3 had maps with clutch points and large-scale teamplay. You set down a machine gun and give supressing fire while your snipers can get into position, you throw a smoke to let your teammates cross the bridge safely; it's not just run n' gun nonsense of the CoD4+ generation. You'll have moments where you're playing the frontman and you have to dive from cover to cover to push into the enemy, or while you search distant buildings with your M40A1 for enemy sniper positions. These are very satisfying and well-done within the game.There are bugs, more so than I'd like, but they nevertheless come up pretty rarely.Going to give this an 8/10, definitely worth a buy if you're into the genre.

												Fantastic tactical FPS that# requires patience, foresight, planning and good reflexes# finds the sweet spot between arcade shooter and realistic tactical simulation# has many different maps, game modes and possible loadouts and thus offers a wide variancy of ways to play# is reduced to the max (no killcam, no kill notifications, no crosshair, no ammo counter)# has great developers that constantly add new content (guns, maps, playmodes or recently night vision goggles)# has the best looking smoke in video game history			"

												I bought this game for $8.99, having loved Arma 3 i figured what the hell, I can use another Precision, team based, hardcore FPS. everything about this game i love, great controls, feels smooth when aiming, and the levels i think are some of the best around. playing as an insurgent with AK platform weapons and even old surplus military weapons like the mosin-nagant, mp40, even an sks and a ruger mini-14 to a m1a1 paratrooper model! whats great is the attachments can go on all the guns, just a matter of how bulky your gun is (attachments go by weight so a big M1 marksman rifle can hold 1 or 2 slots, whereas a tiny UMP45 or mp40 can hold 4 to 5) the gun physics are amazing, better than arma 3 in my opinion. you honestly feel like your in a shootout and can feel your shoulder weaken after letting off a clip into a brick wall suppressing enemies behind it. the recoil is so accurate, yet not so difficult to where a full auto isnt effective. yes, you dont want to hold down the trigger, but short burst tend to be on point most of the time. i like how theres no leveling system, everybody is equal, you just choose your guns by the squad you join (machine gunner, recon, scout, rifleman, demolition,sapper, militant,engineer) so it forces you to work as a team as a whole, and wont put you up againt a team of ""quickscopers"" or LMG guys.bottom line, if youre thinking about getting this game, DO IT. it is so much fun you will highly enjoy it. if you liked any other military simulators (but hated how buggy and glitchy Arma 3 is) than this is your next game. the price itself should be enough to buy it, cause i wouldve bought it for $15 if i had known about it before the summer sale. you really cant go wrong with the game OR the price. I (and you) will be playing this game well into next years Steam Summer Sale.			"

If you're looking for something in between arma and battlefield with a hint of counterstrike, this is it.  I only hope they fix the latest bug which doesn't allow me to play the game.  It says play now and when I click it a grey box appears.  The game is fantastic though.  DEFINETLY worth $15.			"

												For new players who haven't played shooters in a while, or at all, This game is a (fun) never-ending panic attack until you figure out what you're meant to be doing. For those coming here from Counter Strike, you'll be frustrated to realise yolu won't be able to survive 12 hits. 2, at most. Don't even expect to be extremely useful with a bolt-action rifle (like the AWP), as Insurgency is based more towards fast paced close quarters combat. You often find yourself right up in your enemy's face, shooting from point blank and hoping he doesn't fire first. Just remember that YOU HAVE TO CAP POINTS TO RESPAWN YOUR TEAM unless it's a game mode with ""Waves"" of reinforcements. But even then, once you run out of ""Waves"" you WILL HAVE TO CAPTURE A POINT OR OBJECTIVE TO RESPAWN YOUR TEAM. Pros:-Fun-Fast paced-Realistic damage. 1-2 hits usualy does the job.-Proper accuracy. None of this ******** expanding reticule stuff. Firing from the hip will screw your acuracy. Aiming does make it easier.-Gun/kit modification. As long as you have supply points, you can change your loadout and primary mods.Cons:-WHAT AM I DOING?! Little bit panicky at the start. Though I like that, others may not.-No railguns. Railguns make everything better. <3			"

												Such a satisfying game to play. Rushing into an objective or successfully flanking an enemy is one of the most fun things I've done in any gaming experience. Hearing sniper shots fly over your head or friendly/enemy bodies falling into the ditch you're crawling through makes you feel like a real soldier, which makes getting kills that much more badass. Gunplay is probably the best thing about this game, being that it is on source engine. Guns are heavy, feel real, have good recoil, and work like they should. Most guns sound very similar to how they sound in real life, and enemies die in 1-2 shots from almost every gun aside from sidearms. Depending on if you want to use the workshop, you can get different player/gun skins, different blood textures, etc. Such a fun game to play with friends as well, to talk tactically and push up. The VOIP system in game leaves something to be desired, as it doesn't fully capture the quality of your microphone, so I reccomend playing with friends and using something like teamspeak. A game fully worth the cheap price, buy it today and become that badass soldier you always wanted to be.			"

												Insurgency is possibly the best realistic game I have ever played, It's hard to believe I was just judging it at first till I experienced it my self, This isn't your average FPS game this is a new type of FPS game taken to a new level, where there is no advantages, It's just pure skill and luck based, where you can either communicate with your team to ensure your great success in winning or just play for fun and just solo it out by your self, either way soon as you jump into the battlefield and learnt all the controls you'll soon deeply love how the game plays not to mention how beautiful it looks as well as a Workshop to touch it off for more customizable features to the game, as well as game modes to choose from, customizable weaponry, night scenes/maps and so many more, for more information about the game I highly suggest checking out their main website.Pros:Realism Graphics and Game play.No Hud, Ammo Counter, Tagging System (Besides Team-Mates) or anything, It's completely just who's your team mate where are the objectives that's it.Classes/Roles to choose from which best suits you.Customizable weapons.Tons of missions and scenes/maps to choose from.First Person Perspective while holding the weapon is fantastic I dunno how you couldn't enjoy it, It's hard to explain.Only get one life till an objective is either captured or destroyed which make It more pressurable for both teams to make you really think about your actions.Cons:Land Mesh is some times buggy or in certain areas.Smoke Grenades are some what unrealistic and can cause clipping issues (For example, smoke clipping through walls, roofs and objects)Jumping over object's or in general isn't too fancy.I'd give this game a soild - 9/10			"

												Insurgency is one of those games that sets itself apart from the fps genre. People mostly think that fps' are supposed to be fast paced, but the realism in insurgency does not let that happen. Its a hard core game with high reward to people with fast reaction time. After getting destroyed in this game for so long I started destroying. So it does not matter soon enough you will enjoy the game.			"

												Although Insurgency isn't the most realistic shooter as of yet, it certainly shines by combining elements of realistic, unforgiving, and hardcore gameplay. Zero health regeneration, quick deaths, and the fact that your opponent could be just around the corner make for very exciting gameplay that keeps players on edge, fingers ready on their left mouse button. Matches are usually fast and furious, adding to the tension and excitement. In addition, an assortment of gamemodes and maps exist for those players who like variety. Players can take on other players head-on in a Firefight match or attempt to survive against AI-controlled enemies in nighttime environments while playing Survival. Also, the community is rather friendly and they churn out marvelous stuff that is available in the Steam Workshop. Yes, I forgot to mention that Insurgency does possess Workshop support. These workshop items offer numerous customizations and could make playing Insurgency even more fun. The developers, New World Interactive, are also very active, often looking for opinions from the community on how to improve the game and releasing frequent patches and updates. However, as is the case with every game, Insurgency does have its weak points. It can be quite buggy at certain times and the community is rather small at the moment. Nevertheless, these are not major flaws and are vastly overshadowed by the pros of playing this game. For a relatively low price, Insurgency offers a very in-depth experience comparable to that of bigger and more showy titles like Battlefield or Call of Duty. This game is a must-buy for all FPS fans. Rating: 5 stars. Not just any kind of stars. GOLDEN STARS.			"

												A solid and fun game, especially since it's free to play after the initial purchase. As of this review, the developers just released Nightfall, a free expansion. The game seems to be on the right development track and has a proven record since it was once a mod.In terms of mechanics: the game is fluid and has a high number of both servers and players. There is a wide selections of weapons and the ability to chose what stuff you put on them is also a nice touch. I recommend this game for those who enjoy medium-paced squad based action. Remember to work in a team and coordinate with your fellow players.ProTips:- Get a microphone- Remember to lean around corners (default keys are Q and E)- Don't sprint everywhere you'll get run over- Throw grenades a little higher than you think they should go, they fall low			"

												A great tactical shooter, both in multiplayer and up to 8 player coop mode.A nice blend between Counterstrike, America's Army 2, Battlefield Bad Company 2 and the original Insurgency mod for HL2 (minus the clunkyness).The maps range from urban CQC to open terrain long-medium distance engagements.Frequent updates and free DLCs.What more can you ask for?Worth every penny, in my opinion.

												Amazing game, to put it in more simple terms!The way you get gunned down mercilessly by one bullet by making one bad move is crazy. Walking into a room, shooting a guy running past the window... And not expecting the realistic sounds as your gun makes a massive sound. Then realizing that you just alerted everyone in the surrounding street block that you are there. Walking through the back door into the alley, seeing movement and not knowing if it is friendly or hostile, then hearing a bang and your screen tilts sideways and goes black slowly as your first person view jerks toward the ground, possibly glimpsing the sniper move from the 2nd story window in the second before your screen is fully black.This game is a master piece. As I tell all my friends who haven't heard of it, it's like Battlefield... Ramped up about 5 levels. No HUD, ammo count, or even names above everyone on the field. To top it off, it is always a mystery whether or not you actually killed that guy you were shooting at.I can not put justice to this game in words. A must play game for any serious or even casual FPS player. For you COD players, this game throws even more dirt on COD than Battlefield does.			"

Unlike most other FPS games, when you zoom with a scope, the scope zooms in but the area around you does not, and it feels really nice, a couple of games have done this like Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm and the absolute travesty Call Of Duty Ghosts.In Insurgency you cannot run and gun, instead you have to communicate with your teammates and use cover to your advanntage.Conclusion:It feels like a modern Red Orchestra mixed with Counter Strike, I'll let you make your mind on if you want to get Insurgency or not.And now a few of the cons:Sometimes you will feel cheated when you die either because someone is camping a choke point or you got one shotted by an MP5k.For a source game it is quite resource intensive so if you have a slow computer expect to run this on lower settings			"

												9.5/10Intense and terrifying when under fire, a (noob-)friendly community that is used to getting killed for the slightest mistake, which is essentially part of the experience. Is it the most realistic shooter out there? Definitely not. There is no wound system like in some other games, usually you get shot and you die. In all honesty, many of the characteristics that would make it more realism-oriented (a complete lack of respawns, wound system, no HUD, ...) would in no doubt hurt the gameplay, which is now excellent. It certainly feels like a real firefight and the coop is as unforgiving as the player-v-player. The gameplay is tweaked in such a way that teamwork is not just key, but also a necessity to survival. This makes it important to communicate with other players, which obviously makes it a lot of fun.If youre sick of bunnyhopping-shooters where you can go full Rambo without repercussions or if you have grown insensitive about being under fire (it's not easy shooting back in this game if you're being shot at) then this is the game for you. This is not a sell-out big company game. They do a lot of effort to keep the price low, reward it!			"

												This is perhaps the greatest FPS I have ever played. It is not the best graphically, but it is the one that pays the most attention to detail. Little things, like not having a crosshair, only knowing how many mags, rather than bullets, you have, really make this game an unforgettable realistic experience. This may be the closest you'll ever want to get to real combat through a screen. The atmosphere is palpable, and at times you will even fear for your life.The maps offer sufficient variety and the updates are near-constant, with new maps being added all the time and old ones refined for better, more intense play. And the setups of each game will force you to cooperate with your teammates to achieve victory.If you like shooters, get this one. I cannot stress that enough.			"

												Insurgency... the perfect  game I've always been looking for. I am a hardcore realism guy, of course Arma series will always be the best, however this does a hell of a job without all the clunky controls arma has, of course sacrificing the giant maps and helis and such. But fk all that, baby. Let me tell you something, this game will run on my old GPU from 2008, and it looks great. But about gameplay... I tried CS:GO... its a arcade experience, uninstalled within 10 minutes. Insurgency does way better for me. REALISM -Bullet Penetration MechanicsQ and E lean mechanicsProne MechanicsNo medic revives/healingSuper high damage, even pistols can kill within 1-3 shots.Headshots always kill no matter what.No croshairsNo minimapOptional friendly fire mechanicNo damage indicatorsSuppression systemNo kill camsThe class system is also very good, there is machine gunners, militants, specialist... riflemen... bombers, sappers. All kind of crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥ Each getting its own availible weaponery, C4, AK47u, M4s, or even RPGs. So basicly, the insurgent teams have complete different weapons than the other side, which it seems to be in higher damage, very similar to many real life situations in iraq, Ak47s from terrorist overpower american weapons, however american weapons have more accuracy. It seems very much like that in this game. I'm a guy whos sick of arcade shooters like counter strike and call of duty, and others out there. While it may not have all the crazy combat the battlefield series has... it has more realism than battlefield. In terms of infantry combat. If you want a huge step up from counter strike... lets go bby. See you on the front lines. FK BBY GIVE IT A 10/10 FK FK			"

												This game is perfect for hardcore tactical shooter fans who don't want to or can't spend hours on ARMA. The sound design is superb and the feel of the weapons is fantastic. The overall atmosphere feels awesome and the one- or two-shot kills make the gameplay very tactical and methodical.I just wish there were more mechanics in place to encourage teamwork. While a lot of players in Insurgency are very cooperative, I feel this is only because they are the kind of players to be naturally attracted to that play style and not because the game directly encourages them to do so.I'd definitely recommend picking this game up if you enjoy any of the ARMA or Battlefield games, as this fits very well in the middle.

												Insurgency is possibly the best realistic game I have ever played, It's hard to believe I was just judging it at first till I experienced it my self, This isn't your average FPS game this is a new type of FPS game taken to a new level, where there is no advantages, It's just pure skill and luck based, where you can either communicate with your team to ensure your great success in winning or just play for fun and just solo it out by your self, either way soon as you jump into the battlefield and learnt all the controls you'll soon deeply love how the game plays not to mention how beautiful it looks as well as a Workshop to touch it off for more customizable features to the game, as well as game modes to choose from, customizable weaponry, night scenes/maps and so many more, for more information about the game I highly suggest checking out their main website.Pros:Realism Graphics and Game play.No Hud, Ammo Counter, Tagging System (Besides Team-Mates) or anything, It's completely just who's your team mate where are the objectives that's it.Classes/Roles to choose from which best suits you.Customizable weapons.Tons of missions and scenes/maps to choose from.First Person Perspective while holding the weapon is fantastic I dunno how you couldn't enjoy it, It's hard to explain.Only get one life till an objective is either captured or destroyed which make It more pressurable for both teams to make you really think about your actions.Cons:Land Mesh is some times buggy or in certain areas.Smoke Grenades are some what unrealistic and can cause clipping issues (For example, smoke clipping through walls, roofs and objects)Jumping over object's or in general isn't too fancy.I'd give this game a soild - 9/10			"

The bots are challenging usually, but not punishing, you usually know where you could have done better.Good youtube review on the game if you want more info:

												My experience with Insurgency has been an overall pleasing and fun experience.  From the close-quarters streets of Iraq to the mountains of Afghanistan, Insurgency delivers fun.  This game has been one of the few team oriented games that actually rewards teamwork.  It is essential to survival.  The maps are varied and interesting, the weapons are as well, with customization for different playstyles, and the game is overall very impressive for the source engine.  The few bad experiences were: A Hackers and B the map ""Peak"" on Cooperative vs AI.  The enemy uses RPGs like crazy and it requires a very careful and experienced team to win.  While not impossible, it is tough.  Overall, I rate the game a 9/10			"

												Amazing game, to put it in more simple terms!The way you get gunned down mercilessly by one bullet by making one bad move is crazy. Walking into a room, shooting a guy running past the window... And not expecting the realistic sounds as your gun makes a massive sound. Then realizing that you just alerted everyone in the surrounding street block that you are there. Walking through the back door into the alley, seeing movement and not knowing if it is friendly or hostile, then hearing a bang and your screen tilts sideways and goes black slowly as your first person view jerks toward the ground, possibly glimpsing the sniper move from the 2nd story window in the second before your screen is fully black.This game is a master piece. As I tell all my friends who haven't heard of it, it's like Battlefield... Ramped up about 5 levels. No HUD, ammo count, or even names above everyone on the field. To top it off, it is always a mystery whether or not you actually killed that guy you were shooting at.I can not put justice to this game in words. A must play game for any serious or even casual FPS player. For you COD players, this game throws even more dirt on COD than Battlefield does.			"

												Thought u were THE PLAYER in BF/COD.NOW be prepared to DIE. ALOT. LONE WOLF PWNER? YEAH try that then sit for 15 minutes and watch your mates die. AWESOME. This games brings back teamwork in a way that BF has lost, and COD never had. (yes ive been a LONG time player of both).  It's serious, slightly fun and at times, hard work. One shot to die. Long time to sit it out. Pressure on you when you get the 'last man standing' warning, as you have the chance to respawn the whole team. CHeck the corners, reload asap, look behind. This game is *&^&%&@!! hard, and TBH most of us playing it love it. Sure, the graphics are 2005, the animations are 2001 but the weapon sounds, the balance, the teamwork is what we all wanted in the AAA titles. I for one dont want 16 different grips, 45 different weapons, 55 different camo's etc. OVERIT. ♥♥♥♥ that give us a simple choice, keep it balanced and let skill decide the game YEAH? I died alot in the beginning, but with time and a good squad or two, oh the joy. As a long time advocate of BFBC2, this game reminds what devs can do to bring back simpilicity, TEAMWORK and awesome fun times all at once. BEWARE no killcam, no HUD, no MAG COUNT. Awesome again. Its hard and its challenging BUT that kill, that POINT CAP, can be soooo >>>REWARDING<<< because, you actually earnt it.This game is a good balance between ARMA, BF. CS and RO. Can't recommend highly enough for those in the FPS community who are looking for an extra challenge. You'll mostly find a good community of players who understand Friendly Fire, Teamwork and VoiceChat as you'll need all to succeed :PEnjoy			"

Insurgency does so many things differently from other fps it's a breath of fresh air to someone who has played the genre for a long time. Minimal hud, ironsight only aiming, and no kill indicators make for highly suspenseful and entertaining combat. If you're looking for a shooter that rewards patience, teamwork, and good positioning you will not be disappointed. BCB APPROVED.			"

												As an avid fan of the original Insurgency mod, i can say without a doubt that not much has changed in terms of gameplay. Sure its more refined and comes with quite alot more options tactically and in terms of customization, aswell as a ton of new game-modes. But the game itself remains true to the mod. The maps are mainly recreations of the mod's maps, with the whole CS:GO treatment, meaning more appealing aesthetics and some minor changes. I would recommend this, its kind of hard to get into if you go in with the mentality of most other mainstream shooters, but not as hard as getting into ARMA. Now this is realism, but not to the ARMA degree, its fast-paced and most games do not last that long. The Co-Op is kinda meh, could be alot better.			"

												Insurgency is a realistic first person shooter that features the realism of modern combat such as carry weight, no HUD (of course) and pretty much 2-5 shots and you're dead. It is a very difficult game to start off with but as you adjust to the multiple gamemodes and maps you will learn the ways of the modern soldier. It features many modern guns such as the M4A4 and the UMP. At times the combat is close quarters and at times long range, but no matter what the distance, the intensity never leaves the game. The in-game voice allows you to communicate and work together with your fellow teammates and lead them to victory.TL:DRYou can spray with a LMG and get 50 kills. 8.6/10.			"

												So I finally got the chance to try this game out, having thought about buying it for some time now (thanks Humble Bundle!). I figured it was pretty much going to be Counter-Strike on steroids, and just something new for me to master.After getting my♥♥♥♥♥kicked for about two days straight now, I think it's safe to say that there's a bit more to it than that. My assessment of it being CS on steroids was pretty spot on. It shares many of the gameplay mechanics and element with CS, and the general feel of it all is pretty familiar. Just how much steroids it's done, however, is where I stumbled. With over a decade of CS experience, coupled with varying levels of experience with various other FPS-games, I generally dominate all FPS-games I play. Insurgency, though, serves my♥♥♥♥♥for breakfast, and you know what, I'm loving it. Some of that experience does carry over, but if you're thinking about playing this like you would CS, think again. It was the first and most painful lesson I had to learn.Not many bad things to say about this one. About as forgiving as anal cancer, but also just about as satisfying to beat, definitely give this one a spin. Probably going to feel like you're just slamming your face to a brick wall at first, but much more rewarding once you start getting the hang of it than something easy and simple like Call of Duty/Farmville/other kiddy games.

												TL;DR Decent game, worth a tryActually surprisingly fun. Of course I did pick it up for free (Humble Bundle gift) which may have affected that enjoyment but in all seriousness, it's nice to look at and isn't awful. Each mission starts of with you choosing a role (Which affects the equipment and weapons you can choose from). From this you then get a certain amount of points to spend on attactments for your weapons, armour you can pick from or grenades. In this fashion it's similar to the point systems you can find in later CoD games without the perks. As the mission progresses you will get more points you can spend on outfitting your character.You do have regenerating health but you yourself cannot really take much punishment from enemy fire. In this regards it's similar to ARMA. It does have a fatigue system (Which honestly, didn't seem that apparent. Only have really noticed it in the training mission). Also enemies did seem to die in one hit most of the time, even on the harder AI settings. The AI, however, do seem to be incredibly accurate and will ruin you if you let them. Didn't really try much of the PvP. From what I did try of it I died over and over, getting a few kills here and there. That's more indictive of my playstyle and mind set rather then the game itself though. If you had a group of friends you could probably enjoy the co-op modes quite a bitAs far as my gripes with it there isn't really much indication of taking damage apart from the screen blurring around the edges (Which happens if you take damage or if the bullets fly past you) and a sound clip (Which seems to play in the same circumstances). Also focusing your fire (Which scopes in a bit more and muffles most of the sound) is the same key as sprinting. Most of the time I found myself sprinting in a direction rather then getting this extra zoom level. Moving slightly will also take you out of this focus.Overall it's worth a shot. Sure to get a few hours of enjoyment out of it at least. Recommend picking up in a sale.			"

												This game is legit. One of the best source shooters that amazed me. Just picked this up for 1$ and it's worth it. First time playing had me amazed, Its realistic HUD and gameplay. When shot your screen blurs and you flinch like you would irl. It's HUD is very realistic. It doesn't show your map and ammo count, just mags/clips available. The gamemodes are well mastered too. I loved the Co-op gamemode in where 6-8 people go through checkpoints clearing out enemy ammo caches and certain parts of the map the enemies control. Its multiplayer on the other hand is very competitive, having 8-16 players per side is awesome. Escort a vip, capture points or just plain deathmatch. This is a well mastered game I recommend everyone to buy and play it. "

It's a smaller sized version of Red Orchestra 2 but with better game modes and Coop been the best part of the game.Overall this is probably the best FPS game I've played in awhile and everyone should own it.Pros:Coop is amazing! (should just get the game for this alone)Intense Gunfights and Pacing.Solid Weapon Mechanics and Gameplay.Lots of weapon customization.Lots of game modes to pick from.Your Skill will actually impact the Gameplay instead of relying on random spray and pray.Teamwork always wins.Steam Workshop (mods).Cons:Moving/Jumping against objects or over them can randomly stop you.

												I love this game. It has realism and challenges every aspect of good team making skills. I personally have had a hard week playing ever since my mouse broke. So now i play on my Macbook Pro (Of all computers) and shoot my mosin with a trackpad. It is impossibly hard. I usually have a laser dot beam thingy (Name crossed my mind) just so i have a fighting chance against people. The mosin does not come with this such attachment, so I have to improvise. On my last game, i had an 11:4 KD with a trackpad so gimme some props for that. I want to initially thank Lag, a friend and a gamer buddy, for supporting our troops with the humble bundle. I barely convinced him to give me one of his three copies. I believe that Insurgency is the new PTSD sim and COD should get out of our way because the Security squad is comin to the check point and aint stoppin now. Seeing as which Call of Duties only good game was Modern Warfare, I believe it is time for them to step aside and to stop saying that your advanced warfare ideas are new even though Halo has been around longer. Too much ranting its twelve in the morning and i got school. PEACE			"

 Insurgency    Field Rating Review   Graphics 7 I will admit that Insurgency is not anything visually amazing, But the detail put into the guns and the realism is extremely well done.   Gameplay 10 The game has no hud,no ammo count,no name tags on enemies! It takes tactical teamplay to the next level, With realistic guns and weapon handling! It can make some intense firefights.   Multiplayer 10 The mixture of new gameplay styles (you can't just run and gun here, you'll die), tactics, realism and some funny glitches make this a very fun game! Its worth giving it a try! I have met some funny and really friendly players that made the game more enjoyable.   Overall 8 Lets be honest here, I didn't expect to have such a fun time with Insurgency, but it is easily the most fun I have with my friends on a FPS in a longtime. If you're playing this one alone, it's good. But when you're playing it with friends, it is absolutely grand. A refreshing game in a field of run-and-gun FPS games, a free game at that.

												I just got this game in the latest Humble Bundle and have 16 hours on so far. Wait, 16? I'm not sure that's right. A good two nights worth of play so I don't think I'm up to 16. That must count afk time. Anyway.... It's a fun game! It's objective team based 'realistic' shooter with a terrorist/ counterterrorist theme. It features PvP and PvE maps based on which server you join. It's not a run and gun type of game. Running actually feels pretty slow and walking is even slower. There is a little run+slide thing for getting to cover and you can go prone so there's a little more depth than just walking and shooting. No crosshairs except for iron sights or mods that you put on your gun. Being 1 life to live, a couple twitch players (or cheaters, I don't know) can really turn a battle. Of course if you manage to kill that guy, it really hurts the team too. Built in VOIP is good quality but of course you also have to deal with trolls. Tip: To kick someone, hit ESC and Call Vote.PvE experience can vary depending on your tolerance for aimbots. You are playing against bots so without good scripting the only way to vary difficulty is to change the speed of their aimbot. On Brutual, it's not uncommon to insta-die before you see the bot because he shoots you through the corner of a wall that you can barely see his foot past. PvE modes vary too. Most commonly you'll play checkpoint which is like progressing through an assault map in Battlefield. You push up to an objective, capture it, and then progress down the map to the next objective, continuing to do so until you win or die. 1 life to live until someone captures an objective and all players are revived. The most annoying mode is Survival where you run around from objective to objective, usually with just a pistol and knife, trying to avoid getting killed by bots. If bots are on Brutal, one of these maps will clear out the server if there isn't an admin to change it. lol...PvP is good. Maps can be like capture the flag or assault-type maps like from Battlefield. Teams usually have 'waves' which is respawns as opposed to a ticker per life. Depending on the map, waves can be gained by capturing objectives allowing for some very fun and intense matches when your team is hanging onto that last wave, trading an objective back and forth with the opposing team. Weapons seem relatively balanced but I always do better w/ Security (CT) weapons than Insurgents (T). The game could do with a few ease of life updates like saving preferred builds but overall it's a very good game. I don't know how much it normally goes for but that 4 pack bundle for $45 making it about $11/ea doesn't sound that bad. Of course I got the 4 pack as part of a $12 humble bundle with Saints Row IV included so I definitely think it's worth it!			"

												Let's start off with something, this game is amazing.When you first start off in the game your going to be put in a Battlefeild/Counter strike enviroment, choosing between two teams (Insurgency or Security), you will be faced with a detailed loadout selection and class selection. Each class on each team has access to different guns, attachments etc. And you have a set amount of equipment tokens/points to spend on your loadout. You also have a weight meter which can determine whether your loadout will make you run fast or slow, and how fast your stamina will run out.Now lets get into the combat:The combat is fast paced at times and slow paced at others, you will constantly find yourself having to visually inspect whether you have killed a person and wondering ""should i check or should i run past and hope the enemy is dead"". From the last sentence you probably can tell the game is going to be realistic. It is. If you move up on your own your playing a wild card, instead you might want to call out a couple of your teammates to help you complete/capture an objective (Yes, there are a lot of different gamemodes to choose from, most of which include control areas). There is virtually no HUD (Heads Up Display), the only things that do show up on the hud is how many magazines you have, and info about the objective(s). The gunplay is realistic, recoil is a thing and attachments can supress that recoil but also you can by swithing modes on your gun or burst firing. 1-2 bullets from most guns can take down an enemy.Lets talk graphics:The graphics in the game are not spectactular, but still enough to immerse you in the gameplay, though the design and textures on the weapons look great. You can't really expect a game run and made on the source engine  and is only slightly modified is going to get you amazing Battlefield graphics.Overall Gameplay:The gameplay is realistic, tense and rewarding if you play the game right, what a mordern military shooter should be, it offers great and realistic gunplay, a variety of gamemodes and maps. Insurgency will keep you coming back to play some more (also teamwork is a thing in this game). "

												Insurgency this is a fun shooter also very frustrating at times. The game has definentally improved since its alpha version. There are still quite a couple of annoying bugs here and there but its still in development even when released. What I really love is the fact some devs actually get in games with other players(Sadly I didn't get to meet one yet). Seems like this dev team seems very cooperative with the community and I hope this leads to more awesome additions in the future. If your looking for something fast paced this game is not a good choice since running and gunning can lead to you not lasting long but, this is great for people looking for a slow-paced, team-oriented experience. I give this a 9/10 because the gameplay is really enjoyable but it doesn't get a 10 because there are still some bugs and lagg problems that need to be fixed.			"

I don't know how much it normally goes for but that 4 pack bundle for $45 making it about $11/ea doesn't sound that bad. Of course I got the 4 pack as part of a $12 humble bundle with Saints Row IV included so I definitely think it's worth it!			"

												Let's start off with something, this game is amazing.When you first start off in the game your going to be put in a Battlefeild/Counter strike enviroment, choosing between two teams (Insurgency or Security), you will be faced with a detailed loadout selection and class selection. Each class on each team has access to different guns, attachments etc. And you have a set amount of equipment tokens/points to spend on your loadout. You also have a weight meter which can determine whether your loadout will make you run fast or slow, and how fast your stamina will run out.Now lets get into the combat:The combat is fast paced at times and slow paced at others, you will constantly find yourself having to visually inspect whether you have killed a person and wondering ""should i check or should i run past and hope the enemy is dead"". From the last sentence you probably can tell the game is going to be realistic. It is. If you move up on your own your playing a wild card, instead you might want to call out a couple of your teammates to help you complete/capture an objective (Yes, there are a lot of different gamemodes to choose from, most of which include control areas). There is virtually no HUD (Heads Up Display), the only things that do show up on the hud is how many magazines you have, and info about the objective(s). The gunplay is realistic, recoil is a thing and attachments can supress that recoil but also you can by swithing modes on your gun or burst firing. 1-2 bullets from most guns can take down an enemy.Lets talk graphics:The graphics in the game are not spectactular, but still enough to immerse you in the gameplay, though the design and textures on the weapons look great. You can't really expect a game run and made on the source engine  and is only slightly modified is going to get you amazing Battlefield graphics.Overall Gameplay:The gameplay is realistic, tense and rewarding if you play the game right, what a mordern military shooter should be, it offers great and realistic gunplay, a variety of gamemodes and maps. Insurgency will keep you coming back to play some more (also teamwork is a thing in this game). "

												Being one of the first buyers of the game, I honestly thought the gameplay was very clunky; AI was clunky, maps were unfair, weapons had slight bugs. But now this game had recently went out of beta, and I'll tell you that this game is more balanced than ever. Little to no known bugs, balanced maps, balanced guns. It's a great buy for anyone who's into realistic gaming.   Please note that this game is based off of teamwork. There's no such thing as playing this game as if it were CoD, unless you like dying. This game is strictly about getting to cover, helping your teammates, and checking your surroundings. Now go out there and kick some♥♥♥♥♥Pros:- Balanced.- Cool weapon sway.- Immersive gameplay.- Diverse class selection.Cons:- Not good for any laptops or low-grade PC with an i3 CPU. (Excessive crashing with 5+ players.)Overall performance: 9/10 Needs more attention by the player community.			"

												As another review already stated it: Red Orchestra: Modern Warfare!It's a great game. If you ever played Red Orchestra you know what you're gonna get, just more modern styled. If you didn't, well here: The gunplay is amezing, the weapons kick like you want them to, not this sissy cod stuff. Attachments actually do something they won't just make the weapon better, they change how you have to use the weapon, and if you do, it will reward you with it's benefits. The maps so far seem to be good, bigger than lets say a cod and smaller than a BF or Red Orchestra. I haven't played all the gamemodes yet but they're probaply as good as it gets. As many have stated before me, the game isn't all running around and shooting people in the face. You'll need to flank, sneak up ont them, surprise them. Risk your life to get a peek around the corner. But that in my opinion is what makes this game great. I would totally recommend it even for 20$ to 30$. For 13€ or your region equivalent get the damn game!!!			"

												I can only speak for the Co-Op (PvE) game play as I have yet to try Multiplayer (PvP). It's been a lot of fun playing Insurgency Co-Op. I wasn't sure what to think of it going in as it's not exactly the newest game out there, but I'm glad I decided to give it a try. The community has been very friendly and helpful. There are five different game modes in Co-Op to suit different tastes and play styles. A lot of different maps to play on, many with nighttime versions (bring on the night vision!). Not to mention a whole lot more great custom maps made by the community. This game lends itself well to playing cooperatively with other players and it's a ton of fun to work towards the same goals together. There isn't any character progression meaning weapons to unlock or skills. Just whatever load out you choose from a list of classes and weapons. From there, you can mix and match weapons and their attachments. For me, this works out well as it's really easy to just hop in and out of a game, play and have fun.One nice feature is proximity voice chat/sounds. Makes it easier to tell from which direction your teammates are speaking to you from, shots are being fired from, nearby footsteps, etc.Overall, I definitely recommend this game for Co-Op play and I hear Multiplayer is a blast as well. When I purchased Insurgency, it was on sale for $4.99 and I can honestly say, it's the best use of $5 bucks I've had on Steam so far. Right now, during this autumn sale, it's going for $1.99. Seriously, at $2 I'd say it's worth at least trying it out. :)*A friendly tip for new players: The UI is unobtrusive. The game doesn't constantly remind you to reload your weapon and what not. So be mindful of how many shots you've fired or you may find yourself listening to the ""click-click of death"" at the worst possible times. lol			"

Amazing game, with highly realistic HUD (very few details), great choice of weapons and assymetrical loadouts (choose your own scope, ammo type, foregrip or bipod, silencer, etc), fun game modes, in both cooperative and multiplayer, and maps are fun, if a tad repetitive. Night maps and NVG are cool, and are so much harder than day. Forces teamwork and communication, but mostly making sure you're covering your team's back and not shooting at each other in a crossfire. High tension pulse beating moments, adrenaline rushes, moments of victory, despair, and frustration. Class based combat system with different weapons available to each, and a realistic load limit. Many other features throughout, and an overall 10/10.For only $10 USD.			"

												1. Should you quit CS:GO/Arma for this game?      Yes.2. Why?     INTENSE, Cool maps, amazing sound effects(especially bullets flying and hiting near you, it is terrifying), nice players, different game modes, all of them are fun, realistic, nice graphics, no pay-to-wins, haven't seen any hacker so far, balanced guns and respective roles (sniper, fighter, etc), grenades hurts a lot so beware, no crashes, I am running this game in a regular laptop so don't worry about specs.3. Downsides?     If you play it like a fool, it will repetitive since you are going to die every 30 seconds and then wait 30 seconds to 'respawn' in some modes. You will die a lot in the beginning, until you get to know the map, but you will be so excited that it will not be repetitive. *Note: There is a 'hardcore mode' where you die once and that's it. Dead meat.I would recommend it to my friends but I don't have any.			"

												My views of this Game.Essentially my way of telling if a game is good is asking myself, have I at any point in this game felt like Sniper Jackson from Saving Private Ryan? The answer for this game, where it's not set in WW2 to be fair, is definately yes. When you are sniping on Buhriz and picking off enemies one by one and calling strats and giving support to your team it is a gameplay experience only comparable to the Likes of Arma 3 and other tactical shooters. This paired with the superb combat mechanics, tense gameplay and excellent weapon balancing means I  would definately recommend this smasher of a game.			"

												It is a fps game that takes place in Iraq/Middle East. Basicly you are fighting as USA against militia. There's no much story in this game though this game is clearly better than Call Of Duty and it is way more cheaper than CoD. If you like first person shooter and if you see this game on a sale just buy it. You won't regret a thing. Well I wanna talk about some of the game features.->Realism: The lack of crosshair & HUD(where you cannot see how many bullets in your magazine etc.) is the most important part of the game thus makes the game realistic and more challenging. ->Weapons: Base weapons for classes are good and enough I think. If you don't like some guns, you can always replace any weapon in the game with mods which gives you the ability to craft your own personal armory. ->Coop: I mostly played Coop mode which is really fun with friends. I didn't encountered any toxic player in coop. Therefore I like the community of this game. ->Multiplayer: I didn't play much in multiplayer only for like 12 hours or so. I found it a little slow. If you are looking for a tactical approach in fps games, I believe you gonna like it.->Mods: You can reshape the game as much as you like. You can change Insurgents as ISIS and make them shout ""Allahu Akbar"" everytime they throw a RPG at you. Or make them Star Wars Clones so that they will miss every shot. As a conclusion, I like this game and I recommend to all fps lovers. I really felt like in a war while playing this game. I hope to see you guys & gals in the battlefield.			"

												This game pooh's on CS GO. END OF STORY.In all seriousness though. This is an amazing game. The dev's nailed the suppression effect. When those bullets fly by and hit walls around you, your butt clench factor is about a 9.6 out of 10. The scopes are unlike any i've seen in a fps. They actually take time to pull up and have a realistic feel to them. Silencing your footsteps and creeping makes for some intense end of round shootouts. I have yet to see a hacker in this game unlike every other game i've played. COUGH DAYZ COUGH. BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.

Arguably the best tactical shooter available for GNU/Linux*.Features Realistic, intense gunplay. Vast arsenal of real life, modern weaponry and equipment. Many game modes. Big player base, busy servers. Source engine runs perfectly on Linux. Workshop items make the game infinitely customizable. Want to play as kurdish Peshmerga against Daesh? You can. Want to play as Russians vs Hamas? You can.  Want to play as Colombian army vs somali insurgents? You can!!!10/10, truly an outstanding tactical shooter.* Verdún or Interstellar Marines (still in alpha) are the only runner ups I know off. "

												This game pooh's on CS GO. END OF STORY.In all seriousness though. This is an amazing game. The dev's nailed the suppression effect. When those bullets fly by and hit walls around you, your butt clench factor is about a 9.6 out of 10. The scopes are unlike any i've seen in a fps. They actually take time to pull up and have a realistic feel to them. Silencing your footsteps and creeping makes for some intense end of round shootouts. I have yet to see a hacker in this game unlike every other game i've played. COUGH DAYZ COUGH. BUY THIS GAME YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. Well actually you will because you realized you wasted your money on the bandwagon game CS NO.			"

Arguably the best tactical shooter available for GNU/Linux*.Features Realistic, intense gunplay. Vast arsenal of real life, modern weaponry and equipment. Many game modes. Big player base, busy servers. Source engine runs perfectly on Linux. Workshop items make the game infinitely customizable. Want to play as kurdish Peshmerga against Daesh? You can. Want to play as Russians vs Hamas? You can.  Want to play as Colombian army vs somali insurgents? You can!!!10/10, truly an outstanding tactical shooter.* Verdún or Interstellar Marines (still in alpha) are the only runner ups I know off. "

												Insurgency is a solid tactical-shooter that will remind you of the good times when everyone was playing Counter Strike and modern FPS games like COD were non existent, good ol’ times.One of the best things about Insurgency is the fact that you die quick, very quick, If the enemy spots you, you are dead, period. The same happens if you won’t cooperate with your teammates or wander too far across the map. Teamwork is key in this game, so you better find a bunch of friends that you can play it with, or at least get a mic and a solid pair of headphones because without them, you are in huge trouble. At first, you probably won’t notice who killed you because this is a very tactical game, everyone is hiding and waiting for the perfect moment to approach.  Insurgency will appeal to the kind of players who love tactical shooters with steep learning curve, sort of like in Counter Strike 1.6 .Insurgency started off as one of the most popular Half-Life 2 mods, but you probably already know that, because most people that I know already played Insurgency before, as in the HF2 mod.  It was downloaded over a million times ,and received the Player’s Choice 2007 Mod of the Year award from ModDB which is a huge honor and I’m happy that this game got released. Even though the game runs on Valve’s Source Engine, it still looks and feels like a fully-fledged release. Personally, I was expecting much less from this game, but I was pleased to see that the developer(New World Interactive) actually took the time and made it worth a while.The best way to describe Insgurgency’s gameplay is quite difficult, it’s a mix between Counter Strike and Red Orchestra, the reason why I’m saying that is because throughout my time with this game I felt like I’m playing a solid tactical-shooter, it reminded me of the time when everyone played CS 1.6 which is a good thing, you have access to everything, you don’t need to unlock weapons or perks, this is an old school tactical-shooter and I love it.. For those uninitiated with the world of tactical shooters, the gameplay is highly dependent upon you sticking close to your teammates, and taking control of the objectives. Most of the game’s maps are perfect for this kind of gameplay style, small maps with many vantage points for long-range shooting and much more, you’ll really appreciate the work that the developers put into the maps. The fact that the game supports up to 32 players, I have never encountered a camper during an online match, which is surprising because at first I thought everyone is just going to hide behind the cover but no, majority of players cooperate with each other, I have also noticed that the community is very supportive, this makes the online experience very enjoyable.The Feel of weaponry in Insurgency is spot on. Each gun in the game, has its own advantages and disadvantages, and they all handle differently. This is how you supposed to program guns in an online multiplayer game, I’m talking to you Call Of Duty. You can also add different attachments to your weapons, for ex. penetrating ammo, scope and many more. The Supplies system gives you a limited number of points which prevents the player from adding all of the attachments to their weapons, for ex. adding a penetrating ammo will costs you 3 points and you have 10 in total(I’m not sure about the precise number).What I love the most about this game is how difficult it is, and how it focuses upon tactical play and cooperation with your teammates, I haven’t seen a game like Insurgency for a long time(except for CS:GO), We need more games like Insurgency, and less of the COD, modern-military bulls**t that we are overwhelmed with nowadays. If you are a huge COD fan who plays nothing but COD or Medal Of Honor, this game is probably not for you but for as little as $15 you might as well give it a try. On the other hand, If you grew up playing games like CS 1.6, get it now, you won’t be disappointed.			"

												Insurgency is the game I always want to play. I've tried the free weekend version and I enjoyed it. So, when it's on sale, I decided to buy the 4-pack edition of the game so I can play with my friends. I never regret it at all.       Insurgency is all about teamwork, communication and pure combat skills. When you play this game for the first time, it's a breath of pure fresh air. It makes you feel like you're in real combat with adrenaline pump in all over your body.This game also feautures realistic damage, where one shot to the chest may kill you instantly, with no-kill cam whatsoever. It features multiple gamemodes and all of them requires good team coordination! Like CO-OP for example, bots are not really smart but the weapon damage bots have is the same to us, that's why they're deadly even if they are not smart. Also, the multiplayer is pure teamwork to win. There are normal gamemodes like Firefight and also interesting gamemodes like Infiltrate too.       The best part of it though, is, the workshop. I downloaded more than 20 workshop contents, like the ACR carbine, CompM4 RDS, DEVGRU uniforms and so on! There are plenty to download thanks to the great Insurgency community. However, original in-game contents are also good but workshop just adds customisation up a bit.       The downsides I found to be annoying (All in PVP gamemodes), are corner camping, like any player can basically just lay down behind a corner and just shoot you with ease when you round the corner or push in a building, however, they can be countered with good crosshair positioning and explosives. So about, explosives, they can be spammed in tight areas, which most of them are objective zones, like a house with a capture point, for example, if you're capturing it, be ready for multiple 10-meter damage radius grenades that will fly into the zone.       My conclusion is that, buy it now, realistic and hardcore FPS fans would love this game. There are tactical and realistic elements like Arma, mixed with medium paced action and objective teamplay like Battlefield. However, there are some annoying exploits or gameplay problems in PVP gamemodes but it's not game breaking. There is also a workshop full of usable in-game community items to use with too! 8.5/10			"

												I just started playing the game recently.First match I joined I was an insurgent.For the entire game I was treated to wonderful middle eastern music at a deafening volume and my entire team scream allahu akbar in to my headset at the same time.10allahuakbars/10allahuakbars--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------On a more serious note;I've grown up with games like Socom and Rainbow Six. Most recently I have been playing Battlefield, probably since BC2. As the franchise puts more games out, they feel at lot less team coordinated, which is what I want in a FPS game.Insurgency doesn't offer the best graphics or all of the flashy♥♥♥♥♥♥on your screen that alot of other ""AAA"" titles do. The fact is, it doesn't need to.If you are looking for a solid, fun, closer to realistic (as opposed to LEVOLUTION!!!!) FPS that actually requires team work and has (from the what I have seen so far) an awesome community, this is the game for you.9/10			"

												This game is basicly mix of BF and CS:GO which is pretty good and well done (trust me you well find yourself playing this game for hours and hours and so on...) but one thing that made me mad is the controller support...which is annoying to me because it says here this game is controller support, which is not! all i can do is just move and that's all, really (controller support my butt) but still disbite the controller support I will forgive this game (because fun). but if you guys are going using a controller for this game don't bother even try, it's not like they going to fix it or anything but if you willing to put up with keyboard then good for you. plus if you looking for challange which is: no spotting, no hip-fire crosshair, no minimap, no killcam, no health meter, no hit/ kill notification, not even an ammo counter then this game is for you. And a tip for you all, trust your instinct. each kill you make it feel so rewarding and you'll see why when you play this game. (work with you're teammate to win the game)The rating of this game is 10/10 with badass seal			"

												So... This is my review for Insurgency: 80% / 100%Gameplay: In co-op you can use in-game commands like ""Moving/Supressing Fire/Requesting Grenade"" .Equipment-Wise - Armor/5 Weapons for each class/Pistols/Grenades/C4/RPG/Night Googles/Vests. Maps - about 10 co-op maps, which can be played in Hunt mode / Survival Mode / Checkpoint mode.There is no cover system (Cuz it's FPS) but you can take cover behind walls/random cars or hiding spots while you are getting ambushed or over-run by the enemy.I enjoy the co-op everytime I play Insurgency (You need to find good tactical team-mates to play with tho :) ) (8/10)Gameplay Styles: You can either rambo and rush through the map while killing enemies (not recommended) or work as a team in co-op and experience the tactical expect of the game (using voice coms and in-game commands).There is also pvp mode with ladders  and zombie mode. (7.5/10)Graphics: The graphics fit the game itself cuz it still needs some updates so the graphics are good enough.There is gore, fire effects and grenade/smoke effects. (6/10)Sounds: Weapon sounds are loud, Silencers have their silenced sounds so you can know if a player is using a SD gun or not.In-game commands included with character voice so it's enjoyable using the commands. (8/10)Enjoyment: (8.5/10)Repetetive: (3/10) - Enemy is randomly places, there are 4-5 difficulties, enemy is challenging to some points as well.Frustraiton (4/10) - Getting killed out of nowhere or way too fast, getting rpg'ed in the face out of nowhere.Boredom (4/10)			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.In all seriousness, buy taliban simulator 2015 now.			"

												Insurgency is such a fun game, for such a small price. Its basically an FPS that is different to the rest. You can customize your weapons, many different gamemodes, heaps of open servers. Insurgency is much more realistic than COD and Battlefield. You have to work as a team to get the objective rather than running in yourself and just looking for kills.This game is becoming increasing popular because it is so cheap compared to other FPS games.I highly reccomend you pick it up before they increase the price, many hours of fun.

												so far i've played 2 hours and i'd like to write a review.Insurgency is meant to capture what real counter-insurgency feels like from the comfort of your desk. The game feels like an Andy McNab book. As far as optimization goes, it is golden, my little i3 laptop can get about 30 fps on it with a medium-high graphics settings. I've only played 2 hours but I learnt one thing, this game has never heard the phrase, ""bullet sponge"", 1 shot to the right place, and it's light  out for you. Co-op, took 5 map rotations and there are about 10 rounds in a rotation, just to get 1 victory! this game has no hud, except it tells you how many mags you have left. I managed to get second on the scoreboard first time I played it, I told my team of veteran players that they can  crouvh behind cover, suddenly I went to the bottom of the scoreboard. Also first time I joined a match I was greeted by and asian kid with his mic lodged in his throat.This is a great game and after 2 hours I definetly think it is worth buying.			"

Amazing game, with highly realistic HUD (very few details), great choice of weapons and assymetrical loadouts (choose your own scope, ammo type, foregrip or bipod, silencer, etc), fun game modes, in both cooperative and multiplayer, and maps are fun, if a tad repetitive. Night maps and NVG are cool, and are so much harder than day. Forces teamwork and communication, but mostly making sure you're covering your team's back and not shooting at each other in a crossfire. High tension pulse beating moments, adrenaline rushes, moments of victory, despair, and frustration. Class based combat system with different weapons available to each, and a realistic load limit. Many other features throughout, and an overall 10/10.For only $10 USD.			"

												Feels like a nice mix of Red Orchestra, ArmA and Counter Strike. A particually nice tactical shooter with, from what I've seen, a decent enough community.It isn't the most realistic gaming experience in the world, but it is a particually immersive hardcore shooter. It misses aspects of realism found in other games such as ArmA 2 with ACE or ArmA 3 with AGM or various realism mods, but compared to Counter Strike, Call of Duty and similar arcade games? It's fairly realistic.Haven't put too many hours into the game, just a couple of rounds so I will tend to this review in the future and go into more detail; haven't got round to trying the latest (FREE!) DLC either.			"

												I can only speak for the Co-Op (PvE) game play as I have yet to try Multiplayer (PvP). It's been a lot of fun playing Insurgency Co-Op. I wasn't sure what to think of it going in as it's not exactly the newest game out there, but I'm glad I decided to give it a try. The community has been very friendly and helpful. There are five different game modes in Co-Op to suit different tastes and play styles. A lot of different maps to play on, many with nighttime versions (bring on the night vision!). Not to mention a whole lot more great custom maps made by the community. This game lends itself well to playing cooperatively with other players and it's a ton of fun to work towards the same goals together. There isn't any character progression meaning weapons to unlock or skills. Just whatever load out you choose from a list of classes and weapons. From there, you can mix and match weapons and their attachments. For me, this works out well as it's really easy to just hop in and out of a game, play and have fun.One nice feature is proximity voice chat/sounds. Makes it easier to tell from which direction your teammates are speaking to you from, shots are being fired from, nearby footsteps, etc.Overall, I definitely recommend this game for Co-Op play and I hear Multiplayer is a blast as well. When I purchased Insurgency, it was on sale for $4.99 and I can honestly say, it's the best use of $5 bucks I've had on Steam so far. Right now, during this autumn sale, it's going for $1.99. Seriously, at $2 I'd say it's worth at least trying it out. :)*A friendly tip for new players: The UI is unobtrusive. The game doesn't constantly remind you to reload your weapon and what not. So be mindful of how many shots you've fired or you may find yourself listening to the ""click-click of death"" at the worst possible times. lol			"

												It is a fps game that takes place in Iraq/Middle East. Basicly you are fighting as USA against militia. There's no much story in this game though this game is clearly better than Call Of Duty and it is way more cheaper than CoD. If you like first person shooter and if you see this game on a sale just buy it. You won't regret a thing. Well I wanna talk about some of the game features.->Realism: The lack of crosshair & HUD(where you cannot see how many bullets in your magazine etc.) is the most important part of the game thus makes the game realistic and more challenging. ->Weapons: Base weapons for classes are good and enough I think. If you don't like some guns, you can always replace any weapon in the game with mods which gives you the ability to craft your own personal armory. ->Coop: I mostly played Coop mode which is really fun with friends. I didn't encountered any toxic player in coop. Therefore I like the community of this game. ->Multiplayer: I didn't play much in multiplayer only for like 12 hours or so. I found it a little slow. If you are looking for a tactical approach in fps games, I believe you gonna like it.->Mods: You can reshape the game as much as you like. You can change Insurgents as ISIS and make them shout ""Allahu Akbar"" everytime they throw a RPG at you. Or make them Star Wars Clones so that they will miss every shot. As a conclusion, I like this game and I recommend to all fps lovers. I really felt like in a war while playing this game. I hope to see you guys & gals in the battlefield.			"

												My views of this Game.Essentially my way of telling if a game is good is asking myself, have I at any point in this game felt like Sniper Jackson from Saving Private Ryan? The answer for this game, where it's not set in WW2 to be fair, is definately yes. When you are sniping on Buhriz and picking off enemies one by one and calling strats and giving support to your team it is a gameplay experience only comparable to the Likes of Arma 3 and other tactical shooters. This paired with the superb combat mechanics, tense gameplay and excellent weapon balancing means I  would definately recommend this smasher of a game.			"

Imagine ArmA and COD had a love child... this is pretty close to how it would turn out. You get the playability and in some sense the pace of Call of Duty, with the ever-present fear of impending death from a well put together ArmA mission. Run and gun works in some situations, but more often than not a good solid bit of squad based teamwork is the way forward - and the people i've played with so far have been team playersYes there are bugs, and sometimes they frustrate... You can plug an entire clip into an enemy without blunting his accuracy - you'll still get an AK to the face. But the sheer tension and ultimate satisfaction that comes from a win make up for it. And i'm sure this game still has a lot to give anyway.Highly recommend if you're in to squad play and don't mind dying. A lot.AK to the faceDead "

												1. Should you quit CS:GO/Arma for this game?      Yes.2. Why?     INTENSE, Cool maps, amazing sound effects(especially bullets flying and hiting near you, it is terrifying), nice players, different game modes, all of them are fun, realistic, nice graphics, no pay-to-wins, haven't seen any hacker so far, balanced guns and respective roles (sniper, fighter, etc), grenades hurts a lot so beware, no crashes, I am running this game in a regular laptop so don't worry about specs.3. Downsides?     If you play it like a fool, it will repetitive since you are going to die every 30 seconds and then wait 30 seconds to 'respawn' in some modes. You will die a lot in the beginning, until you get to know the map, but you will be so excited that it will not be repetitive. *Note: There is a 'hardcore mode' where you die once and that's it. Dead meat.I would recommend it to my friends but I don't have any.			"

Arguably the best tactical shooter available for GNU/Linux*.Features Realistic, intense gunplay. Vast arsenal of real life, modern weaponry and equipment. Many game modes. Big player base, busy servers. Source engine runs perfectly on Linux. Workshop items make the game infinitely customizable. Want to play as kurdish Peshmerga against Daesh? You can. Want to play as Russians vs Hamas? You can.  Want to play as Colombian army vs somali insurgents? You can!!!10/10, truly an outstanding tactical shooter.* Verdún or Interstellar Marines (still in alpha) are the only runner ups I know off. "

												Insurgency is TACTICAL realistic multiplayer game but you do not what is the meaning of tactical for this game.Insurgency tactics : 1-)Throwing nades and yelling allahu akbar in the mic.2-)Playing arabic music.**Do not worry If enemy team yells better as a team - probably they are going to die for their case and you are going to win.Also your some of crazy teammates can kill you  If you kill the guy who is yelling allahu akbar in the mic.(All servers have unique allahu akbar remix musics do not worry.)**			"

I've spent a lot of time in PVP and enjoy the hunt as well as Co op with the different styles of game play such as bullet time.   The game is unforgiving if you try and play it like an arena based run n gun FPS game. You'll need to approach this game as its own beast and give it a chance.

												Great game, has a good potency of realism yet is still fast paced enough to keep the flow of action. The game makes you rely on instincts (no indication of enemy location, no magazine count, no mini map, just instinct.) It also subtly forces you to work with your teammates instead of going lone wolf. Weather it be coop or pvp you must rely on communication with your team mates or else face losing. Overall I would highly recommend this game for someone wishing to break away from major FPS titles such as Battlefield and Call of Duty. My ONLY complaint about this game so far is how privately owned servers are allowed to monetize their ads. Now don't get me wrong, if a person wishes to host a server they should have the right to monetize it to gain revenue so that they can keep the server running, what I don't like is how the ads uncontrollably BLARE from my speakers. Yes...The ads that play upon entering a server will blare at full volume, and there is no way to turn it off or turn it down. This is a highly obnoxious way of flaunting about an ad, and makes it so I cannot hear anything else until the ad is done playing. Again, as I mentioned before, monetizing a serve is okay, but it should be done in a more subtle way.			"

												Insurgency doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. It's a no-frills, no BS first person shooter. No unlocking guns, everything is balanced and there's an assortment of maps of varying sizes. There's a variety of gamemodes. There's no vehicles and everyone has equal opportunity. There's several classes that you can play to fill your role on the battlefield. What's more, there's new content coming out for the game constantly and is always free and immediately available to use. Plus you can use the Steam Workshop to personalize the game to make it your own.			"

												Incredible tactical and realistic shooter. I am not the greatest at FPS, and quit playing many FPS games years ago shortly after CS became stand alone from HL mod. If you are looking for CoD 2.0, leave now and don't pay for it... you'll jus get annoyed when you try to sprint straight into the enemy respawn area and get gunned down by the entire team at once. Mind you, it'll only take about 2 of the 50 bullets that will hit you to ensure you die... if not just one. However, if you are looking for something that will challenge you both as a solo player and a group friendly player, take this one up. This game has definitely renewed my faith in the FPS saga.Tactical shooter is a bit of an understatement. It's probably one of the more realistic shooters on the market at this time. Pull the trigger once or twice while the weapons on the player, you're going to get the kill. Doesnt take a full clip to slaughter someone, or have them turn and sprint + knife at the same time (coughs... COD).No hud, no map, no bs. Just your sights, a couple mags, and your team. You'll get a quick glance at how many mags you got (for about 2-3 seconds) or grenades when you weapon swap - thats about it. Sounds also are very realistic. It is hard to find a game that actually includes a bullet crack when one zips too close to your head (as it does in real life). The gun sounds are comparable to the weapon counter parts as well.Graphically, I see no room to complain. Gameplay - I am still learning the different types of modes and the maps, but the game is solid. I barely hit any buggy issues like my bullets magically vanishing when I shoot at a person, or the wall disappearing and I fall through the game.. I will say you will be forced to learn the maps, its neccessary to get any type of advantage. And those advantages, you'll need em. I love the fact that with 1-2 shots a player is down and out, none of this 15+ 5.56mm bullets to kill one man... Overall I give this a 9/10 - and I would DEFINITELY recommend buying this if you desire a challenging FPS that is fun and fair.			"

The handling of firearms in this game feels very authentic, noise, recoil and movement is very believeable, its extremly satisfying getting kills when rounds penetrate peoples ""cover"", the game even recognizes a round in the chamber to your round count, I dont know of any other modern shooter that does that. I only wish they changed up the way damage works, foot shots should not be instantly fatal like they are.			"

												Perfect pvp on pc game. Very realistic, it takes 2-1 bullets to kill someone unless you use a small caliber on a soldier's chest that is equipped with heavy or light armor. I like that there are 3 game modes, Co Op (One team of Players and One team of very smart and tactical enemies), Multiplayer (The typical PvP, there are about 8 game modes), and Practice (You and your ai team vs another ai team, BEWARE as the friendly ai no matter what will be totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and my solution is to team kill them and you do all the real work after). Overall great game 10/10 and i would definitely pay for a dlc or even a second one maybe in Afghanistan? or even cooler would be Vietnam. Thanks guys for this awesome game for only 15 dollars, will be buying your future games.			"

												I know that I haven't played this game for too long, but I just love it, so I feel like writing this review.First of all, you can get this game pretty cheap on summer sale or winter sale so that's a bonus.Second, if you are into hardcore military fps shooters, that's for you.The classes, the teams, the maps, the guns, are just really well made and the sound really gets your attention, atleast it did for me.The only thing they can do to improve the game is to change the way you buy your weapons, I mean, you can buy the weapons just from a specific class, not all the guns available in your team. They could make a gamemode where there are no classes (just a limit for snipers, rocketeers, etc, in a team) and you can buy any guns you want and are available in your team or even looking into changing the whole buying system.With all of that being said it is a enjoyable game, I haven't encountered any bug that can change my gameplay in any ways, so that's another bonus.I really recommend the game, and as I said, if you get it on a sale it's perfect, but I can say that even the whole price is worth it if you enjoy this type of games. I really recommend buying it. 8/10.			"

												I only played 4 games during the free period and absolutely loved it. Infinitely better than Counter Strike: Global Offencive ever was and ever will be. I didn't run into any negative things during my games, so I can't say anything bad about it to be honest. 10/10			"

												Insurgency is a great game. It makes you feel like one of your kills might actually help your team. Your kills have weight, and they arent just like one person you mowed down in call of duty. It is a tactical game, but is relatively easy to learn. The point system adds a unique way of customizing your soldier, and the role system makes you feel like a sniper when your a sniper. The point system also negates excessive farming for weapons, and lets all new players unlock all the guns. Also, the game doesnt have a horrible commmunity (in my opinion) and great developers who know what there doing. I recommend Insurgency for everyone!			"

												This game is a MUST have for any FPS lover .......  I admit its a HC game ""1 shot kill type"" but thats the beauty of it.. no free for all BS , team based gameplay ... if u play solo u die in an instant ... thats what makes it very different and fresh + the devs are making a very formidable effort, they support the game in a way that shows that they are true gamers . just get it and u wont regret it :D			"

												Perfect pvp on pc game. Very realistic, it takes 2-1 bullets to kill someone unless you use a small caliber on a soldier's chest that is equipped with heavy or light armor. I like that there are 3 game modes, Co Op (One team of Players and One team of very smart and tactical enemies), Multiplayer (The typical PvP, there are about 8 game modes), and Practice (You and your ai team vs another ai team, BEWARE as the friendly ai no matter what will be totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and my solution is to team kill them and you do all the real work after). Overall great game 10/10 and i would definitely pay for a dlc or even a second one maybe in Afghanistan? or even cooler would be Vietnam. Thanks guys for this awesome game for only 15 dollars, will be buying your future games.			"

												This is one of the few games that I will actually take the time to do a review on. Why? Because its freaking amazing!! The aim of this game is to provide combat realism, but not have overly long, drawn out and occasionally boring scenarios such as in ArmA (Arma's still a heck of a lot of fun though, check that game out too!).This game has stunning graphics, seriously. It reminds me of an action movie- and it plays like one too! The game can also provide lots of ambience that matches right with whats going on. I was playing a game with bots- I was the last man standing with 0 waves left on my team and two left on the enemies. I had to sneak around the map, camping corners and carefully sniping all the enemy team mates. That moment was incredibly suspenseful- I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and any time a bullet flew near me, I'd jump back in my seat despite myself.The larger firefights are really cool too. Most of the maps are medium sized, allowing for longer-distance engagements as well as close quarters, action packed adrenaline filled spray-and-pray scenarios. Each match is a little different from the next, providing a TON of replayability. I'd reccomend it to anyone into milsim like shooters. "

												Excellent Tactical FPS. The handling of firearms in this game feels very authentic, noise, recoil and movement is very believeable, its extremly satisfying getting kills when rounds penetrate peoples ""cover"", the game even recognizes a round in the chamber to your round count, I dont know of any other modern shooter that does that. I only wish they changed up the way damage works, foot shots should not be instantly fatal like they are.			"

												A slow-paced, realistic, team-oriented military style shooter.Some key points:Slow paced gameplay, sprinting around to meet an opponent with their gun drawn will likely end badly.Excellent sound design with realistic audio - Bullet cracks flying past you, impact noises and soldiers on the battlefield yelling as they are suppressed.Equipment management with limited supply, balance out your strategy before a fight.Realistic damage modelling - You will likely get killed with 1 bullet. First to land the hit wins the gunfight.Limited HUD, save for compass. No ammo kount, most servers have no killfeed.Easy to get into, difficult to master.The most enjoyable games where you have to work as a team to win.I would highly recommend this, very nice to unwind to, or to wreak havoc.

												CAUTION: THIS GAME IS NOTHING LIKE COD OR BATTLEFIELD.

Fast AND Slow paced game. You want to capture points fast, so that you get more ' waves' or your team mates respawn or you win the game, but you always have to slow down and check the tiniest bit of detail to prevent you form dying.   A variety of gamemodes and maps (a lot more after the nightfall update), and loads of weapon choices.This is where I find the game exciting:  The game gets so tensed if you can't find an enemy because you know that they're somewhere out in the map, and then suddenly, BOOM they shoot you and you die before you even know it.

Posted: December 30, 2014
												I'm very impressed with this game.First off, Insurgency is very entertaining. Easy to learn and boasting a wide variety of gameplay options, the game is both simple and complex. Situations vary from drawn out, long range battles to quick, almost twitch-shooter style firefights. Sometimes you need to destroy an object, sometimes capture one, and sometimes just kill as many enemies as you can. In addition to the standard pvp gamemodes, Insurgency adds a few of its own, as well as a coop gamemode that's fantastic for learning the ropes and practicing against bots while still getting a feel for multiplayer.Insurgency is on the upper half of the scale as far as realism goes. The minimalistic HUD and the way the gun handles creates a very immersive experience, and the game has a million little touches that work wonders to keep that immersion going, from the way your gun wavers when fatigued to the way that firing from the hip requires you to actually aim the gun at the enemy, not just position them in the middle of your screen and click. High damage from guns means that you can't go charging into battle like some sort of adrenaline-high Call-of-Duty bullet sponge, and keeps combat drawn out and deliberate, favoring a playstyle of firing slow, well-aimed shots instead of spraying everywhere. That's not to say it's INCREDIBLY realistic - Healing from gunshot wounds in a matter of seconds, improbable aiming skills, and the like - but it definitely isn't Counter-Strike or Call of Duty.The game boasts a tag of ""tactical"" and it earns it. While I wouldn't say it requires you to make larger strategic decisions, outside of ""what point should I go to,"" and ""what's the safest and fastest way to get there?"" it does require you to make smart decisions both inside and outside of a firefight. ""Is this the best place I could be standing?"" ""Knowing my skill, can I expect myself to cover all three of these entrances or should I risk losing ground to limit the number of directions enemies can come from?"" ""Can I handle this point by myself, or should I call for support?"" In combat, you'll be expected to make good choices to stay alive, even if they're as simple as, ""Is it safe to poke my head out now?""On another note, the community for this game is great. Usually, you'd expect ""the internet"" and ""cooperation"" to go together about as well as oil and politics, but the players I've met so far were very nice. We all have a good laugh when we get obliterated, and we all congratulate each other when a teammate pulls off an unexpected victory. More experienced or skilled players are quick to provide helpful advice. When a player sees a role that needs to be filled, they're quick to jump into it. So far, I haven't met any real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and while a few people take the game a bit seriously, the mic chat is free of 12 year olds threatening to do terrible things to my mother. Even our squeakers are friendly.Overall, I highly recommend this game to anybody who enjoys FPS games like Counter-Strike, but would like something slower and more thoughtful.			"

												lets be honest, who has time in their busy lives to run off to some foreign dustbowl, join up with some local insurgent fighters, attend the day camps and seminars and then wage a futile, yet endless, war against a western military industrial complex? Not me, But now you can with the game the Kabul Post called ""جيد جدا، سبحان الله"" If slow, methodical pacing is for you, if you get a tingle when a decades old Russian made assault weapon is thrust into your hands and a man who uses big words tells you that those gentlemen on the otherside of the map have come to destory your world, if getting killed by a guy you never saw again and again is what makes you moisten your big boy pants then Insurgency is for you. 8/10. Pretty good. Better then the mod its based on. As frustrating as fighting an actual insurgency.			"

												What do you get when you mix Counter-Strike and Battlefield 3? You get this beauty of a title. The co-op is the best part of this game. While there is multiplayer where you verse off against teams, there's a co-op mode where you play with other friends and fight off a bunch of Insurgents or Security forces and it's very addicting. Totally recommend this game.			"

												If you ever play with me (past name - Hobo Potato) , i will lead you and teach you how to play, you can add me and if im playing ill surely help you learn... and stay alive :D. i remember a coop match in heights where we lost 8 times even with great communication and I had a great team although at first we were all strangers. The AI are so good that they can take out 5 outta 6 guys with just an RPG. we went in pairs 2 by 2 to spread out so that we all dont bunch up and die by a single RPG again cuz we died several times like that. If you are into TEAMWORK, this game is the REAL DEAL for you, cuz even if you're with random strangers, you end up making good friendships with them and you guys will probably end up playing with each other the next time around again.It's rewarding that there is actual TEAMWORK and not twitch shooting or going lone wolf, you really have to keep your teammates alive and watch their backs.A mic is optional but i recommend it.The community is awesome, no mic spammers, rarely have i seen any that are like garrys mod mic spammers.Almost everyone is nice, about 95% of the people, I rarely have seen anything like TKs that much unless it's on accident.and IT'S SOOO MUCH better than the CSGO community.

												The game plays out very well. Its, its own game in it self, I've not seen any like it (Gamemode wise). But it still has a feel of counter strike to it, and in my mind that is not a bad thing as I also love Counter Strike. I'd say its an Upgraded version of Counter Strike, but thats just me.In most game modes, if you die, a team mate will need to catch an enemy objective. It is like Search and Destroy from the Call of Duty franchice, but you can respawn by one of the team mates at least doing the objective for a change. It is a very team based game, as there are a lot of firefights. May it be in a street or a hallway, you always need your team there to back you up. So if you are the last one alive you can sneek over and take an objective, and all of your team will respawn. Not only things like that but the gun play is really realistic, as you can shoot at an enemy... And he will actually die, rather than having to be shot 15 times before he dies. The game overall is very realistic in my mind, as when you shoot your gun it creates smoke at the end of your barrel, and varies depending on what gun it is. You can also shoot at the ground, and instead of an odd bullet hole, a huge pile of dust (Wether you are on a snow map or a sand map, you will get snow or sand). Cover is quite a critical thing in this game, as if you are shot more than once, you will most likely die. I hope the review was to your liking... I have only explained some of the minor things in the game, there is so much more to it.10/10Have fun! (If you buy it of course)			"

												Insurgency is a fantastic shooter and should be more widely supported by the shooter crowd. It brings the smaller map designs which COD is known for yet sticking to the realistic combat you would expect of a military simulation. If you have not found that multiplayer shooter which offers a tactical combat experience, I HIGHLY recommend you to run out and purchase this ASAP. You will not be let down!			"

												Holy Moly. This game has come very far! I loved it when it was a mod, and now I love it even more.The overall feeling of the weapons is highly believable, it takes just one shot take down an enemy. Suppression effects are marvellous and make you eager to just suppress an enemy with rapid fire while your buddy (Who you should have some kind of voice communication with) goes in and flanks him. Teamwork is easily created!The bullet impact effects are also very subtle and help add to the fear of death in this game. Very good. The ragdoll effects are far from the comical exploding and flying through the air effects, instead dead targets instantly fall to the ground and remain there.The UI is minimalistic, you have no idea about your ammo count, except when you count your bullets. You can modify your weapons with all kinds of attachments, especially on the ""Security"" side, while the Insurgents mostly field WW2 equipment. (I saw an MP40!)The maps/levles/areas are highly detailed and made with a lot of love. The audio effects used in those maps add to immersion even further. And all the equipment and vehicles that are used (static, not useable) are accurate to the era.So this game is all in all amazing, and in my opinion the next ""Red Orchestra"". So if you are into realistic firefights, this game is gold.From a gamer's perpective I give this 9/10. It didn't make the 10/10 because most servers currently lag and this causes a jittery visual to all the animations.			"

												I went into this game thinking it was another quick conversion of a mod turned standalone but I was blown away how good this game is. Many people come into this game thinking ""COD"" and are destroyed but if you take your time, work together and pace yourself. You will end up having an amazing wicked time. There are times in the game where I am so overwhelmed with taking fire that my thought pattern is compromised and because and confused shell of a man.If you want a game with harsh punishment for COD strats and a solid realism of an Arma game, this is for you.

												Insurgency is a great game. For an alpha, it has absolutely amazing gameplay and few glitches and bugs. One of the best FPS I've ever played and probably the most realistic one too with realistic recoil (no spray), prone (which most PC FPS don't have), and aim down (which most source games lack), some things are questionable like maybe graphics or the smoke or flash effects. Those hopefully can be fixed over time as this is still just an alpha. Overall insurgency is a top of the line game that I would recommend to anyone.			"

												Great release and few bugs to be found. It's a fast-paced FPS that is difficult to survive in, if not careful where your lifespan may be as short as in Red Orchestra 2. It is rare for one person to be a one man army like in Counterstrike and the game is better for it when more casual players can actually compete with those who are very competitive, if you understand the fundamentals and have common sense.

Nothing more hearth warming than seeing team using voice over, moving in squads and watching everyones back while pushing objectives.A welcome change amongst FPS games. :)			"

												lets be honest, who has time in their busy lives to run off to some foreign dustbowl, join up with some local insurgent fighters, attend the day camps and seminars and then wage a futile, yet endless, war against a western military industrial complex? Not me, But now you can with the game the Kabul Post called ""جيد جدا، سبحان الله"" If slow, methodical pacing is for you, if you get a tingle when a decades old Russian made assault weapon is thrust into your hands and a man who uses big words tells you that those gentlemen on the otherside of the map have come to destory your world, if getting killed by a guy you never saw again and again is what makes you moisten your big boy pants then Insurgency is for you. 8/10.

												If you ever play with me (past name - Hobo Potato) , i will lead you and teach you how to play, you can add me and if im playing ill surely help you learn... and stay alive :D. i remember a coop match in heights where we lost 8 times even with great communication and I had a great team although at first we were all strangers. The AI are so good that they can take out 5 outta 6 guys with just an RPG. we went in pairs 2 by 2 to spread out so that we all dont bunch up and die by a single RPG again cuz we died several times like that. If you are into TEAMWORK, this game is the REAL DEAL for you, cuz even if you're with random strangers, you end up making good friendships with them and you guys will probably end up playing with each other the next time around again.It's rewarding that there is actual TEAMWORK and not twitch shooting or going lone wolf, you really have to keep your teammates alive and watch their backs.A mic is optional but i recommend it.The community is awesome, no mic spammers, rarely have i seen any that are like garrys mod mic spammers.Almost everyone is nice, about 95% of the people, I rarely have seen anything like TKs that much unless it's on accident.and IT'S SOOO MUCH better than the CSGO community.

												Insurgency is a great MP-based hardcore tactical CQB FPS that has perfectly combined gameplay elements and ideas inspired by older FPS titles such as Counter-Strike, Ghost Recon, Red Orchestra and from the older Battlefield game titles as well which gives us, the players, such a great gaming experience like no other game does out there. Teamwork is very essential in this game, having a microphone is a must as well to have that 100% game experience and you have to rely on your team mates to complete all task objectives in order to win or by killing all enemy combatants.I can assure you that it feels very rewarding when doing an objective or defending the control points by keeping the enemy team at bay, it also helps a lot being a total team-player by helping to spot enemy positions and informing your team of so for a counterattack and the best of all is using your brain to outsmart the enemy and use different tactics to flank them, lure them in for the kill or set up a nice trap for your team to finish the job.A tip that I highly recommend when playing this game is to make sure you have killed & cleared the objective area point of enemy forces by searching for dead bodies when a firefight is over and communicate over all with your team for intel, since there's no kill-cam/kill confirmation feedback that tells you so (default/official NWI servers) and I highly do recommend all of you to get this game if you are truly tired of the dumbed-down games that has affected this generation of FPS games for a long time, such games as CoD or the latest BF games that pampers to casual, mainstream no skill players that only enjoy brainless gameplay, overpriced & game breaking DLC, stupid unlocks and the recycled garbage for every single year.Cheers! and see ya' all in the front-lines of Insurgency.

												Have to say, with the price of 14,99€, I got something really special.I've always been more hardcore player, when it comes to FPS games. ArmA etc. Never been too much into CoD kinda things and I pretty much devour Planetside 2. But Insurgency is great. I love how it drops in the middle. Easy to learn, yet not too run 'n gun. I like co-op gamemode the most, AI actually can do something. In short words, Insurgency is challenging, fun and different from others. I think that map designs are well-made. Good hours into it and will have more. Today, 39th of October we will be getting Night Ops kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥ Can't wait. Go buy this.			"

												I'm not gonna lie: On the first glance it looked like every other military shooter trash. But after reading the overall very positive reviews (one guy had over 1000hours played!) I decided to give it a try.To make it short: This game is amazing! It's something between CSGO and CoD4 Hardcore Mode. The netcode is perfect, the sounds are extremely well done and the overall feeling makes your heart beat faster and faster. You could be dead within a second, not knowing where this guy shot you from.The graphics are better than what you see in most of the videos on Youtube. It obviously doesn't look like BF4 but ♥♥♥♥ it, you can acutally play this game and have tons of fun.You can crouch, lean, prone, aim down the sights and use voice chat to communicate with your teammates. While communicating is important, it is not the case that you can't have fun alone in public games. People are very nice and I haven't found one single COD kid insulting you as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Great game in my opinion and a huge surprise!

												First off. I love this game, couldnt recommend it highly enough. I really hope this game gets the attention it deserves. Its honestly really well made and balanced. This game is a great throwback to games that actually made your heart race. Theres an andrenaline rush that comes with winning a round or killing your foe in a 1v1. Thats a feeling that i think has gone missing in a lot of titles. Especially the AAA ones... this will bring you back (or introduce you) to the feeling of being in a competitive match in CS1.6. I like the fact that there isnt a crazy amount of guns in the game. Just your basics, AK 47 ak47u, m16, ar15, m9 makarov, mp40, benelli, m24, mpk5 ump45 and mosin nagant. So youre thinking, thats no good. Where is the variety? But trust me, each gun feels unique enough to find a favorite and all the weapons will put your foe on his bum if you master them. Sniping feels crisp. The recoil in the game is also better than any modern military shooter out there. (ive tried them all) and it makes for awesome firefights that actually make you feel like youre in the midst of a battle. it has a learning curve, but that is welcomed. Now a days games are just pick up and play, and just about any idiot can get a crazy kill streak and wipe out your whole team. Not so here. You will have to work for those kills. That being said. Im glad. If you want another point and click fps. Look elsewhere. If you want something refreshing, thrill inducing but still bringing fps back to their basics, this is the game for you. Give it a chance, for 15 bucks, you seriously cant go wrong. All that being said, see you in the hellfire soldier.			"

												I've seen someone write this into a review so I thought I would add it. This game is what would happen if FPS breeding goes haywire. It's like Rainbow Six had a baby with Red Orchestra and their nanny was Counter Strike. It is simply one of the best FPS game of our time. Quick, tactical gameplay with team coordination and realistic outcomes. 1-2 bullets to kill and the best feeling shooting of ANY FPS game. That is high praise. Considering this game released right into the firing line (Gun Pun) of the likes of CS:GO and Arma. The controls are tight and responsive but still simulating your characters weight. The graphics and video quality are tremendous. There are some slight glithces here and there but it is very good looking. Everything in the game just feels good. I would like to have a way to walk instead of walking quickly so it disguises your footsteps and maybe have a way to blind fire whilst leaning towards a corner to lay down surpressing fire as supression is a big part of this game. A solid 9/10 for me and I recommend that you buy it, If you are into FPS/Mil Sim games like I am. Thanks for reading!			"

But of course, in a whole different ambientation, that i personally like a lot.As you may know, this game started as a free sourcemod, and now is a complete game, this means that the developers know what are they doing, and they know how to make a good balanced game. Someone said in his review: ""modders as developers is great because they are gamers too"", that's exactly what i think.So if you like hardcore fps and want something new, give it a try, it will not disappoint you.PS: sorry if there is any grammar error.

												A game like war. One does not simply cross an open street here. Intense, well functioning, dangerous, well supported. Very fast and also very slow-paced tactical shooter with some hard, but really smooth gameplay.No HUD, zero kiddo-comforts. All man. Awesome game, buy it. Worth the price many times.			"

												This game is very realistic and fun once you get past the learning curve. This isn't a typical Call of Duty game, and as such, promotes teamwork quite extensively. What the game lacks in graphic quality (it's not too bad), it makes up in gameplay and its realism. I highly recommend this if you're looking for a realistic FPS. 9/10			"

												Graphics:  It's a source game, as such it's not exactly a benchmark game.  Having said that, the game has a lot of nice touches that I don't see in most games like smoke trails coming from the end of your barrel after firing, gun smoke projection during firing, and seeing not only whether my teammates flashlight is on, but where it's landing in the environment.Gameplay:  Low health and limitied/no respawns (depending on game mode) combine to offer a much slower, less hectic combat experience.  An experience that I thouroughly enjoy, but it's not for everyone.  I've never seen non-lethal gernade types be so important in a modern combat game than in Insurgency (flash, smoke) and that's refreshing to see.  The game is built around a supply point system that the players use to purchase the gear they'll be using in the match, not completely unlike Counter Strike, but you don't lose all your stuff when you die.  They give you enough supply points that you can be decently kitted out, but you won't be able to get everything you want, so you'll have to think hard about what you can do without.Overall:  I'm really over the moon about this game.  The slower combat experience from Insurgency is unlike anything I've experienced prior.  I came for the COOP, but ended up staying for the competative multiplayer.  I've always liked objective based games, but lately the past two battlefield titles left me disappointed.  I felt they were far too hectic, too much going on for me to get any kind of teamwork going between me and my friends.  The community is small but dedicated, and I've never had trouble finding a populated match.  This is a classic case of quality over quantity, the developers priced it very well considering the amount of content there currently is, and they are working on producing more.  I'm very excited for Insurgency, and I think it will have a bright future.			"

												First off. I love this game, couldnt recommend it highly enough. I really hope this game gets the attention it deserves. Its honestly really well made and balanced. This game is a great throwback to games that actually made your heart race. Theres an andrenaline rush that comes with winning a round or killing your foe in a 1v1. Thats a feeling that i think has gone missing in a lot of titles. Especially the AAA ones... this will bring you back (or introduce you) to the feeling of being in a competitive match in CS1.6. I like the fact that there isnt a crazy amount of guns in the game. Just your basics, AK 47 ak47u, m16, ar15, m9 makarov, mp40, benelli, m24, mpk5 ump45 and mosin nagant. So youre thinking, thats no good. Where is the variety? But trust me, each gun feels unique enough to find a favorite and all the weapons will put your foe on his bum if you master them. Sniping feels crisp. The recoil in the game is also better than any modern military shooter out there. (ive tried them all) and it makes for awesome firefights that actually make you feel like youre in the midst of a battle. it has a learning curve, but that is welcomed. Now a days games are just pick up and play, and just about any idiot can get a crazy kill streak and wipe out your whole team. Not so here. You will have to work for those kills. That being said. Im glad. If you want another point and click fps. Look elsewhere. If you want something refreshing, thrill inducing but still bringing fps back to their basics, this is the game for you. Give it a chance, for 15 bucks, you seriously cant go wrong. All that being said, see you in the hellfire soldier.			"

												Great Game! If you appreciate tactical shooters with loads of realistic mechanics look no further.  From the rounds snapping over your head to the blistering shellshock of a well placed grenade, Insurgency keeps it simple, fresh and intense as hell.  The weapon customization is balanced and innovative with many game changing attachments that suit your unique playstyle.  The minimal UI, no minimap and lack of hit indicators elevate the intensity with no real method of knowing you eliminated your target or where your opposition might be hiding; while also giving you an element of stealth that evade most AAA titles. Lastly, it's as flashy as it needs to be while delivering smooth unadulterated violence right to the comfort of your own home.			"

												Probably the best FPS on Steam.The game is powered by the Source engine, which allows you to run it on a potato, while still kicking♥♥♥♥♥ The only source game that looks better than this is maybe Contagion.The sound quality is freaking awesome, you'll feel like you are actually there, fighting those damned insurgents.The combination of the arcade and realism style is so damn well done, that I cannot think of any words that could describe it. Probably the best elements combined from Red Orchestra, Battlefield and Counter-Strike.This is the game you must pick up if you can.			"

												I can’t remember when I cursed that much while playing a multiplayer shooter, Insurgency is a multiplayer tactical and highly realistic shooter, the maps are not the best and the enemy AI in co-op would need some adjustment, but other than that Insurgency works pretty well. 7.5/10			"

												Insurgency is the most intense and realistic shooter I've played in a while.No hitmarkers, no killfeeds, no ammo counts, no health bar, no crosshairs. Just a magazine counter, a timer, and your objectives.The main gamemode (and pretty much the only gamemode I play) is a bit like TF2's control point gamemode, except with more points to capture, and some of them needing to be destroyed.The combat can get scary, bullets whirring past you, only inches away from killing you. You shoot someone, and your only indicator of his death is his corpse on the ground.It's especially fun with friends, or even just good teammates. Having good coordination and strategy is key to this game.I've heard this game is a lot like Red Orchestra, but I haven't played that game, so I wouldn't know. But if you're a fan of games like that, I'd suggest buying this game.			"

												I've been playing since the mod, not very actively, but have played both and bought insurgency in Early Acess, and i gotta say, even in Alpha, this game was a beast,  just gorgeous, intense, tactical and cooperative, you get adrenaline rushes with footsteps of friendlies or enemies.You really depend on a good tactical team to win the game, either ur attacking or defending, it's all about positioning, recon and communication, and then is just getting it done, it's like a co-op vs co-op multiplayer, get it? no? Buy it idgaf, get in a 32 player server, go all stealthy and tactical Q'ing and E'ing walls and you'll see what i meanGreat job for the devs, surely a replace for most tactical cooperative fps			"

What Other Shooters Should Be Aiming ForI remember when COD:BO came out, I was a fan of the hardcore and barebones game modes. There was no option to play hardcore barebones though. You had to choose between one or the other. I remember thinking, ""wouldn't it be nice if they had a hardcore barebones game mode"". Even though this game has weapon attatchments, this for me is as close as it gets.With kills taking only 1-2 shots from your mag, it feels almost more like a paintball game in comparison to other shooters i've played. The guns in insurgency feel and sound great too. Gun fights are intense in the sense that you have no hit markers and no way to tell if you killed the person other than a visual confirmation. So popping your head out for that second look could mean death, or that you're clear to advance. Something else thats nice about this game is that the  rich don't get richer . Unlike most other popular shooters, there is no leveling system to unlock guns/attachments and increase character stats. And for ingame there are no killsteaks. This is a game that focuses more on the core game mechanics than visual polish. In short, if you are looking for a shooter that has a realistic feel and is tactical, i highly recommend this game.

												Haven't played very much yet but it looks pretty good. The game feels like it's all about camping or you will die. The graphics ain't nothing special but it works. You don't unlock new guns and there is no ranks. It is what it says in my opinion and is a really good fps game. 8/10 but it's an indie game so for its budget, it's really good			"

												""He is the Shaman, and we are his followers"" -Insurgent that I was playing withFor 23 years, the United States of America has been under oppression from the terrorists and iraqi soldiers at war. Thousands of American soldiers have been wounded or killed. In order to pay tribute to the American soldiers we've lost, a game was released to the public.It is called: Insurgency.This is our time to shine.Not as a community but,as a whole.
