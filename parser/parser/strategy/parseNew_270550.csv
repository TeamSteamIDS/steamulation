""Yet another simple but good game ..."" This game makes fun! You kite around a lantern and must survive several waves. On 4th wave you'll have enough money to buy a better weapon (I prefer the sniper rifle) or start to build up your camp. Therefore are wooden or steel palisades and turrets where you can mount all weapons.Every wave you evolve more. But the zombies do also. Each property of their damage, life and speed raises by a factor. There are even more effective weapons like a rocketlauncher, the tesla coil or a lasercannon, but the ammo is mostly too expensive or the reload time is quite too long. Another mode is the endless night mode. which you gain after 10 waves of survival. In endless night mode there are no palisades. Weapons spawn by random of killed zombies. Here you must survive 5 min max. The MP is stable and makes fun. Achievements are partly deactivated for MP. Don't miss this little but nice game. The devs have promised some more content if you support them.			"

												This game is a great arcade-esque style shoot em' up and I adore it. I played for a few hours with a friend and it was a lot of fun but I have a few suggestions to improve gameplay:1. SKILLS-You can put a point after every round into a skill-Skills could be like: accuracy, damage, run speed. and scavenger (get more from cash/supply drops)2. GUN UPGRADES-Pay to get various upgrades/attatchments to your guns-Such as: incendiary (does dmg over time) explosive (hurts more than one target) or like an increase in damage, accuracy or firing speed3.CHARACTERS-We need just a little bit of character development, who is ""The Girl""? Or ""The SWAT""?-I suggest adding MORE characters and giving them each starting attributes depending on who they are like: The SWAT gets a defense bonus due to his bulletproof vest.4.TRAPS-You should add more traps and trap like elements to the game-Such as a bear trap that costs, say, $50 and you could put them in a 1/4 space of a normal tile-Fire traps would be cool5.PALISADES-Palisades should decay with damage and you should have to pay to repair them-The advantage of this would be you could add in palisade damage. As in they do damage to zombies based on how new and freshly repaired they are.These are just a few suggestions that I thought could make this game better, even though it already is pretty addicting.-ZacP.S. Add some detail to the map, just a few cracks in the concrete or litter. Something to make it more immersive.EDIT: Nearly a year later, I played this game again and saw that the devs practically took all my ideas and implemented them and I couldn't be happier! Skills and traps have been added and so have harmful palisades! They also added a couple of aesthetic details to the map! Awesome work guys and thanks for using my ideas :D			"

Zombie sounds are okish but leave a lot to be desired.- While most guns are useable, there just isn't quite enough weapons to keep you amused.- In the end of it all, you will end up behind barricades, fiercely fighting to keep yourself alive with super-strong zombies that take more than 1 clip of ammo to kill each one.

												I could likely sum up this entire review by simply stating the title of the game in question: Yet Another Zombie Defense. Intended as a sideways joke at the ridiculous number of zombie themed games flooding the market, it extends beyond the name to every aspect of the game, resulting in a bland and unimaginative isometric shooter that even for the low price is hardly worth a second glance.If you've ever played a wave based survival shooter you already know exactly how YAZD functions. Enemies come at you in increasingly difficult swarms, which you then counter by buying guns and defense in between rounds. Rinse, repeat, and try to stay alive as long as you can. It's a formula that's been done dozens of times over, but when executed properly can be immensely addictive and rewarding.You can probably see where I'm going with this, so I'll just spell it out: YAZD doesn't get it right. A surface summarization of the many games that inspired it, it has the right pieces to potentially make a great game but doesn't know how to use them effectively. Progression is severely limited and uninteresting, with only a handful of unimpressive guns to choose from and even fewer defenses, as well as no upgrade system or other means to provide something to keep playing for beyond a highscore. Enemies are repetitive to far too great a degree, making for a dull experience after the first few waves as you begin to go through the motions, and the banal presentation leaves a great deal to be desired.To be perfectly fair, YAZD isn't broken on any fundamental level, it's just not fun. Everything it attempts has already been done infinitely better in so many other games, that I can't bring myself to recommend it for even a quick look. There's an argument to be made for it being cheap so expectations are obviously lowered, but personally I would recommend spending a bit more and getting something more polished and deserving of your time. You might be able to squeeze an hour of enjoyment out of it with a friend if you really try, but that doesn't make up Yet Another Zombie Defense being as hollow and lifeless as the undead it pits against you.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												Yet Another Zombie Defense+ Creepy soundtrack+ Cheap game+ Playable with at least 4 players+ You can play with your friends+ Must have a good strategy+ The weapon upgrade system works better. ""Dead"" or killed zombies drop money ( and health) which allow you to purchase upgrades between levels. A traditional approach surely, but it works well. While these are basic improvements over I MA3D, they are significant in that they make this game enjoyable to play...So if you need to kill zombies, this one will satiate better than the competition :)			"

												Short ReviewEver heard of Orion: Prelude? Terrible launch game with infinite amount of bug and generally unpleasant gameplay that got relaunched not once but 3 times but eventually end up somewhat good enough to play and cheap enough to justify the few remaining bugs? Well Yet Another Zombie Defense is a bit like that except it never got relaunched, there was hardly any bugs, the graphics are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and contents are barebone. Yet I am actually recommending it because:A) It does what it say it does well which is a horde based game defending against zombie.B) It was already super cheap to begin with. And C) It actually got updated.At its core Yet Another Zombie defense is a topdown shooter that has you defending a highly important streetlight for as long possible and to accomplish this you kill zombies to get money for turrets, barricades, ammo and more guns with random drops happening throughout the match. It used to be that the game has practically zero content but now it has more turret and barricade types and far more stable netcode.BTW Netcode as in COOP. Thats right one of the major saving grace apart from all the alphabets which I have listed is that it has coop. Defend against the undead hordes with up to 3 other mate with a total of 4 people in 1 game and with the price chances are most people already own it. Money are shared between all 4 and only the host can decide what to buy so bickering will happen.Its a pretty fun game, not much of a substance, does what it does well with minimalist gameplay and graphics. What more could you ask for about a game defending a streetlight probably covered in meat from the undead horde? For the cost of a couple of high value cards you and your mate could probably enjoy this stupid thing for a few hours and thats more than enough in my book.			"

												People write reviews for this game like it's the new AAA title that is diabolical with beautiful graphics, game mechanics, and all that jazz, which delineates a terrible game if one were to quickly glance at the reviews. However, people fail to realize that this is supposed to be a fun little zombie shooter, heck, that's why it's priced at $2.That being said, some of the game mechanics are a little wonky, but that just makes the game more enjoyable right? Also to mention, please check out the screenshots before hand, I don't see why people complain if they don't fully check out the product. Would you purchase a new computer without checking out the specifications? I certainly would not. So why be too myopic to glance at the entirety of the game. I personally thought this game was quite enjoyable for $2 and I even 100% it in terms of achievements in 2.5 hours (you can do it faster if you don't screw around, but it was nice to goof off). It's a nice zombie defense game to play with friends when you want to goof off and just enjoy yourself.Lastly, you will certainly enjoy this game if you have ever played the game ""Box Head"" as it brings back the intense moments of running for your life and wondering why you didn't purchase more ammo. Combine that with some achievements and you've got a steal deal for $2.Overall, this game was quite nice for a $2 zombie shooter, please don't expect it to be the next AAA title. Yet Another Zombie Defense brings back the feelings of ""Box Head"" and even throws in some achievements and inane game play for you and your friends.			"

Basic InformationTitle:  Yet Another Zombie DefenseDeveloper:  Awesome Games StudioPublisher:  Awesome Games StudioGenre:  Top-Down ShooterGeneral ImpressionYet Another Zombie Defense is very well designed top-down shooter with some tower defense elements. It requires some strategic thinking since you’ll have to maintain your base defenses against the oncoming undead onslaught and micromanage the team mates as well. That last aspect is the game’s main weakness. The AI is abysmal and so you are almost forced to play this game in co-op with some capable friends, if you wish to enjoy this game at its full potential. And this title is indeed promising and enjoyable since it also features Cards and Achievements, two very important features for any Steam game collector.Strong Points+ Great fun in MP mode.+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.Weak Points- Less fun in SP mode.Rating 7/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways.

												The title says it all for this review, it is Yet another zombie defense game. This was created by Awesome Games studio, and is a simple top-down arcade style zombie shoot. The player is free to choose from 9 unique weapon Yet-Another-zombie-defense-game-gameplays and fight against waves of zombies. The game is simplistic in its mechanics, as zombies become increasingly fast and have more and more health. The game as limited replay-ability as the scene does not change. It is worth to buy this Yet-Another-zombie-defense-game game, if you are looking for a simple co-op game. Overall i feel that the game has very solid game-play, and could be very intriguing, but unfortunately it has been abandoned by its developers,and does not receive an new content.			"

												If you like the tower defense, if you like classic stick shooters, if you like trial and error defense tactics...Buy this game. pro tip: For playing with your steam friends, someone has to start a game and set it to allow friends. Also you may have to allow it to accept ""anyone"" if you have issues with the friends option. This game is absolutely worth 2.99 if you have at least 1 friend to play it with. My opinion is that in it's current rate of content and enjoyable challenge I'd say its a fair game that if you like the genre is worth 9.99. Game sounds are a bit generic, but they aren't expected to be stellar yet and for the price you get enough. The animations, while repetive are very smooth and mesmeric when you enter the Flow state of mind, and become completely mentally engrossed in trying to keep yourself along with your team and your defenses off the ground. I recommend it for harcore zombie killers who want to vegitate, and for the casual pick up and drop occasional scream fest for anyone. Enjoy! "

Yet Another Zombie Defense is a small, unpretentious game that manages to do what it wants to do quite well. The objective is very clear: defend yourself against ever increasing hordes of attacting zombies (hey - that's in the title!). So I went into it, as in quite some of these small and cheap games, I do admit, for the trading cards, and since I love games with Steam achievements. During the first encounters things got on in a rather predictable way. I managed to survive several waves of attack circling around a single lamp-post with nothing but darkness surrounding me. There was the ability to buy new weapons and ammo in between the rounds, but no upgrade possibilities for the weapons, to name but one thing.Also, I could place some fences, but that produced a rather weird result, since the fences can't be turned around so stand as soldiers in a row awaiting the onslaught. And slaughtered I got, out there on my own in the darkness.This morning, I decided to give the multiplayer co-op a go, and made my game open to anyone who wanted to drop in or out. And that made quite a difference: people came and went, staying for some seconds or longer, and suddenly it proved to be quite some fun to blast away at those pesky zombies. I do have to admit I find it difficult to watch other players jumping around like grasshoppers on speed - be a man, stand your ground and shoot!!All in all, a small diversion for the dead moments in between the more serious games, but hey, this game didn't pretend pretend to be anything more than just that.UPDATE - August 2015After coming back to this game after a year, I have to say the developers polished it nicely since then, adding some more interesting weapons and most importanly: zombies can drop extra powers for the player, such as invisibility or invulnerability. These help a lot and make the game more enjoyable. I was pretty impressed that multiplayer still seems alive, and I enjoyed hunting for some more achievements.Recommended: unpretentious but well-made game with some challenging achievements "

												So much stuff done right for such a cheap game!1. The Good.- lots of weapons to use, from pistols to chainsaws and tesla guns;- plenty of buildings from palisades to turrets and mines to place in order to help you survive - and make zombies go boom!- RPG elements (can pick traits to improve like reload speed, extra health, health regen, etc.)- resource management - money and ammunition are all important- 2 game modes - a strategic one, and a brutal one where surviving over 3 minutes is a success of its own- multiplayer with still plenty of active people online- The music - albeit the game has only 2 relatively short music tracks, I love them both. The Main Menu music has that ERA/Enigma vibe, and the combat (level) music is heavy metal kind of the XBlades 1 type.2. The Bad.- repetitive- only 1 map- only 2 music tracksThe Conclusion:An amazingly good game for 49 cents in my opinion, perfect to fool around with to relax and break the everyday tedium, or as a nice filler between your crazy good AAA games. Even if you're a huge cheapskate and think that 49 cents is still money, deduct 24-30 cents from the steam trading cards that you will sell and you get a perfectly fine SP/MP experience for just 19 cents. That's cheaper than a chewing gum, for God's sake. Get this game, have some fun, and maybe come play online with the others as well!			"

												Got this gmae for free. Played it long enough to get the cards. It's a time waster that is basically no more than anything you could get as a browser, or phone game. Everything functions fine, has online co-op and you can play solo. Every level is the same and you shoot zombies until you die. 1. Cost: $02. Cards: 33. ????4. Profit!Would I PAY for this? PRobably not, but for $1.99, or the eventual sale where it will be $0.49 I don't think it is too expensive and you get 3 card drops so the developer knows Steam well enough to know that this price point + cards is a winning formula. This is the crap that Greenlight brings. MEdiocre to bad games for cheap, with trading cards to help it sell. xD			"

Pros:Cost (even at full price of like $2)EntertainingEasy controlsMultiplayer (co-op and DM)Cons:Gets repetitive after a whileConclusion:I have spent 3 hours on this game already and if for some reason i never play it again, where else can you get several hours of entertainment for $0.54. I know that i will play this game more in the future as its a good game to kill 10 minutes or several hours.			"

												Not bad for $2.00.  If you are someone who lies really cheap games, I wouldn't hesitate if this game went on sale (Its cheap enough as it is anyways).  The gameplay is very simple-it consistes of you (single player) or other players (multiplayer) being surrounded on all sides by zombies.  Like the many games that came before it, each level brings ore zombies as well as more powerful zombies.  After each round, you can place turrets, barracades, or purchase guns.Pros:Music-It was the first thing I noticed when entering the game.  It kind of reminds me of the music from Kingdom Hearts when you are going through the tutorial.Turrets- What I though was cool about the turret system was that you buy a seperate gun for each indiviudal turret, and you have to buy ammo for them.  In similiar games, the turret already came with a gun.  I like this aspect because it lets you decide what to do with each turret.  (In the multiplayer game I was in, we put pistols on them because they are the cheapest weapon and the ammo is free.)Multiplayer-This is by far the best part of the game.  My first multiplayer game was with some of the top players (Given this is the release day).  They were very friendly and we made it quite far before the host had to leave thus ending the game.Neutral:Gunplay-I like the look of the guns and the musslefire.  But, the major downfall is that the shotgun packs little to no punch and the flamethrower is god aweful.  The other guns are fine.  Overall, I wasn't too satisfied with the gunplay.Cons:Graphics-It didn't really bother me that much, I'm not a very picky person when it comes top graphics.  I consider them to be par.Level(s)-There is only one level.  It is very simple with one lightpost in the center.  You can see so in the screenshots.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion:The game was enjoyable and the price point is completely reasonable.  Its not a groundbreaking game, the title speaks for itself on that one.  Its simple, yet fun to play for a little while.			"

												Yet ANOTHER zombie defense is a decent entry in the zombie/survival genre despite the over-saturation of zombie games in recent years. STORY & GAMEPLAYChoosing one of three characters, you must survive for as long as possible by constructing and buying resources by day and defending by night either alone, or with friends and strangers up to four players. The game presents you with an assortment of weapons and accessories to aid you in your zombie slaughter. Ideally in zombie shooters the most expensive weapon is the most effective. That concept is no different on Yet Another Zombie Defense: Expensive = Effective. You can either buy weapons during day break at full price, or wait for a discounted sale to hit in later days. You will burn through money fast; therefore sales provide you with an option to cash in on low-price gear. You can effectively create your own “safe zone” through the use of auto-turrets and two variants of palisade walls: Wood and steel - the latter being more durable to zombie attacks. You can have all sorts of combinations, though their effectiveness will be tested in combat.The online portion works just as well as the single player with a drop in/drop out feature. I had some lag drops here and there, even during my own hosted lobbies though not too often that would ruin the overall experience. Players can communicate via the in-game chat box and host is able to kick players who are otherwise trolling or lack contribution. From the several games I played the community is rather active, friendly and helpful which is a major plus.The current offering is satisfying, though for a limited time. The game lacks weapon/fortification upgrades and variation in terms of maps. Once you breach wave 20 you will stop and question whether it is possible to progress any further as zombies become ridiculously over-powered in terms of speed, durability and damage. Future updates are promised by the developer (most recent being 14 August 2014) possibly free of charge, therefore it would be nice to introduce additional features to build on the current game.I only played this game with an Xbox controller, therefore cannot comment on the functionality of keyboard and mouse. Xbox controls handled well without any problems.GRAPHICS / ART STYLEAesthetically nothing impressive. The character and zombie models are almost identical to those in Garry’s Mod. Delivers an entertaining game of mindless zombie killing.AUDIOBetween 4-5 different tracks; nothing major in terms of variety. Some sound effects were off-sync – i.e weapon shots and zombie growls.OVERALLA fun but limited zombie shooter with a not-so-ridiculous price tag. In dire need of additional content to bolster its current offerings.PROS+Two modes which can be played alone or co-op + supported by leaderboards.+Nice assortment of weapons and tools to change gameplay.+Ridiculously cheap.+Developer is opposed to the idea of charging players for additional content (DLC).CONS-In dire need of additional content – especially map variations.-Unexplainable lag in single player and online.-Some sound effects off-sync.

												Was given a coupon for this game which made the price $0.69WELL OKAY!It's time for.... Yet Another Zombie Defence game review.This is a basic zombie defence game that packs the fun!First you choose one of three characters. Then you are thrown into an arena, with one street lamp and you begin with a pistol.Each round intensifies with hordes of Zombies charging after you. The first and sceond round are easily completed with just a pistol in this top down view of a game and as you take down the zombies, they drop bonus items and monies to buy more weapons and defence. Such as barriers, turrets, mines, etc, etc. to help slow down and hold back the Zombie horde.And it works!Simple but fun Zombie shooting time!There is online standings, coop and 4 player death match. All just add to the fun. Although you might find it difficult to find other online players at times.So for a $1.99 or less, this is a fun little Zombie shooter!Get it! Before the Zombies get you! "

												This game is fun to play. Even when it is pretty simple to learn the ropes it takes a few runs to get to know the strategy to survive longer. Of course, you'll end up dying no matter what. There's no story or any missions, just survive till you get overrun by a horde of zombies and start all over again. The achievements give ya something to aim for and there is a decent variety of weapons to try out, but basically is the same thing everytime. Yet, is simple and entertaining enough to keep it around and come back for yet another hopeless defense. Who wants to live forever anyway...?			"

This game is ridicolously fun!Let's explain in what it consists:The Defensemode is more a tower defense game than a shooter. If you are good enough to trick the system with your base you will go all the way trough the first 20 nights or so. Then it becomes more challenging. The Endless Night mode instead is definitely a zombie shooter and you need to be very skilled to go over several hordes.Last mode is Deathmatch in which you'll have to play against an opponent while you and him are facing zombies hordes.Major improvements I would adviceIn Endless Mode you should ""save up"" weapons and ammos so if you find a weapon you don't have to lose the previous one you were using. In Defense mode the building system should be improved: it's pretty hard and tricky to remove barricades.In Deathmatch the drop rate for the losing player should be increased otherwise if a player starts to win he will be advantaged.Open the game to modders! This will create a new fan base who will eventually build maps, weapons, characters, skins, textures, new zombie types and new modes as well!Minor improvements I would adviceI'm looking forward to some graphic adjustments, other bug fixes (e.g. you get spawned out of your base so you need to be clever when you build or you'll be spawned out of your walls!), new game modes, and a bit of a storymode with funny dialogues and interactions (e.g. Blood and Bacon).Final Score: 8/10You can get it for 50 cents and play with your freinds for several hours. I use to spend more money on playing billiard and it doesn't last so long and it isn' as fun as this! It can still be improved and they are still working on this as far as I can see.Find a couple of friends and throw some cents at this game! You won't regret it! "

												Yet Another Zombie Defense is as the title suggests, a zombie defense. I can't really say much about this game, but I guess I'll start at the price. This game is quite affordable at the price of £1.59, although I got this in a sale for £0.39, and I'd say that it's most likely worth it. The game's design isn't unique or out of the norm, but it doesn't go to say that it's a bad game, at all. The zombies work well and don't bug from my experiences so far, nor do the items for sale (guns, barricades, turrets, etc). However, there was an issue that happened to me a few times, and really annoyed me. After 'daytime', when the night starts and swarms of zombies attack, occasionally your character would not be able to move or equip any weapons other than the starter weapon, the pistol. Only being able to use the starter gun and look around isn't good, especially if you've progressed really far by yourself; just a side note, the map isn't really that large. I'd love to see a new map added that was much larger and had run down buildings in which you could put turrets in.The Co-Op is good. There's Multiplayer, Singleplayer and Local Co-Op, the Steam Trading Cards, Leaderboards and Full Controller support add to why I believe this game is good. There are 3 Characters, the 'SWAT', 'Boy' and 'Girl', which aren't too imaginative and do not have any personalities. There aren't many online lobbies, but playing with friends or hosting a lobby is still pretty fun. To add to that, there are 3 game modes, all of which I like.I'd recommend this for people looking for a quick game to pick up and play; like I previously said, there's not a whole lot to say about this game, it's not bad, but it doesn't stand out well. I enjoyed playing this game myself and would recommend this game to those considering buying it.			"

												Saw this was £0.39 on Steam (75% off) and thought YOLO how bad could it be!This game is actually pretty good for a small simple game that it is. The goal is to survive hordes of zombies trying to kill you and you have some variety of weapons and defenses to help you. There are two game modes, Defense and Endless Night.DefenseFirst of all you can choose to play solo or allow others to join you when choosing this game mode or you can choose to find a game hosted by another player. Playing with others does help survivability however only the host can buy items such as walls, weapons, turrets and ammo.You start with only a pistol to defend yourself and earn $ by killing zombies. You can buy weapons, walls and even turrets which can have any weapon mounted on them as you see fit. You do need to make sure that you buy ammo for all of the guns that are in use however because turrets will be useless if they are not shooting because of ammo shortages. In the later levels repairing walls and resupplying ammo can start to get very expensive since the zombies also progressively get faster, tougher and stronger.The area you have to build is a little smaller than the edge of the map where the zombies will be spawning and you have a single lamppost in the center of the map providing some light. The very edge of the map is an invisible barrier and zombies will just spawn instantly so can occasionally block you if you happen to be running the edge of the map.Lastly the items that you can buy to help your survivability sometimes can be bought slightly cheaper because they go 'on sale' which can be helpful but sometimes it can take a while for them to do so, in which case it might be more viable to buy them at their full prices.Endless Night ModeIn this mode you can also choose to play solo or allow others to join you when choosing this game mode or you can choose to find a game hosted by another player. Again playing with others can help survivability but in this mode you cannot build defenses, you can only run around so make sure not to run into each other with a horde of zombies either side of you and get trapped! This game mode runs 'endlessly' until you die, there is no daytime in which you can buy weapons or defenses or ammo, there is just one single night that lasts until you die. You can however pick up weapons dropped by zombies upon their death but the ammo is very limited for these so you will run out and your pistol (which has infinite ammo) will be pulled out again.OverallGreat game for only £0.39 that i bought it for, does have achievements that took me only 5 hours to achieve but its a very simple fun game and for that price you can not go wrong! For reviewing completeness the game does also have Steam Badges if you are interested in those too!			"

												""Yet Another Zombie Defense"" is a co-op game where you and your friends have to kill zombies on a small map, that is the only point ... but that is pretty fun ! Up to 4 players can fight together, using a man, a girl or a member of the SWAT (the only difference is the skin, nothing else).There are two modes.The first one is the defense mode. You have to survive waves of zombies over and over until the end of your lives. Each time you kill a zombie, you get some dollars plus from time to time money, medic kit (enables your team to recevor health) or ammo (you need to have at least one weapon to get ammo, that does not take into account the pistol that you have at the beginning because you have infinite ammo for this specific weapon). After each wave, you recover your health but the zombies get stronger : they will deal more damage to you if they bite you, they will be faster and you will need more and more hits to kill them.In order to survive, you are able and you have to use your money between each wave. You can buy different weapons (rifles, shotgun, flame thrower, tesla, rocket launcher, laser, ...), but always remember to have enough ammo tu use them ! Tip : I think the best way to go is to buy only one weapon so that, when a zombie drops ammo, you only get the adequate type of ammo. If you have two or more weapons, you are going to drop at random two types of ammo, and if you are looking for one specific kind, you might be unlucky and get the other one.You can also buy barricades (wooden and steel) and auto-turrets and place them on the map, almost wherever you want within a medium circle from the center of the map. You can build up to 5 turrets, and for each of them, you have to buy and mount a weapon on it to get it active. Them, each time the turret shoots a zombie, it will use your ammo, so be carfeul with your stock ! The idea is to protect your turrets with barricades because zombies can destroy them, and since they are pretty expensive, you have to keep them alive.Remember that only the host of the game can buy stuff and place items. You can ask for specific weapons, but the host has the final decision. I think that you should spend the first four or five waves killing the zombies with your pistol (which is free thanks to inifinite ammo), then you are likely to buy the weapon you like the most. There are also ""sales !"" : at random, between each wave, some items are going to be cheaper (-25% I guess), so you might want to wait if you are looking for a specific item and maybe get lucky after the next wave, unless you die ...In the end, you have to get the highest score you can to get your name on the leaderboard. The second mode is the endless night. As indicated, there is only one wave of zombie, but there is no end to it ! No money on this map, no barricade or even turret to build, you have to kill zombies with weapons. There is a lot of zombies and they can drop weapons : as soon as you pick one of them, you have to use it, you cannot get your previous weapon back (unless you drop it again). The aim is to survive as long as possible, so try to gather medic kits when you need one of them, and never stop running !To conclude, this game is pretty fun, maybe it is lacking a little bit of content, but with two modes, Steam trading cards and 18 achievements to unlock (5 hours should be enough to get them all), it is worth its price, which is quite low currently :)			"

												7/10For a basic zombie shooter, it has some flaws.It is a standard run and strafe zombie shooter where every kill earns your team money. After each wave, you can buy ammo or guns.Here are the flaws. The lobby leader holds all the money and can buy the guns for the team, build walls, and turrents.So if you get a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who wants to not buy anything, he can start next wave before the team can ask for a new gun or mention low ammo.But if you happen to have a few friends to play with, can be real fun. Even with random people. It would be a lot better of a score if I could hold my own cash for kills, and use MY money for MY guns instead of having to ask.			"

												Despite the name, Yet Another Zombie Defense is more a dual stick shooter than Tower Defense game. There might be a few elements, reminiscent of Tower Defense strategy, but success owes much to the player’s ability to react quickly via the use of their hands.Working on a wave basis, each in game night pits the player against an increasingly large, tougher and faster horde of zombies.The weapon selection is decent, but the fortification side of the game – the purported tower defense – is an absolute snore. Perhaps my expectations for Yet Another Zombie Defense were off-base. I was looking forward to a sharp mix of light tower defense strategy and arcade action, but what I got was a competent but unremarkable dual-stick shooter with sentry turrets and blocks- reasonably fun, but quickly forgettable. Overall 6/10.			"

												Yet Another Zombie Defense developed by Awesome Games Studio Sp. z o. o. & released on 28 March 2014 on the PC Platform. It has an average score of 6.9 on Metacritic (http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/yet-another-zombie-defense) & surprisingly, this is also available on the iPhone/ipad. There are tons of zombie defense game out there but this title came at a ridiculous low price. As a fan of Tower Defense game, I couldn't pass this up and not wanting to be conned by the mass steam reviews, I dig up game play footages and reviews and finally made the purchase. I am all for  value for game play experience and this title deliver it in that aspect.For the sake of this writing, I am going to use short form. YAZD is all about surviving endless waves of zombies. You can either play it solo or co-op; 4 person multiplayer. It's that simple and to aid you in your survivability you'll be able to purchase weapons, barricades and sentries. The game currently offers 3 game modes:  Defense - your normal defense game; you need to survive each night@level against x number of zombies. During the day, you get to build your defenses/resupply and during the night, you fight off the hordes of zombie. Endless - you are thrown into the game with hordes of zombies. There is no day - you kill zombies and hope that RNG will drop weapons/supplies for you to pick up and survive. Good luck. Deathmatch - for those who want to pvp.Controls:The controls are simple. Standard keyboard; WASD & mouse.Visuals:I am not sure how to word this. On overall, the feel is Plain. Simple. No details, no textures. Bare minimum visuals.  You are loaded into the game with 1 lamp post right in the middle of the map, which gives you light source. The rest of the map are dark. So environment wise, its barren.  There's only 1 type of zombie throughout the entire fight. They switch from walking to running. There are some different cloths zombies but that's it. The human characters are designed okay. There's the boy, the girl and the SWAT. Each designed nicely and colored just ok. No broken/weird animation. Weapons, no textures but each has been designed properly with their respective effect; shotgun, kick back and pellets. Tesla gun, a large coil thingy  which zaps stuffs. Laser weapons that slices stuffs into 2. In that respect, they are okay. My personal thoughts:Upon launching the game, I saw the simplicity on-screen menu filled with zombies. I went: URK! and my eyes went o_O"" I was taken by surprise lol. I am not sure how the mass would react to the screen but i'd suggest another loading screen not to scare off certain audience.I didn't understand what and how the UI work. at all! That was until 2 hours later..where I emerge from the tons of dead zombies and do a victory pose *punch the air* I understood how the darn UI, barricades & the sentries work.My game play experience from that moment onwards, was simply fun. Fun because I know what the heck I was doing and at the same time I was trying to accomplish certain achievement(s). If you see me running around with a pistol beyond night 6, it's not that I am _tupid but because I am lucky & skillful enough to be able to execute it unlike certain people out there. This is my strategy to rake up money to build my ultimate defense for the team. When I went to play with others on multiplayer, it's the same awful co-op experience just like every other game out there suffers. Lack of team work, different ideas, in-fighting...all this is going on as the horde of zombies is breaking our defenses. Urg! If I could just point my chain saw to their face and @#$@#! and re-focus back onto the zombies. There were also people who kept crying for weapons when the team were low on cash/fixing up the barricades. What is wrong with these people..The game play is darn simple. Some may find it uninteresting. The weapons, defense mechanics are also darn simple and thankfully they work! but some may still find it uninteresting. So what do these people do to make the game interesting? The cheat the crap out of all this simplicity. Tsk, Tsk, Tsk! 999 million on night 1? Come on.......how hard is this game..... T.TYAZD in it's current state leaves a lot of potential and improvement to be made. While I am aware that the devs have promised to make  some improvements, here's what I would like to see if possible.  An improved UI and a section for help; in-game explanation on barricades and weapons.  Introduce new form of barricades. Introduce new form of weapons/mines/traps. Introduce environment and if possible, make some interactive option; water, bridge, trees, fire,electric, Any form of skin/clothing customization would be welcomed. The devs can even earn some side income from here. more achivements? =p Support for controllers on the PC version in the future maybe?While many would suggest for new enemies, I dont think it's fair or possible to do so - between solo and co-op play (for the achievements purpose). Right now, its free for all. You can do it solo or co-op to get those achievements. I really hope it stays like this because more and more games out there are forcing people to band together to complete certain achievements. It has it's benefits but most of the time, with all the awful online gaming experience out there, I would rather solo it. When a game does it the right way, it becomes meaningful else it just feels like another chore of ""oh, crap. I need a team for this x achivement. help! Someone? Anyone!""My SummaryThe way I see it, with a little bit more touchup/improvement YAZD can be really fun. It is already fun and with such a cheap price tag, this is a bargain for a simple fun game. But in the long run, the devs need to work on the game to retain its player base.If the devs overhauled the mechanics to allow players to scavenge/make traps/build weapons - expand on the day light game mode; allow players to travel, engage and do other stuffs. This could retain your player base and give some sort of sense of progression. . By then YAZD could turn out to be another gem product in steam. Unfortunately, till that day arrives, I'll be running around the single light post with broken barricades everywhere and lots..lotttsssss of dead zombies. So on the scale of 0 - 10, my personal rating for Yet Another Zombie Defense is a 5/10. *starts the chainsaw* >:-D			"

												This is an exellent game for the price. This game has given me many hours of entertainment and I will continue to play it for a very long time. The replay value is amazing, it just never gets tiring! I always find myself trying to beat my previous records! Pros:=Fun and Addicting!=Its fun trying to unlock all of the acheivments!=AMAZING SOUNDTRACK!=No DLC's!=Controler support that works well!=Easy to run on weak PC's!=Good multiplayer servers! Cons:=Infrequent updates!=A few bugs have yet to be fixed (such as the inability to walk through invisible objects inbetween rounds that have been there since from the previous round)!=No graphics options, so theres no way to make the game look nicer (although it looks great already)!So in conclusion, this is an outstanding game! It is definently a must have if you like strategy defense style games and I would recomend it to anyone!Also check out my Steam Group which is deticated to Yet Another Zombie Defense!http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ChainsawSWATBrigade "

 A funny co op game! The title of the game pretty much says what it is about. It is indeed a zombie tower defense in which you have to survive as long as you can, you can get money and with that money you can buy guns or stuff you will need for survive the hardest nights. Also, you can get upgrades that will make stronger, faster, etc.The game itself is not bad, if offers a good time with your friends and it also have different games modes. Also it offers archievements and trading cardsI have a few problems with this game though, it can get a little repetitive, since the game is too simple there is no a high replay value, once you unlock every archievement is pretty much over.Another thing is, I personally don't enjoy playing solo as much when I was playing co op. I feel like the fun in the game comes from the co op experience. Don't get me wrong, I know there are plenty of people who enjoy the solo experience in this game, is just not for me.So, for the final question ""Do you recommend this game?"" Yes, yes I do, the game offers a funny co op experience and you can try to unlock every archievement, but I think you should have a friend to play with.My score 7/10. "

												Aye Community!Although I haven't played this game for a long time yet, i can definitley say that it is a challenging and extra-ordinary game, giving a new experience of gaming. Positive Facts about ""Yet Another Zombie Defense"": .) The name of the game and it's very cheap .) Very simple to understand and made for everyone .) I would classify the game as a Zombie, CO-OP & Top-Down Shooter .) Wave-based with growing difficulty every round .) Has an own shop, where you can spend your earned money from the past rounds on new weapons, ammo,                                  barricades and automatic turrets .) Co-op ModeAll in all i would say it's one of the best casual-Co-op-Games out there in the wide world of Steam. One thing I really hate about the game is the very little choice of placeable items. I would like to see more items for base building, but maybe that's going to be changed in the future. well done Awesome Game Studios, the game has potential for more!8.5/10 Duck-Points Sincerly, the friendly duck from the neighborhood			"

												It's way too simple. That's the fault. The actual gameplay is solid enough, and actually feels cleaner than some other isometric arcade shooters I've played (more expensive ones to boot). The survival aspect isn't bad, since you actually do have to utilize barricades and whatnot if you want to survive at later levels, because zombies increasingly become faster, stronger, and more durable. At first you can just kite the circular play area and the few zombies who decide to run faster towards you can be taken care of easily, while you outrun the rest and pick them off later. Further on, though, when the zombies all have high speed levels, you can't outrun them for long, and you have to either kill the quick moving ones immediately, or use barricades to hold them off and survive. For the asking price (dirt cheap, or free in a past free Indie Royale Bundle), it's actually a really clean feeling game. It's just lacking in depth and variation. The developer is always asking for feedback on the game, suggestions, etc, and says he'll add more upgrades, game modes, etc if there's enough interest. Everyone was bashing this dev, but to be honest, he's doing things the correct way. He didn't bite off more than he could chew, he made a simple, playable game with good fundamentals and nice clean graphics, and will add to it from there. Much better than so many other indie devs who bite off way more than they can chew and put out a glitchy, unplayable piece of crap, or ones who make up for their lack of skill by making things too weird and 2deep4u, or getting lazy with ""retro"" graphics.All in all, it's not going to blow your socks off, but if you can go find me a game for $2 MSRP that blow my socks off, well... I'll eat those socks.			"

 OVERVIEW Yet Another Zombie Defense is a defense building action game developed and published by Awesome Games Studio. The whole concept is that you are a human that is being overrun by zombies night after night, Every night you survive you will have money to allow for you to upgrade weapons, get palisades and buy turrets. The goal is to survive as long as possible with or without the help of friends. PROS + Easy Achievements+ Steam Trading Cards+ Co-op+ Multiplayer+ Fun+ Cheap+ Easy to Run CONS - Not The Best Graphics- No Save Feature CONCLUSION This game is a big bang for you buck. It has a fun and easy concept that allows for you to get sucked in very easily and can become very strategic over time. I do have to admit it is a hell of a lot more fun when you have other people to play with. Although it might not be much to look at, and not too much to come back to, the fun I had in this game with a few friends really allowed for it to be a hidden gem. 7.5/10  "

												Yet Another Zombie Defense is a zombie survival game so as many other it have no story.It's all about defending yourself against the infinite number of zombies attacking every night. In the end all of your prayers are to find a quiet place to fall into a peaceful slumber.The graphics are great. The textures are very detailed. the animation of movements, firing, blood, the zombies and your character are quite impressive.The gameplay and controls are good WASD for movements, R for reload, G to throw grenades Lclick to fire and using the mouse to aim. It support gamepad.  You get to choose the character you wish to play with either the guy, the girl or SWAT.There is a huge variety of guns. From small machine guns to heavy full assault rifles.You can create your own game or join other's. You can play with up to four other players. The more the better, right?The multiplayer mode works smoothly without any problems. It's pretty fun to play with your friends.The soundtrack is just perfect hyped fast tempo at night and sad at day. I really liked it.The settings and options are great. You can adjust the volume of the Music and Sound FX, adjust the brightness, change the resolution and change the key bindings.You get three card drops of five card badge. You have eighteen achievements why not giving it a try.If you are interested in reading and discussing reviews. Check Cassus.org "

												This game is as basic as can be, and yet very enjoyable. It is even more fun when in multiplayer. I have experienced zero issues with the game, as bugs or glitches, and have enjoyed the variable ways in playing this game. I recommend this game as a fun and quick to jump in and go type game. It is most fun with friends, so get your friends with you for the best experience, but even solo is enjoyable.			"

												I'm giving this a game a thumbs up for it's simplicity and the price point of $1.99.  Let me begin by saying you do get what you pay for.  The game starts out just the same as it ends.  In what looks like a parking lot with a single lamp post, you begin to construct a very few simple structres.  By building fences and auto turrets to keep the zombies at bay as you try to stay alive as long as possible.  There is no variety of zombies and no changing of levels.  But as I said the game is only a few bucks, and if you play an hour here and even just a hour later you get your moneys worth.   I experienced no crashes, no glitches so it seems stable enough as it is simple.   While I played only a short while there is the co-op option which makes survival a bit easier, so all in all, a simple zombie defence game for a few bucks.  Money well spent.			"

												Objectively speaking; this game is not very good because it's nothing more than a glorified flash game. That being said, I like it because it's very easy to play and enjoy because the multiplayer and singleplayer seamlessly flow over into eachother. Reasonably easy to collect all the achievements for this game too, no absurd 'kill 1,000,000 zombies' junk here.			"

But choose wisely because those zombies are not messing around!Set up turrets and a makeshift barricade and stay alve as long as you can!Simple concept executed well.Music is good, sound effects could be better but get a 2 pack because the netcode is very good and with a friend it is tense but funny!Be sure to tell your friends.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												Yet Another Zombie Defense is a simple yet fun zombie survival game. In this game, you can build turrets and barriers to protect yourself from incoming zombie hordes and/or just use your weapons to overcome them.There has been quite a lot of changes since this game has been released, such as level-ups that allows you to increase your speed, reload speed, health and health regen, electric barriers, stronger turrets...Don't forget that you have to mount the turret with any guns of your choice after you build it, otherwise, it's useless. There's about 10-15 different weapons and they are quite different and interesting to use. There's also 3 gameplay modes, there's online multiplayer and local multipayer. You can also play this game entirely with a controller!Sadly, the game has many flaws. After a few hours, it becomes very repetitive. There's a few bugs too... The zombies animations are quite sluggish and their hitbox is a little weird. There's about 2 soundtracks in the game and they're not very good and they get very repetitive. Also, in online multiplayer, if the host goes innactive, you have to wait until he comes back or leave the game. The host can also kick anyone, decide not to start next wave or not buy you any weapons that you want, so don't expect too much when you play with strangers.Overall, the game is very cheap and it's one of the reason it's getting a positive review. It is not a bad game, but it gets boring too quick. If you play this game with a few friends, it is alot better. So, buy a 4-pack and play with your friends if you want some survival action!			"

												Within the time I've played this game, it helps pass the time. It's like a basic tycoon game in which you can earn money as you kill zombies. As you progress, the zombies become stronger and more lethal. Trying to survive 10 nights might seem difficult enough, but getting at any point past night 10 is difficult if you have less than four people. Trying to get all the achievements can be a challenge and makes more goals to go after in this game. What I liked most about this game is the accessibility to auto-turrents and the ability to mount any weapon on top of them, making them fierce allies if you're able to protect them. My personal favorite weapon is the Telsa Ray, which can attack up to three zombies at once, and is basically an instant-kill gun. I love the idea of ammo sharing and whenever some gains a health pack you get some of it too. It was definitely worth the $0.69 I paid for. Even though I currently only have 2.6 hours on it, I expect to add more, seeing a this is an enjoyable game to play.Some things to know before you play:You can have up to 4 people playing with you.You can customize your server to personnal or to publicThe game becomes harder as you playIt matters where you place everythingThe Rocket Launcher is not a good gunThe auto turrents are VERY usefulAt random nights, there are sales on various item in the storeNever play aloneThe street light is your friendSome thing that could be added:Better assortment of weaponsNew barricadesPossibly new mapsNew charactersNew game mode (Example: A defending mode where you have to protect the street lamp from the zombies.)Few various tweaks on the AIs of the zombiesVoice chat in the gameAnd maybe a few bosses that come out each night during the horde, to add a little spice to the game!I hope this helped you and gave you a proper decision on whether to buy this game or not, but I will say this; It is defininetly worth the amount of money it is being sold for, very fun and low graphics, meaning you can have a fast gameplay on slow laptops, like mine! Enjoy the game!			"

All i could recommend is for the multiplayer buying to be improved so everyone doesn't have to 'ask' for items, but shares some of the profit to buy their own gear (or have the option to do so in multiplayer settings). A good example of an indie came that has succeeded.7/10 (Indie game rating)			"

												A fun little adventure with as much Character development as a COD franchise game, as much freedom of choice as the Mass effect 3 ending, all with the amazing Campaign of the Evil Dead. My god do i love this game! What more could you 'triple A' Game buyers want?10/10 for intense psychological horror.			"

												Within the time I've played this game, it helps pass the time. It's like a basic tycoon game in which you can earn money as you kill zombies. As you progress, the zombies become stronger and more lethal. Trying to survive 10 nights might seem difficult enough, but getting at any point past night 10 is difficult if you have less than four people. Trying to get all the achievements can be a challenge and makes more goals to go after in this game. What I liked most about this game is the accessibility to auto-turrents and the ability to mount any weapon on top of them, making them fierce allies if you're able to protect them. My personal favorite weapon is the Telsa Ray, which can attack up to three zombies at once, and is basically an instant-kill gun. I love the idea of ammo sharing and whenever some gains a health pack you get some of it too. It was definitely worth the $0.69 I paid for. Even though I currently only have 2.6 hours on it, I expect to add more, seeing a this is an enjoyable game to play.Some things to know before you play:You can have up to 4 people playing with you.You can customize your server to personnal or to publicThe game becomes harder as you playIt matters where you place everythingThe Rocket Launcher is not a good gunThe auto turrents are VERY usefulAt random nights, there are sales on various item in the storeNever play aloneThe street light is your friendSome thing that could be added:Better assortment of weaponsNew barricadesPossibly new mapsNew charactersNew game mode (Example: A defending mode where you have to protect the street lamp from the zombies.)Few various tweaks on the AIs of the zombiesVoice chat in the gameAnd maybe a few bosses that come out each night during the horde, to add a little spice to the game!I hope this helped you and gave you a proper decision on whether to buy this game or not, but I will say this; It is defininetly worth the amount of money it is being sold for, very fun and low graphics, meaning you can have a fast gameplay on slow laptops, like mine! Enjoy the game!			"

												Yet Another Zombie Defense is a fairly simple top down twin stick shooter with some tower defense elements thrown in. Basically, you are thown in with nothing but a pistol and fight off a wave of zombies. These are the nights. Then, once they're all dead, it goes into a section where you can use the cash you earned from killing zombies to purchase and build. These are the days. You can buy guns, ammo, turrets to place guns on that will shoot automatically, and walls that can be placed to help stop the incoming waves. During the night stages you can pick up drops from the zombies like ammo crates, money stacks, and full health. Health will come back between rounds, but if run out of it during the night, it's game over. The walls and guns become very necessary for later rounds as the zombies continue to increase not only in numbers, but in speed and health as well. You're going to die. It's just about how long you can survive. Eventually ammo will run out, walls will get destroyed, and you'll be overwhelmed. And that's basically the whole game. Simple, but with possibilities and strategies to try. Oh, and there's an endless mode with is similar except that... there's no day stages. There's also mutliplayer, which is where this game really shines for me. You can play with up to three other people (meaning four players total including yourself). That means four times the firepower, and a game is only over if every member dies so... better odds. Just make sure not to get in each other's way and do your best to cooperate. Playing online is a great way to make this game more enjoyable and interesting, as you can see other people's skills and strategies. I've played much more online multiplayer with this game than single player, and it's one of the few games I actually play online anymore.I also want to mention how cool some of the other things are in this game. It has some neat music, which is nice. The way you can build walls and turrets to create a defensive outpost between rounds is a lot like a tower defense game, and it's a cool way to implement that genre into this top down twin stick shooter type of game. It's basically what I think a new arcade game would be like. I like it.But every game has some downsides. The online can be awfully laggy at times. That can be due to distance, but... it's still a major drag since there's no local co op for this game, another downside. Also, while graphically it looks alright, artistically it is a bit drab. It's a zombie apocalypse, I get it, but that doesn't mean I have to like the dark, dirty look. Just a personal preference thing I suppose. Also, there's this weird system that allows everyone to use the money to buy things in private games with friends, but in random online matches there's no way to do so. Only the host can buy things. It works out alright, but the fact that it's inconsistent is strange to me, and not really explained anywhere either. The heads up would help. Speaking of that, it'd also be nice to get a little warning on the turrets. See, you buy the turrets from the shop and then you can place them. Pretty easy to figure out. What's confusing is that you're supposed to mount a gun on them. This could've been conveyed a little better. Many times newcomers will buy a turret and place it then be confused as to why it won't shoot. Well you have to have another gun to mount on it. And that gun also uses ammo. You start with many extra pistols to mount to them, which is nice enough, but being given a small heads up on a few of these features might have been nice little things to add. Also, there are supposedly more updates coming... but they're taking long than expected as well as longer than announced. So don't base your purchase on new features coming as it's still a bit up in the air. However, let it be noted that, at the very least, more stages to pick from would be very appreciated.It's still a pretty fun little game. Nice for a time killer. Simple. Easy to learn. And for two bucks, it's worth it. Wait for a sale even. I got it cheaper and even I think it's worth the full price. Yet Another Zombie Defense gets a 6/10 for being a fun, simple, arcadey experience in a more modern time.			"

												This game definately shows potential. With some more effort and support, this game can grow and thrive into a really nice game. If you really like top-down zombie tower defense/shoot-'em-ups, as well as games prone to changing, this is a good investment for the money it is priced at. That said, if you prefer a more finished/polished game with full functionality, then either wait or move on.			"

												Bought this was for 0,49€ for me and my friend. Played it for 2.9 hours, both unlocked all of the achievements, had a lot of fun, and fought it out in deathmatch mode. For the price it's a pretty decent game. You can buy different weapons, get upgrades for your character, pickup powerups that enemies drop etc. The only downsides would be that it's likely not that much fun playing alone, and also that the content is very limited (1 map, 1 type of enemy), and it doesn't really offer any replay-value. Also it's kinda hard to move and replace your barricades.I would suggest playing it with friends, to have the most ammount of fun. You can play up to 4 people together in a game. Again, the price makes it a reasonable purchase if you're looking to spend a few good hours with a buddy.6.5/10 on my personal scale.			"

												My first impressions:The game still needs work, gameplay is simple and graphics are not important for it. It sure does look like there can be potential in updating the game, adding new things, weapons, modes and so on.Pros:+Gamer's skill is rewarded+Simple conceptCons:-Really laggy multiplayer online experience-Zombies are a mess (explained in ''DETAILS'')DETAILS:(I'm talking here about how things are right now in the game. It's my first encounter with this game and it's fairly new.)I see no need for animation of zombie's attack due to instant loss of health when you even touch a zombie. If the zombie hurts you without it even grasping you, there's no point for animation of it grasping; there needs some work on that.A lot of the zombies are actually faster than you which makes you to die easier considering what I said above. And yes, somebody will find this as a great challenge.There's no option for you to set your controls to default. That's really a minor issue but I feel the need to point that out before developers make a change.			"

												A good price for a game that can provide a good amount of fun.As I never tried Deathmatch Mode, I won't be able to provide much information about it. You can go against 3 other people while zombies increasingly grow in number and speed. Weapons are randomly scattered once in a while on the battlefield, even among undeads.Endless Mode follows the same concept for what concerns Weapons (Randomly spawned on the field) Along with  Power-Ups. Zombies will get faster and aggro will keep increasing. Ammunitions are never dropped, so you're forced to cycle through Weapons.Defense Mode is what you'll probably play mostly: Survive at night and gather Money and Power-Ups (Health; Faster Run Speed; Faster Reload; Invisibility; Invulnerability; Grenades; Mines; Ammo) Dropped by Zombies. Daytime marks the moments where you can buy Weapons, stock up Ammunitions, Mines and Grenades and place bought Turrets and Barricades (Which comes in different variations). Turrets can mount different Weapons (Keep in mind that the Ammunition for that Weapon will depletes as faster as the number of zombies grow) And can be destroyed as easily as barricades. And while, by every night, Zombies will gain faster speed, higher damage resistance you too, every 3 nights, will gain 1 point to invest in Faster Reload Speed, Health Regen., More Health, Pickup Range and Faster Movement Speed.Getting the Achievements is not difficult and while the game is nothing special nor noteworthy, it will offer fun without stress or broken expectations. It does its job properly: Having fun while relaxing, killing without feeling guilty. They were dead already when I started. "

												I've read a fair few negative reviews for this game, but after playing it for a few hours, I don't think they're justifed. This is an indie game, priced at £1 something - it's good value. Some people might moan about the graphics, the lack of scenery or story line - but  1) doesn't need  story line (It's zombies wanting to eat you - what more do you need?) 2) The singular lamp has a certain atmospheric effect that gives way to the impeding darkness. 3) It's an indie game - don't expect amazing graphics. (Not that it needs it) This game isn't about amazing graphics, it's about survivability... and fun.If you play this game with friends, it's an almost guarenteed laugh fest as you (probably) squelch beneath the horde of zombies. I've played this as a solo player and with friends. It's more enjoyable with friends. The only annoying aspect of this game is that you can't keep your money or weaponary between games.			"

Controls well, difficulty increases fairly, and with a friend it's extremely fun. Work together or die.			"

												Nice Co-op game with friends. I dont like the fact that only the host can buy items for the team, i would have preferred sharing the resources. Unless you are the the one hosting you cannot buy items it seems. Apart from that cool game.

Surprisingly fun wave-based shooter. It's simple, yet still entertainingYou start with a pistol, and shoot zombies wave after wave. Not so original, but the game is very aware of that, hence the name. You can play the game Solo, or Online up to 4-players Co-op.No problems with multiplayer, works fine!After each wave, you can place defenses, such as barricades and turrets.With some planning you can get quite far, but it does require you to try few times.Achievements are pretty easy to get, I got all 100% in few hours. Some you might get without thinking about it, but others may need few tries to get. There are steam guides for achievements, so that helps.Overall, it's fun zombie shooter which brings nothing new to the genre, but is still entertaining for few hours in small sessions. Price is low, and you can pick it up on sale for even cheaper. Definitely worth the asking price.			"

												So, let's define what a typical video game zombie horde is:1) Dumb as a rock2) Highly predictable3) Extremely numerous4) Individually fragileFrankly, this game's biggest failure is that, instead of just making the zomibes more numerous, which would make sense, they make them individually stronger AND more numerous. Hey, kids, want to play a game where each of the 60 on-screen zombies take a whole assault rifle clip to kill? Where the basic weapons are vastly more effective than the advanced ones? Well, you're in luck, because this game exists.In a nutshell: If you're looking for something to tie into a drinking game at your next LAN party, you might get a few kicks from this. Otherwise, you're looking at 20-30 minutes of entertainment for your 2$. It could be fun with weaker zombies, and with more weapons and features, but if you just -really- need your zombie survival fix, go play Unturned instead.			"

												Yet Another Zombie Defense is a fairly accurate title for this game, mimicking the style and setup best seen in Nation Red (a highly recommended zombie shooter) with the added flair of defense buildup in the form of palisades and auto turrets. Although a bit genuine, the defense buildup only serves to slow down the hordes and keep you pinned in a single spot trying to snipe off incoming hordes, which I found unintuitive, as it was much easier to circle strafe around the entire level while picking off the trailing hordes.The music is awefully repetitive, but can be turned off, while the weapons lacked sonic and visual punch. Aside from scoring achievements, this game might not hold your interest for too long, unless the developers add more content as they promised. 2.5/5			"

												A fun little game that is definately worth the money.Seems so far like the kinda thing you'd play for a few mins in between bigger games, which is fine.I think the best thing about this game is the way the turrets work. Instead of just a standard minigun turret or whatever you put down a turret mount thingy and then you can put guns on that, such as shotguns, to make a turret out of any weapon in the game. I like it.			"

												After selling the Steam Cards, this game came out to about 64 cents; and given that I've already put in over an hour to the game (with at least as much time left), and it's only in Alpha - I'd say it's well worth purchasing.It's very simple:  buy weapons and baricades to kill increasingly plentiful, powerful, and speedy horde of zombies until you're eventually overrun.  There are a few obtainable achievements making it a good game for metagamers looking for an easy stats booster, and its simplicity lends itself to a quick play timetable making it perfect for random dull spots in your day.

												I decided to edit this review because the game has changed. They have added quite a few amount of features since the last update, although it is rarely updated, it does get updated with new features. It now has local co-op so more then one person can play on the same computer, new barricade design and more. Pros:Controller SupportDeathmatch (I have yet to play this but it seems interesting.)endless night(You can't build or get new guns, really proves a challenge)Local Co-Op (not many games have this)ConsGets boring after a bitOverall:This game is a little bit fun, for the price. it goes on sale a lot and is worth it when you play with your friends. I managed to reach wave 20 with me and my friend, it's worth it now with the new update			"

The reason this game is so fun is because of the easy-to-set-up multiplayer. These game devs are great at doing what they do, and I hope they make more games like this. Easily the best indie game I've played. For such a cheap price too!			"

												This is my review for the last update up till this date.Awesome little game,  runs really smooth even on my laptop which makes it even more handy when you have time to kill, although after around 40min straight it gets boring since no matter what I do, on night 20/21 the zombies are way too fast and strong, they end up breaking in and taking down all my turrets, eventually killing me, and then you have to restart all over again making it too repetitive.

												This game is awesome. Basically your typical zombie defense game where you survive as many waves as you can while purchasing items as you progress. I really enjoyed how easy it was to pick up, and how challenging the game gets as you go past wave 10. I would love to see more variation to the zombies, or perhaps boss-like rounds, would also love to see more content as this game could probably go stale within a week or two. If you're looking to 100% this game, it's totally doable. The sniper achievement is a little tricky, but if you try enough you'll eventually get it (took me about an hour to get that single achievement).			"

												I had received this game as a gift from a friend who bought it while this was on sale, and after playing a bit, I went out and bought a few extra copies for my friends. I spent maybe 2 dollars total for my friends and I to all play together.TL;DRIf you're looking for a time killer, this is definitely for you.I recommend this game, even more so when on sale.Pros+Great for blowing off steam+Decent Graphics+Game actually presents a challenge & requires you to think+RNG for item salesThe item sales are entirely random, and requires you to check on them every level to make sure you can get a good deal+Dirt Cheap and well worth the $2 you pay for itI wouldn't mind spending extra cash on this to grab copies for my friends, and this is an even bigger steal when on sale.+Cheap enough to where it's convent to buy a copy for a friend+A few wacky weaponsLike the freeze gun and laser.Cons-Later levels are almost impossible soloI'd highly recommend buying a copy for a friend and teaming up, as the zombies get really strong later on.-Only two gamemodesDefense and Endless, would like to see a ""Play as zombies"" mode or even a campaign-No storylineMinor thing, this game is great without it-Limited character optionsYou get the Swat, Girl, and Boy. Given this has a maximum of 4 players, 4 skins would be nice.RatingThis is an easy 8/10.Great concept, great gameplay, and a great game to sit down with friends and work on getting the top rank on the leaderboard.

												After selling the Steam Cards, this game came out to about 64 cents; and given that I've already put in over an hour to the game (with at least as much time left), and it's only in Alpha - I'd say it's well worth purchasing.It's very simple:  buy weapons and baricades to kill increasingly plentiful, powerful, and speedy horde of zombies until you're eventually overrun.  There are a few obtainable achievements making it a good game for metagamers looking for an easy stats booster, and its simplicity lends itself to a quick play timetable making it perfect for random dull spots in your day.

												In just the short time I played the game, I do have a few pros and cons to point out.Pros: It's a fun top-down zombie shooter, especially when you can co-op with other players. Endless fun until you're dead, aim to be at the top of the leaderboards.Cons: Unfortunately, there seems to be some major lag when playing with other people online. =( I think the only way this game can be enjoyable and lag-free is via LAN with some real life friends. Some other notes also, I bought the Auto Turret, thinking it's a machine gun turret that'll fire at zombies if they get too close (dunno if it can rotate 360 degrees or not, or if zombies have to be in front of it, or if it can shoot over barricades). But when I bought it, I watched as the zombies went up to it, bashing it, and destroyed it, and it never fired a single shot. =( Is there something we're supposed to do to get it working? Or is it just a broken item? Another problem also is I found the Flame Thrower to be utterly useless. Short spurt of flame, then reload. Short spurt, reload. Never seen a flame thrower with such a small capacity, and when I played one online game with this person, it was just an utterly useless weapon. The shotgun turned out to be the better option as the spread shots would hit multiple zombies better than the flame thrower (also flame thrower doesn't seem to catch zombies on fire, or you just don't see the fire animation on the zombies, so you can never tell if you got them or not).So yea, unfortunately the cons outweigh the pros right now, as I can't think of many pros. It is fun though, and I love how it has trading cards too (selling those should cover the cost of buying my copy of the game). I hope the devs work out some bugs, and polish it up abit. After all, it's supposedly a ""Zombie Defense"" game, where you gotta survive, but at the same time you can build barricades and turrets, you'd think it could be a tower defense game as well. Sadly, what good is a tower defense if the tower (in this case the auto turret) doesn't even work? It's utterly pointless to even have in the game then. =-(I'd still recommend this game to friends, but only in the hopes that this game gets some free updates or even free extra content, then it'd be all worth it.*EDIT* Ha, ironic, I didn't realize it, but there was this small window still open in the backround after I had exited the game. I looked at it, and it was a thank you from the devs for playing the game. It also said if the game became popular and would earn ratings, they will include extra content free of charge, with new weapons and even game modes. That just made my day, thank you devs! =) Though I won't be editing my review on the cons till all noted issues are resolved. XD But I will recommend the game!			"

Perhaps if more time were to be invested into it, we could get a blend of comedic, crazy, and epic new weaponry, armour, MAPS and generally new things added to it? It's cheap, and it looks cheap. Kinda plays cheap too, but then again, it also feels like not tooooooo much time was thrown at it. Group play seems fairly reasonable.

												Wow!  To call this game a 3rd-person view of Killing Floor would be a disservice to both games, but the similarities are still there.  Do you like killing zombies?  Do you like building defenses?  Do you like to think through your tactics more than simply blasting through them?  If so, then this game is definitely for you.  Grab a friend or two, make sure to get on voice chat so you can plan your tactics and coordinate the building of the fortress.I bought this game on a whim, and I'm having far more fun with it than games I've spent $10-20 (or more!) on in the past year, so hey, if you have a couple bucks, give this one a try! and if you have an extra dollar, buy a copy for a friend.

												Bought this for me and friend. I must say that I am very please with the game, I think the removing of barricades and other placable items could be better, but apart from that, it was a really fun experience to play this game and I would recommend it if you just wanna shoot some zombies for literally no reason at all other than survival.

 Content to price ratio = Insane! That's how I want to start this review, it's only a buck or less if you get it for sale! Think about that. With it you get the option of single player, multiplayer, and two different game modes. In these games you survive through means of barricading yourself in, or kiting like a professional. Multiple different weapons, tons of strategies, and multiplayer! I bought a couple to disperse to friends, as I got it on sale. Don't expect a huge game, just a quick little defense strategy combat action player. But seriously, the price is worth the content.  ~Razznak  "

												YAZD is a very limited an simplistic game in the same mould of Nation Red.  Basically you play one character in an 3rd person arena shooter where you must take on and defeat wave after wave of harder enemies.  The longer you survive the higher your score. Though unlike the excellent NR, YAZD has only one map, no perks, one type of enemy and very limited replayability.  Infact once you've made the achievements there is almost nothing to bring you back.  Except maybe getting the best score on the leaderboard.There are three character types to choose from but none of them have any diffrenciating abilities.  Between each way you can buy new weapons to shoot down the waves of enemies.  In addition to your starting pistol these include: SMG, shotgun, flamethrower, assault rifle, sniper rifle, rocket launcher, laser and tesla coil.  These weapons can be mounted on automated turrets to increase the number of weapons firing during a wave but, at a cost.  Defensive obstacles can be brought to construct a temporary base to increase of survival.Perhaps its one true plus is the coop for up to four players but even then the session leader is the only one who purchase the weapons for the team.  Where its different from say Nation Red is that ammo must also be purchased for each weapon.  If this runs out during a wave you only have your basic pistol to rely on.  Which means almost certain death after wave 5.Gameplay is very repetitive but can be fun in short bursts.  Though eventually you'll succumb to its limited capabilities and uninstall.  Be warned - Only recommended on a 75%+ discount, 90% if you can find it.			"

Posted: December 28, 2014
												I got this cause at one point it was one of the cheapest games I had ever seen on Steam, and admittedly I didnt expect a whole lot out of such a low price but honestly I was rather pleasantly surprised.The game is rather simple, just shoot zombies with different weapons and try to survive with different means of defense that you can buy inbetween increasingly hard rounds.For me the enjoyment comes from the fact that it is simple and easy to pick up and play. The game doesnt expect you to learn some bizarre new mechanics or anything, you can just pick up and get playing.Now the only issues I have is that the visuals of the game at times can get very dark and I have been attacked by Zombies without realizing because of it, also the game tends to lag later on when there are lots of bodies on screen, though given the small price I'm not terribly bothered by that.Overall I'm glad I got this game, its nice and cheap and you get your money's worth.

												This is a simple zombie defense game. You fight zombies by day and build defenses by night.There is no depth, story line or different levels here.  This might sound negative but I don't mean it that way.It's pretty good at what it does. It has a kind of arcade feeling to it and is a lot of fun. Check our video below for some ingame footage!

												I have to admit that I REALLY didn't like this game at first. It's actually kinda boring to play it alone but once you get into the COOP, it is surprisingly fun to kill 250 zombie with a weak gun. Controls are very intuitive and the gameplay is easy. Given the price, I'd recommend it.			"

												I decided to edit this review because the game has changed. They have added quite a few amount of features since the last update, although it is rarely updated, it does get updated with new features. It now has local co-op so more then one person can play on the same computer, new barricade design and more. Pros:Controller SupportDeathmatch (I have yet to play this but it seems interesting.)endless night(You can't build or get new guns, really proves a challenge)Local Co-Op (not many games have this)ConsGets boring after a bitOverall:This game is a little bit fun, for the price. it goes on sale a lot and is worth it when you play with your friends. I managed to reach wave 20 with me and my friend, it's worth it now with the new update			"

												I had received this game as a gift from a friend who bought it while this was on sale, and after playing a bit, I went out and bought a few extra copies for my friends. I spent maybe 2 dollars total for my friends and I to all play together.TL;DRIf you're looking for a time killer, this is definitely for you.I recommend this game, even more so when on sale.Pros+Great for blowing off steam+Decent Graphics+Game actually presents a challenge & requires you to think+RNG for item salesThe item sales are entirely random, and requires you to check on them every level to make sure you can get a good deal+Dirt Cheap and well worth the $2 you pay for itI wouldn't mind spending extra cash on this to grab copies for my friends, and this is an even bigger steal when on sale.+Cheap enough to where it's convent to buy a copy for a friend+A few wacky weaponsLike the freeze gun and laser.Cons-Later levels are almost impossible soloI'd highly recommend buying a copy for a friend and teaming up, as the zombies get really strong later on.-Only two gamemodesDefense and Endless, would like to see a ""Play as zombies"" mode or even a campaign-No storylineMinor thing, this game is great without it-Limited character optionsYou get the Swat, Girl, and Boy. Given this has a maximum of 4 players, 4 skins would be nice.RatingThis is an easy 8/10.Great concept, great gameplay, and a great game to sit down with friends and work on getting the top rank on the leaderboard.

The UI could use a rework perhaps instead of one long list have it kinda like a shop inventory with the sale items marked, more barricade types. the weapons need to be set through 1234567890 it SUCKS having to fumble for the weapon you want in the swam of zombies.

The achievements are carefully designed, and in the most case, you do not need a co-op to get them.  The game setting is sufficient, though a gamma setting is required.			"

												I have to admit that I REALLY didn't like this game at first. It's actually kinda boring to play it alone but once you get into the COOP, it is surprisingly fun to kill 250 zombie with a weak gun. Controls are very intuitive and the gameplay is easy. Given the price, I'd recommend it.			"

												Yet Another Zombie Defense is an indie game by Awesome Games Studios. From my playthrough of it I experienced a good time playing with my friends, which I bought a copy for them.THIS REVIEW GETS A LITTLE LENGTHY. MY RATING IS 8/10.____________________________This game has a lot of potential, the graphics are simple, but sometimes a little too simple. I really hope that more to the map will be done, and more maps will be created. The flat ground doesn't feel like much, and having a map to explore or move around it would be fun, and add to the experience. The map itself is also a bit too small, and when zombies crowd on you, there isn't much room to run.However, I like the shop and money mechanic. I think sharing money adds to the teamwork and cooperation, but sometimes someone random or your friend can just waste the money on something dumb, and non-progressive to the game. I like this mechanic, but it can be annoying.I really hope more characters will be added, as my friend usually play as the same person, making it hard to see who's who until I press Enter to chat. I think it would be nice to have a button the allows gamertags to be visible over players during gameplay, and not just DURING the chat. I love the multiplayer, it runs so smooth! I can easily connect to my friends by just inviting them, and it works so well. The developers did a really nice job with that.There is a nice variety of weapons, and some are pretty OP, and useful. They work well when you need to take on a horde of zombies. However, the ammo can run short fast, and paying for it is costly. Some weapons aren't even useful (or work well) and they are expensive, however I found myself enjoying some of the cheaper weapons to my favor. The upgrade mechanic is nice, allowing you to upgrade almost after every level.In conclusion, I like this game. It's fun, and a good time waster. Hopefully more gets added soon, because I will definetly come back to play. The complaints I have with the game are minor, and I can overlook them. I give this game around an 8 out of 10. It's really enjoyable gameplay wise to just shoot stuff and upgrade, that I can overlook the cons.			"

The challenge of collecting all the achievements is fun ! Played this with a friend and we had a blast trying to figure out how to build the perfect defense, lasting as long as possible in endless mode, & getting all the achievements.			"

												Well, I grabbed a 2-pack for 74c. I've played 3 hours now and have unlocked 89% (16 or 18) achievements. The game is surprisingly fun and a good challenge, until you die then everything is gone and you start again. The games don't tend to last very long, about 10-15min on average until you figure out a good strategy.Playing online with others is ok, however it is a little complicated to learn the buying system for others. Also only the host can buy, the host needs to keep ontop of keeping ammo stocked, only the host can build and mount guns to turrets and lay mines.If you treat it like a simple challenge, the game is great. There's nothing amazing about the game, but hey its 74c for 2 copies! what can you expect!Also! At first my game was launching using my onboard graphics rather than my Geforce video card which created some mouse lag. Go to steam library, properties of the game, find the button to view game files, rightclick on the executable and make sure it is set to launch with graphics card by default.Cheers!			"

Could it be? a Good Co-op game?almost 3 more hours went past in a blaze of gunfire we had got more enjoyment for our money out of this simple but well designed game than something priced at 30 dollars USD all for the Refreshingly honest price of 2 dollars USD.the game plays very similar to the loved Boxhead2 flash gameWorth your money!

												This game is very small so there is not so much to talk about, so this will be a short review. This mini-game is a fun indie where you fight zombies (duh), there are 3 options for your character who you can play as, the guy, who is an average guy, the girl, who is an average girl, and the S.W.A.T, who is a... Swat. There are a range of defences like barakades (useless sticks), Steel Barakades (same thing just has grey paint) and an auto turret ( a broken gun just lying there), the barakades are just a smalll wall of stacked up sticks which somehow attracts zombies, the other barakades are just stronger, and the auto turret, tell me if you get it to work, (P.s. I recomend you dont get the defences). apart from that there are a range of weapons, from pisol to laser, shot gun to tesla gun, they are all awesome. the map is a simple flat land from a birds eye view with a lamp post in the middle of it emiting light, as you get closer to the edge it goes darker. zombies with differant clothing aproach you in round 1, as you defeat them, you get money, and a chance to drop a bonus pickup (like in cod) which could give you 'Bonus Money' or 'Extra Ammo'. At the end of the round you go into a shop menu, where you can buy weapons, ammo and defences (dont buy defences), every now and then there is a sale at the shop and you can get things way cheaper. if you are playing the multiplayer option and you buy 2 of the same guns by accident, dont worry, that means 2 of you can hold a weapon at the same time! (press tab for differant weapon). overall i really like this game and hope you decide to get it, oh and try not to die.13/15 stars			"

There are some players still in the internet in the 2nd quarter 2016, so you can enjoy co-op plays.  The achievements are carefully designed, and in the most case, you do not need a co-op to get them.  The game setting is sufficient, though a gamma setting is required.			"

												I bought this game when it was on sale for something between 0,19 and 0,99 cents. I did not except much joy from this game but I did enjoy it a lot even as survival and zombie game fan I'm quite sure other people would enjoy it too. I haven't played very much yet but with the random people I played with that were quite nice to talk to it is really worth the money.Pros:-Game still getting updated-Your player has enough things to upgrade like weapon reload speed, health etc.-Friendly players-Lots of weapons-Fun to play-Good power ups like extra ammo, speed etc. -I like how you shoot kinda reminds me of BO2 Arcade Zombie Survival which was fun to play with friends (zombie mode only thing that I quite played on that game)-It's cheapCons:-No option to sell stuff like wooden barricades since they become more of an obstacle when you have played quite some rounds.-I feel like the assault rifle should deal some more damage-No display of an name or anything above an other player at all timeThings that should be added in my opinion:-A powerup that makes you deal twice as much as damage-Should display some stats like which other player is using the other shotgun-Should display the name above an other player all the time since I have have mistaken an other player as zombie-Some more models is always nice-Custom crosshair :PI apologize for my English it isn't the best and it's 9:07 AM and haven't slept yet :/ "

It's just awesome when you play it with friends, so you can work together to survive the longest. So far the only negative points I have found, is that the flamethrower is a bit underpowered, and that on night 12 the zombies become really strong, however that may just be because I'm a terrible player, lol.Definitly worth the price!

												This was the best 75 cents of my entire life. For those who want a full review, read on. Otherwise, I give the game a 9/10 for a low price and fun gameplay.I found this game randomly, saw it was 75 cents for a two pack (ON SALE), and instantly got it thinking it would be only decent, but it's actually really good! This is a very simple game, and as such it is not very difficult to learn the different mechanics. As the title may suggest, this game is about defending yourself from zombies, but it's in a third person perspective and it's done pretty well overall. This game offers two gamemodes, which are Defense and Endless Night (which can be unlocked by getting to night 7 of Defense). The 3 characters are Guy, Girl, and Swat, and they do not (as far as I've seen) have any difference between them. I think it would be cool to add some special characteristics to make the characters different; such as the Guy having more Defense, the Girl having more Speed, and the Swat having more Damage or Firing Speed. Every Night in Defense mode you can buy upgrades like fences or weapons, and so you evolve from night to night. But as expected, the zombies slowly get more challenging too. This game is a masterpiece for the asking price of as little as 50 cents for a copy, and is still fun. For those who have that little amount of money in their steam wallet, I highly recommend getting this game. It's lots of fun.Yet Another Zombie Defense - 9/10			"

												I am not going to talk about the game in this review.Instead I'm going to talk about the pop-up box that comes up after you close down the game.I was going to say that this game was just mediovre and nothing more, with no special secrets. The regular oatmeal, as some would say. However after I saw what was in that pop-up box I have become a new man. The world is brighter, the grass more green, and Hoonie Boo-boo's mom more attractive.Now I'm sure you wanna know what made me-, how shall I put it? -""plant the flagpole in the everest"", but the only way your going to find out only via this review is by buying it.This is not about the game.

												This game, this game... When I was a young lad, about 3 or 4, my father gave me a gift on my birthday. I opened it up and there was nothing there. Then, I went on Steam, and wanted to play a masterpeice. I had two dollars in my account and I saw a game with such a beutiful title, ""Yet Another Zombie Defense."" I still guffaw in awe to this title, it works so well. I played this constantly. I got my entire family into it. We built bunkers that barely worked, used so many great weapons. Then one day, I played a round that I got all the upgrades and all weapons. I was the coolest cat in class. Even my teacher, Mrs. Fowl asked me how I did such an amazing feat. After that, I became depressed because the game was so easy it took me 7 minutes to get all upgrades and weapons. I was finished. The game I played so desperately was gone. I used everything. I left this game forever and I vow to never play it again. The end.Yaas Gaga.This is not a true story.			"

												I'm not a big fan of filler; That's why I couldn't finish skyrim, so I'll just cut to the chase.The Good◦ It starts out pretty strong and has some great features for a new game.◦ It has a simple and intuitive interface. Gaining an understanding of most, if not all of the game mechanics takes less than 5 minutes.◦ The first few games are intense and fun.◦ Multiplayer is a nice feature and works(relatively) smoothly. The community seems nice enough.◦ Decent sound track, albeit royalty free.◦ A unique ""sale"" feature where different items are discounted every day.The Bad◦ The game is simple, but so much so that enjoyablitily and replayability are nonexistant. None of the features themselves are bad... it's the lack thereof.◦ The game gets old fast. There's no variation between save for what you do differently.◦ No 'special variants' of zombies. The enemies are monotonous.◦ No difficulty scaling based on the amount of players in game. It's virtually impossible to reach level 10 solo, but it's nearly impossible not to with three other people at your back.◦ No upgrades. At first glance, this may not seem like a big deal, but eventually the horde can break your steel palisades in a matter of seconds, and your laser can do nothing to stop it.◦ No progression. Once you die, that's it you start at square one again with nothing to show for it. There's a ranking system, but it doesn't mean a thing in the end.The Ugly◦ Overall, the visuals are adequate. It's not disappointing but it's certainly not impressive in any sense of the word.◦ The setting is... Nonexistant... There's one 'map' and it's a lamp post surrounded by an expanse of concrete.  ◦ There are only three character types and no customization whatsoever.The RealityThe game isn't bad by any means. I got it for 67 cents and don't regret the purchase. You get what you pay for; A couple hours of entertainment. While it's lacking in some ways, the features that are in place are, at the very least, executed well. If you're not impressed easily, there's little enjoyment to be had here, but if you're looking for some quick and inexpensive entertainment on the fly, it's definitely got you covered.			"

												I really liked this game (for its price). Got a copy for a friend for $1 more. Some of the weapons need balancing (flamethrower and rocket launcher are too weak, sniper rifle is too expensive) and it's practically impossible to play a team match of Endless Night b/c the difficulty ramps up before anyone else can zone in. Still, I've logged more than a few hours already and enjoy teaching new players some basic tricks of base building and pistol kiting. I hope the ability to sell old weapons is added later - ammo randomly drops for owned weapons whether you use them or not.			"

												I bought this game when it was on sale for something between 0,19 and 0,99 cents. I did not except much joy from this game but I did enjoy it a lot even as survival and zombie game fan I'm quite sure other people would enjoy it too. I haven't played very much yet but with the random people I played with that were quite nice to talk to it is really worth the money.Pros:-Game still getting updated-Your player has enough things to upgrade like weapon reload speed, health etc.-Friendly players-Lots of weapons-Fun to play-Good power ups like extra ammo, speed etc. -I like how you shoot kinda reminds me of BO2 Arcade Zombie Survival which was fun to play with friends (zombie mode only thing that I quite played on that game)-It's cheapCons:-No option to sell stuff like wooden barricades since they become more of an obstacle when you have played quite some rounds.-I feel like the assault rifle should deal some more damage-No display of an name or anything above an other player at all timeThings that should be added in my opinion:-A powerup that makes you deal twice as much as damage-Should display some stats like which other player is using the other shotgun-Should display the name above an other player all the time since I have have mistaken an other player as zombie-Some more models is always nice-Custom crosshair :PI apologize for my English it isn't the best and it's 9:07 AM and haven't slept yet :/ "

This is a very simple game, and as such it is not very difficult to learn the different mechanics. As the title may suggest, this game is about defending yourself from zombies, but it's in a third person perspective and it's done pretty well overall. This game offers two gamemodes, which are Defense and Endless Night (which can be unlocked by getting to night 7 of Defense). The 3 characters are Guy, Girl, and Swat, and they do not (as far as I've seen) have any difference between them. I think it would be cool to add some special characteristics to make the characters different; such as the Guy having more Defense, the Girl having more Speed, and the Swat having more Damage or Firing Speed. Every Night in Defense mode you can buy upgrades like fences or weapons, and so you evolve from night to night. But as expected, the zombies slowly get more challenging too. This game is a masterpiece for the asking price of as little as 50 cents for a copy, and is still fun. For those who have that little amount of money in their steam wallet, I highly recommend getting this game. It's lots of fun.Yet Another Zombie Defense - 9/10			"

IntroductionYet Another Zombie Defense is a game which puts players versus zombies in a fight for survival on a very simple map. It's a very simple and straightforward top-down, arcadey shooter with a fairly large arsenal of weapons and defensive options to be used. There is a lot of fun to be had with this one, and has some very interesting stategic options to fit many playstyles. Read further to learn more.GameplayThe gameplay of YAZD (I'll refer to it by this acronym) is divided into three sections: Classic, Survival and Deathmatch. One common thing between these three is that the zombies get stronger and stronger over time, which means that no matter how hard you try, you're eventually going to die at some point though you can hold out for pretty long especially with a full 4-man squad. Speaking of which, this game supports a maximum of 4 players in any multiplayer game. Zombies drop ammo, money and power-ups for the player randomly when killed.ClassicYour goal is to survive each night from a horde of zombies that spawn. Each night has more zombies, and their defensive, offensive and mobility multipliers go higher every night meaning that survival is less and less likely each night. To your aid are weapons, pickups and the store. After you complete a night, you can shop from the store which randomly has items on sale. Money is an important resource which you collect from dead zombies, and can be the difference between an impenetrable defense and a failed run. Every few nights you get a skill point which can be allocated to upgrade one of the following: Movement speed, pickup range, health regeneration, health points or reload speed. It's important to identify which particular upgrade path suits your playstyle and stick to it. Survive long enough and you'll get to upgrade them all, but some upgrades are better than others early on. Defensive and Offensive options are plentiful and really cater to multiple strategic playstyles. Want to run around shooting zombies that chase you? Grab an automatic weapon like the uzi. Prefer to snipe out entire lines of enemies? Sniper Rifle. Need an effective area of effect weapon? Grab a rocket launcher or the tesla coil. The combinations are endless, but your money and ammo is not, so always think ahead.SurvivalThis time it's a race against the clock to see how long you can hold out from the endless wave of zombies chasing you. There is no shop here so the only thing that drops are weapons. Good luck collecting them though.DeathmatchI haven't played this one enough to give it a detailed review, but essentially you can now hurt other players whilst having to deal with zombies at the same time. I will update soon.VisualsYAZD doesn't really have much in the graphics department. It's not horrible on the eyes, but it's not very good either. The one map it has is very plain, and the edges of the map are simply black. A lot more could be done visually to give it a better feeling overall, but the devs may not go that direction.AudioThe soundtrack, while being okay, is repetitive and limited. Again, not much worth mentioning here. Summary & ConclusionYAZD is best played with your friends or anyone online for that matter. The fight for survival is a very fun experience, and can lead to some rather tense moments where you're struggling to keep your base from falling as the zombies close in. Playing solo is not really recommended, as there's much less zombie killing action to really enjoy, but you can if you want to. At the price it's easy to pick up and play, and it goes on sale quite often, so it's definitely worth your time and money. For what this game offers at its price:7/10 - Must...Survive...Another...NightIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												I know what your thinking, this game looks incredibly boring and the price makes it look bad. If you did think this you are very much incorrect, this is a great game to play with friends. Hours of fun for just for $1.99, although I got this game for 50c I bought it for my friends and played plenty of hours of this game with them. I'd pobably give this game an 8.5/10.			"

YET ANOTHER ZOMBIE DEFENSE REVIEWAs a gamer who love any game that include zombies, I immidiately love this game. The price of this game is so cheap if we consider that this game have Steam Achievement and Steam Trading Cards. An easy game to improve your Steam level. The gameplay is looks like the classic Alien Shooter that I love so much when I was still a little boy.For true zombies survival game fans, this game can be a break when you tired after genociding zombies in L4D or RE or Dead Rising.My Rating for this Game:Simple, yet fun! 9/10			"

												I was going to buy this game for myself when it was 75% off, but decided to instead buy 2 copies  so I could invite a friend. The small 133mb download made it so I could play with my friend in minutes. I can imagine that playing alone is boring, although me and my friend had a blast. There are only 3 gamemodes currently, defense, eternal night and deathmatch. Defense is really the only worthwile gamemode, with much needed improvements to the AI.Overall I like the games simplistic art style (although it feels very PlayStation 2 era) and would like to see improvements to A.I. and gamemodes. Definitely a good choice for a couple hours of fun (with friends). I give it a 9/11.			"

												 When I first got into this game, it was half a dollar. For such a low price I expected a low quality game with no longevity whatsoever. Granted, I still think it may not provide the longevity some gamers long for(IT DOES HAVE REPLAY VALUE, but it is definitely fun.A simple zombie defense game, that doesn't require any additional effort to play online(like downloading Hamachi).Pros:-Few noticeable bugs(other than wanky character models)-Easy to host, connect, and randomly join your friends or random people-Can be played casually, but has a rather large skill gap because of the room for strategic play(That's a biggie for hardcore gamers)-Very simple concept   -Easy to get into-Very little PC power needed to run-Promotes cooperative play-Replay value-No additional effort for connecting to playersCons:-Inconsiderate, inept, worthless, wastes of oxygen(Scrub hosts).   -When playing online, all the money is shared amongst everyone, but only host can spend it, so that tends to result in      greedy misfortune   -There is no host migration feature(If the player hosting quits, the entire game ends)   -Does not promote playing with randoms   -There is a grace period between each zombie wave(which is nice), but if the host doesn't want a break, he gets to skip      the entire grace period. Not only that but there is a very small respawn delay for the zombies, so if you have the      misfortune of scrub-based matchmaking, you will not get a grace period(no time to speak in chat with other players) Overall, it is a great game, and for a low price, you can go sell a few trading cards and come back for it.I do highly recommend this game only if you play solo, with friends, or happen to find decent competent people.Thank you for reading, have a great life.

												Very fun, simple game. I'm surprised this game isn't more popular, especially since it's so cheap. I would recommend buying this for yourself and friends because it's sometimes hard to play since not many people play. If you have your friends to play with, this would be much more fun. Sum of the game Max 4 players a game I highly suggest getting chainsaws for everyone. They're unlimited and kill very quickly up until wave 10~. This is a great way to save money for better weapons and defense.  Creator of a game controls all money picked up. You can click "" Buy"" on an item you request to have and it will say that you wish to have said item bought above your character Gun turrets can be useful, but are weak against being attacked. Be cautious having them unprotected Gun turrets are used by placing it and mounting it with a weapon that you have already purchased (it's unlimited ammo on turret as far as I know, with slowish fire rate?) Communicate by pressing ""enter"" A great strategy is to try and group the zombies together and kill them by following the edges of the map. Upgrade movement max for this to be best so they can't hit you Last three weapons seem to be the best. Blaster is great but may cause lag especially with multiple people.  I don't suggest getting the item-grabbing upgrade unless you reall need it.  Be mindful of what weapons you purchase. The more weapons you have, the more you have to switch weapons to get to one you want sometimes which is time consuming. I typically stick with 3 weapons (chainsaw, Tesla, Blaster)Pros: fast paced, lots of options for different strategies, simple to play, fun, nice graphics for being simple, smooth movement and shootingCons: not many people play, sometimes you freeze and can't move until you die, lag can be bad by around night 20 due to so many zombies and shooting, high rise in difficulty as you get to around 20, people don't chat and quit early, people may join your game and not agree how you spend money which may become problematic as a teamSome things I wish would be changed: upgradable weapons and barriers, option to change leader, minor glitches fixed (I've experienced two so far: one where the camera will stick and won't follow your character anymore and when your character freezes at the end of a round and either won't move or shoot until you die) "

												This game makes fun! You kite around a lantern and must survive several waves. On 4th wave you'll have enough money to buy a better weapon (I prefer the Sniper Rifle) or start to build up your camp. Therefore are wooden or steel palisades and turrets where you can mount all weapons.Every wave you evolve more. But the zombies do also. Each property of their damage, life and speed raises by a factor. There are even more effective weapons like a rocketlauncher, the tesla coil or a lasercannon, but the ammo is mostly too expensive or the reload time is quite too long. Another mode is the endless night mode. which you gain after 10 waves of survival. In endless night mode there are no palisades. Weapons spawn by random of killed zombies. Here you must survive 5 min max. The MP is stable and makes fun. Achievements are partly deactivated for MP. Don't miss this little but nice game. The devs have promised some more content if you support them.			"

 Yet Another Zombie Defense - just a short Review I think you can´t expect much from a game which costs 2€. But it´s a suprisingly interesting game. Maybe it´s not that complex but all in all it´s a nice amusement while you are waiting for a download or something else. Although the game is very simple it has kind of some variations (different modi, Single/Multiplayer). I think this is kind off a game every steam owner should have in their library just for some time to pass. And in my opinion the game is worth it´s money.			"

												i feel i got my money worth out of this game in the short time i've spent playing it. i played it with a friend seemed boring however as we progressed we learned how to mount weapons, make mazes out of the barricades, and how to stay alive. overall game is enjoyable and i recommend it.

												I was going to buy this game for myself when it was 75% off, but decided to instead buy 2 copies  so I could invite a friend. The small 133mb download made it so I could play with my friend in minutes. I can imagine that playing alone is boring, although me and my friend had a blast. There are only 3 gamemodes currently, defense, eternal night and deathmatch. Defense is really the only worthwile gamemode, with much needed improvements to the AI.Overall I like the games simplistic art style (although it feels very PlayStation 2 era) and would like to see improvements to A.I. and gamemodes. Definitely a good choice for a couple hours of fun (with friends). I give it a 9/11.			"

YET ANOTHER ZOMBIE DEFENSE REVIEWAs a gamer who love any game that include zombies, I immidiately love this game. The price of this game is so cheap if we consider that this game have Steam Achievement and Steam Trading Cards. An easy game to improve your Steam level. The gameplay is looks like the classic Alien Shooter that I love so much when I was still a little boy.For true zombies survival game fans, this game can be a break when you tired after genociding zombies in L4D or RE or Dead Rising.My Rating for this Game:Simple, yet fun! 9/10			"

												The game is really fun, at least on defense mode, haven't tried the other modes yet. The player gets to build his shelter from zombies during the day and fight 'em during the night. Each zombie killed gives the player money reward plus they have a chance to drop extra cash and some other cool stuff.In defense mode the game requires the player to be wise and strategic in order to get equipped with good weapons for harder levels and to be able to save enough for good defences. Each purchasable item has a chance on becoming on sale randomly by a small amount noticed about 25% for each purchasable item for in-game money.The few minor defects about the game though:1. When purchasing the SMG weapon full price (not on sale) as well as the ammo, ammo shows the price for it - 60 but player gets deducted - 80. And when it's on sale it is the other way around, the cost displayed is 80, while actually deducting - 60.2. Some areas of the map is for some reason blocked from deploying mines, I wonder if that's intended or actual bug???Some features to be added would be great:- No explanation or strength of the defences. Would be nice to get some info about that.- Also the weapon stats would be good to have as well.Overall experience and rating: RecommendedAddictive, always making you reach for better score and earn more money to get better defenses and weapons.Personal opinion ratings:Gameplay: 8/10Graphics: 6/10Fun: 8/10Average 7/10 "

												Gameplay is fun, recommend you to buy it when there's a sale on this title.Get your friends to buy the game during the sale, because all the fun in YAZD is in its multiplayer.What's disappointing is that you cannot buy weapons if you are not the host and if the host isn't buying them (quite a few of them happen to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s), then you are well and truly screwed. And if you are interested in conversing with teammates via team chat, then well, you can, but good luck mate. That♥♥♥♥♥♥is screwed too.In all, killing zombies is a good way to spend your spare time and if you are a fan of zombie movies (Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland, etc) and tv shows (The Walking Dead, In the Flesh,etc) like me and you would really not want to miss out on playing all the great/good/decent zombie games that exist, then get this when it's on sale.And hey, the game also has trading cards.

The only good thing about this game (excluding the trading cards) has been ruined. Now, the hosts troll you by only letting you use a s*** pistol. So you ask for a better gun. They ignore you.

												When i saw it on the screenshots i was like..Another unity game huh? Some weird♥♥♥♥♥♥again then i bought it on a sale for 50 cents + bought my 2 friends one So i spent 1.70 euros +-This game isn't as stupid as it looks, its way better give it a try its pretty cheap.The choice of weapons is really high and you really need strategy hereThe dificulity, it depends wether your good at strategy or not...For me its hard i suck at strategy but i still love this game+ Has much choice of weapons and baricades.+ Isn't easy, needs strategy...+ An ""endless night"" mode if you really dont like strategy and like some action :D+ Graphics OUTSTANDING 11/9 -IGN (This is a joke the graphics arent that good but it fits the game :D)-/+ You need some skill of strategy -/+ You can use the same tactic all the time since the lvls and money isnt really randomly generated- Can get boring really quick...- Really a few buggs that were annoying.. Like i use a health kit and then everything ♥♥♥♥s up... Or if i die i become really big and stay in everyones way...

												The basic of basic dual joystick shooters, Yet Another Zombie Defense sports a good tower defense challenge. Graphically, its not outstanding and its only ambience considered is a single lightpost among a dark, barren concrete wasteland. Despite it being beaten within the day, the replay value might be low, considering not much is left to be unexpected, except how long you can last. If you're looking for a quick and simple strategy game, look no further. But if it's the customization and creativity you're after, you might be disappointed, but willing to play for the low price.As an aside, the indie developers send you a message upon exiting the game for support and if you know anything about indie games, they deserve their time in the limelight.

												Yet Another Zombie Defense is a zombie survival game with co-op and uses the wave mechanics.I think it's well worth 1.99£ (right now it's 0,67£!) because it's so much fun.Here's my positives and negatives.Positives+ Very fun to play+ Achievements+ Wide variety of weapons+ 2 game modes and both are fun to play+ Co-op+ Unlimited time to prepare for the next waveNegatives(for a game of this price I really can't demand more than they've given so this is more like stuff I'd like them to have)- Boring environment- Only one kind of zombiesNote this though, to be able to enjoy this game you're almost required to have a friend to play it with. I have a hard time seeing myself being able to play it alone and enjoy it, but with a friend it's great fun. You can always make friends in the co-op mode, there is a chat option. 8/10 (considering the price)			"

												I got gifted this game by my GF, and honestly first taking a look at it I doubted I'd like it... but I'm glad I was wrong about it. Only played about 120 minutes and can honestly say it is fun, better with at least 1 other person and not sure if the game supports for 3 - 4 players. If it does, cool, play with friends; if not, hopefully it'll be a future upgrade! The game is pretty simple, survive the night with hordes of zombies coming at you. It gradually gets more and more zombies, zombies get tougher, faster and you're forced to manage the money you've picked up by the zombies otherwise spending too much on defense can mean your downfall because you haven't upgraded your gun to the Uzi or Shotgun for more damage. Turrets are pretty much your friend, mount guns you've purchased on them and they do consume ammo you've purchased as well. Manage everything wisely. You get a turret, you better defend it best as you can.Really fun, and I'm not one to write reviews unless the game really			"

												I got gifted this game by my GF, and honestly first taking a look at it I doubted I'd like it... but I'm glad I was wrong about it. Only played about 120 minutes and can honestly say it is fun, better with at least 1 other person and not sure if the game supports for 3 - 4 players. If it does, cool, play with friends; if not, hopefully it'll be a future upgrade! The game is pretty simple, survive the night with hordes of zombies coming at you. It gradually gets more and more zombies, zombies get tougher, faster and you're forced to manage the money you've picked up by the zombies otherwise spending too much on defense can mean your downfall because you haven't upgraded your gun to the Uzi or Shotgun for more damage. Turrets are pretty much your friend, mount guns you've purchased on them and they do consume ammo you've purchased as well. Manage everything wisely. You get a turret, you better defend it best as you can.Really fun, and I'm not one to write reviews unless the game really			"

												Yet Another Zombie Defense is a fun game. There are plenty of weapons to choose from and there is heavy strategising if you want last long. If I could choose one game to play for the rest of my life it would not be this. I got it on sale which is pretty much the only time it's is worth buying. You should buy it. 10/10 Would buy again.

												When i saw it on the screenshots i was like..Another unity game huh? Some weird♥♥♥♥♥♥again then i bought it on a sale for 50 cents + bought my 2 friends one So i spent 1.70 euros +-This game isn't as stupid as it looks, its way better give it a try its pretty cheap.The choice of weapons is really high and you really need strategy hereThe dificulity, it depends wether your good at strategy or not...For me its hard i suck at strategy but i still love this game+ Has much choice of weapons and baricades.+ Isn't easy, needs strategy...+ An ""endless night"" mode if you really dont like strategy and like some action :D+ Graphics OUTSTANDING 11/9 -IGN (This is a joke the graphics arent that good but it fits the game :D)-/+ You need some skill of strategy -/+ You can use the same tactic all the time since the lvls and money isnt really randomly generated- Can get boring really quick...- Really a few buggs that were annoying.. Like i use a health kit and then everything ♥♥♥♥s up... Or if i die i become really big and stay in everyones way... OVERALL RATING So far i would give this game a 9/10Pretty simple and if your looking for a quick and funny game to enjoy with your friends, recommended for you.			"

												After playing a decent 6 hours of what i consider to be the greatest masterpiece of modern times, it is safe to say that YAZD is the best RPG,Shooter,Strategy and adult video game. The game itself is the pinnacle of tactical shooters, rivaling games such as Arma 3, and Battlefield 1 through to 4. Its RPG nature allows it to surpass games wuch as The Witcher and Mass Effect. And to top it all off the strategy aspect feels like it came straight out of lego star wars the clone wars battle mode. I purchased this gem for 99 cents and bought it for a friend. We play it every chance we get and it is continues to serve as an excellent option when there is nothing else to play. All that is missing a competitive scene for YAZD, I already class myself as in the top 5 players in the world as my skill with the tesla gun rivals the awping of KennyS so when the dev does add it, it will pro long this titles life span for another 10 hours.In conclusion YAZD is the pinnacle of gaming, it the finest example of how a game is done right. So I highly encourage all to purchase and play this game I rate it 9 keemstars out 10.			"

												I will rate the two primary factors to this game (Gameplay and Sound) and include a final score below.__________________________________________-Gameplay 8/10 (Very Good)The premise of the game is to survive wave after wave of zombies that increase in Toughness (health), Damage, and Speed. Each kill you earn is money in your pocket, and they regularly drop pick-ups from ammo, limited power-ups, and bonus cash. After each wave you have the chance to build barricades, guns, or turrets to mount guns. After a certain amount of kills, the player can choose from a tier list of upgrades including but not limited to: Reload Speed, Run Speed, Health Regen. After beating a minimum of 7 waves, the player can now play endless night mode in which the entire game is spent during the zombie phase and you progress by picking up weapons the zombies drop and pray to God you won't die.The difficulty in this game is incredibly high. Getting passed early waves is easy but your choice in purchases will impact how far you can get in the long wrong. There's a limit to the amount of money you can make each round, and it's up to RNG to decide how many drops of bonus cash you can get to help buy those extra barricades or that final turret. The micromanagement of your cash is probably the most engaging part of the game, but as most defence games work this way this becomes an incredibly fun part about the game. Zombies have a one track mind and will do everything they can to get their hands on you, and their spawns are quite methodical as they will appear to surround you within a second with only one way out. It's very bullet-hell-ish.The Multiplayer aspect of the game is spot-on and has virtually no issues other than minor connectivity problems that seldom appear.-Sound 5/10 (Average)The audio in this game is quite cheap. The song that plays on loop is bland, landing itself on the sweet spot of, ""This is a constant loop but it's not annoying so I can tune it out white noise."" The weapon sounds feel like an after thought, like the developers forgot that they needed sound the entire time and made quick sounds, leveled them so they weren't abnoxiously loud, and then released the product a little early. However, like the music, they're on a sweet spot of comfortable absence.FINAL SCORE........... 7/10 (Good)__________________________________________Rating System:10 - Fantastic9 - Great8 - Very Good7 - Good6 - Fine5 - Average4 - Bad3 - Very Bad2 - Horrible1 - Apalling			"

												My first impression when I booted up this game is to harvest for cards. Well I decided to give it a shot and to my surprise, I find myself enjoying it! I was laughing the whole time I was playing it. It's the multiplayer mode that this game really shines! It can apparently go up to 4 in the co-op. You can drop in any random game that's going on over the world. This game starts with you standing next to a lamp post, and you must defend yourself from various hordes of zombies coming at you, spread out into waves or ""nights"" as the game calls it. They get harder to kill as it progresses, but after each wave you get to buy upgrades. There's a healthy variety of weapon selection. Here, the fun is building the barriers to delay the zombies, and turrets which let you mount various weapons on it. They can break if suffered enough damage from the zombies. I played co-op in a few games, and you gotta love chatting up with these random people and the creative ways to defend from the zombie hordes using the barriers and turrets. That made for a least 1 hour of fun, which is well worth the asking price. Definitely feel that more upgrades e.g. health, reload speed, perks can be added into the game (a la Crimsonland), but then it would be just a dime a dozen top-down shooter.Pros: fun co-op, comes with steam trading cards and achievements  Cons: lacklustre graphics and music, only 1 level design with 1 type of enemy, oddly enough only the host of the game can buy upgrades.

												What appears to be a simple game on the surface reveals itself as a well balanced environment to challenge your reactions and how you plan for each next wave. It runs well, it's cheap, and is surprisingly fun. You can look up tactics for it on youtube to see some cool approaches to getting a highscore.			"

												Zombiedefense with basebuilding - Turrets, barricades. Yep, should be enough to get you goin and buy this game.But well, heres what I experienced. GameplayShooting feels very smooth, zeds get fast very strong and you need to get the best weapons asap. You can put every weapon on your turrets so there are a lot of combinations to experiment. The walking animation of the playable survivors look a bit...strange. The legs are swinging around in the air like you are swimming, no idea. MultiplayerSorry but no matter what game I join, I have such incredible lags that its basically unplayable. Endless ModeSo there was a patch recently adding a new gamemode called endless.Too bad something went incredibly wrong with this mode, since it doesnt make any sense to shoot at the zeds, they spawn endless and you wont be able to pick up the loot they drop because else you will die. When you play the endless mode it will look like this: You run around in a circle kiting the zeds around at the edge of the map trying to not get sandwiched. Shooting doesnt make any sense. Im not sure if this is the mode we want to play...Dont know how endlessmode looks in multiplayer, but at least thats what you get in SP.			"

Pew pew! DIE ZOMBIE DIE!A very good game for such a cheap price, some features are missing but I couldn't complain because this is a small indie game.So you're thrown into the game straight away there's no story it's simply just a survival game with the object being either survive as many nights as you possibly can by building up your fort with the money you earn from killing zombies and picking up loot drops, or to try out the gamemode ""Endless Night"" where you never stop fighting zombies!Features:- The game ran smoothly with lots of events and animations happening.- The achievements to unlock make the game more challenging!- Multiplayer can be setup very easily for either friends only to join you or for you to let anyone looking to play online join you in on your game.- Zombie difficulty scales up each night.- The odd chance a zombie could drop a bonus timed boost for you.- There's a RPG leveling system for certain player skills (more playstyles).- Controls for both controller and mouse and keyboard.Missing Features:- Customizable characters.- Different types of zombies.- A few public servers where everyone could connect and play (no private match servers).- Players inventorys/weapons were independant in multiplayer not the hosts inventory.- Some different maps, random maps maybe?Another than that I really like the game and I would suggest it if you're looking for something to kill time with either on your own or with a friend, well worth the cheap price!

Now initially i had never heard of the developer of this game as they had only previously made indie games of not such great quality, but this game is exceptionally fun. Playing the game on singleplayer can be slightly boring, but playing on co-op with a friend or just with random users is a very fun experience.Pros:Fun Gameplay Great PriceGreat Co-opOkay GraphicsCool Upgrade SystemSteam AchievementsSteam Trading CardsCons:Singleplayer Can Be BoringPlaying The Game For A Long Time Can Make It RepetitiveOverall I Give This Game A:Buy It Now  ←Buy It On SaleDo Not Buy "

Another great reason to buy this game is becuase once you get enough cash in-game, you can buy some freaking badass weapons!I definatley reccomend this game to everyone, especailly if you want to play with your friends, 4 player co-op is the BEST!8/10 would fry zombies with telsa gun again!

												Games on sale for 49 cents. You have nothing to lose. Already got enough trading cards and got my money back just today. Over all: this game is fun. Single-player or playing with friends (I do recommand getting the 2-pack for 74 cents; give a copy to your friend and get them hooked c: Lol).Not the best graphics out there, but this game takes up 50 MBs.Really. You have nothing to lose.9/10			"

												Well I just played with some tactical russian guy. It's fun to play alone or with friends/random people. But the game needs some configuration, because ALL PLAYERS share the ammo/cash, game should give players to keep things to their own. I played only 3~ hours of this game so far. I don't know how about anybody else, but it was fun to play over and over to get some of the achievements. Well after I quit the game there was a pop-up message that said if I'll rate it up and give positive feedback, devs will add more content (free DLC'S beaches!), so... why the F not? (I mean I enjoyed the game). Keep up the good work! I wonder what other game modes could be O-O, I hope I'll live to see it lol xD. Well that's it for now (or forever)Here's 1-15 wave survival while playing alone and with some people (same match)

												All these unrecommended reviews are BS. This game, I can assure you, is worth so much more than the price that it is. I have been playing it for a while and it is a nonstop-addictive game. You have a wide variety of weapons and there is more to come. You can also build defences and play with friends worldwide/etc. If you like action, addictive and fastpaced game, this is for you! In my opinion, the graphics are good also!Highly recommended,8/10			"

												Yet Another Zombie Defence is more than just a tower defence game, It's a fun, multiplayer survival.I bought this game when it was on sale ($0.50) and It's great to play with friends.The creators listen to the community and usually fix bugs ASAP, as well as add new content regularly. Another great reason to buy this game is becuase once you get enough cash in-game, you can buy some freaking badass weapons!I definatley reccomend this game to everyone, especailly if you want to play with your friends, 4 player co-op is the BEST!8/10 would fry zombies with telsa gun again!

												This game is actually amazing. Simple, horde-based two stick shooter combat. It's so cheap. You should just buy it.Integrates with Steam better than $50 games do, and if you sell the steam cards you could probably make a profit.Did you buy it yet?			"

												~OUTDATED REVIEW~-About the game:Don't listen to the others. They don't have enough hours on the game. Like 0.2 most of them. This game is totally fun! The SinglePlayer is awesome, and the Co-op is great! Try this game! It also has achievements and trading cards. -About the community:The community is big, not very big, but has enough people playing the game. And the greates thing is that you can post new improvements you want in the game, on the forums. The developer (a very nice guy) is reading them and responding about what he will add in the game. The developer is constantly making updates. So feel free to post new ideas! -About the guys who reviewed this as a crap game:Guys, you'll find out this will become a great game. More graphic options, weapons, characters, maps will be added soon.Just buy this game and have fun! You can enter the forums and find some nice guys to play with in Co-op mode. Also, a new mode will be added in the next update, so feel free to check this game out, and post your opinions here!			"

												Spent $0.50 on it, was pretty good.Here are a few things that would be great:>Tesla Jumping (The lightning jumps to other zombies, not just one);>Longer freeze for the Freeze Gun;>Constant Laser beam, without the need of reload upgrades/pickups;>Higher DMG for the Blaster;>More melee weapons (Katana, Bat, etc);>Turrets don't need weapons to be mounted/don't consume ammo;>Remove sharing ammo/money;Thank you for taking this into consideration.

												This is a fun game if you have little time to play it because the zomibes are really well programed. The search for signs of life and then change their priorities when the find you. They can be tricked but, over time the can become an army of tanks that mow down walls in seconds. This game is also good because the auto turrents are easy to get so it is not just a tower defense game; this game takes skill and is overall the best indie game I have played.			"

												Well I just played with some tactical russian guy. It's fun to play alone or with friends/random people. But the game needs some configuration, because ALL PLAYERS share the ammo/cash, game should give players to keep things to their own. I played only 3~ hours of this game so far. I don't know how about anybody else, but it was fun to play over and over to get some of the achievements. Well after I quit the game there was a pop-up message that said if I'll rate it up and give positive feedback, devs will add more content (free DLC'S beaches!), so... why the F not? (I mean I enjoyed the game). Keep up the good work! I wonder what other game modes could be O-O, I hope I'll live to see it lol xD. Well that's it for now (or forever)Here's 1-15 wave survival while playing alone and with some people (same match)

												All these unrecommended reviews are BS. This game, I can assure you, is worth so much more than the price that it is. I have been playing it for a while and it is a nonstop-addictive game. You have a wide variety of weapons and there is more to come. You can also build defences and play with friends worldwide/etc. If you like action, addictive and fastpaced game, this is for you! In my opinion, the graphics are good also!Highly recommended,8/10			"

												Im gonna be rating this game by grades and on different categories:Graphics,Main Objective,Gameplay,Weapons.A = EXTREMELY GOOD!B=really goodC=DecentD=mehE=badF=horribleThe graphics deserve a C (decent) good model texturing,lighting...The main objective is pretty much to survive (the way i like) i have to give it a B,there couldve been more added to the main objective,like protect an NPC for as long as you can (president,injured civillian,soldier,cop,etc...)The gameplay is C it is very interesting,the zombies can overwhelm you quickly and the weapons are cool,but there couldve been some more kinds of defence props,like barrels,electric fences,spikes maybe even a flogger (if you played Shi No Numa in Call of Duty:World at War)Ahhh the last one...weapons! now THAT is a pure A.The veriaty of weapons is AMAZING! shotgun,assault rifle,flame thrower...wow they even have a ****ing laser cannon!They couldve added a minigun but i don´t mind,it´s still a cool game.Entire Game Rating =B! really good! the graphics could have been better and they could have put some more work into the game,otherwise is amazing and worth your 1,99€!Buy in the store now,tell em ClassyDerp sent ya!

												This game is a lot of fun, but there are some small drawbacks. With the current defense placement system, it can be extremely tedious to add and remove defenses while still retaining your sanity. Also, because the bodies don't disapear until the next wave, the game sometimes lags once you get to the point where you have 100s of bodies on the screen at one time. If the way you place defenses gets tweaked and the bodies fade away after they die it would be perfect.			"

												This game makes me happy not only on the outside, but on the inside as well. When I play this game, I get super excited as I slay evil zombies. The zombies make me scared to go to sleep, and I get suicidal. My parents as well as my doctors have to be in the room as I play this game, otherwise they fear I will kill myself because of how sp00ked I am of the zombies. If you get scared easily, play this game because the thrill of wanting to kill yourself is amazing. I recommend this game to infants and the elderly, as well as the average gamer. Go buy this game now!			"

												This is by far the best tower defense semi-open world themed zombie horror survival game (...that cost me 49cents) that I have ever seen so far. There's multiplayer, diferent game modes and even a 1-100% blood toggle option to increase the awesomeness that is Left for Dead 3 / GTA 6 / Dota 3 or simply YAZD!! (yeah right?) ;)...it's fun though, at least for a while :/			"

												This game is a lot of fun, but there are some small drawbacks. With the current defense placement system, it can be extremely tedious to add and remove defenses while still retaining your sanity. Also, because the bodies don't disapear until the next wave, the game sometimes lags once you get to the point where you have 100s of bodies on the screen at one time. If the way you place defenses gets tweaked and the bodies fade away after they die it would be perfect.			"

												I bought the two pack for 74 cents... definitely worth my money. Although this game could use quite a bit of improvement, it is very fun to play with friends and gets challenging after night 20. There isn't a lot to do in the game, making it a little repetitive, but it is definitely a good time for being so cheap and I would recommend.			"

												Im gonna be rating this game by grades and on different categories:Graphics,Main Objective,Gameplay,Weapons.A = EXTREMELY GOOD!B=really goodC=DecentD=mehE=badF=horribleThe graphics deserve a C (decent) good model texturing,lighting...The main objective is pretty much to survive (the way i like) i have to give it a B,there couldve been more added to the main objective,like protect an NPC for as long as you can (president,injured civillian,soldier,cop,etc...)The gameplay is C it is very interesting,the zombies can overwhelm you quickly and the weapons are cool,but there couldve been some more kinds of defence props,like barrels,electric fences,spikes maybe even a flogger (if you played Shi No Numa in Call of Duty:World at War)Ahhh the last one...weapons! now THAT is a pure A.The veriaty of weapons is AMAZING! shotgun,assault rifle,flame thrower...wow they even have a ****ing laser cannon!They couldve added a minigun but i don´t mind,it´s still a cool game.Entire Game Rating =B! really good! the graphics could have been better and they could have put some more work into the game,otherwise is amazing and worth your 1,99€!Buy in the store now,tell em ClassyDerp sent ya!

												Fun shooter, almost reminds of Dead Frontier sometime back. You always start with the pistol, unlimited ammo, but then on you can save up for weapons like the assault rifle, flamethrower, even lasers! (I know what some are thinking... ""IMMA FIRIN' MA LAZAR!!)Setting up barracades and turrents for defence, can be soloed or teamed with others to survive as long as you can, since each level it gets harder each night (Harder, faster, stronger... you get the idea).

												This game is better than CoD Zombies.Why?Take a look.This is my story.I buy the game.I wait for it to download.It instantly downloads.10/10.My friend starts messaging me.Asking If I want to play it with him.I Agree.I start Yet Another Zombie Defence.I am Welcome by a horde of zombies walking around on my screen.I look at the few buttons in the Top left of my screen.Theres no Multiplayer button.I am sad.I ask my friend.He says there is.Hidden in the Start button.I go through all that.Blah blah blah.Soon it asks If I want to be a:A GuyA GirlA SWATThats it.I choose ""A Guy"".I join.I Listen.to this music.of.There are zombies inbound.No warning but the sound of action.Shooting zombies with 4 shots.within only using around 5 - 6 clips of ammo.My first achievement...Then.Chapter 2 (Lol)It greets me with a lit up screen.Other than darkness.It shows me:My cashBuilding barThe Saleand the Buy button in the very bottom corner.I click through all those things you can build.I notice you can build guns.?So I build a chainsaw.But it doesnt give me it..So I just press Next Night under the buy button.Then. My chainsaw appeared.Like as If I was God or something.Then I continued to play the game.In the end I totally forgot about the friend I ""Going"" to play with.Cons: Not much buildings nor weps.Not such a active game.Zombies go bonkers when all players are dead (In endless night)Chat is a bit small in windowed mode.not much.Pros!Good time waster,Enough to make you focused on the game,Fun with friends, (and  r e t a r d s     t h a t    c a n   n o t  r e a d !)Rip: Me "

												Let's get a few things out of the way: Yes it is a port of the Xbox 360 Indie Game, which doesn't automatically make it a bad game. In fact the Indie section of the Xbox Arcade Marketplace has some amazing titles like Beat Hazard, Nyan Cat Adventure, DLC Quest, Any of the Avatar Based Games and plenty more. Yes it's another zombie shooter with tower defense elements. But it's still a fun game. In fact, it reminded me alot of a flash game I used to play called Boxhead: The Zombie Wars. It controls well with the WASD or Arrow Keys, aim with the mousem, and you can shoot with either the Left-Mouse Button or the Space Bar. There's a nice selection of weapons to choose from...except don't bother with the FlameThrower. It seems to be the weakest of the bunch seeing as I rarely got any kills from it.Are there flaws with the game? Well yes. For one thing I wish there was a weapon upgrade system in the shop between rounds and a bit more turret styles and defensive placements. Graphics are a bit meh at best, but coming from a two-man indie team, you shouldn't expect FarCry 3 level of graphics. The option menu is a bit lacking, but seeing as I only browse it to see if it has a fullscreen on-or-off button (which it does!), it didn't really bother me.All and all, I recommend this game for anyone who wants a simple yet fun zombie survival game.

												Main game ini sambil dengerin music nya memang BEST lah. Sayangnya,  environment di game ini sangatlah sedikit, ya dikit banget, cuma ada lapangan + tiang lampu doank. Kan lebih bagus kalau ada tambahan kayak mobil yang bisa meledak kalau di tembak, tong minyak dan lain sebagai-nya.Untuk Multiplayer nya masih aktif, dan tadi sempet main, gak ngelag, stabil. Sebagai Host, kita nanti yang bakal beliin item atau weapon untuk anggota party. Nah, di game ini ada Achievement yang MASIH BISA KITA CAPAI. Yap, gampang. Gak seperti kebanyakan game lain yang memiliki tingkat kesulitan yang amat sangat susah untuk mencapai Achievement nya.Game ini juga ada drop card yang memiliki harga lumayan.Sebelum kita main atau melanjut kan misi di ""Night "" selanjut nya, kita nanti bakalan beli weapon atau item item yang lumayan fun untuk membasmi zombie seperti shotgun, chainsaw, turret, flame thrower dan lain sebagainyaCash yang kita dapat dari membunuh zombie tersebut.Saya belum menjumpai adanya sistem Boss di game ini. Masih stuck di Night 10 .Well, nilai saya 7/10. Untuk kalian yang ingin menyicip game horror yang memacu adrenalin, lebih baik jangan beli game ini. Game ini lebih di tujukan ke Survival, dan have fun dalam multiplayernya ~Hingga sekarang belum pernah sampai ke Night 10 ~ :') Damn			"

It's got the top of the line super streamed turbo graphics which is best viewed with the all powerful computing might of wireless monitors features 3D so real it's may as well be real life 2. It's got the game and the play. It's mechanics not quite unlike the 2014 blockbuster Call of Duty Zombie Ghosts GOTY featured in E3 with Xbox One Kinect. And it's got an emotionally moving story that will bring you to tears and make Passion of the Christ look like a baby movie for real.Halo: Spartan Assault brings the excitement of Halo combat to Steam for the very first time. Battle your way through 30 action-packed missions against the Covenant as you explore the origin of the Spartan Ops program featured in Halo 4. Earn Steam achievements, complete missions and compete against your friends for the top scores in the leaderboards. It's time to join the assault, Spartan!

												UPDATE TWO: More items have been added and a few other fixes were implemented. The game is perfectly stable now as far as I can tell. The net code was improved. More items have been added and I still can't recommend it. Get Zombo Busters instead.UPDATE: The game has been updated with ""Endless Night"" mode and 3 achievements to go with it. It's buggy and crashed twice while I unlocked it [beating wave 10, which I had done forever ago, but had to do again] The new game mode itself is boring and doesn't last more than five minutes maximum. The item drops don't have any indication of when they will despawn. This game was, and still is, completely bland.This is hardly a game.Starcraft custom maps are more innovative.It should have been included as a mode or a mini-game in some other game...At least they only charge $2.

												Based on the title alone, it is obvious what this game is like.  Hordes of zombies are trying to get you, and you need to fend them off as long as possible.  While this sounds like most other zombie games, this game is as simple as that.  Other games like Left 4 Dead or All Zombies Must Die have you fighting mobs of zombies, they mix things up by doing things like escort and fetch mission.  With this game, fighting waves of zombies is the only thing you do.  When the current wave is gone, the next wave begins.  After only one wave, you will see everything the game has to offer.  With no variety at all, it hardly makes playing worth it.Another problem with the game is the scenery.  With the mentioned games above, there is plenty of variety even from the beginning.  Yet is about as bland is it could be.  The only thing you will see is a single lamppost.  Move even a little bit away from it, and the game becomes almost too dark to see clearly.  Even if the game was well lit, beyond the lamppost, there is literally nothing else to see.  There are no barriers, buildings, or holes whatsoever.  There is nothing else to see at all.  With nothing to see, you may as well be playing blind.What should be a bright spot about the game is the multiplayer.  However, it does not take long before the monotony of the game sets it even with others.  Even when playing with friends, the bland gameplay will overwhelm you faster than the zombies can.  It will take at most ten minutes before the desire to play something better kicks in.This game just does not have one good thing going for it.  The low price tag might make it as tempting impulse purchase, but when the game starts, regret over wasting money will overtake you.			"

												It's Nation Red if you sucked all the fun and life out of it.  Only one map with a single street lamp during the night time on boring grey pavement.  Waves of zombies attack that will randomly drop cash and ammo and health boosts.  After each wave you buy weapons/ammo, repeat as the waves get increasingly more difficult.  It's very barebones, but the price fits the quality.  I'd much rather recommend Nation Red than this if you are looking for a game of this nature.			"

But in the end there are better zombie games, L4D2 was free some time and there is a survival mode, it's not a zombie defense, but it's something. And there's also a free game called ""Boxhead"" that is too a zombie defense and it's much better than this game.At the end, do I recommend the game? Not for the original price.			"

												There is only one type of zombie, the graphics are stone-age and still manages to run at terrible speed. You are better off not even building anything other than a few turrets defended by walls, so that whole system is thrown out. The soundtrack isn't a soundtrack, and more like one song that is the most irritating and annoying song repeated over and over again, each time with a scream that can only be described as a poor soul who had to play this game. There is also the fact that when playing with others, only the game maker can build/buy anything. That includes barricades, turrets, guns, and gun ammo. Also there is the fact that there are only 3 things you can build: wood and metal barricades and a turret, and if my memory serves me right there are only 7 guns.I played a game similar to this on the DSi that was better than this. Not the 3DS, the DSi, and is better than a PC game made recently. This can only be described as a crappy attempt by an indie team trying to pander to that 10 year-old audience that is obsessed with zombie games, and is a sleezy cash grab. Don't waste the $2, and go buy a candy bar or something.			"

												I guess its decent to be a cheap game that I bought on saleId like the developers to update the game more though, then this game could probably be one of the better zombie defenses out there (to be honest I have seen better flash games than this), the problem with the game at the moment is that it sort of has some small laggs, and to be a small game like this, that should not happen. Character models should have been optimized better as well.Kind of a small single player map though, should have been a little bit bigger and maybe a few obstacles or something in the map. I feel like its kind of empty. I get the thing that you can build your own stuff, but I would like the devs to put in some trees, stones etc..Dont get me wrong guys, the game has potential, but my personal vote goes down for now.

Keep it simple, but something that could be improved is the building. The map itself is like 3 times bigger than the actual area you can build in. The idea of mounting any gun onto the turret is brilliant! More weapons, more characters, more defense!Anyways, nice game. Had fun.			"

												If you’re thinking about buying ‘YAZD’ because you need your top-down Zombie-shootin’ fix and it’s cheap, don’t. It really is cheap. I wouldn’t have it, if it hadn’t been part of a bundle [which, in retrospect, I don’t exactly know *WHY* I bought it anyway]. There’s no variety, no real feedback when you get hit, nothing compelling at all.There’s already a better alternative on Steam. So, if you really haven’t bought it yet, buy ‘Nation Red’ ASAP. It’s better in every aspect.			"

												No, just no.Stay far away from this game. It's pretty horrible and boring.There's: one map (with a lamppost in the middle of it), one type of zombie (which sometimes rushes you), one sound track (which gets old after the first thirty second loop).At the end of every round the zombie count is upped and the zombies take more shots to kill. This continues until you die. ""Fun""I can't say many games aren't worth $2... but this isn't. Not even close.Co-op might make the game better, but how could I ever recommend any of my friends to buy it?You could make this game (minus the networking) in Unity for free in about a weekend.On the plus side, the developer seems to be very active in trying to make the game better.If the game were ""Early Access"" I think it would easier to not be so negative, but this game is so minimal that it's not really a game. It's not completed. It would have been better to keep from releasing and added at least one more level and a few more zombie types. This just gets boring really quickly.If you want to see how this type of game is done correctly, go buy and play Nation Red.It's 5x the price, but 20x the game.Just... no.			"

												YAZD is the standard ""Zombie Defense"" gimmick (as made obvious by the title), But there's really only so much enjoyment you can get out of this gimmick, and YAZD just fails to entertain me. I, as many others only bought YAZD because I got a 90% coupon for it. Honestly, YAZD's one of the very few games that I hold Buyers Remorse over. I've spent roughly seven minutes in this game to-date, And in those seven minutes I managed to figure out pretty much the entire game.The gameplay is fairly standard: You are a survivor with a supply of weapons (That you for some reason must purchase) who mindlessly slaughters zombies. Most of the game is spent holding down the Left Mouse Button and strafing around the zombies, And at later stages even strafing becomes useless when the zombies get faster. There are two barricades you can purchase (which I found wildly useless) and a sentry gun (Mildly helpful, But you have to relinquish one of your weapons for it).The graphics (Yes, I know graphics aren't eveything, But still.) are subpar, from the character animations to the lazily done Single level. There's nothing impressive about the barren level, and the only scenery on the SINGLE LEVEL is one lamppost, Which even then has completely terrible lighting.The UI has a rookie feel to it, With current ammo being a confusing yellow bar and health being the standard red bar, Money is displayed in a green font. Honestly, The UI isn't really bad, though that may just be the minimal amount of elements to it.For droppable items, there is a very scant amount of them: Ammo, Health, and extra Money pick-ups. Ammo is fairly obvious along with money, But health just gives you full health off the bat. All three are displayed with the generic sprites that you've seen everywhere.And for sound; I can't really complain about weapon noises or zombie sounds, As you can't really make ""correct"" sounds for them. But the music is just not good, It doesn't sound like you're in a zombie apocalypse, fighting for your life. And with that, There's no ambiance (though, That's probably because of the lack of scenery, Not really the musician's fault).Overall, I honestly cannot reccomend YAZD to anyone in good faith. To me, It feels more like an indie-startup's first project than a full fledged game. I personally feel that $2 is too much for a game where there's nothing but an established gimmick. I sorely regret impulse-buying YAZD just because I saw the price. Oh well though.			"

												It does what it says on the tin. It is another zombie defense shooter.But the ""building"" mechanics don't make this game look more appealing than other zombie shooters, nor the rest of the game is fleshed out enough to make it stand among others.The menus aren't well organized; you can't leave the pause menu with ESC, the options menu is bare bones, the purchase menu is laid across the screen borders and hard to navigate on high-res monitors. In generals it feels like it was designed to be used with a controller.The graphics are not that great but it's not that important; however the character movements feel a bit off, and I've yet to figure out if it is the game in and of itself, or it's due the ""upgrade system"".It is mildly entertaining and rewarding, it's also very cheap, but if you ask me, I cannot recommend you this game.I'd rather play Nation Red.

												An indie game that is very obviously not able to walk yet. I frankly don't know why it's available for purchase in its current state and, apparently, not marked as an Early Access game. The reason I'm writing this is because opening the menu while you're playing removes the HUD. It pauses the game and removes all the text from the screen. Just...wow. The menu options are still there, you just can't see them. After some frantic clicking and mashing the keyboard, it thanked me for subscribing to their newsletter, but I was unable to unpause the game. That and several other bugs and missing features simply don't make this game worth any money at this point.			"

												Yet Another Zombie Defense -This game is fast paced and can get quite difficult if you make mistakes. The whole time I played this game, I experienced one bug and it was funny not game-breaking and lasted mere seconds.Overall, This game is awesome and the developers did an awesome job. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good time in an indie title.			"

												The best thing about this game is the fact that the title is truthful.It really is just Another Zombie Defense.Not only is it dirt cheap, but it also has trading cards & achievements. Something you don't find in cheaper games.Also if your looking to level up your steam profile, this game only has 5 trading cards. And they are pretty cheap.			"

												Perhaps the best game ever made. I had been chasing after a professional career in DotA 2 but this game managed to show me how little I really knew about competitive gaming. The strats go way beyond anything I have ever encountered in a video game. Who could forget the brilliant roster of three heroes, each oozing personality in a way I have never seen in any MOBA? My favorite hero is SWAT bloke because he's pretty cool tbh fam. I look forward to the many years of competitive play this game will provide me.			"

												The game itself is a great way to waste some time. I purchased the 2-pack and was not able to sent a copy to a friend so BE WARNED. DO NOT BUY THE 2-PACK. Just buy the solo game and gift it.That being said I think the game is fun and interesting and will surely use it to burn time in between matches on league or waiting for Incursions. Really easy to pick up the controls. It's an asdw movement and when trying to buy you use 2 to go forward and 1 to go back on the shopping menu.			"

												Really great game, very cheap game it should be priced higher (imo). The gameplay is basic but flawless you have to survive waves and waves of zombies by using different weapons which are a ton different than each other. You might think the game is easy but after about 14 rounds it can get really hard especially alone. I recommend playing it with friends as in the game gets harder over time. Getting those achievements can be really tricky as finishing all these is actually a real challenge. Some complaints I have from the game are that some weapons are kind of the same as in: (laser=sniper)(blaster=shotgun) Their basically stronger versions of these weapons but have different particle effects. But still the game is very nice and I recommend anyone to play it. you don't have to like zombies or defense games its just the best game ever. I kinda get triggered lol whenever my mate loses the game. This game is also hilarious it has led to many different hilarious journeys with my friend. I recommend playing endless night mode with a pistol only. Lol just try doing that. Try getting to round 15 with the pistol only :).8.5/10 Make more diverse weapons and its 10/10 m8			"

												Perhaps the best game ever made. I had been chasing after a professional career in DotA 2 but this game managed to show me how little I really knew about competitive gaming. The strats go way beyond anything I have ever encountered in a video game. Who could forget the brilliant roster of three heroes, each oozing personality in a way I have never seen in any MOBA? My favorite hero is SWAT bloke because he's pretty cool tbh fam. I look forward to the many years of competitive play this game will provide me.			"

												The game itself is a great way to waste some time. I purchased the 2-pack and was not able to sent a copy to a friend so BE WARNED. DO NOT BUY THE 2-PACK. Just buy the solo game and gift it.That being said I think the game is fun and interesting and will surely use it to burn time in between matches on league or waiting for Incursions. Really easy to pick up the controls. It's an asdw movement and when trying to buy you use 2 to go forward and 1 to go back on the shopping menu.			"

												well... where do i startyet another zombie defence is a cheap, pretty pointless game on steam. here are the pors and consPROS.it's a zombie game.you can buy difrent weapons to defend your home.you can build a basewith that being said, here are the consCONS.there's not much building materials.the games not detailed well [you fight the zombies on a sea of concrete].the map is tiny.the playermodels look really ugly.if you build a base that completely goes around you, you will be stuck and cannot get out. .no jump buttonthe game needs much more map detail like maybe some props or something like that. a few more weapons would be nice and much more building materials like maybe sandbags or barbed wire or even a guard tower wich would be pretty awsome. i do not recomend this game bt if you need a simple game to kill time when you are bored, try yet another zombie defense. i hope this review was helpfull			"

												From what i can say of this game on the XBOX 360 (Xbox indie games), to me at first when this game appeared on the steam market place it seemed like a full cash grab, i with this knowledge in hand bought it. But, it never ended there... It received updates, patches, even trading cards and extras. This game did a full turn-around as basic as it could be, I'm kind of happy the dev has been still updating. I recommend this game fully for what it is.			"

												Of all the dud games I wish I could delete from my Steam library, this one is the worst.If this was the product of a summer day camp for 5th graders, I'd say ""keep it up, kids, you have some potential"". If it's the product of grown adults, I say put down the bong and go get a job you're qualified for, like sorting recycling or picking up trash by the side of the road.I feel that burning a one dollar bill would have given more lasting enjoyment than buying this.

												Simplicity meets epic moments!    What can I say, I'm tired of the FPS, MMORPG, RTS, games.  I look for a game that I can sit down, play for 15 minutes to an hour, have epic saves, and fails. Wash my hands of it, and not feel like i've just wasted a bunch of time because something unexpected yanked me away.   All the old school gamers (80's-90's) will really appreciate  this game.  LAN parties (if there is such a thing anymore) would have been so epic with this.  10/10 in my books, and with the sale right now, a two pack is only $0.82.  Drop $10.00 and send one to all your friends, you won't regret it.			"

												Fun. Spooky. Zombie. Gore. Exhausting. Raging.Tags for this game.Overall I give this game a 3/5 for these things I would like to see changed.-Why do zombies get to sprint but not us? Not even a stamina bar.-Mouse movement is just really weird. Actually kind of all the movement.-There are some strange bugs that, even though they are hilarious, cause the game to rate lower: giant legs of your team mates appearing on the screen, getting stuck in palasides...This game is really fun though and I reccomend it.

												The best thing about this game is the fact that the title is truthful.It really is just Another Zombie Defense.Not only is it dirt cheap, but it also has trading cards & achievements. Something you don't find in cheaper games.Also if your looking to level up your steam profile, this game only has 5 trading cards. And they are pretty cheap.			"

												Perhaps the best game ever made. I had been chasing after a professional career in DotA 2 but this game managed to show me how little I really knew about competitive gaming. The strats go way beyond anything I have ever encountered in a video game. Who could forget the brilliant roster of three heroes, each oozing personality in a way I have never seen in any MOBA? My favorite hero is SWAT bloke because he's pretty cool tbh fam. I look forward to the many years of competitive play this game will provide me.			"

												The game itself is a great way to waste some time. I purchased the 2-pack and was not able to sent a copy to a friend so BE WARNED. DO NOT BUY THE 2-PACK. Just buy the solo game and gift it.That being said I think the game is fun and interesting and will surely use it to burn time in between matches on league or waiting for Incursions. Really easy to pick up the controls. It's an asdw movement and when trying to buy you use 2 to go forward and 1 to go back on the shopping menu.			"

												I bought 4 copies of this game, one for myself and 3 for my friends. I got it a couple months back for 49 cents each. Every cent was worth it. One of the most fun games to play with your friends. Just mess around and shoot zombies for a while. What's even better, my friends would troll each other by making a massive hoard chase around one guy, which in the end, he would get surrounded and mauled to death. Hilarious. The gameplay may not be amazing, but the laughs you will get will be worth it. However, I would like to warn people; DO NOT BUY FOR FULL PRICE! The game may be fun to play with friends, but it isn't worth a cent over 49. Here's why:Pros:A lot of fun with friends.Zombie mechanics and gun mechanics make for funny gameplay.Forts are fun to build and get trapped in, and be laughed at by your friends.Very well optimized and absolutely zero bugs.Very easy to connect with friends.Cons:Very amateur.Not fun in solo.Extremely rare updates.I highly recommend Skype for playing with friends (when they are at their homes), it just makes the experience better.Overall, 10/10.P.S. I will be buying more copies of the game if the price drops below 49 cents during a sale.			"

												Curator Review:Yet Another Zombie Defense, made by indie game developer Awesome Games Studios, is a rather simple game. Priced at only $2, YAZD is definitely what you pay for, a simple zombie defense game. While the game performs well it is ultimately lacking any sort of depth. The game is exactly what you would expect for $2 and while it is fun for about an hour or so I don't recommend this game. 6/10

												I bought this game not really expecting a lot. I'd bought a 2-pack so i had a friend to play with. But damn was it fun. This game is excellent when in the company of others. Nothing quite beats blasting away at hordes of zombies with a mate. The music and graphics are great for this low-priced gem and the devs are even better; they will update their game, with NO DLC. NO DLC! Finally a game company understands the point in buying a game! You get the whole thing for the price you pay!!! Though it does feature its downfalls in that the space in which you fight is as bland and featureless as a flattened potato. The difficulty curve also has a major spike after about night 4. Still, this is an enjoyable little game to waste half an hour on with your friends.7/10 A nice adition to any game library.			"

												At first I thought I wouldn't like this game. But after I did a video on it and played a while it is actually very fun. Its like any other zombie game with a few unique things (I suppose they are unique). You basicly survive waves and get money to buy walls, guns and ammo. You have a health bar that can only be filled with medkits that are droped by zombies when they die. This is also a very challenging game.The VERY BEST part of this is this: IT COSTS $1.99! About 2 bucks for a game that can keep you playing for hours.Also play with friends!			"

I really  recommend playing with a friend. We were figuratively dying of laughter (mainly because we had no ♥♥♥♥ing clue what the game mechanic was). 10/10 as far as entertainment value goes.			"

												For 50 cents when its on sale at least once a month it was definately worth it.  There are some issues and areas to improve on but overal its an enjoyable game. The aiming is a bit choppy and some of the controls and game mechanics could be worked on a bit more such as: only one person can buy for everyone, you can only scroll through weapons rather than buttons set to weapons, not much of an explaination for most parts of the game.  Most of these can be overlooked however but it would be nice for them to be fixed			"

												The game is a fun concept with some RPG elements (upgrading speed, reload time, pick up distance, etc.) and for $2 is hard to complain but man, the game is fundemantally flawed. The hitbox detection is the main issue,  as soon as a zombie raises it's arm to hit you, you're taking damage, no matter the distance you get away from it. The other issue is that for whatever reason the framerate is abysmal for me, my computer is no powerhouse but I'm running much more demanding games on it with no issue. Two things that are hard to overlook, for that, I don't recommend it.			"

												10/10 rotten banana's - IGN""Best game of 1015"" - The Times""It's like Skyrim with guns"" - The Washington post""This game just keeps you wanting more.. or less.."" - MeObjective, run around in circles hoping you can regen faster than the zombies can run.Survived your first night? good boy, now spend your money buying barricaides that you can walk thru and zombies can break within seconds.Got some left over cash? of course you dont, but lets say you do, go ahead and buy yourself a turret, but dont stop there, the turret needs a gun, and very exspensive ammo. You have even more money? Well now im calling you a liar, but okay! Go ahead and by yourself a gu- what do you mean you just di- what do you mean a zom- calm down dude its only just a g- HEY THAT'S MY MONIT-.You basically run around trying not to get hit by zombies and spam click your mouse.The aiming is horrid and so is the building machanics if you could call them that.After you kill a zombie they have a chance to drop extra cash, ammo, etc.At the end of the day once you killed all the zombies you get to spend the money buying barriciades, wooden, reinforced, electrofied, even one with a propiane tank in it.You can also buy a turret and a turret mark II. The turrets require you to purshase a gun and manually mount it to the turret, you then need to buy ammo for the gun which runs out really quickly, on round 10 it takes around $5000 of assualt rifle ammo to make a turret last the round.Did i mention the whole time your running around or trying to keep zombies off the barricaides they are breaking them and ignoring you? they target the most exspensive things first.You can glitch and go threw corners or barriciades, (and so can the zombies).When you throw a grenade you pause and cannot move for 3ish seconds and you have no control of where your guy throws the grenade.Every two days you get to pick a upgrade that helps you survive longer, extra health, regen, walk speed, etc.The public online mode of also horrid, unless your the host you cant build, buy, or pickup items. All you can do i shoot using the same starter pistol with infinite bullets that takes 2 clips to kill a zombie with.There are also a few powerups that drop that make you invisable for a short time or make you reload faster for a couple seconds.Also you get to choose from 'Guy' 'Girl' and 'SWAT' as playable characters.But for the price its a well made game and it will probably kill a few minutes of bordem or maybe a few hours if you get creative with a few friends.

												I bought this game not really expecting a lot. I'd bought a 2-pack so i had a friend to play with. But damn was it fun. This game is excellent when in the company of others. Nothing quite beats blasting away at hordes of zombies with a mate. The music and graphics are great for this low-priced gem and the devs are even better; they will update their game, with NO DLC. NO DLC! Finally a game company understands the point in buying a game! You get the whole thing for the price you pay!!! Though it does feature its downfalls in that the space in which you fight is as bland and featureless as a flattened potato. The difficulty curve also has a major spike after about night 4. Still, this is an enjoyable little game to waste half an hour on with your friends.7/10 A nice adition to any game library.			"

												I've read the negative reviews, and I understand them completely. This is a very basic game. Just point and click. Hell, you don't even have to keep clicking, you just need to hold down the left mouse button and watch devestation unfold. However, I recommend this game for two reasons. 1.) It's only 2 dollars. It costs less than most games on your cell phone. 2.) It's nostalgic. I don't remember how many times, be it in high school or even college, that I would play certain tower defense games that just involved pointing and clicking. (Hover over enemy, click them X number of times and watch them die) I love games like that. They are simple, to the point, and can bring hours of fun. Not to mention that you can play this game ONLINE with your friends or with anyone else who just happens to be on the game. True, there aren't too many weapons right now and it's also true that after you hit a million points it just sort of gets repetitive. But hey, what do you expect from something that costs less than a soda? This is one of those games that has many options for future developement. I really look forward to new weapons, new enemies, who knows what else might come. Also, one more perk about this game. It's a very small install size. It downloads fast and installs fast; and you don't need to worry about it soaking up your space like other games do.  "

												I really like this game, on the outside, it looks old, basic and boring but that is the complete opposite of what it is. It is really good when you get into it and has quite a high replay value for there is no story-line, only you (possibly some other people online....) a shop and some zombies. It IS in early development though so there are some expectant bugs but this game has potential!			"

												Simplicity meets epic moments!    What can I say, I'm tired of the FPS, MMORPG, RTS, games.  I look for a game that I can sit down, play for 15 minutes to an hour, have epic saves, and fails. Wash my hands of it, and not feel like i've just wasted a bunch of time because something unexpected yanked me away.   All the old school gamers (80's-90's) will really appreciate  this game.  LAN parties (if there is such a thing anymore) would have been so epic with this.  10/10 in my books, and with the sale right now, a two pack is only $0.82.  Drop $10.00 and send one to all your friends, you won't regret it.			"

												Fun game. Guard your lightpost with your life. Uprade to better guns and barriers. Get turrets and tesla coils. Yoy can even get a laser gun. Add brainless zombies and a little body odor to attrack them zombies and you get this game. You start with nothing but a pistol with infinite ammo. There is a reload bar but there is no reload animation but that aside you get to kill zombies. Each night the zombies get harder and it tells you by how much and where is their stats upped at. So all in all it is a game of kill or be killed. A new way to see zombie killing games where the zombies come to you and not you going to them. Remember its dangerous to go alone. Stay by the light pole and kick some zombie AZZ!!!!!			"

												Edit- Game is dead, cant recomend it. It was barely updated since release, and this was long ago.Dont get it wrong. Yet Another Zombie Defense isn't that bad. Really.The problem with the new reviews is that they care too much about things that doesnt affect in the gameplay itself -like ""bad graphics"" - I really hate when someone makes a review of a game, and put ""bad graphics"" as one of the cons. Graphics DOESN'T make good any game. Gameplay do. Fun do.Ok, we know that the game is repetitive, yes, it is. But, what you must consider is: The developers are working right now to put more weapons, zombies, and even a perk system. If this was the problem, you wont have it anymore. My guess is: They made the game, but didnt expected the game to sell well, and it did. Now, they see how much the game sold, and want to make it better, bigger. Remember, its a Indie game. Consider play with friends. Playing alone can make the game boring - unless you like the style (like me). Wait for further updates, the game is really cheap, and I absolutly not regret buying it.

												Disclaimer: I received this game for free by signing up for Awesome Games Studio's newsletter. Receiving this game for free will in no way influence how I will review it.Yet Another Zombie Defense's title tries to joke around about the oversaturation of zombie shooters in recent years. However, I feel that the developers of this game simply wanted to name the game this way simply to make this joke, and hope that people buy it solely based around that one joke, but put little effort into fine-tuning the game itself. The game itself isn't terrible; the main issue is that it gets very boring, very quickly. There is no variation in gameplay; it's just a generic point-and-shoot horde mode. And a boring, generic game is not a joke I want to laugh at.The player (or players, in co-op mode) selects one of three character models (a man, a woman, and a SWAT officer), and is simply plunked into the only level in the game: a plain gray square with a single lamppost in the center. You must fight off zombies as long as possible, until your inevitible demise. When you defeat each wave, you will enter the day phase, where you can buy weapons, ammo, and barriers. There is no plot to speak of; no joking about other generic zombie shooters, no calling out the popularity of the undead in the media. It's just you versus the horde.Gameplay, as I mentioned before, is simple: point a gun at the zombies, shoot the zombies until they keel over dead, buy new things. Lather, rinse, repeat. There's nothing wrong with having a simple approach like this. However, if there isn't any variation in fighting off the zombies (like, say, new enemy types, moving to new locations, or doing other objectives like saving distressed survivors or fighting off bandits), then the game gets tedious very quickly. The only thing that might make people constantly play this game is to see if they can beat their high score, or to earn Achievements.Everything else about this game is also mind-numbingly boring and awkward. The character animations are quite awkward (especially the player characters), and seem to only consist of two frames each, with ""faster"" zombies speeding up said two frames. Death animations are just the dead character faceplanting into the ground. The weapon animations are also uninspired, but special mention goes to the flamethrower, which just shoots a small stream of orange circles at the zombies, with no flame animation on the afflicted mobs. It also appears that the zombies can hit you the second they start their attack animation, even if you move just out of their attack range as it begins.Speaking of weapons, they don't feel like they dealt much damage against the hordes. The pistol feels like a cheap water pistol, the flamethrower is hilariously ineffective against large mobs of zombies, and the SMG feels like a rapid fire version of the pistol. I usually stuck with the shotgun and the rocket launcher, as these two seemed to be the only two weapons that dealt a significant amount of damage to the horde, killing zombies in 1 to 2 shots. If you're good at moving around the screen, you won't even need to use either of the barriers, except if you want to watch the bad AI pathfinding, as they get stuck attacking the barricades until you approach.After spending a bit of time playing this, I just cannot recommend Yet Another Zombie Defense. It's just way too bland for most people to put up with. The levels, characters, weapons... everything just feels so dull and lifeless, with miniscule replayability, even with co-op play. The developers of this game could have done so much more to make this game stand out, to make it worthy of the jokey name they gave it. But in the end, YAZD ends up being the only one to laugh at its own joke, one that most people wouldn't understand.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pros:+ Music is passable+ Co-op play give this game a bit of longevity+ Simple gameplay...Cons:- ...perhaps a bit TOO simple- One level; no more, no less- Weapons lack oomph, not many of them are useful (especially barriers)- Animations are awkward, both in characters and weapons- Only two songs in the entire game- BORING "

Way too repetitive.+Direct and easy game+Players share ammunition+Multiplayer makes it a thousands time more interesting-Waaaay too simple...-Too few weapons-Too few playable characters-Only the host can manage things (buying, selling and placing items)-Doesn't deserve to be paid-There are hackers-There are similar flash games for freePROS1. Direct and easy gameThe game itself is very easy and simple. You know your goal, which is to survive the zombie horde. Having such few and simple tasks makes you keep more focused. Moreover, the controls are extremely easy and it is almost impossible to get lost in the controls.2. Players share ammunitionA fact that adds a lot of realism to the game, players always share their ammunition and money earned with each other, trying to survive the zombies. This is an excellent factor that consists that both players have to save ammunition as much as they can, in order to have better weapons sooner. Well, they're in a zombie horde together, they have to share the 'wealth', don't they?3. Multiplayer > SoloMultiplayer is a thousand times better than single player. More funny and more challenging. Single player sucks, seriously. The zombies always come in your direction and in a straight line. With multiplayer tasks can be divided (one defends while other fetch ammunition, etc)CONS4. It's too simple!You just defend yourself from zombies. Nothing more. Okay, okay, I understand, this game IS defending yourself from zombies --but, there's literally nothing more! Nothing more! The terrain is flat, there's no boss, there's only one type of ammunition, there are only two or three types of zombies (slow ones and fast ones) and you can only kill a zombie if you shoot it in the head! What the f'ck, seriously~5. Few weaponsThere are just a fw weapons, ten or eleven, I estimate (along with one turret). Some have different aspects from each other but there are not enough weapons! This game's lacking mines, solid walls, homing missiles, katanas, daggers, bows and maybe some buffs? Bruning aura, speed aura, defenses, healing, luring... What about pets that deal a little damage? Or guns upgrades?6. Three playable charactersJust three: one guy, a girl and a SWAT member. They're all the same, the only difference between them is the appearance, nothing more. One could be a bit stronger than other, or faster, maybe more accurate? Or there could be level up system to increase defense for a small amount? But no.7. Only the host does things between waves!Let me explain. Zombies attack in waves. Between those waves the host can buy weapons or barriers, manage the ammunition or disassemble turrets. What about the other players? They just keep looking! Sometimes you want to help, building a nice blockade or buy a different ammunition and you can't, because this game system is bad! Being host means being the king8.This game doesn't deserves to be paidNot even a penny. The game itself is cheap (I bought it for ~R$1.50 -- ~US$0.70, I think) but I recognize I wasted my time, that this game shouldn't even be worth a penny. I bought the two-pack to play it with my cousin but now I realize this game was a waste of money and time (sorry developers!). The whole game looks like it was made in a hurry, to earn money and nothing more. It's so badly made that I played for half an hour and earned about 50% of the game achievements...9. HackersThe game community is dead. Along the dead community hackers usually join you room and eep trolling zombies and killing the rest of the fun and constantly you have to stop waht you're doing and ban them. I don't blame this game for the hackers, but they're annoying.10. There are similar games for free!There are similar flash and unity games like Yet Another Zombie Defense for free! Some of them are Boxhead series[www.kongregate.com]. And even they're simple, they are as fun as YAZD and free of charge!			"

												Okay so, you start out with a team of special tactics police officers and go to investigate these mountains where people have been getting killed. The forest looks normal but then out of no where you get attacked by zombie dogs and seperated from your team! So you get to a mansion and you're stuck inside - best thing to do is to search it and.... and... wait that's another zombie game. Damn. Hold on.Alright, got it this time - so you begin the game as a team of four survivors, you're all going to have to work together to make it through this thing. You start out climbing down off the top of a building in order to reach the evac center located at the near by Mercy Hospital - but before you get two feet down the street, Bill's getting pounced on by some Hunter and Francis won't shut up about hating... No, no, no! That's wrong too! Ugh, one second...Okay, this has to be it, sorry about that. You wake up in a field with nothing but the clothes on your back and your trusty axe at your side, within seconds you begin to feel a horrible sense of dread creep upon you as you have no idea where you are or whats lurking just over the hill. You make a mad dash in a random direction you feel might be safe in attempt to save yourself and spy out a cluster of zombies to your left - but what really worries you is the car passing by on the nearby road. As the car slows down to a stop thats when you know you're in trouble - and I've got the wrong game again...You start out with a group of your modernly trained warfare soldiers and fight off hoards? No, thats not even a full game... Ah! You're in space and theres this cult making zombie-alien-mutant things out of the crew, no this game wasn't in space. You play as a child trying to make the best of things and keep her group together as you try and survive a harsh and unforgiving appocalypse? Okay, I know it wasn't that game.What the hell did I just play then!?			"

												I think I paid something like 49 cents for this, and it gave me about an hour of fun local co-op play with a friend.  It's not worth full asking price, not by a long shot.There isn't much to the game and from a ""game design"" perspective it's pretty amateur.  However it worked with no bugs.I found the 'base building' to be tedious and unenjoyable to the point where I just erected a ton of wood walls as quickly as possible so I could quickly get to play the shooting part of the game.  I had no interest in exploring other options because it was a guessing game... there's no in-game information about why one base component would be better than another and I really didn't find myself caring enough to explore.The shooting part of the game is sub-par as well, but not super glitchy or annoying.  Aiming is a little wonky as your have to learn to aim above the zombies.But all in all if you like top-down shooters, buy it for an hour of something different.  I know that after my first hour or so of play, I won't ever come back for more.			"

												Great simple zombie fun for so low price!The idea behind the game is really simple and the game is easy to begin with but it gets more and more difficult when you proceed killing even more zombies. The buymenu after every wave is easy to use and something goes on sale every round so you have a little variety too.For the price (on sale it's like 0.49€) I would totally recommend this to play with a friend or two!

												Unfortunantly, Yet Another Zombie Defense does not compete well with the overabundance of zombie themed survival shooters currently flooding the market. It ends the way it begins; with mild apprehension and buyers remorse. I have no doubt that this would have done well as a school project or even as a mobile game, however for pc, it fails miserably to make an impression.Save the $1.99 and go buy a cheeseburger. At least the high sodium content will give you something to think about.			"

												Honestly, this game is good. Yes, it can get a bit stale after a while with looping music, but it is tremendous fun and I recommend it for everyone. The price isn't too high, graphics aren't terrible, gameplay is good. So, why haven't you bought it?			"

												Is pretty cool game but need more features and stuff. As always need fix due have some glitches but i hope they get fixed soon or later. I played for a few minutes and seem enjoyable so i like the game even isn't my favorite style of game. It should have some brightness control in his options due his black background not let see around the defense area where you go. At least this is my opinion respecting the other down or above me			"

												In the very short ammount of time I (thankfully) spent playing this game, I was surprised time and time again - and not by a thrilling storyline or astounding graphics - but by the sheer lack of depth this game offers. Needless to say, I didn't expect much going in, as the title and price surely indicated. But a part of me, maybe niavely, at least expected some basic core elements of a shoot em' up waze-based zombie survival game, such as noise made by either the zombies, my character, or guns. Nope. The best you get is a single monotous thud sound when firing some of the weapons - which sounds less like an actual gunshot, and more like the sound of your heart sinking at the sight of this game. Another basic feature that is missing altogether: a point. Sure, it's called Yet Another Zombie Defense for a reason, and that's exactly what one should expect from it. But the utter lack of depth to the game - besides a handful of guns to buy and a few player upgrades (which are unlocked here and there, but don't provide much difference to the game) leaves you bored after only 5 or 10 minutes.Ultimately, if you buy this *flash game*, here's what you can expect: running in circles in an extremely limited, un detailed environment, shooting identical zombie after ifdentical zombie silently, while a repetative music track from some royalty-free music site plays endlessly. Oh, and keep an eye on your health, because there's no sound or visual indication that you are being hurt, other than the small red bar in the top corner of your screen disappearing with each hit, making you question if you're really playing a game from the 21st century or not.However, I understand the limited capabilities of independent developers, and for that I feel this review may be a bit harsh. But, then again, independent or not, if you want good reviews and happy players, make a decent game.Thankfully, I only payed about $1 for this game, and I do know that you get what you pay for. But, then again, I've played free flash games that are 5+ years old that are easily 100 times better than this garbage. Don't waste your time or money here.			"

Even when the price is so low it's not worth looking at at all. Do yourself a huge favour and spend a few more bucks to get Nation Red instead.			"

												What do you get for $2? Yet another Zombie Defense game.  Not really a lot to this, but you're also not paying a lot either. It's a very simple hold your ground horde defense mode game. There's a fairly nice selection of weapons to pick from and 3 characters, but they don't really matter as they're visual only. The real ""meat"" to the game is the auto-turrets and walls. The auto-turrets allow you to place ANY gun you've bought on them and it then becomes that type of turret in effect making this a kind of tower defense game. You can even set up the little walls so zombies have to maze in through your towers to get to you. Will you play this much? Really depends on much much time you want to put into the walling and turret system. If that's not your thing, then this won't offer much for you. Do I recommend it? Again if you like those things it can be a good time killer while waiting on something else to download. So for that alone, yes I do recommend it.			"

												I received this game for free today from a bundle that i had bought.  I think it is worth purchasing at the sale price of 2 for 2.24 or 1 for 1.49.  It took me a few minutes to figure out that the fences cannot be rotated.  I have only played single player with a controller so far.   I was unable to get 2560x1440 support but have only been playing it in window so far.  This is a simple game with fun upgradeability and strategy.  No its not going to be game of the year, but if you like what you see you should consider buying.  I will probably buy a few copies for my kids just to support the author.			"

												First of all...before you bash this game for being a money milking game for charging $0.72 for two copies you need to understand the game. Firstly you're promised to shoot zombies just from the title and the the developers go full into consumer needs and puts multiplayer as a free bonus just for buying there game. They have over 10 different buyable in game weapons and structures to help you slaughter many zombies with your new favorite multiplayer game.This game has amazing graphics that put the Gameboy Color to shame, gameplay that makes Candy Crush look like a bad Tetris ripoff and animations that put the N64 to shame.Choose between 3 advanced and intriguing characters!The Guy: A broad man with a hat and jeans ready to murder zombiesThe Girl: For all the horny teens out there that just want there senpai to notice themand lastlyThe SWAT: For all the adults playing this game with their children.This game has many weapons including:A pistol: Your everyday basic weaponSMG: Your bullet hose that happens to kill zombiesShotgun: Just listen to them sound effects and look in awe when the zombies fall before youFlamethrower: I mean seriously! IT SPEWS FIRE!Assault Rifle: A stronger version of the pistolSniper Rfile: A one shot glory of madnessRPG: THIS GAME HAS FREAKIN' RPG'S!!!!!!and much more...Fight the same enemy over and over! You know what screw the special infected in Left 4 Dead we only need one simple, not confusing enemy to slay.Overall this game is worth the 72 cents for this well made flash game.10/10 Game of the Year			"

												A game like this is fun with friends...thats about it. Not much to this game. The only thing that I can say that sucks balls, is the tower effect. Whats the tower effect? When you go really far in a tower defense game, then you lose. All progress: Lost.  Its over. What now. It puts you in a slump is all, and some games are very forgiving with this minor annoyance. This game is not. Nothing much happens after you lose. No story, or anything. I know, I know, its an ironic joke game, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it im going hard on this for a reason. You dont NEED a story in a good game, but it sure does help games like this. There is NOTHING to go off of. Only kill, build, buy, lose. Repeat. It gets old. REALLY fast! If you play this game all night, you will hate it the next day. With other games you do that with, you might take a break from it, or find new respect for it, but this is NOT that kind oof game. It puts you in a really bad mood after you lose. And that's about all that I need to say that it sucks. Sure, its creative, it is sort of fun and cooperative, but no good game should make you feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥after 20 minutes of playing. UNLESS it has a really sad story! Story? Oh you know, that thing that Yet Another Zombie Defense GAme doesnt have at all? Do you want to buy this game? Sure knock yourself out, but dont complain when you get a headache. In some ways, its worth it. One of those Play-with-your-friends-on-a-sleepover-for-about-30-minutes-then-refund kind of game.			"

												i feel a bit bad about downvoting this game because there were so many hints about it being bad, (Title, looks, reviews) and I can only blame myself for purchasing it. It's one of those games that you play for about an hour, if you  have some friends to play with then maybe for a couple of hours and then get bored and forget about it. If this was a free to play game I would recommend it, but if you want to buy a co-op game where you have to shoot zombies just save up some money and buy something like Killingfloor 2. The problem I have with the game is that it doesnt excell in any cathegory. It looks awful, the gameplay is immensly repetitive, the music is nothing more than noise. On the other hand, if you like tower defense games, zombies, have some friends to play with and the game is on discount, it might be a good deal.			"

												i feel a bit bad about downvoting this game because there were so many hints about it being bad, (Title, looks, reviews) and I can only blame myself for purchasing it. It's one of those games that you play for about an hour, if you  have some friends to play with then maybe for a couple of hours and then get bored and forget about it. If this was a free to play game I would recommend it, but if you want to buy a co-op game where you have to shoot zombies just save up some money and buy something like Killingfloor 2. The problem I have with the game is that it doesnt excell in any cathegory. It looks awful, the gameplay is immensly repetitive, the music is nothing more than noise. On the other hand, if you like tower defense games, zombies, have some friends to play with and the game is on discount, it might be a good deal.			"

I think a mode which changes that would be neat. Now maybe there is i havent tried all the modes. The health damage ammo ratio is a little odd, but consdiering the price i got it for the game is pretty good. Id highly advise you buy it if you want a cheap fun game			"

												Zombie Herding Simulator 2014I have only played this game 2 hours total, but I feel that 2 hours warrants a review. What is this game about?It is a simple game. The entire game is based around killing waves of zombies.In between the waves of zombies you can build fortifications and have turrets, as well buy new weapons. I have yet to do that.This game is extremely fun and is casual gamer friendly. It is fun and is a difficult game. Since I enjoy just collecting Steam Achievements I have been trying for my first 2 hours of play to survive past night six without buying anything. I have yet to get this achievement. You learn how the zombies move and how the herd moves. It really is an awesome game. Even though I do not hate DLC's as much as the devs do. I bought the game with a steam coupon I recieved after making a badge. With the coupon I only paid .20 for it. I honestly would buy this game at full price, it is well worth the $2.00 and is a nice little time killer when you want to just shoot pixels and survive a Zombie Herd. I actually do not like tower defense games, but I like this one. Excuse me while I go back to herding zombies.			"

												Fun for the first two nights then the game sucks beyond all description. The zombies just magically get stronger and stronger every night until they require infinite ammo to kill one and they can 1-shot you and your steel palisades. Don't waste your money.			"

												For everyone whose wondering if he should buy this game  1. This game is in alpha and it doesnt have alot of features and mechanic's yet 2. DONT BUY THIS GAME IF NONE OF YOURE FRIENDS PLAY IT the game becomes very boring after 10mins if youre by youreself 3. The price is just like a donation pay 2$ and support the game that's the point of early accesMy Rating for this game 3/1O Below averagePro'sCan be very fun if playing OnlineHas a nice strategy feel to itCon'sPlaying the game alone is not funGun's are not custimizable and only 3 structers 2 barricades and 1 turret1 Type of zombie that gets upgraded by the end of every roundNot the greatest graphic'sno story plot at allFinal OpinionIt's basicaly a zombie survival that end's when you die if you have some Roleplaying in you this game might give you 1-4 hours of entairtenment if you play it by youreself 10-80 mins			"

												I know the price is very low, but this game is very poor. The only map you can play on consists of single street light and darkness around. Poor physics, can't buy weapons online unless host agrees to let you (which he probably won't). Entertaining for first 2 minutes. Don't buy it, even on sale.			"

												I haven't played this in awhile, and even with my playtime being what it is, I can tell that if you get into the right game with the right people, you can easily snag all of the achievements and all of your cards within an hour. Really, that's the whole point of ""YAZD."" It's uncomplicated, unpretentious, and it's cheap. You pick a character, you shoot things, you build defenses with what money you have, you upgrade your weapons, you get more ammo, you pick up health, you run in circles...not much to it. What you can expect to get out of this game is exactly what's in the title already.And for 2 bucks, why wouldn't you give it a shot? Does what it says, gives you a few little bonuses here and there. Totally basic, and there's tons of other games that are exactly like this one. This one has the bonuses, though. Most of the other ones do not. Taking it for what it is, 6.5/10.			"

												This game exactly matches my definition of a small indie game: it's simple and fun. Totally worth the price and the time I've spent with my friends in this game.You're spawned in a small rectangle world and must survive waves of spawning zombies! You start with pistols & few zombies and work your way up to Rocket Launchers, Zombie Hordes, Barricades & Turrets. BOOM-BOOM! A basic hero progression system is built-in as well, so in the end there're many possible tactics you can come up and tinker with to reach ever higher levels! (achievements & highscores)I do recommend this game and advise you to only play with friends so you can talk and plan your defenses and purchases beforehand.			"

												Well, there is one thing I like about this game and it is its theme song, ""Darkness is coming"". I can hear this song the whole day and fall asleep. As for the gameplay itself, what do you expect for a SGD $2.50 game? It is fun, no doubt about it, but content is lacking. However, I would recommend this game to causal gamers or to those hardcore Steam fans who try to own every game on Steam.Nice haunting music though.......			"

												Feels more like a free app that you download, try, then never play again due to indifference. Not sure what vested-interests many people may have to give it such a high amount of positive reviews, but it feels like it was made by someone messing around one afternoon with a game-making program that promises 'much success, monies and women'.I played 3 hours, which ended up being more for the achievements.. which I feel kinda sad about. Still, credit where it's due, it's almost free when on sale.(edit: Looking through my old reviews and it boggles my mind how something like this can have so many positives. Let's be frank with each other for a moment.. everyone's favourite 16-yo YouTube celebrity said it was amazeballs and everyone swooned, bought it, and couldn't disagree with their idol, right? Gotta be some reason behind it. Certainly any negative reviews seem to get trashed with the downvotes. Let's put it this way - most of the positive reviewers barely have an hour gameplay, and most above that only have enough to get all the trading cards while they went out for a few hours. Can't be that amazing after all. Sick to death of 'apps' like this clogging up Steam, and the review system is about as reliable and trustworthy as Trustpilot.)			"

												Keliatan dari namanya Yet Another Zombie Defense, game ini sama kayak game lainnya dengan genre yang sama, menghadirkan game top-view shooter dengan elemen Tower Defense, tapi kita defense sendiri diri kitanya, bukan tower atau base atau semacamnya. Yang gw bingung, judulnya cuma buat sindiran buat game dengan tema sama yang lagi mainstream atau apa? ---SPOILER--- Kita bisa milih 3 karakter disini, ada the GUY, the GIRLS, dan The SWAT. Zombie-nya? ada Mr dan Ms. Zombie. Cuma dua? iya cuma dua, sayang banget dan harusnya gamenya bisa lebih dipoles. Nampilin banyak macam jenis zombie.Stage leveling? Ada 3 elemen penting, setiap level akan naik kekuatan serangan, kecepatan dan kekuatan bertahan zombie akan naik seiring dengan naiknya tingkatan level. Grafisnya mulus, semulus paha gaben #eh. Tapi sangat disayangkan UI-nya gak menarik banget. Too plain, too simple. Meskipun cewek-cewek UI pasti lebih menarik #eh. Sound-nya kurang greget, musiknya bikin bosen karena cuma satu dan selalu berulang-ulang, karena suara lain yang bisa kita denger cuma suara tembakannya aja, suara zombie ketembak itu gak ada. Jadi buat apa judulnya Zombie, kalo suara zombienya gak ada? kayak nonton bokep Jepang suaranya di bikin mute. #ehGame ini bener-bener cocok dimainin sama temen sekitar 3-4 orang. Kalo udah main sama temen udah pasti bisa sampe level tinggi, karena tingkatan levelnya kalo buat main sendiri masih agak  tinggi antara satu level sama level lainnya, perlu banyak uang biar bisa bertahan dari gempuran level yang jauh semakin sulit. Namun ini hal yang menjadi menarik kalo main sendirian, harus bijak menggunakan uang buat apa. Buat fences kah? buat ammunitions kah? buat naik angkot kaah? #ehMeskipun gw ke data sama steamnya belom dalam jam mainnya (kebanyakan main offline). Gw udah bisa nyimpulin, patut dimainin? IYA kalo kalian punya temen atau waktu senggang. Patut dibeli? IYA karena harganya murah dan alasan lainnya cuma FOR THE LIBRARY!Developernya berjanji, kalo game ini populer, semua DLC bakal gratis. Ya semoga DLCnya bener-bener Worth to Play. Tapi bener ini game genre begini dengan jenis yang sama udah banyak diluar, bahkan bisa dibilang sebenernya game ini harusnya gratis, sayang banget mereka harus ngecharge $2, seenggaknya $1 mungkin?Gameplay: 4/10Storyline: -Graphics: 6/10Sound: 3/10Stage Leveling: 7/10Terima Kasih,Mahesa Nugraha#backtouniverse			"

												Probably one of the most boring and ugly zombie games I've ever played.  A friend bought this for me during a steam sale so we could play together.  We each played for about 3 minutes before deciding it wasn't worth any additional time.  If you like zombie games, don't buy this one.			"

												I know the games will have future updates but I'd post my review for the game as it is now. Pros:[+] Who doesn't enjoy games when you're with your friends?[+] High replay value despite being so simple.[+] The controls. Nothing beats WASD + Mouse.[+] Challenging. I like the idea on looting the drops manually to get cash and ammos.[] The game could use better sound effects. You don't see a quiet shotgun now do you?[] More content, more! Characters, zombie types, modes, the game is too small.Cons:[-] Bugs... Sometimes, when you build a barricade the indicator disappears.[-] After playing a couple of hours, the game becomes repetitive and you're most likely only after the high score instead of the fun in it.[-] Zombies only have their offensive and defensive stats increase and increase in number when you go up a night.[-] It becomes "" numbers > skills "" when you go past wave 14. The map is crowded that if you don't build a fortress you're pretty much done and you'll need atleast 3 people too.[-] Shop navigation is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥[-] Did I mention how bad the flame thrower is?This game has potential and it's not that bad as it is now despite having more cons than pros. So, I'm recommending it.			"

There is no setting for the FIRE button anyway.There is not even a  reset button.All in all, a pointless experience.			"

												Less complex but slightly more polished than your average Flash game, YAZD is an extremely mindless game where you shoot zombies, get cash, buy stuff, and repeat on an utterly plain map. You build walls and/or autoturrets, buy ammo, shoot zombies, get cash, buy stuff, repeat. Sometimes zombies drop cash, you pick it up, buy stuff, repeat. I guess if you were playing it co-op you might have more fun shooting zombies, picking up cash, buying stuff, placing walls, and repeating while your partner shoots zombies, picks up cash, buys stuff, places walls and repeats, but for me I didn't have much fun shooting zombies, getting cash, buying stuff, placing walls, and repeating.The good news is, during sales this game has an extremely low price, so there's a low barrier of entry to shoot zombies, get cash, buy stuff, place walls and repeat. If shooting zombies, getting cash, buying stuff, placing walls and repeating sounds fun to you, Yet Another Zombie Defense is definitely a standout in the shooting zombies, getting cash, buying stuff, placing walls and repeating genre, but I personally am not a fan of the genre of shooting zombies, getting cash, buying stuff, placing walls and repeating genre so I can't recommend it. Very repetitive.			"

												EDIT: chaged wording to account for error in name change.Alright, let's get something clear here.Lampshading the fact that what you are doing is overplayed does not give you a free pass to further overplay it.You might know this game better as ""Amazing Zombie Defense"" Which is the name the game goes by on Desura and Indie Royale, which is where I got the game. It has been changed back for steam.Unfortunatly, while the game is at least aware of what it is and does not try to hide it, lampshanding the nature of the game does not make everything ok. Skip this. It's not even worth how little they ask. If you're truely set on killing zombies on the cheap, get Dead Pixels, it's only a dollar more and a far better game.			"

Perfect un-polished and crap looking zombie shooter, but the game is just perfect!This is new for me, a crap and graphically un-polished zombie top down shooter with an amazing gameplay and experience.The game is very simple and it's straight to the point, it actually has some early access feeling inside of it.Some more info about the gameplay; In YAZD ( Yet Another Zombie Defense ) it's up to you to survive the nights of horror and help your friends out in horrorfying situations.You have a big arsenal of weapons for all possible ranges and damages, you have turrets, barricades and other lethals to design your own base, every survived night you will be able to design your base and buy/sell items and upgrades.There is enough content to spend at least 2-3 hours alone and with friends you won't get bored before you hit 10 hours.This game is made to be played with friends and has all right to deserve a saturday night with friends online or locally.Let's rate this game fellow readers !Pros: Amazing easy to learn but hard to master gameplay Super fun with friends Fast paced gameplay Great features such as base designing Steam trading cards support Good and challenging bunch of achievements availableCons: Graphics are terrible Menu's look awful Some things look unfinishedSo in a nutshell this looks like a unfinished game and they should fix that and continue the development ( faster or continue with it ) but the game performs like a finished and amazing zombie shooter.I can only recommend this game to all of you as it has  a great price tag and it's a nice addition to your game collection.It's worth it!Thanks for reading !

												well Yet Another Zombie Defense is a great Zombie Defense game like all the other other Zombie Defense games.... BUT this one has great gameplay that i have not Yet talked about.......It has barricade you can stop the zombies with, letting you build a Defense from the Zombie hordes....Note: It's actualy realy fun to play for some reason, no you cant spend hours upon hours but you can make a top down base with friend ,stratagise how the rounds money will be spent and join others if you dont want to take on the role as leader  (in this game the one who startes a game is the leader and is the only one of the group, max being 4 btw, who ccan buy ammo/guns place barricade as others in the group can only request things) There are quite a few differant wepions to use mines to scatter, turrets to build and well thats it just see how long you can survive. Simple but Fun (espacialy with friends)			"

												Wonderful game for such a low price. The Multi Player makes it even better, and there isn't much to complain about. It's so simple and yet so complicated that you find yourself staring at the game, trying to think of what to do with your money, then you make a sweet fort just to watch it CRUMBLE. Then you re-build it, and watch it be BLOWN TO BITS. Then, you invite some friends to tag along, and then you build an even sweeter fort, and watch that one SHATTER. Then you build it in a diffrent way and make it cooler. Then have your friends laugh at you. And then you all die. But hey, just start again.10/10Would die again			"

												Yet Another Zombie Defense is a game simply about defending yourself against an infinite horde of zombies.And just looking at the price and screenshots, it may not be the best ""eye-candy"", but it's simple scheme, and ability to play with friends (and or family), it is quite fun. The ""low"" graphics allows for older or less beefy computers to render said horde, along with a variety of weapons (soon to be growing- hopefully), one or many can enjoy themselves.Basicly, if you have friends, buy Yet Another Zombie Defense, it's worth the $2 USD!

												When I read all the great reviews on this game, I decided to purchase the 2pack for $2.99.  I hopped in the game and matched up with 2 random players online.  Game was a bit fun for a few rounds.  Then I started to wonder why the graphics would lag when about 25-40 zombies would be dead in the same round.  My pc build could handle crysis 2 on ultra settings and almost any other very high end graphics game on high.  Anyways, i continued to play, and building forts didn't matter anymore because they would go down within the first 15 seconds of a round.  Every round resulted in everyone dieing in the first 20-25 seconds MAX except for myself.. I found myself just running in a circle around the map with a chainsaw and slowly killing the rest of the zombies.  The only challenge was to get the money before it disappeared (for the other players to spend) while having no upgrades on pickup reach/range.  So, basically, 1st game i played of zombie defense and already i was invincible with probably the cheapest weapon buy in game, the chainsaw.  Everyone thought i was hacking but obviously they were just too.. dumb to actually listen to me when i say ""just run around in a circle like i have been every round and you won't die.""  So in conclusion, the idea sounded VERY fun, i've always wanted to play a defense map where you could upgrade either weapons or your character stats and build turrets.  The game however, lags when more than 30 zombies are dead on your screen, weapons are very similar in damage and effect so there's not a lot of interesting/entertaining strategies you could use.  Although there are a nice range of weapons you could buy (but like I said they are all similar so it's not a big difference of buying them).  So, good idea, bad development.Oh and I told my friend that I gifted the 2nd part of the pack to not even waste his time.  This game was not only a waste of even the small amount of $2.99, but a waste of an hour of the very limited game time that I have.			"

OK the graphics are bad and the aim makes no sense but it's a game for the home computer and to be honest you could probably run it on a toaster so all your friends can play it! If you're worried about a lack of servers don't be, you can just make one yourself and play with your mates!

												Seriously people, this game is exactly what it says it is.  It's defending yourself from zombies.  You have a light pole and have to basically purchase and setup defenses around said light pole to survive night after night of zombie waves that increase in difficulty.  You also have to purchase weaponry and ammo for yourself, although there aren't any upgrades for said weapons.  The game is extremely simplistic, so don't expect much.  Playing with your friends is highly recommended, as that's where the enjoyment comes in.With a cost of $1.99 I'd recommend this game, even if you only try it out for a little while.  That said, I wouldn't pay any higher than that.			"

												Great little game! Works really well with Xbox 360 controller. Developer seems active on the forums, open to all sugestions! Really looking forward to some of the proposed features of the game!The game really requires some skill, I think the furthest I've got is night 12, passing a night feels really rewarding! After that it gets crazy but from what I've read the developer is working on that.Multiplayer feature is fun but games are hard to connect to and sometimes just lag out. I'm guessing this is being worked on too.No real settings options. Not a big deal for most PC gamers however if your running intel 3000 or less graphics you may get some serious graphical lag even in low resolutions, would like to see visual quality adjustments. Would like to see support for more resolutions, Has trouble over 1080.Gameplay is straight forward and fun! I could nit pick some small things like weapons, characters and other stuff but for the price and the fact it's easy to pick up and have fun, everything else is just icing on the cake!			"

												This game is alot of fun, but it does get a little boring on your on. The multiplayer is pretty damn fun and can host up to 4 people in one game which is fine for me. A few cons about this game are the map layout and characters. You can't build your bases far out into the world, so they have to stay rather small, which really makes your chance of survival a little bit less because they WILL get in eventually. As for the characters, you have a very strict choice. ""The girl, The guy, and the swat guy"". Pretty weird, right? Unlockable characters would be nice. Overall, this game is a blast, but i hope to see more in the future. But hell, for 2 US dollars, it's pretty enjoyable! I would get it, especially when it goes on sale.			"

Yeah, I have only played 2 hours as I am typing this, but so what, I just bought it, its amazing and definitely worth the two dollars. I would prefer to buy the 2-pack, its like twice as better with a friend for only 1 dollar. Great game, I highly recommend it to all ages.			"

												For $2, this offers quite a bit of fun!  I appreciate that the dev encourages feedback to further fine tune the game too.  My only complaint is when you buy an auto-turret, you then have to purchase a weapon to mount on it as well, plus ammo.  I wish it at least came with an installed pistol that I could upgrade.			"

												I have played this game for countless hours on the xbox version and I am glad to see it here on steam! It has been improved upon and is just as fun as it was before. It's a simple, fun, and difficult survival game. The one downside of the the xbox indie game version when I played it was the lack of online multiplayer. Now with this version it is great to jump on with a few friends or with ramdom strangers and murder some zombies! It takes a lot of skill and strategy to make it further than night 12 and is a fun challenge. Its not without flaws, but playing with friends makes it a lot of fun!Overall I would definitely recomend buying the 2 pack and giving the second copy to a best friend of yours. It will make the experience that much greater and provide hours of entertainment for the price of a phone application.			"

If you were expecting a zombie game with the list of features that games such as dead island has then i suggest that you get your head examined, a small budget game means less features but doesnt mean less fun. Its a game...They also add that if enough people play the game then the developers will add content free of charge with the stance that 'they hate DLC content as much as we do'. "

												-----------------------------------------------------DANGER! DANGER!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Reviewing Yet Another Zombie Defense----------------------------------------------Verry cool game! This game is JUST 1.99 EUR and IT'S BLODY EPIC! This is a strategic survival game in a zombie apocalypse. In this game, you need to build turrets, barricades and to buy wepons and see how mutch as long as you can you can survive!1) Wepons: In this game, the wepons are: pistol, machine gun, shotgun (which is my favourite), rifle, rochet laucher and some kind of a lighting. Oh, and you can have laser as an attachment. (I dunno if I spell it right :P)2) Zombies: Lot's of zombies! AND MORE!! AND MORE!!!........But....they try to kill you (logic) and you need to kill them to earn money, health and ammo.3) Gameplay: This game has Singleplayer and Co-op. Co-op can be played with friends and online, with a player. The game doesn't have much thing and zombies, characters etc., But It Is A Lot Of Fun!!!So, the conclusions are: Such Fun, Much Zombies, WOW!....Ha ha ha! Ha........ha.------------------------------------This Game Needs Five out of Five Stars, So Buy It!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you buy it, add me at friends and say if I am lying, and after that, let's PLAY IT! (ok, maybe I exaggerated a litte bit, but it's a loot of fun!			"

												You can read the other reviews to easily find the negatives and complaints of this game; yea, it is a really simple game and there is not much to it.  The name gives most of it away.  Decided to buy it with a 75% off coupon, and it was a good game for the price, and to pass a little bit of time.What I like is the co-op option in this little, simple game. Though I have not played it yet, and I know there are much better games out there for it, I can still see me and a few friends having fun on here for a little.  Then there is always the plus for some people; that is, it just being a little game that you can turn on and do a little bit of killing zombies.  Of course not all people, but I know some people who would like this just for the fact that you get to kill zombies in it and test how long you can survive against the endless hordes.			"

It was fun and very enjoyable.The graphics are what you would expect nothing that fancy.There is enough content, turrets barriers and other stuff.Something about it makes me want to play more... there is a laser gun I want to get badly!!!!!!So everyone stop hating on the game!!!!!!!!

												This game will not change your life, but it is fun and addicting The entire game centers around a single street lamp at the middle of a very small map. The further you venture from the lamp, the darker it gets. So you are ecnouraged to stay near the lamp but not restricted from straying. It's your standard horde mode in that waves of enemies are sent against you that increase in quantity and difficulty as the game progresses. Killing enemies can net health, money, or ammo drops that disappear over time so you must be somewhat quick in picking them up. In between the waves you have the opporuntity to purchase various weapons and defenses which can give you a great advantage in the next wave. A nice feature is that these items will ocassionally go on sale making them significantly cheaper than their original price and stretching your money further. This can help in giving you that little edge up you need earlier than you would otherwise be able to afford it. Which can seriously help late game.As stated before, this game will not change your life and it isn't without it's faults. Mainly, it's limited. I would really like to see it grow and have new weapons and defenses added, maybe slightly expand the map over time. As is, this game is worth every bit of the few dollars I paid for it and I hope to see more. I'd give it a 3/5			"

												I get the feeling I'm going to become addicted to this quite easily. Considering the price this is a great game. It's not exactly Dead Island but for a zombie killing game you can curently buy for 54p, it's brilliant. Each weapon has its own advantages and limitations but the pricing ranges seem to have been worked out very well to correspond with the progressive difficulty of each level and when you're likely to be able to buy them. Controls are simple but there is no need for anything more advanced in this kind of game.Overall good game especially if you've got a bit of time to kill but not enough time to get into a big game. And it could easily become more than just a a way to kill time. Thouroughly enjoyable.			"

												Alright, so this game is crap, but I did the math, and...So I paid $1.01 for a two-pack of this game when it was on sale. Now, I get Three (3) trading cards worth approximately $0.10 each.That adds up to $0.30. Including the cards from the second game, we reach a total of approximately $0.60That means $0.40 for Two (2) copies of this game, making each copy worth approximately $0.20All-in-all, I'd say it's not a bad deal. I got approximately $0.20 worth of enjoyment from this game so it's somewhat sorta worth it.			"

												Perhaps the best way to put it is that I'm glad I spent steam credit from selling trading cards and not actual money.Not necessarily a bad game, but roughly on the level of a browser game- though, I've played many other zombie defense games that were more enjoyable.			"

												Yet Another Zombie Defense is a game simply about defending yourself against an infinite horde of zombies.And just looking at the price and screenshots, it may not be the best ""eye-candy"", but it's simple scheme, and ability to play with friends (and or family), it is quite fun. The ""low"" graphics allows for older or less beefy computers to render said horde, along with a variety of weapons (soon to be growing- hopefully), one or many can enjoy themselves.Basicly, if you have friends, buy Yet Another Zombie Defense, it's worth the $2 USD!

OK the graphics are bad and the aim makes no sense but it's a game for the home computer and to be honest you could probably run it on a toaster so all your friends can play it! If you're worried about a lack of servers don't be, you can just make one yourself and play with your mates!

												Bought the game when its on sale: $0.39 i think or a little higher. Its fun once you get used to the basics and the mechanics of the game. It could be played defensively or a Run and Gun type of style, but its targeted more to defence in its way of gameplay and since it has zombies drop power ups and extra cash its just pointless to play on defence. In the way of graphics, they arn't too impressive and the animations are just really basic and the textures are just bad, so are the player models and just make you want to barf. This also means you don't need a highly powered pc to play it and means more people that only have a laptop can play. Its also easy to start a private server and join other servers as well. This game is not fun if you're going to play by yourself, but since its so cheap, you can by another copy for a friend and thats all good. The final verdict is a 6/10. Its a cheap yet okay party type of game and with it being on sale all the time its a solid mini-game to play with friendsX/10 Verdicts___________Graphics: 4/10 Not very good/ You don't need a Gaming PC to play-----------------Gameplay: 6/10 Solid and okay with the keyboard-----------------Party Options: 7/10 Has what it needs.-----------------Guns: 6/10 Has basics and outragous guns such as a RL and a Freeze Gun?!-----------------*Sound: 3/10 Makes you just to turn off all the sound and add your own music.-----------------Final Verdict: 6/10 Above Average-----------------Check out my Youtube where I make videos and animations whenever I want to! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHRe_IrFFJxQMcNybHLqFw "

												Seriously people, this game is exactly what it says it is.  It's defending yourself from zombies.  You have a light pole and have to basically purchase and setup defenses around said light pole to survive night after night of zombie waves that increase in difficulty.  You also have to purchase weaponry and ammo for yourself, although there aren't any upgrades for said weapons.  The game is extremely simplistic, so don't expect much.  Playing with your friends is highly recommended, as that's where the enjoyment comes in.With a cost of $1.99 I'd recommend this game, even if you only try it out for a little while.  That said, I wouldn't pay any higher than that.			"

												A deceent wasd game, I got this game for free and honestly would have been quite dissapointed paying anything more than $1.99. Single player is alright, however to get to level 30 is nothing less than a feat. The multiplayer is decent, even more so with friends.There are 2 kinds of turrets, the 1st turret is basically a non upgraded person who never misses; the second turret (mark ll) Is like having an ally with 2 upgrades maybe 3 in reload and never misses, the downside is of course that you run out of ammo quickly so make sure you but quite a bit. A very good strategy is buying a good gun that was on sale ASAP, because the zombies have a chance of dropping ammo of guns you have purchased (you do not have to equip said gun/s). There are 3 different kinds of palisades (walls); wood (useless), steel and electro: (not sure if steel is a higher durability then electro but electro does do damage.Pros-High replayability (wanting to get a higher score every time you play, changing what types of guns to purchase and when to buy them in some kind of order)-menu options (Can change music and effects volume)-Graphics (although not the best graphics there is an option for ammount of blood when killing zombies)-Personalization (you can level up and CHOOSE what stats you want to put a point into per level)Cons-instructions (there is no way to tell how much any weapon does in damage nor how much hp a zombie has, also no way to tell how much durability a palasade has nore how much damage a zombie can do)-user interface (With absolutely no tutorial or instruction its not the easiest to drop items pick them up or mount weapons on a turret; you can mount weapons on a turret (it uses ammo). The only ui that this game has is a health bar, reload bar and what weapon you are currently using and how much ammo is left for said weapon.-Content (the game has gone a long ways since it came out and has gotten quite a bit more content, but the game lacks on the ui and needs more choices when leveling up)The game is not the best defense game nor the worst, I do believe the dev's are still adding content and they seem to be a caring bunch who would ban people for things they should not say, or just trolling matches for the hell of it. All in all I give this a 2.75/5 There is no storyline whatsoever, there are no spoken dialect and too few types of zombies to give this a higher rating, however for the content and price as a casual game I would recommend this for no more than $1.99.

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												Great little game! Works really well with Xbox 360 controller. Developer seems active on the forums, open to all sugestions! Really looking forward to some of the proposed features of the game!The game really requires some skill, I think the furthest I've got is night 12, passing a night feels really rewarding! After that it gets crazy but from what I've read the developer is working on that.Multiplayer feature is fun but games are hard to connect to and sometimes just lag out. I'm guessing this is being worked on too.No real settings options. Not a big deal for most PC gamers however if your running intel 3000 or less graphics you may get some serious graphical lag even in low resolutions, would like to see visual quality adjustments. Would like to see support for more resolutions, Has trouble over 1080.Gameplay is straight forward and fun! I could nit pick some small things like weapons, characters and other stuff but for the price and the fact it's easy to pick up and have fun, everything else is just icing on the cake!			"

												Yet Another Zombie Defence is what you would expect a zombie defence game where you have to survive wave afther wave.there is a day/night cycle or a fight/build cycle depending on how you look at it.During the night you fight of zombies and gain money/points during the day you can spent your money on wapeons/defence.a day/night cycle is 1 wave in game the further you get the more difficult the game gets and i mean really difficult it gets hard quick i recomend playing it with a friend but even than its hard.there is only 1 map as of yet and 3 playeble characteres. the controls are simple and if you just want to play a quick matchs you can (you can blast trough the waves really fast with some of the better wapeons)that is my review on Yet Another Zombie Defence ill give it a  7/10 if the update the game with more maps and some more ways on defending your self it would become a 10/10 also the price is nothing so no reason not to give this game a try.

												This game is indifferent and does require any commitment to enjoy. I'm not sure why many people gave a positive review, and it feels like it was made by someone messing around one afternoon with a game-making program that promises ""much success, much monies and much women."" I could find better games than this on ArmorGames and other websites that offer similiar games.This is my only reason for buying this ""game"":*buy the game for ~50 cents**play for +30 minutes and receives trading cards**sell the cards on the market for $3384.99*+$3384.49 PROFIT			"

												Ever wanted a game that could finally give you that needed push to suicide, well this is that game. This game has beautiful next-gen graphics, absolutely astonoshing. The combat mechanics are out of this ♥♥♥♥ing world, imagine LoL, but a billion times better. The writers of this game are extremely talented, I've never been so emotionaly attatched to a game's characters. Best game of the century, if you don't own this game then how ♥♥♥♥ing dare you call yourself a gamer. 8/8 m8.			"

												Pretty fun game! I think it is a good time killer and is well worth more than the low price I paid, the only complaint I have is the shared resources thing, as a host of a game you feel like a parent whose kids keep bugging them for candy! But other than that it is a solid survival game and you should go and buy it (also more maps and game modes would be cool)			"

												It was cheap, fairly good reviews and a fast download. I got it to play while another game downloaded, just to waste some time. It has simple gameplay, but it is fun and addictive. I found myself playing long over the time needed for my other game. A game with this much fun at this price easily gets a 10/10 in my book. Is it the funnest game out there? No. But for its price,  and its muti-player capability make it easily better than many games who are 20$+ and is becoming one of my favorite games. I hope in the future there are updates/DLCs adding more upgrades, weapons, and blockades/turrets. They can honestly keep this game going for a very long time easily.			"

												Let me start off by sayingcons: -its not at gamestopevery gamer must experience the squishy feeling i get on the inside when they play this game. I was playing this game with my grandmother (you know her as DiplupMaster) and we had a blast. my heart makes happy spaghetti as i play this game. the game is so simple and beautiful the only people who cant have fun are the blind elderley going through labor. when the martians visit our planet they dont just come for our smart mops they also come to play ""Yet Another Zombie Defense"" since the servers dont reach out to Mars. we need to find out ways to get the devs on a spaceship with bananas to mars so they can set up a merch tent for their game. we will get a twitter dedicated for this game. we will have a YouTube channel dedicated to this game. It will only contain Lets Plays of this game and tutorials on how to make guacamole.this gameis4/0.037i want everyone to be playing this game by the next blue moon or i will invade the city of Rome with Bob the Builder dolls holding flat potatos.Get ready America""Yet Another Zombie Defense"" will drive apples into bankruptcy			"

												This game is barely playable. You either run around like a♥♥♥♥♥♥or die. Despite this, the game tells you to hold  your ground and even gives defensive items. None of thesee help for more than a few seconds and after that its back to being downsydrome usain bolt with an AR-15. I do not reccomend this game no matter the price as you will swiftly become bored of this game past the 20 minute mark if not sooner.There are two gamemodes  I only bothered with 1, and are under the assumption the 2nd one is simmiliar. The gamemode I played was a wave survival and for some reason, only the host can purchase weapons for the players in the server. Meaning you do not get to choose how you play this game. If you join a match where the host has only purchased grenades and a chainsaw, you will see yourself reinacting Evil dead meets ISIS with about 3 seconds to prepare.The final nail in the coffin is just how bad the game plays, the controls are clunky and unresponsive, there is no accuracy with the weapons and the graphics make games like Alien Shooter 2 look advanced for their timel.In conclusion this game is not worth the price even at 54cents.

You can do all you need to survive, build your base, or even bases, buy new guns and ammo for your teammates, save their lifes. 2 gamemodes, in both you can fight with random people, friends or solo. The only missing thing is the fact that fight spot should be bigger.This is a must-buy.			"

Its even more fun multiplayer so the buy one get one half off deal is amazing for playing with friends. 7.5/10 Perfect price for a few hours of fun.

												Booooo! Aiming is WAY OFF! Controller support is there but it's not tuned at all. The guy points in only 8 directions. If you like keyboard movement with or without a controller then go for it. I expected at least fine tuned movement and aiming while using the controller. Some people are into that i guess. But when I've got 20 zombies surrounding me and I can't simply push in the direction of them and shoot to kill it gets quite frustrating. Got it on sale for under a buck.

It's just a simple co-op tower defense game with zombies.  But it's so fun.The game does have some room for improvement, but overall it's worth the cheap price.  The downside is that there aren't a lot of people playing this game.			"

												Yet Another Zombie Defense is a thrilling game, so much so that you feel like you could play it on your mobile phone or tablet. When you play with a group of friends everyone shares the money that you pick up, so there's plenty of time to have arguments during the day time.  I've made it to night 15 so far with some friends, pick it up! It's worth the money and worth a try! You won't regret it.			"

												This game is a 10/10 must buy, its so cheap why wouldn't you buy it? (I bought on sale for 54 cents) theres always people playing online so theres always games you can join and people to play with there are 2 modes ""Endless Mode"" & ""Defense Mode"" well most only play Defense Mode but i find Endless Mode very fun. Nobody plays Endless mode Online so you will have to Solo it but anyways.. this game is one of the best zombie games i've ever played like.. the things i like about it are it actually takes skill to survive and no pay2win stuff although it is a very basic game.. looks like it took about a week to code but still its worth the buy :) I love this game sometimes i get bored of other games and i start this up and i remember how much fun it is.

Picked up four copies for under $2 a piece for me and the kids and my 7 and 10 year olds say, ""this is the best game ever!""  I wouldn't go THAT far but it's DEFINITLY worth more than it costs.  It's a nice little diversion that you can pick up, drop and pick up again whenever you need a break from those 1000+hr RPG's			"

												I enjoyed it, but the enemy power and health scales too quickly with few options for keeping up. Eventually you find yourself being one-hit while zombies seem nigh indestrucible. This is espessially problematic in Endless Night mode when you have to resort to using your pistol to kill zombies for more powerful drops.			"

												Simple zombie defence gameTo forfill the zombie craze-movement comes 'yet another zombie defence' game (see what I did there?).  Developed by indie studio 'Awesome games studio', the top down 3D game tasks you with surviving against waves of zombies.Gamplay is is similar to other zombie survival games with a few base building elements thrown in. You start of with a simple pistol, but you can get more weapons later on including sniper, smg, rifles etc. All weapons have limited ammo, which needs to be restocked. There are 2 types of zombies you face: standard and fast ones. The standard zombies move slowly and have a decent amount of health, while the fast ones move very quickly towards you. Before you begin a match, you can choose between 3 characters: a guy, a girl and SWAT guy (I wish there was more character variety).There are two game modes available: 'Defence' and 'Survival'. In defence, you are tasked with surviving waves of zombies. You start near a lamp post (which serves as the only light source) with a simple pistol in hand. The first wave has weak standard zombies. After each  wave you can buy guns, ammo, barricades and turrets to help bolster your defence.  Money is earned by pick ups from corpses. Health pick ups also appear from corpeses as well. With each new wave the zombie's health and damge increase which makes the game get harder as you progress.In survival mode there are no waves of zombies, instead zombies will keep spawning and chasing you. there is also no money in this mode and no option to buy any guns or barricades. Instead guns will occasionally appear as a pick up item on the map. This is the weakest and most unpopular of the two game modes.There is absolutely no story in this game, which isn't necessarily a bad thing as it's just a simple survival game meant to pass the time. However, the addition of a plot could have made the game more engaging for the player.Audio is a mixed bag. On one hand, the music that plays during each wave is great and makes the action more fun (think rock music). However, the guns sounds are really bland and off putting. There is no voice acting in this game.As for level design, well... there is only one map. The map with the light post is played in all game modes and there is no other choices unfortunately. There is also multiplayer available. You can play both the game modes with up to 3 other players. You all share the same money pool, but only one player can buy weapons, barricades etc. The other players need to state which weapons/ammo they want so the other player can buy it for them (I kinda felt this was a tedious element to the multiplayer mode). The game isn't dead yet and you could probrably find a game (however I recommend playing with steam friends as it is not only more enjoyable but you can also communicate better).Do I recommend this game? Well the creator promised  new free content (hopefully new maps or game modes) if there is enough support for the game, which is better than going the DLC route. For only $2 (even less during sale) though, you could probrably do worse. "

If you are up to something really simple. If you want little more complicated I would recommend Nation Red (little biased opinion though).Anyway this game is worth for it price tag and will still play it time for time!			"

												Great game, didn't expect to have so much fun on this. A fewthings need to be changed as already mentioned, such as the buying menu and the chat are both awkward to use. Also it would be sweet to have a game mode wheremore than 4 players can be in a match? But most importantly, please please please keep the updates and added content coming, keep it interesting by adding new things. I dont want to get bored of this game because its got so much potential, thanks guys.			"

												It is R6 on sale (less than a US Dollar). At full price, R24 (~$2).It is enjoyable.If you consider that a movie spree costs at least R100, which lasts 2 hours, even if you only play Yet Another Zombie Defense for 3 hours, you would have already had your money's worth.If you enjoy playing co-op games, this is probably a good budget choice.

The coop does need a bit of work as it still lags on lan connections but i am more shocked that the DEVs havent updated.  it was such a hit with quite a bit of fans but we are dwindling off due to lack of updates and expansion.

Yes, the game itself is very fun. It's an excellent time-waster and it's addictive. If you're looking for some decent arcadey fun, this is it.Graphics, gameplay, everything wise, this game is literally an arcade shoot-em' up run and gun game. There is little redeeming quality about this game except the amount of fun you will have, which is probably why you're looking at the game in the first place.			"

Pros-Easy to play-Simple controls-Very light game, so;  -Fast to download  -Doesn't take up much space  -Unlikely to lag-Multiplayer includedCons-Collectable money disappears, removing ways to buy weapons/buildings-Costs too much for what it has to offer (Normal Price)-Only 2 modes-3 characters to choose from, all of which aren't any different  -3 characters are also sorta boring, design-wise-Aiming system is unpresice, although simple-Only 1, boring stageOverall, I'm halfway on my opinion. I like the game to a point, which is a tiny bit over how much I dislike it. That's why I recommend this game.			"

												So, when this was given to me as a gag gift, and I played it, I found it to be... Not what I expected at all. It was a tiny square map with no scenery but a lamp, infinite waves of zombies that get stronger and grow in numbers as the levels go on, about 10 generic weapons and some completely over the top ones, and a soundtrack that you have to experience to understand why I can't talk about it.But to the point, if you get some friends online with you, this game is insanely unbelievably fun. Mainly because if you play alone you notice how frustrating the lack of anything on the map is, and how the fences get useless in the late game, and how that last death was total bullsh*t, and I guess that isn't a point in the game's favour but the absolute joy that comes with playing this co op excuses it.In summary, if you can convince your friends to buy it, you'll love it forever			"

												I picked this game up for cheap for me and a friend. From the few games I played it was decently fun! Simple and easy to pick up, although I still don't understand a lot of the mechanics. If you're looking for a cheap and quick game that's fun with a friend and want to kill time, this isn't a bad solution. However I would wait for a sale- even at this low price it's questionable whether the money is worth the little content it provides. Not a lack of weapons and such but more of a lack of variety of things to do- unfortunately the entire gameplay formula of ""Shoot & Build"" can be written on a piece of gum wrapper and it would still fit. While I wouldn't say it's a horrible game at all, I wouldn't be recommending it to people, either.			"

												 -Your goal is to construct barriers and turrets in order to survive as many nights as    possible against increasingly more difficult waves of zombies. -At the end of each night you are given as much time as you want to construct   your base and purchase weapons, which allows for careful planning.   - I like the turret mechanic, which requires that you purchase a turret mount,    then place whatever weapon you want on top. Turrets can also be destroyed so   you must take that into consideration when placing it. - An overall very fun strategy game for a very small cost.			"

												This is not a bad game however its not wonderful.So, looking to buy YAZD yea well its probably not the best idea, at full price. You see, on console this games price tag is half of the steam price however to make up for that steam is pretty much always having a sale (Every holiday and more) so it does make up for that. The game doesn't feel complete, the weapons are generic and boring and the defenses are bland and the zombies are vague, un-interesting. L4D 1 & 2 has  a lot more content and on sale for only twice the price of this game - $4.99 on sale. The defense system is also bland and just overall BAD. They help in a way but they dont make this game a stategy game, AT ALL. Its just a little game with about 5-10 hours of fun with 1-3 other people, yea dont try soloing the game its boring and its all a grind. Overall its not actually a awful game it has some good qualities one being the EXTREMLY cheap ammo which is nice, and two modes which are basic but fun. The map is also terrible ONE MAP FOR BOTH MODES WITH NOTHING BUT A LIGHT POST. THATS IT. No buildings no roads just a ♥♥♥♥ing street lamp, with no damn street. Okay, maybe im being a little harsh for an indie game, WELL WHAT THE HELL PROJECT ZOMBOID WAS AN INDIE GAME AND IT HAD WAY MORE CONTENT THAN THIS. This game tries to be a new and fresh take on the zombie genre well guess what it is, i have never seen a more repetitive zombie game. EVER. That being said if you get it on sale and play with a couple of friends its not bad, keep in mind if you expect to have 100 hrs in this game you way in over your head by like a damn mile.FINAL SCORE - SP = 4/10 - MP = 7/10ONLY GET IT IF YOU CAN MORE THAN 1 DONT PLAY BY YOUR SELF - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

												I picked this game up for next to nothing during the 2014 Holiday Sale. Figured even if it's complete garbage, my games collection at least looks a little bigger. Then I actually played it, not expecting much from it, and man was I surprised; it was actually a lot of fun!Obviously it's low-budget and very simple. There's no engaging story, or character development, and there really doesn't need to be. You're dropped into the middle of an empty lot with just a street lamp as your friend, and you blast Z's in the face. Fun on a bun!You earn cash from the aforementioned face-blasting, which you can use to buy barricades, weapons, and ammo between nights (the shotgun is your best friend starting out), and see how long you can last. There's an online co-op mode as well, which I've yet to try, but I just wanted to get on here and compliment the creator of this game for a great budget-title well done.			"

												Well they price have gone up since i was playing but still worth every penny.Fun survival game to play with yourself and with your friends and just as the title says it's just another zombie defense except this zombie defense defeats all the titles.Pros:+Weapons (Fun weapons and good options to pick from, what i was meant to say is that the weapons work differently and there isn't full of automatic guns for example)+Map (The map might look gray and boring but it's a good map to run around on and build because you are going to need alot of space)+Coop (Ofcourse we all expected it to be coop but this coop is up to 4 players and works fantasticly with the coop buy system)+Shop (I like the way they had added sales on different weapons because it tends to make you build for different things and doesn't make it as repedetive as it can be at times)+Cheap (Do i really have to explain this one?)+Characters (You don't have only 1 character but they have made it so you can choose from different models and make it so that you actually can tell eachoter appart, there is only 3 models in the game so far that i know about but last time i played was about a year ago so they might have added way more other stuff that i don't know about)+gamemodes (Instead of making it sandbox-ish you can also play as a survivor that goes around and finds different guns to slay hordes of zombies that comes after you, i have slowly been falling inlove with this gamemode but mostely becuase i grew tired of sitting behind a wall for the entire game)+levels (Yes you can level up your character in this game, i mean who would've thought it from a game that only costs 2 euros right?)Cons:It's too cheap to have any real complains about it, i mean come on it costs 2 euros for god sakeJust so y'all know this is a really old review from when i had last played it so this might be a bit outdated.

												Yet Another Zombie Defense (YAZD) is worth every penny of it's low price. In YAZD you move through stages called ""nights,"" in which you fight hordes of zombies. As you progress the zombie hordes become larger and stronger in several ways, but at the same time you are expanding a base, gaining new weapons, and improving your character's stats. The controls are simple and the game is straight forward, yet there are several strategies that make this game fun and re-playable. Additionally, it is very easy to join friends or online matches, and the game includes several fun achievements. I definitely recommend this game to others.			"

I would not reccomend this game if you are not going to play with friends. There isn't enough depth in the mechanics and gameplay to enjoy playing by myself. If you can get this game really cheap when it's on sale, go for it. You'll have fun. It's not too bad of a game. But with many many other zombie defence games out there (especially the free ones), this game doesn't compete very well and you should probably go with a different one.  "

If you are up to something really simple. If you want little more complicated I would recommend Nation Red (little biased opinion though).Anyway this game is worth for it price tag and will still play it time for time!			"

If you're looking for some decent arcadey fun, this is it.Graphics, gameplay, everything wise, this game is literally an arcade shoot-em' up run and gun game.

												Yet Another Zombie Defense is a simple amazing game for just 2.00 $.Its gameplay is good and addictive but gets repetitive after a while.Has 2 good gamemodes, Endless nights (A survival of champions) and defence (a strategic gamemode)I definetly recommend this game if you have a couple of friends to play with (about 2-4 is great).Now for the improvents this game could see:#1 More maps, I could see a few new map ideas like a subway or a grocery store.#2 More weapons, Like a Revolver or Semi Rifle.#3 Multi-leveled maps, Like an upstair or basement in a future map.#4 More ammo types, Like Exploding rounds or Incindeary rounds.#5 Perks, Like Looter (It would give you more money upon foe death) and around that general area.#6 Zombie bosses, like a giant tank like zombie or a zombie using a chainsaw.Now that I have gotten this all out of the way I can give my rating.My rating is 8/10.Now I love this game but I definitly see room for improvement and changes but overall its a great game.

												I would not say this game is amazing or a must-buy,but with friends this was pretty enjoyable for 3 hours. After that it is repetitive and you might play it once more, months later.It's like worth 50 cent for me, and that is for how much you can buy it as a gift inthe market. ONe thing: They should make the controls easier and more clears, buying♥♥♥♥♥♥is a nightmare...			"
