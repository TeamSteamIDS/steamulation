												Wildlife Park 3 is a game where you get to create and manage your very own wildlife park. You make animal enclosures, pick the animals to go in there, hire vets, zoo keepers, gardeners, garbage men, place visitor facilities, plants, decorations and so on. As a game, its full of soothing music and the campaign tells you exactly what to do.The game is good at telling you what the animals and visitors want when you click on them. Such as buffalo want to wallow in mud or have a mineral deficiency. Not just that, but icons hover over the heads of both animals and visitors. The visitors have smiles or frowns over their heads. The animals have icons indicating their needs such as its too hot out, if they're thirsty, hungry or need more foliage. The animals can do a variety of things such as mate, have babies, get sick, scratch on trees, play with toys and wallow in mud. Clicking on an animal shows their information in a panel at the bottom. This panel is full of information how their needs are being met. Everything from grass, meat, mineral and water to scratching, temperature, ground and foliage. To be honest the charts are appreciated, but not needed when the comment box for each animal bluntly tells you where each animal is deficient.You don't just buy an animal or hire someone like you would a piece of furniture, you need to hire from applicants and buy from animal traders. Every animal and employee is unique unto themselves, so you need to select the right one for you. Not just that, but consider their price, age, health and skills. This all goes into the management aspect of it. You can sell off animals and babies. Its all about keeping your wildlife park running. When you click on an employee, you can see their range radius that they will tend to. The radius is a giant square that you can shrink or expand, but its always a square instead of just being assigned to a specific enclosure or two. The staff will attend to all feedings, watering, droppings and vets will attend to sick animals automatically. They'll also gain skills when working with animals too.When your visitor approval rating go up, so do your 'stars.' With more stars, you can charge more, upgrade buildings, unlock more buildings and have a selection of better animals. It is a wildlife park, not a zoo, even though someone in the tutorial calls it a zoo. Since it is a wildlife park, it sticks to that theme, you'll find wild animals here. You'll find bison, wildebeest, gazelles, lions, giraffes, hippos, penguins, cheetahs, bears, pumas, sea lions, leopards, chimps, gorillas, elephants, zebras and so on. Some might say the game is limited in its how many species of animals that it has. Perhaps some DLC will offer different animals, but since this game was originally released in 2011, I think that monkey escaped the zoo a long time ago.The animals aren't the only things you'll need to keep alive. The trees are living too. They'll need the correct ground underneath of them to flourish. Not only for the animals to eat and shade themselves, but in this game, the animals get spooked from seeing jeep rides drive through their enclosures. So you'll need to obscure the jeep ride tracks with foliage as exampled in the campaign.I love games like these that blend management and creativity into making your own area. Games like Roller Coaster Tycoon, Zoo Tycoon, Prison Architect, Sim City and Cities XL. With that being said, I really want to like Wildlife Park 3, but it just feels so cumbersome, devoid of goals and just not fun overall. The 'campaign' is really just a tedious tutorial with some okay to good voice acting. This is one of those tycoon games that has characters commanding you. How to pick up animals, where to drop them. After about 3 hours, I felt like the tutorial wasn't specifically telling me what to do. The tutorials seemed to have bugs or issues, such as the next button not working or even when you do what they tell you to, they still will not continue. Sometimes doing as you please and saying that area needs something, doing it then it breaks the tutorial and prevents it from continuing even after undoing what you did, causing multiple restarts when really I just want to build my own wildlife park. Perhaps none of their testers deviated and did anything the game wasn't instructing them to do. For completing each campaign mission, you'll unlock an extra decoration or something to add to whatever parks you have in the future.There is freeplay mode, which seems to be the real game since the campaign is just a tutorial. With freeplay, you get to select a plot of land from dozens from around the world. You then select how much money you start with and rules such as if your animals and or plants can get diseases. The problem here is some of the areas just feel very small even for one animal enclosure, let alone dozens. Each plot of land has their own climate, either grassy, desert or tundra.While I can't say the graphics are the best, they're not the worst. You'll see stiffly animated animals and beautiful foliage, hiding in tall grass and experience all of the seasons with rain and snowfall. It is a nice layer of graphical detail. Even better than that, if you really want to examine things, you can use your mouse wheel to zoom straight up to the animals to see them play, swim, and eat or just to see how bored your staff looks.  You can also see how the characters don't move their lips when talking, but that's a nitpick unless you really want to figure out who is talking to you. When you are super zoomed in, you can see in first person perspective, and walk around. The only problem is right and left keys rotate you instead of strafing you, but when you're not zoomed in all the way, you can strafe. I guess it offers control diversity to what you prefer.That is just the tip of the iceberg as to how the controls feel out of date. There are no hotkeys, you need to push the rotate button instead of mouse dragging to rotate like similar games a 3D engine. Its all so cumbersome. Luckily the 3rd tutorial teaches you to hold the mouse button and move up or down to rotate the item, otherwise you'd need to click the rotate button on the panel and check to see how far the item rotated. When I want to pick up an animal or employee, I need to highlight them, then click on move from a bottom menu, then move them and drop them. It just feels like an extra step and it could have been streamlined like other games have done.The game is full of needlessly poor design choices. Yellow text on yellow and red gradient background so it blends in. Paths aren't considered ground so much as they are considered 'visitor facilities.' To top that off, paths are called 'ways,' in the menu, but even the game calls them paths and thoroughfares.The game doesn't feel fun compared to most every other sort of build your own this or that tycoon game. There's nothing to do, no goals to achieve other than the blunt commands in the campaign tutorial. Visitors will have thoughts and I guess that tells you what you should do. They want to see other animals, so then you add more animals, and then they want to see more animals, so you add more animals. It would be nice if there was a campaign with goals such as have 600 visitors to your wildlife park within 2 years. Have X amount of animals in your park within 4 years. Have a park value of X amount in Y years. Even though this is a finished product, the third game in a series, it feels much more like the start of an unfinished game. I bought it in a $1 bundle and you can too. Maybe the fourth Wildlife Park will be better and have more to offer.			"

												After about a couple of hours of gameplay and completing the tutorial and several missions, I want to weigh in on what this game has to offer.Others have covered some of these points already, but I'll summarize the biggest shortcoming as thus:The overall aesthetic design of this game is atrocious. The graphic design seen in the UI, main menu, even to the closing screen, are amateurish at best, I prefer the UI in Roller Coaster Tycoon 2, and that game is over a decade old. If you're prone to frustration, you will most likely give yourself a headache trying to figure out this clunky and dated interface. I still haven't figured out where (Or if) it tells you how much a purchase will cost before buying it.On the bright side, the actual game itself can be beautiful at times. The screenshots are pretty true to the game.However, don't expect it to go much farther than that. The gameplay grows shallow after little play. Once you set up an initial enclosure, it's hard to care much more about it as there's little else to do besides make it prettier or bigger. Training of the animals is gone, there's so few of them that you run out of combinations of species to set up in one enclosure, and the only visitor attractions you can really build are safaris (Jeep and rail) and air tours.Everything else, as far as the small bugs go, pales in comparison to the sheer lack of gameplay that can be found in this.Don't get me wrong, what's actually done in this game is done fairly well, but the game is not worth the 10$ pricetag, not when you can pick up the 1st Zoo Tycoon ultimate edition for the same price at the time of writing. I bought it at 3.40$, and I feel like that was fair, I got what I paid for, but do not purchase this game fullprice, it's simply not worth it, and it pales in comparison to the previous Zoo Tycoons, and even the previous Wildlife Park 2, which is a complete shame, as this market is absolutely starved of games like this. There's only a handful of games which can liken themselves to the same genre, and what is there pales in comparison to what came before it.			"

												The obvious Error on release aside. Wildlife Park 3 is actually a pretty enjoyable Tycoon game. Whilst it's no Zoo Tycoon 2 beater, It definately holds its own in the Zoo Management genre, and is definately better than the recent Zoo Tycoon effort that was released on 360/Xbone which is a pretty poor Zoo Tycoon game considering the title its meant to live up to.Being a fan of this genre though, I thoroughly enjoy this game thus far, whilst I'm not expecting any expansions or miracles etc, I think its a damn good attempt at the Zoo management effort. The variation on the animals is a pretty neat idea, For those that have Played Zoo Tycoon 2, they will know that having 8 Elephants that all look the same can look like a copy/paste effort. I find the overall experience exactly what you'd expect from a game like Wildlife Park 3.If people can overlook the negative reviews about the game considering they all pertain to the error which has since been fixed and won't happen again, It's definately worth grabbing a copy to waste a few hours.

												Bought this game looking for substitute for Zoo Tycoon 2 as my new laptop doesnt have a CD drive and im just going to go straight to the point. DO NOT BOTHER. It's obvious the Devs gave up on this very quickly and didn't bother making any DLC.  Animal choice is quite limited, very very very few mods at all and its just glitch-fest 2016.If you really want to play a zoo game i'd recommend the first WP for its easy but replayable game that has plenty of mods OR the more popular WP2 which in my opinion is the best out of all the WP's but for the love of god don't waste your money on this game because you'll either end up requesting a refund or wishing you had.

												While the game has some flaws with lagging when going at highest speed and the music is really repetitive, I do enjoy the game.  It has it's flaws like poor ""decor"" choices, silly animal models, boring people models, and the inablity to move bought buildings/plants/decor after placing them.  I enjoy raising the animals, running a ""zoo"" and zooming in on the animals to take screenshots.  The campaign is challenging at times and will give you rewards for your park.  There's a bunch of maps to make more parks on which is good for replay value.  You can also make multiple accounts ingame to play over and over or just reset the campaign levels.  In all honesty, at $10 for full price it's good, but if you can get it on sale it's even more worth the money!			"

												This game is very fun to play casually. From what I've encountered, the tutorial is slightly tedious and hard to follow at some points. Everything else is okay, and I love the zoom feature that allows you to get a first person view up close and personal with the animals and zoo environment. So ya, I would recommend this game to anyone that loves animals or wants to run their own zoo. :D			"

												I've played this game for a few hours and ultimately I've decided that it's just a bad game. The limited animal selection is boring, the campaignes are tedious, and the park leveling system is incredibly stressful. The interface is also incredibly complicated and awkward to use. The music is monotonous and the voice acting incredibly tacky.If you want a time decently fun time waster, I'd say you could go for this game. Definitely only get this game if it's on sale, though. I got it for around $3 and I'm glad I didn't spend any more. It's not worth $10.			"

												From what i've played its a decent game. I'm only using this as an advanced tamagotchi, i could care less about people coming in to enjoy the park. I enjoy taking care of the animals and watching them have fun and play. Going into it is kinda confusing because the HUD is small and mashed up, But after awhile you get used to it. I havent experienced errors or glitches. 7/10.			"

												Ignoring the error that prevented people from playing at launch, the overall game itself is solid. It is not optimized terribly well (highest graphics settings had my FPS ~5-10 and my GPU was barely being used). How employees function is poorly thought out (they are stuck in one square area around their placement and don't roam the park). But all in all it's a pretty decent tycoon game at this price point.

												The Good:   Sometime I like making animal pens and just watching them exist because the varying skins at least make them interesting to look at. The Bad:     Pretty much everything else. The controls are bad. The instructions are really really bad. The story is boring and the game mode is literally painful to complete as fuctions are locked outside of your tasks. So if you need to wait until animals are all trained to a certain level or have a number of offspring you are mostly stuck with what you have. No making a cool zoo while you wait. Sandbox mode is less painful but animals, plants and visitors all have very strict requirements and with a very limited number of items to chose from you will soon give up on any attempts at fun or creativity.  You also can't mange many fuctions yourself. Animal needs feeding? You must hire a zoo keeper who will spend the majority of their day standing stock still. Plants need watering? Well you are going to need a groundskeeper full time to do that every so often.			"

												I love games like this one, and enjoyed this one very much. However the visitors are annoying, despite having every animal available, visitors walk past animal enclosures without viewing animals, whilst complaining about there not been enough animals in the park. There also seems to be a lmit on visitors allowed in the park at one time, people complaining that they won't enter the park as it's too busy... Also very annoying as the park looks empty. Once you get to end game (all animals) people don't seem interested in coming anymore, which suck on the second to last mission as you need to earn 100000, 3000 on facilities and 3000 on tickets... Despite this it's worth playing but gets boring at the end, maybe more choice of freeplay maps, more animals, decorations and facilities (or just start all-ready on the expansion packs).			"

												Awesome game , I was sceptical about how good this was going to be but was plesantly surprised.PROSGraphics - nice graphics and good zoom in UI - lots of easy tools to help you manage the prices and find and help animals needsCustomization -  tons of terrain options and decoritive changes to each item to make your park unique. The terrain even affects your animals happiness.Animal management - You dont just place animals and watch them , you actually have to design their pens to keep them happy which is cool.CONSRotating and making items line up to 90 degree angles is a pain. their might be an easy way to do this with a hot key but the tutorial didnt explain how to do it.Selling Animals is kind of a pain when you have a bunch. Sorting them is buggy but not too bad.			"

												Wildlife Park 3 is a fantastic continuation of the series, I will sum up the pros and cons for readers that want to skim through it and quickly decide on purchasing. The game has a huge selection of different animals with their own needs and enclosure requirements, The graphics overall are pretty good for a game from 2011, Ground, building and misc textures are of a high quality and the shadowing effects look great but the graphics truly shine on the animals themselves, You can see the fur on each animal, not just as a texture but as a realistic effect, visitors and staff have acceptable graphics overall, but some of the textures for them could be a little sharper. The animations for the animals are another fantastic aspect of this game, they truly act and sound like their real life counter parts. The campaign has voice acting which isn't the best but is done to a reasonable standard. I find the UI to be hard to see since a lot of the icons blend into the button but that could be my gamma settings. I highly recommend this game for fans of Sim games, like Zoo Tycoon and, of course, the older WildLife Parks games.Pro* Large variety of animals* Good Graphics* Large assortment of enclosure items and customization* Voice acting of acceptable quality* High-quality sound effects and animal noises* Good amount of visitor attractions* Fun Campaign* Helpful tutorialCons* Hard to see UI ( might just be me however)* Could have better character textures* Small learning curve (for some but not many)			"

												I strongly wished to be totally enthralled with this game.  There is a serious deficit of this particular Genre in this style format and they just happen to be the style of games I love best. There were a few good notes.  The graphics were decent even on Medium setting. I liked the use of different emoticons to identify problem animals, guests and plants.  And I liked the way the ride designer would automatically navigate around obstacles making for relatively easy placement of the ride features.   However, there are some issues with the level designs.  The boarders of the parks do not always permit you to build to the wall (which is the most affordable method when starting out).  The level challenges started off interesting with a semblance of story but the story fell off quickly and degraded into ""Oh, I need a campaign task here..."" with no consideration of the previous campaign nor returning to the players own park as part of the campaign.   Also The landscaping features are not adequately user friendly and it take allot of patience to get some special need animal enclosures to function correct.  A final criticism is with the ""Workers"".  The place and adjust area works good for the Gardner's and Keepers as it makes logical sense for the style of work they do, however, the Vets and Garbage-men seemed to be wasting allot of logical coverage ability for the style of work they would be performing.  All this combined with the limited items and animals made for some dry and fustrating game play which made the sandbox mode very...Over all it was an okay game...and I will continue to play it...but I wish I had NOT spent more than 5 bucks on it.

												Overall a pretty good game!The quests can be reasonably short and enjoyable. More often than not they're actually about the animals, rather than ""Make X amount of money"" which is what I remember from Zoo Tycoon.The graphics are nice and the colours are vibrant, however I believe it's not fully optimised as I've heard of people getting a few framerate issues and have experienced it myself with my steam overlay lagging a fair bit whilst running the game.The UI can be a little clunky at times and not incredibly helpful, some examples are the fact that you can't sort lists of animals by species and when purchasing animals further down the list, sometimes the list will refresh, which takes you back to the top, having to scroll back down - this happens sometimes before you've even had chance to buy an animal!So far, I've not come accross anything in the game that would make me unwilling to say that this is a good, solid game.

												I was super excited when i seen this game available for sale. I use to play Zoo Tycoon all the time, but now can't since it won't work on Windows 7. Really enjoying this game so far, very similar to zoo Tycoon. Try it out guys :D			"

												I would recommend this game, just based on liking this genre and it's good enough to play for the price. The UI is extremely cluttered and not very intuitive. I don't know why they felt the need to re-invent the wheel on the UI because this isn't a brand new idea and others have done it so much better. I like the complexity of the keeping the animals satisfied, more than just a habitat building. The missions have been interesting so far. Lots of the mechanics are unweildy but I'm still learning it, so maybe I will find a better way to do those things.			"

												Enjoyed the game, but honestly, the UI feels cluttered, and the controls tend to feel clunky. Other than that, it's a great game--for the price (bought it on 15% sale). Don't buy assuming it'll play like Zoo Tycoon, or Zoo Tycoon 2.  The only thing in common both titles have is that they're both zoo management simulators.			"

												Keeping animals in zoos for humans to gawk at is hopefully something we'll be seeing in the rear-view mirror during the 21st century. This game also sucks. The controls are counter-intuitive and the navigation leaves much to be desired. Been watching my friend play it a bit, was not impressed. Got it in a bundle, much less impressed with my hands-on experience. FWIW it seems like most simulator games are pretty garbage-y these days, so this is just another piece of crap on the heap.			"

			BEST FENCE SIMULATOR EVER!!! Game: http://store.steampowered.com/app/287200/ ~Notice~ Thinking about doing a proper ""How To"" on this game, feel free to voice your opinions.		

The game is fun in it's own right. Just let your imagination flow and your good. Controls are a bit clattered but once you get used to it, navigation should be easier. If you enjoy tycoons and simulators or even building/construction games you shouldn't have a problem getting in to this game.  "

												Though this game has some decent graphics, it is lacking on side for gameplay, many of the parks, you cant build all the way to the wall due to earlier limits, and the entrances vary from things like elading into a canyon ( youd have to rockclimb to get up)   or the map in california, it leads out to the ocean. But with gameplay it had lacking freeplay tasks, a zebra has been neglected, take care of it, its bland. then with some map like california again, you cant choose how much money to have on freemode, its stuck at zero with 1 star, so i build a fence and im in debt 3K, it was kinda good i got free animals to start with, but 7 zebras, all the meerkats, and buffalo, not fun anymore. including the whole in debt thing, you cant build any moer when in debt, so youd have a small exhibit, a gate, and no visitors due to the oceanlastly, in freemode, you only have 4 animals, and very few things to make the guests happy, and ive tried going to 5 starts on some maps, and no matter what, i only have things like meerkats, and zebras, id give this game a 1/5 because it is clunky and feels like it in an incomplete game			"

And their support is not forth coming...It's ok Saying the errors on starting are fixed,however i do not think so...			"

												I a bit angry with the game actually, although I paid less, at the discounted price, but I think the game should be missing anything such as in  game text, there is actually no visual element after entering the game, its pitch black, really!!!!!!!!!!!!!But I think you should have time to correct that. But I think if you can't fix the problem you should consider giving people their money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												I've had this game for two or three years and still have yet to play it. Not because I haven't tried or because I don't want to play it, but because it's freakin broken. Nothing I have seen suggested has worked to help the game to run. I just get the ""PathManager error"" warning and nothing else happens. There is no antivirus/firewall blocking anything. It wasn't flagged by windows 7. There is absolutely no reason for this to still be a problem. What a waste of money, time and bandwidth.			"

												This is a good game, but I prefer the Zoo Tycoon series. This game is far too detail oriented. Every plant in your zoo has a satisfaction bar, every staff member and animal is unique to their own way, and after a while, it get's to be too much. I am a stickler to creating the ""perfect zoo"" with symetry, and so when placing objects do not have a grid- it really bothers the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me. That's not to say you shouldn't buy this game. Fundamentally, it's great. I just would rather play Zoo Tycoon 2 over this.			"

												I really like this game the best out of the three Wildlife Park games. I like that the staff aren't in towers like in WP2. I find it a lot easier to play than the others. I can't really think of much to complain about it. It'd be nice if the paths could be placed in a more straight line or just not be able to be placed near plants, since that always messes things up for me. I've really enjoyed playing the campaigns though. They're challenging, but not enough so that I just get frustrated and never try again. I always struggled with the ones on Zoo Tycoon, but that may have been due to how old I was at the time. I don't like how the animals get upset by their numbers and that you can't even expand the area to make them happier...or maybe you can and I just don't expand it large enough. Either way, for anyone that likes zoo games and is looking at the Wild Life Park ones, I would reccommend this one over the other two. The first one isn't bad, but I really dislike the second one.

												Pretty fun game, easy to understand, nice missions and a nice story. I managed to learn a thing or two about animals during this game. I really enjoyed the money dynamics, where I can overdraft the budget, but more and more things become unavailable as the debt gets bigger. Some mission objectives are rather hard sometimes (like getting all animals 100% statisfied or getting big income from the entrance gate(although that objective made me reevaluate my business strategy)), but nothing that can't be done.Making your own park is a bit sad mission in my opinion, because it gets objectives as other parks do. Failing them results in making you restart the level. I enjoyed ""making my own park"" during the other missions, was more fun anyway.Big parks take toll on the computer so framerate goes down a lot, so that's a minus.Overall i'd give it 7(heart shaped baloons, that are too expensive) out of 10.

												I wanted to give this game the benefit of the doubt. I loved the second game, and its DLC despite its own problems. However, I found this one absolutely unplayable. No matter what I did, I could not get this game to do more than chug at 10 fps when I moved the camera. I'm often rather fond of clunky UI, but this one had the distinct air of someone not caring about the actual game. The animals looked nice, I liked where they were going with it, but it's so poorly optimised that even on the lowest of the low settings, my laptop, which can easily run Skyrim, struggles, even with a frame limiter on to try to give it some easier time of it. I hate to give this game a bad review, but if you have Windows 10, good luck, mate, because it wouldn't work for me. The purple glitch at the beginning of the game should have given me a hint of the times to come, when it nearly refused to change resolution into something my computer agreed with, but I tried it, and I wanted to love it... but I just couldn't. I nearly got motion sickness just trying to move the camera.			"

												OMG! Where do I begin?!The graphics are absolutely amazing! The animals look so realistic and act just like they would in real life. I fully enjoy this game and would recommend it to anyone who loves animals and managing a zoo.It is very similar to Zoo Tycoon 2 but includes many more amazing features, such as: having to care for plants (not just animals), animals arent always up for adoption and sometimes you have to wait, animals have ages, etc.I love this game and strongly recommend it!

												Don't do it. Just dont, If you have ever played Wildlife Park 1 or 2 or even haven't played them, !!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!! The controles are SO hard to understand, And hard to see. They are like white with white writing. The graphics are good but.... its just to, idk kidish for me.. Like no depth or something. Plus the fact that you get seriously.... 5 animals. I don't understand how to buy anymore the controls are that bad. I'm sure going through the missions and stuff It will tell you but I mean come one who wants to do missions for the next week to understand what any of the controls mean. If you haven't played any of the wildlife Park 1 or 2 and your looking for something like zoo tycoon or anything go with Wildlife Park 2, you will love it. Its a great game. The graphics might not be the greatest but they are not terrible or hard to see or anything. I highly recomend Wildlife Park 2... Don't buy this garbage.			"
