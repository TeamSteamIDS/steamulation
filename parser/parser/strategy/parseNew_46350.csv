												Refer to my review for XIII Century.It's like Total War, but without campaign management - just battles.If you want something surprisingly enjoyable (and in some cases without the lag), then give it a try.			"

												Too buggy for me, and I see that there are still no patches.  Would have been a good game otherwise.Lesson:  don't buy a game until at least 1 patch is out so you know then that there will be some support for problems.			"

												This game would be fantastic if it actually had more of a free roam and more customization. Since it does not, I would not recommend it.			"

												Very solid strategy title.Good unit variety, in depth unit stats and statistic effects from combat, challenging and varied battles bought to you in great graphical detail. Very surprised with the quality of this game, I am really enjoying it and definitely recommend it for fans of strategy games set in this Era.			"

												Tactical game of medieval battles in 13th century Russia and around. Cavalry raids, archers on hills and spearmen behind bushes.... Using the terrain folds to outsmart ever-overnumbered enemies, maneuvering on the battlefield - is all what the game is about. Engine and visuals are decent, even if a bit dated. AI is quite nice, acting and reacting on your every move very adequately. Overall gameplay, however, somewhat lacking. I'm not a big fan of Total War series in general, yet I see some reasons behind downvoting reviews for this ""Real Warfare"" title.All that you have to do in the game is about commanding 5-10 units in some battles, roughly based on historical events. There are no global map, no economics except option to buy extra troops before mission start. Also, there is no coherent story - you finish one mission, and move to the next, but what was happened in-between, what was all hustle about - you're left to wonder for yourself. I doubt someone will move to the history books, so I can't call the game educational.What I dislike the most in the game concept, is about mission briefings. In the most part of missions, you're supposed to lead only part of the forces on the map, but you'll never guess your objectives until you'll start the level. So, while it's so fun to see how many enemies are opposing, with exact numbers of each unit, I would prefer instead to know better my strength and my role on the upcoming battle. Alas, no such luck.As of bugs and other tech problems - I haven't noticed anything but the usual dated software problem played on the newer hardware, with newer OS, lacking some outdated drivers and scripts to run the game as it was supposed to be. Namely, the game sometimes freeze - mostly at the level start, with intro video. It's not a small issue, as when such freeze occurs, you'll most probably have to restart all system - but, it's not so much gamebraking, to forfeit and ban the game completely.So, as of bottom line, at this point, in the year 2016, I'd not really recommend to buy this game as it is. As of part of bigger deal, say, 1C WarGames Collection, or some other bundle - it suits better. I like ""Real Warfare 1242"" for decent battle engine. However, there are no ""one more turn"" feeling, to lose my sleep with this game. Worth 6 out of 10 points, but playable only for real strategy fans, with a passion for anything medieval and maxed patience stat.			"

												I was not going to play this game today but seen all the mixed reviews . and the Negitive ones comparing it to Total war games. I have just about all the 1c war games , love to play them all . So I went and played this one .Quick learning tutorial since it has almost same set ups as the other games .  Has a auto set up that you can click on to get best out of your computer. .. Next was little scared as it said Russian Ouch . Nope came through in English and was really glad I have plad a battle in a campiangn in Russia as a son of some Noble Based on Historical battles , Gives you great quick history then the battle and your pbjectives ..I hered a bunch of reviews about the cloudy battle field /foggy or what ever . I was in winter cold Russia woods . I felt the cold in my bones as I played the game even here in Texas at 75 degrees out . Have you ever looked at a water painting from the days Of Nights or Napolian era and just get so absorb in the painting because of the way it is painted blended in . This is how the battles are done here . Yes a tree is a tree a rock a rock . person is person but when you view the battle from a over all you see the picture in a art gallery .. This is not TOTAL WAR big Sega mass media market . this is for hard core war gammers . who play WAR GAMES not political , games with fighting as a secound thought . Here you get bare bones fighting of this period , I have game tested some of the hardest and best well known games from the 80-90's .. I found this company one night by accedent I do not have a supper game computer right now and was looking for a ""older game"" that  it could handle . I bought another of the WWII 1c games fell in love with them they are the hardest most enjoyable WAR GAMES out there . You do not need bother with building a fur trading company , a church , none of that .This is a game for fighting and historical fighting . The screen graphics are like a water color painting  that during my two battles i played felt like I was on the field with the troops . No shinny plastic looking trees or clean bright unaforms here hell  they been marching thousands of miles in mud snow . after all 1c dod not have it in the budget like Sega to put dry cleaners on the battle field so your troops can look bright and shinny before they die for you .I recomend this game if you are not a Total war freak and yeas I have a bunch of them . I get enough political games on TV . If real battles and hard core not bright shinny grphics are your thing  I got it for 2 bucks on sale the 90 minutes has already given me enough joy and look forward to many more hours . I am just into a M4 pre buy game simulation this weekend but will be playing this next rest assured ..			"

												I know the first question you have in mind while reading this review is what's the main difference and distinct feature between this game and Total War?This game is much more a simulation than Total War series ever be. It has a lot of details to the battlefield that even one slight mistake can invite defeat for your side. Hardcore, very hard are 2 words that most suitable to represent this game.It is however ridden with low performance issues and the support for this game is no longer active. I will still recommend this game but only if you can live with it's issues.			"

												So many people have compared this game to the Total War games (of which I own all  and have spent a fair chunk of my life playing  ) but that is rather unfair.People realise that Mount and Blade Warband Viking Conquest is a different game than Attilia, Kingdoms or Barbarian Invasion and so is Real Warfare 1242 diferent than Med2. They are very different games.I acknowledge the game may not exist if Med.2 didn't but it's still an interesting period of history and a quite complex old game to play well in it's own right.To be sure it is rather like playing in a leaking diving mask in some battles,it is a bit blurred.Fog I believe it represents and that is  pretty usual up the Baltic Sometimes the view looks quite wonderful  and  the terrain  lends itself splendidly for attack or defence and there are plenty of various, well modelled, historically correct troops to choose from.  The game functions fine,load ups are a bit slow ,the music is a bit strange maybe I'm being picky but some of it sounds like a prolonged burp, battlesounds are excellent, controls of which there are far more than a certain other game and they are very good and give you tons of options for your troops.Been no glitches or crashes  it runs well on Windows 7.Ok If  I was only allowed to play this or Med 2   for the rest of my life  of course I would choose Med. 2.But none the less Real Warfare 1242 is a pretty damned good wargame especially if you  like the Medieval period ..It's a buck forty seven in my country now so its got to  be cheap in yours also and definetly worth giving it a try at that price.You might be  pleasantly surprised...

												Pretty buggy.Game has some good potential, but for me it was unfulfilled. Positive is interesting graphic engine and idea of the game, but game mechanics are unfinished and buggy. I have encountered many unpleasant bugs, mistakes and errors. There should be done a lot of work on game, but it is obviously DEAD and abandoned by devs.			"

												The gameplay, from the five minutes iveplayed, seems to be alright. Why i will not play anymore, is that during battle, everything is so freakin blurry i thought i was going blind. Apparently the world is always foggy.			"

												By far the worst strategy game I have ever played. Horrible graphics, long set-up for resolution and other options, no campaign map, bad camera control, and bad combat animation. For a 2010 release this is a poor excuse for a strategy game. If you want a good medieval srtategy with better overall gameplay get Medieval II: Total War. If you really want this game buy it when it is on sale not at full price, it's a waste of money.			"

												Rip off of the total war franchise.  If you are looking for a game with horrible graphics, one voice actor and almost no stradegy element then this is for you.  This game dosent even have a campain.  You can ethier play a costom battle(which half of the time crashes) or lan.  Who the F*ck Plays Lan.  If you want to play a quality RTS then I suggest ethier Total War Shogun or any of the more recent instalments (Attila, Arena, Rome 2) do  not make the mistake of wasting your money like i did, Please this game will forever haunt your steam library if you do.
