												There is like 1 billion different Tower Defense games out there.Most use the conventional 2D top view to keep it simple.But there are some jewels that don't follow these old views.. jewels like Dungeon Defenders, Orcs Must Die and Sanctum!Sanctum 2 is definetly not an easy TD game but for sure a fun and challenging one!Playing this game in coop mode gets you the most out of it and it's also the most fun way to play the game in my opinion.If you like Tower Defense games, then Sanctum 2 is a MUST buy!

												Action? CheckReaction? CheckIntensity? CheckCool aliens to shoot and not feel bad about it? CheckNot having to clean up the dead bodies after a good workout? CheckMaze building (and I don't mean having 2-3 options, I mean the whole nine yard of options)? CheckLOADS of diversified weapons, perks and towers? CheckSadly this game lacks in terms of the sizy of its community, and that's about the only bad thing I can come up about this game.You like fast-paced FPS Shooters? You like Tower Defense? You like to be faced with increasingly difficult odds and to put your name on some relevant leaderboards (until they reset them, of course)? Then this game's for you.I'm doing my part eradicating these filthy alien scums... are you?			"

												          One could call this a reimagining of the original Sanctums run and gun tower defense gameplay.  For those who played the original changes include enemies that actively attack you if you get too close, walls are now low enough for towers to be able to shoot across multiple rows and also make it harder for you to avoid attacks. Most towers are air and ground now. Weapons are now split into classes, and you can only carry four tower types so as to encourage team-work.           For new players and beginners, if you enjoy FPS combat and Tower Defense, then this is a great fusion of the two. Balance is perfect between towers and player weapons so as to ensure contribution from both. You also have the option of inviting three other friends for a chaotic good time of setting up towers and shooting monsters in the face. "

												This game is ridiculously hard. It's by far one of the hardest games I've played. The challenge is nice for a change.The game is multiplayer-centric and co-op is set to ""public"" by default. It was a bit of a shock the first time someone randomly entered my game, but he was very helpful and we won. The community is very sporting, not a lot of finger pointing when a game is lost. Having a different team each time you play keeps it interesting.In Sanctum 1, the FPS element served to supplement the TD element and it was often possible to win without firing a shot. In Sanctum 2, both elements are vital and you must be good at both to survive. The separation between tower bases and towers means your options for pathing are much more limited in the beginning than in S1. Moreover, the FPS has been made much harder than it was as the enemies now fight back and your character can be killed (knocked out for ten seconds).Overall, Sanctum 2 is one of the best games of the century.

Of course you have. We've all been there. Don't you wish there was a way for you to kill him right before he got to your nice, shiny base?Welcome to Sanctum, where you can walk up to that guy and shove a rocket up his a** personally.

												Hello Ladies and Gentlemen!Today I will write a review about a first person tower defense game called Sanctum 2.A bit about the game and developers.Sanctum 2 is a sequel to a quite famous first person tower defense game called Sanctum. Both games have been developed and published by a well known company called Coffee Stain Studios. They stand behind many well known titles. The most recent one is Goat Simulator. Yes, they made Goat Simulator.About Gameplay.Sanctum 2 is a first person shooter game in which the player has the ability to make a tower maze that will help him defend the core from a lot of numerous enemies. There are a lot of different weapons, towers and enemies in Sanctum 2, every one of them having different strengths and weaknesses. And to be able to experience the game fully, the player should have full party of people with each of them having a different character. I feel the question ""why?"" coming up next, so I'll just answer it to you now. Each character has his / her own weapon. One has shotgun, one has sniper, one has rocket launcher, one riffle and the newest character has a crossbow. Shotgun character is good against bigger enemies that come running at him. Rocket launcher is good versus swarms of enemies since his damage does not only go on one enemy. Sniper and Crossbow characters are best versus game bosses, since they deal largest amount of damage in one hit. And riffle is good versus pretty much anything, but of course it has smallest damage rate.Each character can have a secondary weapon. There are many various secondary weapons so the player can fit exactly what they want to fit. There are also different perks in this game, so even those help out. So you could even turn slow, but powerful weapons into very fast, even more powerful weapons. Of course, there are many towers that help you in your victory. There are those towers that are fast, but deal small amount of damage, and then there are those that are slow and yet deal massive amount of damage. Each tower is good for something, and it's up to player to find out what is the best way to make the towers fit in with their game style. There are also a lot of different types of enemies. Some are small, numerous and fast, while others are big, slow and hard to kill.Unlike the first game, Sanctum 2 feels a bit more open. It feels like you have more space to move, more space to build and more possibilities. On the other hand, this game also introduced leveling system. Each level unlocks different weapons, perks or towers to the player. Leveling is quite easy at start, but that changes later on. And the leveling system actually gives a replay value to the game, since you can always come back to old maps and redo them with your newly unlocked weapons, towers and perks.Unlike in many other games, DLC's in this game are actually quite good. I am not a fan of DLC's in general so I still think that they are overpriced, but for the amount of money you put into them you get quite a few things back. With the DLC's you get tones of new maps, new characters and quite a few weapons. So the Complete Collection is a pure go from my end.Graphic and Audio.Honestly, I was a bit disappointed by the graphic. It does look prettier and there are more details than in the first one, but I just feel like there's many more things that the developers could do to make the game prettier. Audio on the other hand is amazing, and I just enjoyed listening to every song or background sound that the developers put into the game.Pros, cons and final grade.Pros:- Many different maps.- Characters to chose from.- DLC's that give an actual new content.- Various different unlockables.Cons:- No ability to change primary weapon until final level.- Sometimes towers feel useless.Final Grade: 7.5/10Extra info: If you are a fan of first person shooters, or maybe tower defense games, then this game is for you. You just can't go wrong with Sanctum 2. You can buy Sanctum 2 over Steam.In case you like my reviews, please head over to my blog and read the other reviews http://midnightwolfie.blogspot.comThank you very much!			"

												A great game, in my opinion. The design and concept are lovely, and I always enjoy smaller game companies. I used to adore tower defense games in my earlier years, but after I discovered Steam, I started to drift away from the tower defense games I'd play online. I started to play more FPS-Type games such as Gmod, Half-Life 2, and TF2. One day I closed a steam game, and was greeted with the exciting sight of a steam news window. Scrolling through it, I came across a ""newly released"" page featuring Sanctum 2. All I remember was that the picture had Skye on it, and I thought ""Oh, this is interesting character design. I'll check this out."" (Yes, I'm a sucker for gingers.) So I watched the trailer, then eagerly waited for the demo to download. I bought the full game shortly after clearing the demo, and I was not disappointed.A note for those with less-than-behemoth GPU's, since the creators don't have a huge amount of resources availible, they don't have all that much spare time for graphical optimization, so it may get a bit choppy with the higher settings.TL;DR: Cute gingers, strong female characters, perfect genre (For me, at least.) And shiny art style. 11/10 would buy again.A bit of an edit: No, this isn't a full serious review, there's a lot more that I didn't add, such as  the great loadout system, fun enemy types, and how the devs are really responsive to the community.And of course, most importantly, there is a difference between gingers and redheads. Lyralei can confirm this.			"

												So the game itself is actually pretty good. The dealbreaker is that the support team has utterly abandoned it with some massive bugs that range from mildly annoying to crash-to-desktop. This issue is even more pronounced on the Linux version and while these bugs have been known since mid 2014, they were simply forgotten. People continue to ask for support, but they're basically talking to a wall.Like I said, the game is really solid in terms of fun and mechanics, but that all goes away when it suddenly breaks without warning. Really disappointing!			"

												Sanctum 2 is really nice mix of styles. FPS and Tower Defense mix very effectively in this good game that will hook you if you are a fan of these genres. Not exactly a masterpiece, but a very enjoyable game that is worth its price. although some people that played the first one find this one much worst, I can almost assure you that this game will be a fun way to spent at least 15-20 hours of your time, no matter what you expect of it.Good game 76/100			"

												The first Sanctum was a first person tower defense game, with first person shooting aspects added to help give the players something to do during waves instead of simply watching your towers do all the work. It was a somewhat new concept in how well the tower balancing was executed while giving almost limitless designs and combinations. The drawbacks were simply trademarks of it being a new Indy title, a simple lack of content for missions and poor textures clearly showed the limitations of the budget and time they were working with. The first person shooting elements needed much more work to be entertaining in the long run however the game’s much heavier focus on the tower building distracted enough from this flaw that the game remained fresh with each new layout you created.With the release of Sanctum 2, I was looking forwards to an updated version of the first giving more customization, towers, maps and maybe a few thrilling scripted events during the campaign missions. As I launched the game for the first time, ignoring the many technical errors of the initial release and completed the tutorial I started my first mission. As expected the graphics were considerably improved as they took on a more comic based look, similar to the art design of borderlands 2, although it has been done before it definitely gives sanctum 2 a much more unique appearance. The new addition of a progression system allows players to level up to unlock perks, new weapons and towers that rewards players who play on harder difficulty settings with a shorter grind.Once I decided to get started building I suddenly realized I was only allowed to build seven blocks of wall, which meant I had to obey the map design when creating my maze for the enemies to pass through. This immediately felt very limiting, as one of the great aspects of the first is that it allowed you to create as many walls as you desired, and simply expecting you to create your own design within the map layout. With a limited number of wall blocks, the game forces you to take the basic route that the map often implies for you to take making it feel like I had little choice at all when it came to the design, just simply having to do what everyone else does within the same map. Speaking to my co-op partner on skype I found myself frequently saying, “I could do this amazing layout.. oh I don’t have enough blocks I guess this will have to do.” Constantly leaving missions with a feeling that it could have been better, and wasn’t complete, one of the worst feelings possible within a tower defense game. I decided to play a survival mission to get around this issue, where each wave I would be given more blocks. I would be able to finally create the layout I wanted, however I soon found myself no longer being given wall blocks after the first few waves, leaving me to keep the same incomplete design for the never ending survival mode.After my second to third mission I started to notice in the end game statistics that I was dealing considerably more damage then all of my towers each game. With the new design you will notice a much stronger focus on the first person shooting then the tower defense, with many levels not even requiring the use of towers providing the use of the right equipment. The stronger focus on shooting would expect dramatic improvements to the design of shooting compared to the first game, however this is simply not the case and some elements of the weapons have been removed. You are no longer able to spend resources on your weapons to improve their performance as possible within the first game. A bigger selection of weapons allows you to focus on certain strengths or help cover flaws that your character choice may have. With the addition one weapon slot being fixed depending on your character choice, you only have access to change your secondary weapon. With such a strong focus on the shooting elements, it leave me to question why they forced this to be so limited during missions. It soon becomes a boring chore to shoot during waves, especially when weapons empty their clips so quickly and then demand a five second cooldown time to reload.Within the game mechanics of Sanctum 2 the placement of a single block can often decide the success or failure of a wave on specific maps. Some maps are clearly much better designed then others, some of which only emphasize the first person aspects even more as you are not allowed to build along the enemies path at all. This just turns entire missions into a first person shooter with shooting that does little to excite. The new addition of boss waves simply takes all tower defense aspects and throws them out the window for the final wave. Bosses are able to destroy towers and wall bases, so on many maps a well designed layout will be instantly ruined as the boss targets a vital block and is soon followed by every other enemy in the wave.Pros:The character progression adds more value to replaying missionsFour player co-opColourful eye catching visualsCons:A stronger focus on first person shooting, with little content within the shooting elementsBalancing issues, some characters and towers are simply sub-par to othersBoss waves completely ruin all aspects of tower defenseLimited resources often leave your base design incomplete before the endFrame issues can sometimes cause huge frame rate dropsSanctum 2′s attempts to become a stronger hybrid between tower defense and first person shooting by removing many tower elements of the first leaves Sanctum 2 with little identity. Becoming a jack of all trades, it simply becomes a case of “Anything I can do, you can do better.” If you want an action orientated defense game, Orcs Must Die 2 surpasses anything Sanctum 2 has to offer. For those who want a more traditional tower defense game then Defense Grid or Sanctum 1 have much more enjoyment to be had. The limitations of the new gameplay mechanics means nothing stands out, leaving a disappointing collection of “ok” and as such no reason to buy it over other titles available.			"

												This is a pretty entertaing solo or co-op Tower-defense/shooter game.  It has a lot of the same fun things going for it that Orcs Must Die! 2 has but it's more serious than OMD!2 is.  I think it's pretty good if you're interested in that sort of play.  With all four DLC, it has well over 40 hours of puzzle-solving and exploration before the game devolves into grinding for Survival times.Sanctum 2's solo and co-op gameplay is an evolutionary step away from Sanctum 1.  The primary differences are in scale and player utility.  That is, the scale is more intimate (close and smaller) while the player characters are specialized for certain utilities (sniper vs. AOE vs. close-range).Although it's still a Tower-Defense game blended with FPS elements, they philosophically moved away from how the first game worked: 'dozens of weak towers to kill most of the Lumes while the player focuses on a few key enemy-types' .... towards 'a dozen-ish strong towers which kill about one-half of the Lumes while the player uses special abilities to either help the towers take down all of the Lumes or kill special ones'.Rather than every player being exactly the same, now there are four (five if you have the first DLC) different character classes to choose between who have different specializatons (such as sniper, rocketeer, soldier, and close-quarters).The developer is very open to changing the game in ways the vocal fan-base seem to want it.  When S2 first launched, it received positive reviews by critics, but many fans of the original vocally didn't like it, because it had changed quite a bit from the S1.  Since then, the developer has modified the game to mollify the fans (allowing 15 towers per map instead of 10 like at launch, as well as other changes).The developer is also continuing to add features free of additional charge such as the server browser for co-op players.Lastly, I just finished the final DLC today, and I really liked it.  All four sets were well done: a good mix of interesting locations and enemies; a solid difficulty; and a good sense of satisfaction after winning some tough fights.(Updated 15 Dec to account for final DLC release)			"

												The original Sanctum was essentially a conventional tower defense game with a first-person user interface. Sanctum 2 is much closer to a true hybrid of FPS and tower defense. Teamwork and marksmanship are MUCH more important than they were in Sanctum 1, everything is much faster paced, and you will no longer be able to make huge, insanely complex, super-efficient mazes. Essentially, Sanctum 1 was maybe 20% shooter, 80% tower defense. Sanctum 2 is 50/50.If you were expecting gameplay identical to the first Sanctum, you'll probably RAEG. But if you were hoping for significant evolution and change, Sanctum 2 is well worth a try.			"

												Sanctum does look impressive, visually. The white laboratory theme from the first Sanctum is only a small portion of the sequel, with outside environments making up most of the campaign levels. Many of the enemies are carried over from the first game and look pretty much the same. The sound design is excellent, with great weapon sounds and music that sets the science-fiction atmosphere incredibly well. It isn't quite as much tower defense as fans of the first game would probably hope for, since more of the emphasis this time around is placed on the first-person shooting element. It also hides way too much information from the player, leading to a lot of guess-and-check strategies. The game remains a refreshing hybrid of genres, however, and many of the frustrations temporarily wash away as you lay witness to the last enemy in the last wave die, proving that your strategic planning and accurate shooting have paid off.

												Sanctum 2 picks up where the first one left, More intencity, more focus on combat, towers are more like the second part of combat rather than you being their support like in the first one.The adition of ranks/levels to unlock guns and towers is a nice adition, ane perks, thanks the gods for perks. Being able to customize your playstyle even further is a godsend!Only good words for sanctum 2, i was a big fan and worked hard to clear stuff on hardest solo on the first one, now i will prolly do the same here too!so in short: more intence, more brutal, more strategic, and there is a story this time around!

												This is at most a mediocre tower defense game in my opinion. Compared with its predecessor, the devs adds some action and shooting elements but subtracts much more strategy parts from. For those players who ever played Sanctum and anticipated for more challenging tower defense game, this kind of change is quite hard to adapt at first. I remember when I played this game the first time, I was shocked by its brilliant FPS effects at the beginning, but disappointed soon due to the lack of strategy depth. If I want to play an action game or FPS, This is no doubt a good budget choice. But for tower defense fan like me, well, It is not my priority in the playing list to be honest.			"

												8.5/10 - Action Packed Tower Defense on Steroids!I really dig this game! It's tower defense unlike any other. You assume a first person shooter role and actively defend the paths you create. Best played with friends online, multiplayer does work so expect others to join in on the fun! There are several characters to choose from and a plethora of large, interesting maps/levels to play. Your excitement and stress levels will peak in this one!I'm most impressed with the hybrid implementation in this game; it’s a perfect blend of FPS and strategic tower defense. I always find players online that are willing to join in and help defend against the treacherous aliens. In my opinion this game exceeds the original game; it's extremely active, controls and game play are more fluid and enjoyable. This one has a pretty high replay value for sure.Worth $10; I usually see on sale so wait for that. Add me! I'll play anytime! Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

												Great Tower defence game, brings together most good TD concepts like a Hero who can move around and kill guys, walls to build mazes, points give power to towers, leading to upgrades etc etc. Oh yeaah and its first person, really good there too. AND AND AND it can run on computers that are potatoes!only thing I can't really care for is the fact you have to level up to unlock stuff. I wish my friends could just join in as powerful as me.

												Sanctum 2: A ReviewYou might be wondering, why am I reviewing it now, why not 6 months ago, or even when it came out? The simple truth is this. Sanctum 2 has been out for a little more than a year now and in that time the game itself has gone though many changes. So much so that it is hardly the game it was whence it first arrived on the market. Sure it's always been a FPS/tower defence, but in such a different way than when it was first released that a whopping 3 whole days after it's release, the Devs released a patch that set in motion the game you see before you today.Now, your time is precious, and I understand that, so for those looking for just the short answer to the question: ""Should I buy this game?"" That answer is, unequivocally, and without a doubt in my mind, wholeheartedly, seriously why haven't you just pushed the add to cart button and checked out already?!?!For those of you who are of the more discerning...Steam...Steam-inites? Steam-ies? What suffix do we use to classify the people of our wonderful Steam Community? Hmm I wonder... In any case, for those of you wanting to be convinced, there are several reasons why this is the game for you, your mother, your brother's dog, and that pen-pal Geoffrey who you wrote to and exchanged letters with in primary school from Uzbeki-beki-stan-stan, that always said he was going to come visit, but never really had the means to do so; still it was nice to see someone from the other side of the planet and who had just as many gramatical and spelling errors in their writings as third grade you did back in the day. Yeah, remember Geoffrey? Well even though he wont be visiting ""Amerika"", he probably now plays this game and if you play this game too, the both of you have the option of text to speech chat! Ah yes, you heard me correctly, TEXT. TO. SPEECH. In an almost Stephen Hawking like manner (until you select your character that is), you can wow the masses with literal pronunciations of the written English language which is always good for a laugh, but terrible for poor old Geoffrey who's been desperately trying to learn how to pronounce words that he couldn't learn from his Speak&Spell. ""Ok, so what's so great about that"", you ask as you feel so very smug in your smug chair, wearing your smug bathrobe, listening to smug jazz, sipping your imported smugness coffee/tea/caffinated beverage, and occasionally adjusting your monocle...smuggly. Listen here Smuggy, have you ever heard Stephen Hawking sing the theme to the A-Team? No, you haven't? WELL I HAVE. And this game has let me do that, it sounded much like I thought it would if Stephen Hawking were part of the A-Team. ""Big deal"", you say? Well a little known fact about Stephen Hawking is that he has relatives, that's right, relatives! And whether they're actually related or not there's a player here in our very own Steam Community who goes by the very similar name of Tiger Hawkins.*(Flashback)*Long ago, in a galaxy far far away... he very bravely (and without the use of right pinky) fought off hordes of Lumes (the game's monsters) in a Survival challenge set forth by the Developers in Sanctum 1 with the promise of everlasting fame, fortune, and imortalization within their games. Alone on the battle field his war raged on, until finally, he cleared the threshold of damage being able to be dealt and beat the Devs at their own game! (Actually he just survived the most waves out of anyone...ever) He was imortalized in both games just as the Devs had promised, and he lived happily ever after.*(End Flashback)*Feel like the game has been out far too long for you to bandwagon onto? Not a chance! With every new Steam sale, a horde of eager beavers, not unlike yourself, flood through the gates of Elysion One Core Guardian training grounds and look like a bunch of fools until someone with a little more knowhow plays a map with you and corrects the error of your ways. To which you feel a little butt-hurt about it and you go off and play single player for a while until you realize that ""HOLY CRAP, THIS ISN'T LIKE OTHER FPS GAMES IN WHICH THE ONLINE COMMUNITY IS JUST FULL OF RUDE ASSHATS AND TROLLS, AND THEY WERE JUST TRYING TO HELP ME LEARN!!!!"" (*cough* sorry, accidental capslock and whatnot)Seriously, the co-op community in Sanctum 2 is very quick to come to the defense of someone who is 1.) New. 2.) Under Attack. or 3.) Being yelled by someone who they themselves aren't pulling their own weight.Want to be UBER L33T 360 NOSCOPE 420BLAZE-IT and go charging in head first, not a care in the world, complete disregard for your own safety for the sake of your own team mates? Go right ahead, so long as you have the right perks equiped. ""Wait a minute, there's perks too?"" Yes, there are. There are TONS of them, and you get to pick a few per map to help customize your own play style. Don't feel as though you need to be the guy mentioned above as you would rather spend your time building a map so that your towers do all the hard work? Sure, that's possible too! Find that you're at neither extreme and would like to join the rest of us under the Bell-curve? Great, see you there! *high five*Character skins, DLC maps, guns, perks, DEATH, Sanctum two has it all! But wait, order now in the next immediate time frame and CoffeeStain studios will supersize your order by throwing in their trademark easter eggs! Ever wanted to occupy your character with some rad-arcade-gaming action while you wait for your online friends to decide whether to upgrade this tower over here, or that one over there? BOOM! Wish granted! There are game stations that you can find in game maps that will allow you to play games within the game! Game-ception! (Except that I really hate this trend of adding ""ception"" to anything that happens within itself. Yes the movie started it all, but the title when way over your heads. Inception, was what it was called because of the plot point of planting the seed of an idea, not because they needed to go 12 billion layers deep! Whatever, Game-ception!)If that last point hasn't convinced you then there's not so much more I can do to convince you other than letting you know that this game has a super chill soundtrack, significant amounts of replay-ability, and you get to shoot things in the face/back/butt/weakspot, causes you to think and then punishes you for making bad decisions, and when you finally manage to beat it, you enable the Feats of Strength, and relearn every single mechanic the game has with expert precision, timing, and bragging rights per wave when the MVP status is awarded.Buy the game.Buy the DLC.And maybe, just maybe, this wonderful game will reunite you with Geoffrey.

												I dislike this game as a tower defense game because it isn't.  A few maps are heavily dependent upon towers at easier difficulties but you quickly discover that the right combination of character and weapon can do more damage than all your towers combined, and hard mode is designed with this in mind.   There are some levels where you can do 90% of the total damage done and still lose the round.  And then the designers start trying to achieve greater difficulty by throwing in enemies that are 100% immune to towers, and then gimmicky enemies that towers stop targetting and then they return to 100% health if you don't kill them by yourself fast enough.The worst part is that they have all the elements for perfection.  Their map design is really creative but then they only give you a  few walls and towers to work with, leaving you feeling like a kid drooling at the lego box for the Millenium Falcon but then looking down at your hand and realizing you only have a dozen blocks to work with. When you only have 2 towers going into round four and maybe 5 or 6 towers going into the final round, there's not much stategy. The game would be more more fun if you were given far more walls and towers and the outcome were determined more by your maze building and tower placement skills, rather than picking the right weapons and perks and then showing off on youtube by killing all the enemies without even bothering to build your token towers. I thought this would be less of a problem in survival mode but there is no true survival mode.  Survival is just normal mode with the normal waves but it repeats after the last wave and just boosts the health, speed, and regen of enemies by a LOT.  So rather than being a mode where you can try to build the perfect setup and then see how many waves of every increasing monsters you can last through, you're instead just left with another form of hard mode that lasts maybe two or three times as long as normal.I've never seen a game be SO close to perfection and then just ruin it with poor design choices.  But if you like PVE FPS then I do still recommend this game for you.  Just don't expect much tower strategy in hard mode or you'll be disappointed.			"

												One of the best games I've ever played. Though very challenging at times, the overall experience that I had with this game was fantastic. If you're looking for a game that combines tower defense and first person shooters, you should definitely buy it.Pros: + Fantastic visuals+ Many stages are quite explorable beyond the normal boundaries that you see on the minimap+ Amazing soundtrack+ Good variety of towers, weapons and perksCons:- Usually one specific strategy is so good that you can practically win any stage with it (except for Sokol, this one is inhumane)			"

												I can't think of a game that I looked foreward to more then Sanctum 2.  My friends and I absolutly loved the first sanctum game and were all pumped as hell for the second installment.  So you can also imagine our dissapointment when we discovered that the game that had a beatuful balance of TD and FPS had been transformed into what felt like a Call of Duty clone(ranking up and heavy reliance on your guns).  Towers felt weak as hell and even the guns didnt seem to be as good as they used to be.  Resources were also limited as  and the way they were given out was downright moronic and limiting.  While I have heard that some issues have been fixed, I honestly dont care.  To me and my friends this game is terrible at its fore and  the ammount of pure betrayal that  we felt upon playing this game made us unistall it 4 hours after downloading it.  If you like pure shooters then you might get more enjoyment out of this game then we did, however if you enjoy interesting tower defense games then you'd probably be better off avoiding this game and buying the original instead.

The graphics and the environment are just amazing, it has a beautiful scenery and a background musics. I can't explain how awesome this game is :)			"

												I haven't ever played in the Tower Defense genre, but the idea of a FPS hybrid made me curious.For sure, it was different then I had imagined when originally checking out the game, but in a good way.Alien environments with a nice combination of FPS and Tower Defense gameplay, as advertised.I don't know if it is something I would ever go at alone, but with friends it was amazing.If you like games that rely heavily on team coordination and want something you can co-op with your friends, then this game is worth checking out.The overall concept is really great, in my opinion, and the visuals are nice on the eyes compared to the urban environments I usually find myself in.

Product received for free
												(I did buy this game and didn't receive it for free, actually Steam. Thank you very much. -_- )I love Sanctum 2. It's the perfect game for somebody like me. Are you like me? Let's find out!- The graphics are beautiful without trying too hard to be flash.- It incorporates so many different modes and styles - FPS, tower defense, strategy, horde/wave survival.- 4 player co-op is excellent, with everybody bringing something useful to the table.- The variety of guns, perks and equipment enable unending variations and the chance for plenty of experimentation.- Great gory gibbage at appropriate times.- It's a little over £10. Some recent releases are £59.99....- The soundtrack is beautiful - especially Skye's theme. If you purchase it, to play in the background, it adds an oddly harmonic, relaxing mood to killing swarms of grotesque monsters.Cons? Uhmm... uhh... well... I got nothing. Buy it.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed this game. Playing with friends or alone, the game play was always fun. I'm a big fan of tower defense (ever since Warcraft 3 mods), and the FPS element keeps it even more involved and interesting. I played the first Sanctum quite a bit as well, and this one is a great upgrade. I highly recommend this game.			"

												Sanctum 2 suffers from two glaring flaws.  It can't seem to decide what it wants to be, and it can't stop holding the player on a leash.Unlike the original Sanctum which was very clearly a tower defense game as well as a shooter, Sanctum 2 focuses almost entirely on the shooting.  The game gimps your ability to build proper mazes or place any significant number of towers, and oftentimes, your towers just can't do enough damage to matter and you find yourself relying more on your own gun. Furthermore, at certain intervals, the game forgoes the standard strategic preparation phase and gives you an abysmally short countdown.  Not only is this countdown unable to be paused if you need to go use the bathroom in between waves, but it hardly gives you enough time to walk across the map, let alone build any towers.  It's like the game itself is telling you ""No time for strategy!  Go shoot things! Go go go!""This wouldn't be that bad if the shooting element weren't so generic and constrained.  The game limits you to a loadout of two weapons, and locks you into your first weapon depending on your character, so your only customization is a single weapon.  Furthermore, unlike the previous game, weapons aren't even upgradeable.  It's like the game wants you to focus on shooting aspect, but at the same time doesn't actually let you focus on the shooting aspect.Overall, Sanctum 2 feels like a game that doesn't know what it wants to be and, worst, doesn't want you doing too much.  It was not a fun experience and my trust in the developers has been grievously violated.			"

												So the premise of this game is that humans have established colonies in the skies over an alien planet. They use magical blue balls of light (cores) to convert the gasses present into oxygen and kill the native spores. The problem is that the planet is already occupied by an alien race of highly evolved mushrooms. The mushroom people under the direction of unknown telepathic boss entity whom you never fight create giant organic shafts to the colonies to try to murder them dead.In the game you will create a maze of towers in an attempt to halt the advance of the mushroom people before they destroy you're magical blue ball as is typical of a Tower Defense game. you will spend 5, 10 or 15 minutes per level depositing towers that will ultimately only do about thirty percent of the damage necessary to kill the enemy waves. The rest is up to you. You can choose two of a plethora of weapons to aid you in the struggle. The game does not address why a gun held by a five foot two to six foot tall human out damages half dozen tool shed sized tower mounted guns you drop and arguably that means this game isn't really a TD. There are ""perks"" you can select to improve you're characters/towers performance but there’s really nothing that will turn this game into an actual Tower Defense, which is unfortunate.The longer you play the game the more powerful guns, perks and towers you can unlock, particularly if you buy the DLC. I'm sure we all know the DLC drill by now. For an extra five dollars you will get access to all the content that was cut from the game during the alpha and beta tests for quality control and balance reasons. Ideally that content has since been fixed/balanced/polished but we never know until we shell out the cash. To their credit the DLC for Sanctum 2 does provide a lot of interesting content. The towers, perks and maps it adds do a great deal to increase replayability of the game and it rounds out the base games story that ends on a cliffhanger.The real strength of this game is the level design. Like every other piece of science fiction made in the past twelve years almost everything looks like an Ipod that said this game does it particularly well. The integration of organic vines and spores growing over the utopian surfaces/structures in this game are very imaginative and well done. A lot of games (Doom 3/Dead Space) place a strong aesthetic emphasis in a human environment being reverse terraformed by some perverse alien influence but truthfully Sanctum 2 does it better. The levels are distinct from each other in groups as you proceed from an idealistic lived in colony under attack to the deteriorating front lines to an industrial themed colony abandoned some years or generations earlier. The theme is that the further into the game you go the closer to the planet you get until ultimately you are beneath its surface in a giant cavern with mushroom Jesus. In the tradition of classic FPS games there are many many secret areas and players are rewarded for their diligent exploration. Ironically the maps are far bigger in scope then the developers were prepared to work with and you’ll shudder when you realize that you can’t incorporate some of the games incredibly ideal choke points into you’re defense as they are simply too far away from where the action will be…. If they allowed you to place your own cores the quality of the game would quadruple immediately but thats something they will have to consider for a sequel.The biggest issue with the game is the many many clipping errors. This game will kill you or force you to consul command suicide many times as you fall through solid objects or get stuck between them. In the basic game it doesn’t matter very much as you can wait out the 9 second respawn time once or twice and it isn’t likely to lose the game for you. Tragically the developers compounded this issue by encouraging the players to play with “five feats of strength” on to create a more challenging experience… One of these “feats” is a no respawn mode… So basically each time you die to a developer error, which will be once or twice a game, you’ll also lose the level. Since playing with the feats of strength on is going to be your last real experience with the game they are brutally poisoning their consumer base who will only remember losing 30 minutes of an expertly played game because Coffe Stain Studio's didn’t properly patch or beta test. Hardcore modes are made for polished games made by hardcore developers. It might be a tough pill for Coffee Stain Studios to swallow but they just haven’t reached that point yet.For ten dollars it is a really cool indie game. The maps if not always utilized ideally are a clever visual spectacle and it does have a lot of replay value. If Coffee Stain Studio focuses on adding general content to their games and take their player testers a little more seriously these guys could easily be around for another few years. Otherwise they'll find themselves doing the 3d effects for their regional weather channels talking about once whens.			"

												This is by far one of the best and most fun experiences I've had. There's a certain magic to this game that brings people together. Some of my best memories were playing this game with people I've never met and having a blast making our way through all the missions. But enough with my sentiment for this game let's see what's good about it.   This is the sequel to the world's first FPS Tower Defense hybrid and it definitely shows. there's way more content than the previous one could even dream of having. More enemies, more customization with an all new perks system, weapons and towers, and classes each with special abilities. Also, it has a lot more maps and an actual story with some hidden backstory. It even features maps from the original Sanctum.   The multiplayer is by far the best part of this game and is what kept me coming back for more. The community is so nice, I have never come across anyone toxic. Even if I would mess up they'd give me feedback to improve my game and not make that mistake again. The community is always friendly towards newcomers, and will not hesitate to answer questions to help you get better.   The maps seem small, but are so much bigger than they look with secrets everywhere, places to explore and mines to help you out so that finding the secrets aren't so pointless. With cool areas to explore, arcade machines with games, and codes that can be entered on a site to get more backstory, pretty much every level is hiding something.   There are very few flaws with this game, but not every game is perfect. First of all, when you get into higher level play with added difficulty, there seems to be very little freedom with setups to use, despite the vast amount of customizability. But the levels are still fun to do regardless. Also, this isn't a game that is meant for soloers. The game is very unforgiving later on in high level play, and you have to mostly rely on your towers to do damage and you just simply don't get enough resources solo to do it alone, but finding people shouldn't be a problem with the great community. Also, this game does use text to speech. it is a hilarious tool that has made me laugh many times. It features commands to alter your voice, and you can even sing songs with it!   Like most indie games, it goes on sale often so I would reccommend picking it up along with all the DLCs. it is an addicting game with much fun to be had, many levels to explore, and conquer. With an amazing community  to back you up along the way. I would reccommend it even if it wasn't on sale simply because it's that good. If this isn't reason enough to pick this game up I don't know what is. Just pick this game up and give it a go, I promise it's well worth it.			"

												Sanctum 2 is just amazing, even better then the original. Combining First Person Shooters and Tower Defence into one was an amazing idea, but giving it a bigger storyline and more in-depth characters just made it so much better. The DLC's for Sanctum 2 just add to an already amazing story. With it's up to 4 player co-op, perk system and vast array of weapons, it really made me want to just keep playing it. The only things that drags it down are the limited amount of towers, only three tiers for towers and the lack of upgradeable weapons. Strongly suggested for people who greatly enjoyed the original.

												The original Sanctum was a cool game, even if it was kind of a mess. you placed towers atop walls, but the walls were so high up that you needed elevators to get up on top of them, so battles were largely either centralized at one spot atop the wall, or standing down inside your maze you built, armed with the game's somewhat poor weapon selection. Some of this might sound confusing if you don't know about Sanctum or Sanctum 2, but I'll explain a bit more. In short, though, the first game, though  pretty good for the time, is completely outclassed by its sequel, to the point of shelving it forever, in my opinion.Sanctum 2 is a tower defense...and a co-op first person shooter, but a tower defense game at its heart. You can choose between 4 characters (5 with DLC) with different weapons and bonuses, and each can choose other weapons and you can equip a few little bonuses that make a big difference in the game. You fight from a first person combat perspective with guns, but it's a tower defense game over all. You place walls that are low enough you can jump on top of them easily, the enemy can't pass over them (except flying enemies), you build mazes/paths to make it take longer for the enemies to get to the core (glowy thing you're trying to protect), and place towers atop the walls that will have the most time/opportunity to kill lots of baddies.In regard to the weaponry and towers, there are a bunch of weapons to choose from for combat, with quite a few of them being pretty good, and there are a lot of different types of towers. It's honestly surprising how many of them were actually good as well. You've got everything from super-powerful flying-unit-only towers to ground-only area of effect towers to towers that make mines you can manually lay out to devastate enemies, to single shot towers that deal positively insane damage across nearly the entire map...but they take forever to rearm. It's great just how many choices there are, and how many of them are actually quite good for various maps and enemies in the game.The story exists. It's okay, though nothing amazing. The story is presented in silent (no voice acting) comic-style panels before each mission. Technically, you need the two DLCs to get the rest of the story, but honestly, this is one of those games where story isn't a big deal, and very little happens plot-wise in the DLC.The graphics are nice enough with a pretty sci-fi asthetic, though humans look kinda...weird. Luckily, there aren't many of them. The music is very peaceful, ""airy"" stuff and nice to listen to while building your maze and placing your towers. There's also one of those fun digital voices you can do text-to-speech with in multiplayer, and that's good for laughs no matter how long you've seen/heard it. This game is fun alone or with friends, and I highly recommend it.			"

If you play Team Fortress 2 or any Strategy games, this game is for you.Gameplay - The game is full of surprises that will keep your attention till the last alien. The Game seems to lean more towards the First-Person shooter at the beginning of a round, then gets progressively more strategic as the waves come and go as you are able to build more towers. The combination of the two genres is almost flawless as the vast array of towers are almost identical to the character's weapon. The characters are unique yet can all be paramount to the group's success, as the player's weapons have massive firepower. In the later game, team-mates can really help.Music - The soundtrack is amazing. There have been times where I haven't started a wave, just so I could listen to the music. The waves also have their own music, so hearing the soundtrack as I blasted lumes with rockets filled me with adrenaline.Note: The Soundtrack is now available by itself as DLC.Performance & Graphics - The Game mostly quite well on an entry-level card and looks amazing, however a few config tweaks can push it to run very smoothly and look beautiful. The art style and environment is unique as the game is set on an alien planet full of forests, Loek III, which has become inhabited by humans. The lumes are unique aliens in that they are not bug-like or technologically advanced, but are strong and will do anything to destroy the player's precious core. The lumes are varied depending on their role and rank, which makes it easy to identify the difference between a walker and a walker warrior.The game is supported on PC, Mac and now Linux. Controller support is available, though I would suggest using Keyboard and mouse.If you see this game on sale, I would suggest picking it up with the Season pass. You will not be disappointed.			"

												Sanctum 2 is a very original uniqe blend of a First Person Shooter and a Tower Defense game.Before each round you take time to construct/upgrade defensive towers, paths and then protect your energy cores from the hordes of different enemies until the round is over. Along with the large selection of defensive towers that can be placed, you also have a nice selection of load outs and character perks to choose from.Desite also being a indie game this really does shine with it gameplay, artstyle and excellent asking price of $15.The game is best played with friends and Steam offers a very reasonable price on the 4-pack, which is a good idea for anyone wanting to play with friends.

												Sanctum 2 is a nice Tower Defense / First Person Shooter mix. It is good fun, especially if played with friends (up to four). It's good to discuss strategies, and you can build effective teams by choosing wisely the various characters and their abilities and guns. You level up as you play, and you discover new ways to horribly murder the various horrible monsters that the game vomits against you. If you find the game too easy for your taste, you can add ""feats of strength"" to increase the difficulty level. This also gives the game good replay value (together with its DLC/Season Pass!). Recommended! :--)			"

												Many people loved the first Sanctum, and I agree, it was the best of the series so far, this one is so far the utter downfall...let me show you the pros and consPros:Characters: Now instead of being Skye or one of her buddies, you can actually pick who you want to be, theres Skye, her sister Sweet, a Robot, a Soldier, and a Goth.Smaller maps: Kind of harder to fight in a smaller map, in Sanctum 1 you had a huge map and could make a huge layout of a area.Enemies fight back: Yes, the aliens actually fight you instead of run past you, and you do indeed have health, which means you need to start dodging them, on the upside they do go after you instead of the core, so if you want to try and lead some of them away you can.Friendly helpers: There are some random NPC's that sit around the field and will actually shoot the enemy with you, but only if they are close, some help I suppose, or if you are feeling lonely.Cons:Characters: Each character has a Preset weapon, and you can't change it, for instance the Goth girl has a Crossbow and you can pick the side arm, what if you want to be the goth girl and change her primary? Well tough cause you can'tMaps: I honestly don't like having the map be so bloody small, it feels like your in a tight space and you can't really go anywhere.Enemies: This kind of sucks honestly, yes they fight back, but you have health for gods sake, and you lose it quick.Teleport system: Guess what? They took away the teleportation, seriously what the heck? That was one of the great things about the first game, if you were in the front and the enemies were in the back you could teleport over to them if you had a teleporter and start shooting them with your towers.Death: Yes, you can die now, and guess what? If you die, you have to WAIT for a respawn, yeah, you fall off the map somehow? No teleport out, you have to wait till the respawn is doneFriendly NPC's: Well I know they can be of SOME use at times, but when they are dead they are gone, and you can actually kill them yourself, with a gun or by spawning a tower on them.Tower limit: Now this got me very angry, and annoyed, in the 1st game you could put up AS MANY towers as you wanted (Provided you had enough space and money to do so) now you have a limit, AND GUESS WHAT?! It counts for co-op too, yes, if you are in a game with 1 or more friends, the tower limit is combined, IE, if a friend puts up a cannon or a gattling gun, it counts as a tower used for you too.Boss battle: At the end of the chapter I think, there is a boss, and he can destroy EVERY, SINGLE, ONE of your towers and blockades, making all of your hard earned money basically be useless.Can't upgrade weapons: Nope, this is removed AS WELL, you can't upgrade weapons, you pick a gun, that gun stays the same, no getting it stronger or faster, or quicker reload, it's just the same all the time.Out of all the stuff they have put in and removed, I can only give this game a 4 or 5/10 It needs a lot of improvement, and it should have been kept at it's roots, not trying to branch off and be a stupid First Person Shooter clone, it should have been it's tower based shooting like it was before.

												Short Version:Did you love Sanctum? Don't dive this one expecting more of the same. First timer? Buy if you want to play a co-op FPS with TD elements.Long Version:Gameplay - As the SV says, Sct2 takes the hybrid TD/FPS of it's predecessor and pumps the FPS part of it while streamlining the TD parts so it feels more conducive to the experience. Everything is more limited, you can have towers, but not that many, you can have tower bases but mazing is limited, you get weapons, but don't choose when to upgrade them, getting a perk system that greatly affects how you are able to tackle the invading forces. The shooting part feels much better and is often more efective, especially when alined with the right perks, so you might find yourself clearing 100% of the wave by yourself, or having to because the towers are ill-equipped to do so. On a bright note, co-op'ing the game is pretty great and gives you a few more TD'ing/perk options, I had a blast clearing the campaign with friends.Story - You are now given a choice of character with different looks, motivations, fighting perks, etc. Alongside that, we are given a context to all the missions in the form of comic book style narrative before them. Playing Sct2 feels much more personal, we know what's at stake and the very decent voice acting cries out to fallen friends and critical hits alike, a big plus for the campaign mode.Sound - As a huge fan of Sct1 soundtrack I was slightly disapointed by Sct2's. It's not bad, it's just not as good, the tunes feel more repetitive and there's less gems in the rough. Still a decent fit for the game's theme.Graphics - Just like Sct1, they fit the futuristic theme the game and I have little of note to complain about, everything is, of course, more detailed.Extra note - Having invaders that destroy structures is not impossible to do in TD's, but they are not very well done here, your whole round can go to hell because your maze was destroyed and that's not fun when there's no save or checkpoint.

												Sanctum 2 is a strategy/FPS hybrid game with tower defense tied in, complimented by its exciting and catchy sci-fi soundtrack and awesome environments. In Sanctum 2, there are four characters to choose from, unlike the original Sanctum with just one. You may play as Skye Autumn, a soldier who specializes in using her assault rifle, Sweet Autumn, Skye's little sister who specializes in her missile-launching REX weapon, SiMo, a robot who specializes in its sniper rifle, and a soldier named Haigan Hawkins, who uses a shotgun. The four characters have different specialties in their passive abilities, as well.As you level up in Sanctum 2, you will gain the ability to use different perks, that give your character different boosts and buffs that can help make certain tasks easier, make combat more effective, and give the Lumes a harder time at trying to win. Eventually, when you reach the maximum level for your character, you can use any weapon that you want with any character. There is also a system called ""Feats of Strength"" that allow you to make levels harder, but in return, provide you with more experience.In Sanctum 2, just like the original Sanctum, you must defend The Core, the power source for all of your towers and for your entire base. Aliens of different forms will come and attempt to attack it, and attack you and your friends on the way. Each enemy has different strategies of attacking, and each type has different weak spots, where hits will do more damage than the hits would on the other parts of their bodies. Some of these enemies are airborne and will attack from above, and some will attack ground-level. There are also numerous bosses in Sanctum 2, and many of them can destroy your towers, leaving you to rely on your weapons and hope for the best.There are four chapters in Sanctum 2, each with four different maps, in the base-game. Each one will have different amounts of space for your tower bases, and you can arrange them however you like depending on the availability of the tiles. You and your friends must attempt to build a maze to make it so that the aliens, known as the Lumes, will have the hardest time possible attempting their reach to your Core. You must use your resources to build new towers, and upgrade old towers.Sanctum 2's environments are pretty cool, and the graphics are very nice. The soundtrack, composed by Leonard Hummer, is exciting, sci-fi, and suitable for the game, and very enjoyable to listen to on its own, as well. The gameplay is fun, and there's plenty of fun to be had with both Sanctum 2 and the original.Overall, Sanctum 2 is a fun game to play with friends, or in single-player alike, and the variation in the enemies, weapons, and towers is pretty cool. It can certainly be a difficult game at times, but it's still quite fun overall. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy games, FPS games, and tower defense games, as well as those who like sci-fi themes, and anyone who enjoyed the original Sanctum. ^.^			"

												This is a two part review. If you're seriously considering buying this, read this entirely. It will really help you out.If the words ""Planet Fusion"" don't mean anything to you, skip to the second part.Part IWhen I was growing up, there was always one game in particular that stood out as an amazing game, and that was FusionFall. Looking back on it, if one were to take away the negative CN aspects from the game, it'd be a solid (minimum) 8/10. This game essentially improves on the design of FusionFall and morphs it into a TD game. If you've ever played FF and wanted a game with a more serious version of its tone, I will always recommend this.The aesthetic of this game is very similar to parts of Downtown and Darklands. Giant spores reminiscent of the ones in the Tyrannical Gardens, gnarly trees like the ones found at the Dark Glade and beautiful scenery comparible to the Really Twisted Forest truly capture the art design that made FusionFall so memorable. And don't even get me started on the Swamp levels. Everything about those are so well designed that words can't explain them (seriously. It gives Rayman Origins a run for its money, and Origins is one of my favorite games of all time).Did I mention the music? I loved FusionFall's music, especially during the later Wilds and Darklands levels. Sanctum 2's music draws on the same influences, but of course discards any of the more cartoony bits typical of FusionFall. Again, the Swamp levels reign supreme in the music department. It's well worth getting to the Swamp sections, I promise.It is important to note that this isn't a complete copy of FusionFall and repackaged as a TD. This game has its own art style, characters, plot, gameplay, etc. In its own right, Sanctum 2 has merely adopted the art style of FusionFall and incorporated it into itself. Some parts of FF are missing: Fusion Matter, Infected Zones, Nanos (although Perks could count, the charm from having a mini caricature hovering around is non-existent here).tl;dr: Sanctum 2 is a much darker, more serious and overall better take on the concept FusionFall built around, all wrapped up into a TD. If you enjoyed FF, you will probably enjoy Sanctum 2.Part IIOutside of having the characteristics of FusionFall, Sanctum 2 does a great job standing on its own. Building on the idea of a FPS game, Sanctum 2 demands the necessity of quick thinking, advanced movement ability, and strategic logic to complete a level. This is even more true when playing with Feats of Strength: factors that make gameplay harder, but result in more XP.Like said in Part I, the aesthetics in this game is unbelievably stunning. My laptop can't run very high graphics, but even with low settings on I was still blown away by the design, feel, and mood Sanctum 2 delivers. The natural world of Giant Trees and Swamp clashing with the modern technology planted onto Loek III by humans is also an interesting touch that draws on the struggles faced during the Industrial Revolution.Gameplay is pretty simple FPS wise. Shoot things dead. Different lumes have different health stats obviously, but some are much harder to kill, however. Armorered Heavies are almost impenetrable aside from the backside, and Bobbleheads (one of the most frustrating lumes in game) can only be killed by attacking the head. Among typical lumes come with aerial enemies, including Pliskeplaskes, Spore Pods, and Spitflies that can force the player to experiment with other weapons and towers. Finally, no game would be complete without bosses, and Sanctum 2 is no stranger. Several bosses make prominent features: Hoverer Queens, giant forms of Hoverers; Walker Patriarchs, giant Walkers that can destroy blocks; and Super Heavies: giant Armored Heavies that shoot laser eyes that destroy anything in their path. Besides this, some other giants loom within the game, but I won't spoil the entirety of it ;)With towers and weapons, Sanctum 2 is full of them. Rifles, giant tasers, and rocket launchers are all at the player's disposal. When it comes to towers, there's essentially one for every niche. Drones can pierce armor, Violators can put a massive dent in monsters with large pools of health, and Slow Field Dispensers make monster move slower, which can be a life saver.Character development is also a pretty nice feature in game too. While Skye tends to be an arrogant prick half the time, she is a pretty good leader and a bond is almost always made with any player. Sweet is the much more innocent version of Skye and resonates well those not fond of vulgarity or pomposity. SiMo is a war machine that in the comics is seen as a sort of a father figure to all characters, even Skye. Haigen is a quiet but confident man that likes a challenge - both against lumes and against authority, but always works well with the others.The maps in this game are truly a sight to behold. This is where all those amazing graphics and artwork are. Each level forces the player to think about every aspect of their game play - their character (which I will talk about in the next paragraph), weapons, towers, and their maze design. The main goal is to defend cores that power various objects on Loek III. Each core starts with 4,000 health, and depending on the setup, this is either a lot, or not enough.Each character has their own advantages of using them. Skye does 2% more damage per successive shot, stacking up to 50 times. She can also double jump, which is what got me into playing her most (even though I really play more like SiMo or Haigen). Sweet can rocket jump if the player uses the REX, has more air control, jumps higher, and sets enemies on fire. SiMo has 60% less spread and does more damage on critical hits than any other character, and that also stacks as well. Haigen has far more health then the other characters and gets a 35% damage bonus if he's within reach of the enemy.Now time for the complaints. I love this game, I really do. No game is perfect however.A lot of the time, this game feels grindy, especially during the later levels. There are a lot of different types of lumes in the game, but only a few make an appearance during a wave, and sometimes not a lot of them show up in a single map.The level system in Sanctum 2 really could've used a far larger number than 50. I say could've as the game has been out for almost four years now, and players at level 50 would all essentially have to start from 0 to get the highest level possible. I say 0 not technically, but metaphorically, as 50 is the highest level one can get. When in multiplayer, Level 50s can be deceptive. One could progress through the entire game, and start from the beginning using all five Feats of Strength, and make it an eighth of the way through and reach level 50. I've played with Levels 50s that are amazing at their craft, and ones who spam Orbitals nonstop and wonder why they can't progress. A much larger level system is something I personally would like (this was also a problem in Fusion Fall, but with 36).Another thing I wish could happen is regular updates. I discovered Sanctum 1 in the summer of 2013, and while I never had the chance to buy it until 2015, I fell in love with the design. I bought Sanctum 2 instead, and was amazed at the work put into it. However, writing this review in 2017, it has been 3 years since the last update, and I wish more work could be put into it. I can't blame CSS though, Sanctum 2 is pretty much as good as it can get. Some balancing would be nice, but like a game I play a lot, TF2, I guess there isn't much else to update.So that's my review. I absolutely love this game! I'd recommend it to any FPS player that's getting bored of typical FPS game play. Even without DLC (which I did buy at the same time as Sanctum 2), this is an all around great game. I recommend getting the DLC, which doubles the size of the content in game. If I had to rate Sanctum 2, at LEAST 80/100. Get this game.			"

												It *does* fix that in Sanctum 1 your hand weapons were completely ineffectual (save the freeze gun) by the late waves, bizzarely *losing* the ability to upgrade them in the process. I can maybe see that the tower base limits were to force you to build incrementally, rather than splurge all your money on building the maze up-front, although for many maps they just don't give you enough of them. The tower limit is at least perhaps an intent to make you form concentrated kill-zones, rather than just carpeting the map with scatter lasers. It's still got rocket-jumping. For one character.A lot is missing. Holo blocks. Floor tiles. The overview map you could put beacons on. Televators. A final map which isn't one miserable luck-based will-the-boss-be-distracted-or-just-carve-a-beeline-through-my-defenses difficulty spike.But the real reason for the big, red thumbs-down is persistent unlocks. For a PvE co-op game they are utterly stupid, since if any of your friends don't want to spend the requisite hours grinding missions over and over with difficulty feats enabled, they're going to be less effectual and have fewer choices than you, and thus have a less fun experience. Stupid, stupid, stupid.			"

												As a whole, Sanctum 2 feels confused. It isn't quite as much tower defense as fans of the first game would probably hope for, since more of the emphasis this time around is placed on the first-person shooting element. It also hides way too much information from the player, leading to a lot of guess-and-check strategies. The game remains a refreshing hybrid of genres, however, and many of the frustrations temporarily wash away as you lay witness to the last enemy in the last wave die, proving that your strategic planning and accurate shooting have paid off.It looks like Sanctum and it sounds like Sanctum, but it plays totally differently. While the more devoted fans of the first game might take issue with a lot of the changes, and while it doesn't match up to that game's heights, there's still some things to enjoy in Sanctum 2.			"

												In short, Sanctum 2 is what happens when tower defense meets first person. Imagine playing Starcraft sunken D with Jim Raynor randomly standing around somewhere, except you're dead smack in Raynor's shoes looking through his visor. Besides being physically appealing, Sanctum 2 delivers, to say the least, some diverse and varied game play thanks to it's FPS incarnation. The primary objective in the maps is to keep enemies away from destroying your power core. Enemies come in varied shapes, forms, sizes, and abilities. The most annoying enemies are the flying ones that seem to ignore tower/brick placements. Other enemies can be small and quick or large and slow. The big enemies all have a certain sweet spot you need to shoot in order to take them down accordingly. The characters within the game (4 all together) all have differing abilities but are more or less the same in strength. I personally chose the girl with the double jump ability because you can't beat jumping in mid air and defying gravity. Their weapons also differ and special. The more shots my character successfully lands on an enemy means the more damage the subsequent bullet will deal. Besides normal rate of firing, the character also has a secondary firing system for their weapons which can be triggered by pressing RB. Alternatively, players can swap between two weapons as seen in Halo series. The secondary weapon also has the ability for alternative fire. Tower bases can be placed in certain locations (as seen on the HUD mini map), and actual gun towers cannot be placed freely. Bases guide enemies and only a certain amount is given every wave. Gun and base combinations are possible but only if bases are available. Unlike starcraft multi player defense games, not every base can host a tower. Tower's cost a pretty penny by themselves, the player also has to take into consideration whether to install a new tower or to upgrade an old one. Some of the tower types include a gunner, a shock proximity sort of machine, a tower that slows enemies down (very handy), gatling gun, and not limited to rockets. Graphics are pretty spot on and resemble a cross between Cloudbuilt, Borderlands and Call of Juarez. Sounds do immerse one into the game and gun fire sounds somewhat futuristic and accurate. The towers make different noises depending which one you install and the enemies all sound like their a bat out of hell. I should mention the heads-up display (HUD) has been done with great care. It is hard to keep track of towers and which way enemies will go, there is a minimap provided to show you the route in which enemies take, which also shows where your blocks/towers are and at what level your towers are at. This is insanely handy.Overall a good game with a decent price. I would highly recommend the purchase on sale. I personally like it for taking a step in a daring direction. It isn't easy to mix a tower defense and FPS concept together.

												""FPS and TD Games doesn't match!!"" -a generic ""Gamer"" on my class that plays a lot of Web based TD Games.Don't listen to my classmate, play this even if you maxed all your towers, some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ monster will slip through it's defenses and ruin your gameplay.Sanctum is the ONLY Tower defense game i enjoyed and spending many hours poured into it, and fun with friends! Sanctum 2 is a more challanging version of the first one, Yes you get Less waves than the 1st one, but the game limits you, forcing you to choose the most efficient way to protect your core with a limited ammount of resources, and of course choosing the right class/ character and tower sets is the best way you can achieve victory!If you Bought All the DLCs you Get TWICE of sanctum 2 and new weapons , towers, maps, enemies, perks and a new character. Basically, it have more replayability than the first one.If you're Still reading this. Stop reading and buy this game!.....and the DLCUPDATE 1/25/2014 DLC 1 REVIEWOkay i recently beat the game and played ""The Road to Elysion"" DLC, it adds 2 new weapons, 4 maps, and perks that i'm too lazy to count, therefor you get an extra 1/4 of the original game also you get a new character to play with.You get TSYGAN As a new playable core guardian, equipped with a crossbow, the maps requires a lot of thinking but if you tag along with another player or more (lv 20+ is recomennded) it's so. Much. Chaos.UPDATE 7/27/2014 DLC 3 REVIEWAfter a couple of months not playing this game, i decided to beat the 3rd DLC. ""The Persuit"" DLC is basically gives you another 2 new weapons and 4 new stages, with some perks as well.Also This DLC Gives you the First cutscene of the game. THE FIRST CUTSCENE.The weapons and towers are the highlights of this DLC. First The most popular weapon and the most unique weapon in the game: The drone launcher. With the abillity to shoot Little planes and detonate them if you want, And then we have the Granade launcher. a standalone version of the Default Assault rifle's Secondary shot. the towers you get is a Mind control tower and a ""Friendship Laser/tower"" that's more powerful if you deploy them next to each otherUPDATE 2/7/2014 DLC 4 REVIEWAlright, Beaten the 4th DLC, The ""Last Stand"" DLC have 4 Challanging Maps, 2 new towers, and 2 new guns, and some perks. This DLC Is between easy and hard, unless you're Level 37+ This should be a piece of cake for you. The new stuff that's in this DLC is More Aerial Enemies, And a Mountable Turret called ""Rolfinator"" it's a Player controlled turret that only fires 20 powerful shots, but that doesn't make it easy, Aerial Enemies Are Far Weaker and easier to kill, But they're on a higher altitude and comes in large swarms (usually 20 or more) Some of the Music From the first Sanctum can be heard playing when the wave starts, Luckily You get a special tower that easily kills aerial targets, The weapons are useful too, But i'm already spoiling much spoilers so...this dlc is pretty awesome.

												Most people who play tower defense games, mostly asscoiate themselves with such games as: 'Bloons Tower Defense' or 'Hands of War'. But i never thought of an innovation where 'You' the player can become part of the game not only buy placing towers and defenses as you would traditionaly, but being placed right in the middle of the battle zone. FPS/Tower Defense combo genre...... a wierd sounding genre but works ever so well. 'Problem taking down the tank? Be sure to shoot it in the butt' I have never played the original but I am still happy that I was able to find this game and end up fully enjoying it, I enjoy tower defense games but this sense of innovation the developers have put into the game make this feel like a whole new genre to gaming both solo and co - op.Just like a tower defense game you set up your defenses and then when you think you are fully fortified and that nothing can get past your defences, you unleash the wave........ either to find your defences are OP or that you have planned your defences every so wrong and the enemies simply walk past your defences taking minimal casualties, normally you would say 'Game Over'.....BUT..... you play a much bigger part with this being and FPS too. You and/or your teamates can work together to stop them from getting to your core and giving yourself time to learn and rethink your defences for the next wave.There are many ways to customize your hero to suit your needs for defence and offense, offering combinations of weapons, towers and perks to further aid your defences. The environments are super detailed with its futuristic new world feeling the views are amazing on full graphics and full FOV. If you say since you have a bigger role in the game maybe it is easier, I assure you it is not any easier as you must not only defend the base and core but also yourself. Aliens will go for you if you are in their way and this makes it a great challenge for a team of friends to play. If you work well together and need a bigger challenge the game does offer 'feats of strength' acting like mutators buffing the aliens to make the game harder: increased health, faster movement speed, and faster attacks all make the game a bigger challenge.Overall I would never have found and played this game if it were'nt for it going on sale but I must say this game is worth its price and i would recommend you get it if mostly you have friends to play it with cause the games main strength is its co - op.

												Pros:+Not your usual Tower Defense game.+A large amount of maps, at least half of them with unique layouts that require differen strategies to beat.+A fair amount of different enemies, some with unique traits or weakspots, especially on the DLCs.+Choice of perks and weapons can really make the play experience of each map different.+Fair amount of playtime, around 30-40 hours if you include the DLCs (which fortunately ain't very expensive), more if you are going for the Feats achievements.+Text to voice chat which can be quite amusing during group play.+A sorta decent story with cool comic-like presentation. Not the best thing ever but it works fine.+Perhaps not something meaningful for other people, but being a Coop game where you actually have to work together with your allies rather than shoot them on the face as any FPS is a big pro for me.Cons-Some turrets can be... well, entirely useless, while others become more or less a must have for most of the maps (ex: Violator), ruining in some way the porpuse of having a wide variety of turrets.-When playing with others, if you have a lvl 30+ player join with new players or low level ones, the player with high level can make many of the first half of maps trivial or way too easy.Veredict:While it is not the perfect game or one to call ""game of the year!"" or similar, it is a fun game to play if you have nothing better to, even more if you have friends to play it with and its not an expensive one at that (and it often goes on sale here on Steam).

												Sanctum 2 is a unique concept that utilizes the tower defense genre to deliver a satisfying fresh experience, Sanctum 2 cleaned up and made the overall mechanics more efficient compared to Sanctum 1, the graphics were inproved and more content was included (more through DLC content). Sanctum 2 includes a interesting plot that you may continue to look into further if you desire however the gameplay is where the game shines as the game is very enjoyable and offers alot of variation when it comes to maps, characters and potential towers and their placement. You get conplete freedom over your arsenal this includes swapping weapons, perks, characters and appearance (optional skin pack). Sanctum 2 difficulty levels vary and add interesting new effects to make your experience more thrilling. Overall Sanctum 2 deserves a 8/10			"

												I was a bit skeptical about this game. At first, it appeared to be a simple tower defense game, where you can fight in as well. But I have to say, I'm pleasantly surprised.The tower defense bit I can be simple about: It's your basic tower defense. Machine guns, high damage guns, slowdown turrets, those kinda weapons are available, and all upgradable. You can buy them with credits you earn through gameplay. You place these guns on blocks, that you can use to lay out the path for the enemy to follow.For the ingame fighting, you can choose from 4a5 characters to play, which basically determines your main weapon: Shotgun, sniper, machinegun. By leveling you get access to more weapons and other stuff. Although the weapons are not upgradable, you can use perks to increase their damage.But it's the versatility of the in-game combat that give it that little bit extra that makes it interesting. You can engage some enemies, so they attack you and can be lured away from the path. Some enemies have higher damage points on their bodies, for extra damage, if you can hit it. Some perks can really help in killing off those enemies. In short, it's not just simple shooting that has been added, it gives it that little extra that makes you wanna play the game some more, just to try out those little extra perks or weapons, to see if you can get further.There is 4 player coop, where all resources can be shared freely.And graphically, it's ok. I do like how they added the little men to fight with you. They suck at combat, but it's a little extra that gives the game a 'face'.Basically, if you like tower defense and FPS, you'll like this. "

												A great game, in my opinion. The design and concept are lovely, and I always enjoy smaller game companies. I used to adore tower defense games in my earlier years, but after I discovered Steam, I started to drift away from the tower defense games I'd play online. I started to play more FPS-Type games such as Gmod, Half-Life 2, and TF2. One day I closed a steam game, and was greeted with the exciting sight of a steam news window. Scrolling through it, I came across a ""newly released"" page featuring Sanctum 2. All I remember was that the picture had Skye on it, and I thought ""Oh, this is interesting character design. I'll check this out."" (Yes, I'm a sucker for gingers.) So I watched the trailer, then eagerly waited for the demo to download. I bought the full game shortly after clearing the demo, and I was not disappointed.A note for those with less-than-behemoth GPU's, since the creators don't have a huge amount of resources availible, they don't have all that much spare time for graphical optimization, so it may get a bit choppy with the higher settings.TL;DR: Cute gingers, strong female characters, perfect genre (For me, at least.) And shiny art style. 11/10 would buy again.			"

												Have you ever wanted to talk/rap in Stephen Hawkings voice?Now you can.While the first Sanctum focused more on the Tower defense part the first person shooter aspect suffered/ was barely there. enemies didnt react to the play, Sanctum 2 focuses this time around on the first person shooter aspect which shines not only compared to the first Sanctum but is great itself, because of the variety when it comes to enemies and their ablities and your weaponry to actually counter these.Enemies are going to have Shields, heavy armor, long range, long range aoe, stun towers around them, revive themselves and many more.Ofcourse there are many towers to counter these specific enemy types aswell, for example: -Drones are able to pierce through any armor but the deploy rate is pretty low, -The gatling tower has an incredible fire rate and is actually devastating to enemies that take more damage over time and smaller foes but doesnt even scratch enemies with armor, -The cannon starts of as a tower with decent damage and range and by upgrading it the firerate decreases for a huge attack and range boost which allows the tower to pierce through specific armor.Your abilities are also quite game changing, these vary from skills that allow you to either pick from passive abilities like core heal to abilities which increase your fire rate up to 200% (you can choose up to three perks which change the way you play drastically, either changing the role you play completely or further supporting it).You are also able to choose between four characters which all come with their own unique abilities, strenghts and weaknesses:-Setting enemies on fire and dealing damage over time depending on the damage you dealt while also gaining the ability to make moves such as strafing easier to perform (crowd controle-much harder to do critical hits/to take down enemies with specific armor)-Increased health and increased damage in close quarters (kiting/heavy foe killer-not as useful against enemies with specific armor),-The ability to double jump and deal more damage with each shot (allround character-depending on your weaponry and skills)-Besides gaining more critical hit damage you also do more damage if you hit critical hits in a row while the spray pattern´s accuracy for all weapons is increased greatly  (heavy foe killer, best at taking down enemies with specific types of armor-gets overun quite easily)Combine that with absolutely beautiful looking maps which let you play the way you want to (in terms of deploying your maze which enemies have to go through and also depending on enemy type and the tower themselves) and you have this game.but seriously if i could choose one game which i would play for the rest of my life, it would be this one.

												Amazingly deep and smart game. Seems eazy at first glance, but feels really complex and vast at rank 50. The variety of character unique features, perks, weapons and towers allows you to comunicate, plan and make decisions with other players from the moment you've selected a map. But that's only the complexity of gameplay. Sanctum 2 gives you a story and a world with it's own legend. The story is told in comic book style before every next map, and character personalities are filled with dialogs, your imagination and their in-game voices and phrases. What really surprised me in this game was how vast most of the maps turned out to be. It's not just the play zone, the battlefield, you can explore the world beyond the marked field on minimap. And that's where you discover another side of the game, which rewards your awareness with not just additional supplies, but with extra plot, funny little minigames and simply glorious views. As much as Unreal Engine 3 can be beautiful, game makes sure to deliver. If you aren't in the mood to think through defences, give your resources to your friend and simply enjoy the view and explore the map with mild relaxing electronic music. This game is a marvelous example of what the smart co-op game can be.Now to the downside. The great big problem of the DLC era. This is really bad way to make DLCs. It's good when they expand and extend the plot of the game, but not this time. DLCs are supposed to be optional, but for some reason the basic game ships with half of the plot (4 chapters) and leaves you with a big cliffhanger (but not as big as HL2EP2 had ;) ). So each one of the DLCs adds a new chapter to the game (5th-8th chapters), allows to unlock new towers and weapons. Yes, you've read right, you need to by DLC to get the full game. Except for Britech Skin Pack, this just adds alternative models for 4 basic characters (no extra skin for Tsygan). So in the end, these DLCs are not optional, you will definitely miss out on some fun things if you don't own them.			"

												Sanctum 2 takes FPS and TD gameplay, stuffs it into a blender, and mixes the hell out of it.Out comes a unique gameplay experience, providing both intense gunplay and tactical management that must be used effectively in order to overcome the obstacles ahead of the player.It manages to do so with grace, and it even stacks tons of great features on top on it, such as:Adjustable difficulty, ranging from beating the level with a single hand, to violently throwing the keyboard across the room, hitting your mexican cousin.Tons of easter eggs. No, really. There's atleast two-three per level. Like the screaming diarrhea man stuck in the toilet in the swamp level. (I'm not kidding.)Absolutely fantastic visual design. The stages are set out a incredibly well-crafted scenery, displaying details and surroundings  at the same level as Mirror's Edge.Fantastic co-op, giving you double the amount of towers, perks, abillities, and fun, as well as sharing the experience with your friends.And more stuff i couldn't think of because i'm busy playing the game.Great game overall, really ascended it's quality over the previous game.Get it with a friend if you really want to get the most out of it.

Everything is well blanced and buying the DLC is very much worth as many people will tell you. Plenty of pros and pretty much no cons. My only suggestion to you devs is to simply change it to where you can level indefinitly so players can show off their level. you dont have to add and perks, though is would be welcomed very much. to me, once you reach level 50 you kind of drift away from the game, but if you added continued leveling i think mre payers would stay playing longer because they would be able to kep leveling and really show how much they pay the gameAbove all: 9.5/10 Very great game to add to any collection			"

												I love this game. Me and my friend play it for fun because it just rubs our chesthairs the right way. I do find myself slightly excited by the game because some of these looms (enemies) resemble very arrousing features. For example the bobble heads, giant, three legged towering creatures with glowing, pulsating bumps on the top, the mutator, another short, stimpy, three legged creature that squirts out gooey white substance that ""mutates"" other looms. The flying things that spit green balls out at you slightly resemble the Andre The Giant Obey picture. Idk why. And to top it all off, the flying things resemble either squidward or the flying spaghetti monster. Anyways, it's a great game. Creds to the guy that made those exciting figures. ;) Looking forward to a sequel with monsters featuring more exciting things. SANCTUM IS LOVE. SANCTUM IS LIFE.			"

												Sanctum 2, is a great multiplayer/singleplayer game. The purpose of this game is to defend a core located usally at the rear of the map, from the evil alien creatures. The players use firearms and as well as turrets to defend the core from the aliens. What i like about this game is that, it s not too hard or too easy on most difficulty modes and is very fun and enjoyable to play with friends. I recommend this for all users and worth buying it. I rate it 8/10			"

												This game is very unique and fun to play and even better the genre and game type haven’t been oversaturated like most other have games have. I have had this game for a while now and bought it due to a sale and it seemed like a good game and I wasn’t mistaken. The point of this game is to protect the core/s (the giant device that is providing oxygen to the area) from the Lumes (the enemies that are attacking the core) using towers and your primary and secondary weapons. Although I can’t tell the difference between the base game and all the DLC packs (since I bought the full pack when I bought the game initially) the game has around 20 towers that are advantageous in specific situations and 14 guns that can deal with one specific Lume easier than another and lots of perks to give you the added benefit over others. The map count is also very large at around 30 maps and the maps themselves are ginormous in some cases while normally the maps are still quite large. There are three game types to choose from in the game and these are just the regular protect the core game, the FOS (feat of strength which is commonly abbreviated to FOS) version of the protect the core game which adds specific perks for the Lumes like enemies attack twice as fast, players cannot respawn during the wave but they can after, enemies regenerate 150 hit points per second, enemies move faster, enemies have 50% more hit points each wave round (Wave rounds are about 4 to 5 waves long and is the time for the wave to add more health to the enemy (If that specific FOS is turned on)), and survival which is to play the protect the core game mode for an infinite amount of waves with the waves getting harder each wave round (as FOS are added as you gain waves and that one of the FOS cause the upgrade of Lume health per wave rounds). The way to survive in this game is to shoot the Lumes dead using your primary and secondary weapon and during the building phase you can build/upgrade/overcharge your towers to keep you alive for longer and also becomes a lot more essential in survival as if you have survived long enough then the Lumes health becomes too high for your guns to make a difference and hence the game then relies on your towers very heavily.Pros-Lots of content (towers, maps, Lume types, perks, weapons)-Maps are ginormous-Replay value-Game genre combination -Weak spots on Lumes -Maps visually vary quite majorly-The amazing text-to-speech (that should be in every game)-The art design for everything in the game (weapons, towers, maps, etc) is superb -Very few bugs (however when they occur it’s bloody hilarious)Cons-Smaller community then most games ()-No longer receives any updates-The story (that is represented by small comics) is very small-Some complain of the weapon taking up too much of their screen (but I think it’s fine)ConclusionOverall this game to me is a gem that is often overlooked and due to that the games popularity suffers (http://steamcharts.com/app/210770) however I have thoroughly enjoyed it and I have gifted this game to 4-5 other people because I support the game so much. I recommend this game for people who like tower defense games, people who love beautiful games, and people who love strategy or strategising.			"

												This game is one of my all-time favorite games. I really can't say when the last time I enjoyed a game this much was. The sanctum series really took the tower defense genre is a great direction, and the feel, look, and sound of the game is stellar. The soundtrack alone is enough for me to recommend you checking it out, but thankfully this game is much more than just a beautiful package.You've got a variety of towers, characters, passives, and weapons to select from, and each of them matters. The character you pick determines what primary you bring, but you get to choose a secondary along with it, and that secondary can be the primary of another character. Synergy is the name of the game, so there's a lot of fun to be had experimenting with different strategies for different maps and enemies. Each character plays differently and brings their own unique passive, and most every weapon, tower, and passive plays a vital role in how you effectively play the game. Stronger weakpoint hits? Looks like you'll want to bring a strong accurate weapon to abuse weakpoints while you bring another tower to make up for your lack of heavy AoE. Or maybe you'd like to bring a strong single target primary, AoE secondary, and bring only utility towers to supplement your weaponry.The amount of experimentation that you can do in this game, along with the wide map variety and consistently fantastic soundtrack really kept me enjoying this game for dozens and dozens of hours. I've bought it every time it's been on sale just so I have copies to give to friends. I love this game that much.			"

This is a long review so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend Sanctum 2 skip to Results and read from there.Coffee Stain Studious pushes the tower defense series with this brilliant addition to the Sanctum series. Sanctum 2 takes the brilliant aspects from the first one and pushes it further with a much more dynamic and fluid campaign. Story:On the planet of Loek III an infestation begins. An alien species, which is actually burrowed into the planet has awoken and it is the job your squad to stop them. Skye Autumn, Sweet Autumn, SiMo, Haigen Hawkins, and Tsygan form a squad and work to protect the cores from collapsing. The cores defend and power the cities, but it’s not long till you figure out that they cores are not everything they seem. Campaign:The original campaign includes four sectors each composed of four missions. The sectors include: Facility, Rocky Fields, Giant Trees, and Swamp. In each of these sectors you must complete a tower defense on a strategic field, using one of the five playable heroes. The game defaults to open party meaning anyone can join your game, but you can switch it to private if you want to play alone. I always found Tower Defenses to be a single player event, unless you operate separate lanes, as clashing strategies can ruin the games value. The campaign allows you to add “Feats of Strength” which increase the difficulty, but also add to the XP bonus from each round. In order to complete the game 100% you must complete each map with all five Feats of Strength (excluding Introduction). I played Sanctum by myself and found I was rarely playing the FPS portion after the first level, although by adding Feats of Strength you will no longer be able to sit around and watch. The levels have lots of secrets hidden within them including arcade machines or even just random little subsections. The campaign essentially constitutes the entire game as there is no sandbox option. Gameplay:Unlike traditional Tower Defenses Sanctum offers you the chance to jump in as an FPS to help control creep flow. Each map you complete offers you XP which allows you to level up your squad, unlike in a traditional RPG fashion no matter who you play in Sanctum all the squad members are the same level. As you progress through the game this means you unlock new towers, better weapons, and special abilities. The towers and the weapons are not equal, so as you progress through the game you’ll probably find yourself using the same kit. Eventually when you reach level 40 you unlock both weapons allowing you to select both of the characters weapons making only their abilities matter. Luckily the vast amount of character customization allows you to play the game however you desire.DLC:Sanctum 2 has four game content DLC packs: The Last Stand, The Pursuit, Ruins of Brightholme, and Road to Elysion. These DLC packs include four sectors: Coastline, Brightholme, Outskirts, and Arc Islands. These essentially double the length of the campaign and sixteen new missions. The story of Sanctum 2 is actually not over after the initial campaign is completed and in order to figure out exactly what happens on Loek III you must finish the DLC. After completing sector four, Swamp, you are left off exactly where the DLC begins. Each DLC pack is $3.99, which is actually quite expensive seeing as it adds very little content (a couple enemies and a few new maps). The Last Stand, Arc Islands, offers a level with essentially unlimited waves that get progressively more difficult. If you were looking for essentially a sandbox mode, this would be the closest you can get. Multiplayer:The game is default multiplayer, this means that when you start your campaign anyone can join you on your mission and help you out. I didn’t realize this until after I started and some random person was in my mission. As a result I backed out kicked them out of my part and changed my game settings to private. For those who are interested Sanctum 2 multiplayer offers an incredibly easy multiplayer system that is almost flawless. Results:If you are a fan of First Person Shooters then Sanctum 2 is a good game for you. If you are a fan of tower defenses then Sanctum 2 is a good game for you. Sanctum 2 is a fun game which offers strategy and action bundled together as you defend a core objective from waves of minions. The DLC adds additional missions to the game, which if you can get on a sale are completely worth it. The character customization and leveling system really allows you to choose how you play the game. Despite not having unlimited blocks like the original, Sanctum 2, requires you to focus on short-term strategy at the start then eventually long-term as you progress past the first few waves. I would recommend Sanctum 2 for anyone who felt like the original lacked in FPS and character development. Pros:+Character customization+Smooth and clean graphics+Large variety of minions that require you to be diverse.+Loads of maps+DLC which adds more levels, story, and enemies.+Great multiplayer+FPS as well as TD+Secrets in levels+Great level design+Bosses which change the dynamic of the maze design.+Various levels which require different strategies (FPS intensive vs TD intensive)+On map allies (they may not do much damage, but it looks nice to have some teammates)+You can upgrade towers beyond their maximum level, essentially increasing there damage beyond the upgrade levelsCons:-After beating Sanctum 2, The Last Stand, you cannot skip the credits. -Multiplayer is defaulted on-There is no just plain simple sandbox map-You are limtied to the number of base bricks you can place (you get anywhere from 5-15 per wave) but eventually you start geting 0-You can only place around 15 towers per map (this varies on the map I believe). -You can no longer upgrade your weapons (although they seem to scale by themselves)-To get 100% essentially requires co-operative play.

												I have over 100 hours on record, have beat the game with (almost) all feats of strength, (was) on the leaderboard for several survival records, have all DLC, and am the top level you can get, and I still have fun with this game. Sanctum 2 never gets old, and it is a great game with many different strategies that can be tested, and you will find that one strategy one player uses doesn't work for another. It's up to you to find your own strategy, and you will find singleplayer is a heck of a lot different than multiplayer. This game is a challenge, yet a fun one. I enjoy this sequel even more than the original Sanctum. Sanctum 2 has a whole lot of content available that all lead to more awesome. 10/10			"

												Being a huge Sanctum 1 enthusiast, I was really looking forward to Sanctum 2, so it came as a real shock when I started playing and realised that the developers have completely changed the flavour of the game. By placing limitations on the towers, they have destroyed the tower defence part of the game and made it a pretty much standard shooter. It’s still a fun game to play, and is priced realistically, but I’m afraid that people who played Sanctum 1 may well be very disappointed with the step away from tower defence.  Is it recommended? Well as long as you can clear you mind of Sanctum 1, then yes, but if you can't do that, then give it a miss.			"

It does perfectly fullfil my expectations!New towers and new maps, but also new mechanics and a brand new gameplay : Sanctum 2 is even more addicting than the first game, and the price is so cheap that it would be a crime not to try this game if you liked the first. Although it's perfectly playable solo (incredibly hard, too), I highly recommend you to play with at least a friend or two. Cooperation is such a great experience in Sanctum !Oh, and I strongly recommend to get the Season Pass ! The four DLC's will expand the base content with twice its current amount of maps, a bunch of new towers, new weapons, new perks, and new characters, and it's not expensive at all for what it gives.

												I love most FPS games and I use to love Tower Defense games back in the day. When I seen they made a hybrid FPS/TD game I just had to try it. This is the first time I ever played this type of game and I have to say it's one of them games I never get tired of! I catch myself always going back and playing it here and there after owning it for some time now. I bought the complete pack for myself and the 4 pack and sent 3 other copies to friends that never play it and still have a copy in my inventory lol. I am sure the coop side of this game is even more fun but I cannot say for myself since I don't have many friends that play it. The game has tons of levels to play as well as several different modes like survival, waves, campaign, etc.. You earn XP and build your level to unlock more weapons and perks so you can customize your player to best fit your play style! With friends this can really come in handy to build the ultimate defense team with many different perks.			"

Story: 2.5/5The general curse of an FPS game is lack of plot and Sanctum is very scarcely different. It will relay a comic book-style preamble before every encounter but you will mostly find yourself more worried about the map layout of the upcoming battle than the story itself and in the end I think most peopel aren't going to know the story behind the Core Guardians at all. Though those of you who do, aren't going to think it's anything to write home about - I didn't anyway. Gameplay & Controls: 5/5Assuming you're using mouse and keyboard (because why would you use a game pad for a FPS...?) the control setup is what you might call standard, but it's called standard for a reason - it works. The pace of each map is always scaled perfectly in my opinion and each time you start a new encounter the difficulty scales well, whether you're playing with friends or on your own. I will say Sanctum will test you - even if you're the type to hunt up tower placement strategies with a little Google Fu you're still going to have to be up to snuff with your shooter skills - Sanctum 2 will send enemies that will reflect fire, take several minutes to take down, and can even destroy your towers from multiple directions. And while it's easy to predict what comes from where and what you should have readied in defense, a lot of the time the enemy AI isn't static. Which is a good thing. No stale battles here!Music & Sound: 4/5While the menu music is a bit of a snooze the in game battle tunes really set a mood well - prog electro and D&B compliment Sanctum's futuristic theme perfectly. There are times with REX you will have to endure a plethora of stacked explosion sounds however as well as some of the tower and enemy sound effects. Visuals:  3.5/5The biggest gripe I have with how the game looks is in a few of the stages the lighting will be so intense it will seem like you're trying to engage in a staring contest with a star from 5 feet away through a magnifying glass though the environments, character and monster designs and weaponry of the game are beautiful. The menus and maps are nicely done as per the theme of the game though foregoing things like grass and physical damage for textures is a bit of a letdown, it's not too terribly noticable.Overall: 4/5Sanctum is a very unique blend of first person shooter and tower defense, and the first of it's kind even. There are even some bits and bobs of RPG thrown in there with the games leveling system, though they work really well. If you've played the original you'll note how much has improved in the series thus far and that gets a major amount of respect from me (mainly because I made the mistake of playing the second installment first and had to backpedal into something I felt really couldn't match up.) The highly customizable pre-battle outfittings and DLC maps and overall difficulty of the game (which can be augmented with Feats of Strength, which are kind of like handicaps and modifiers to make the difficulty even more trying) make it one I can constantly play over and over again. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a different kind of shooter.			"

												This game is strange in a few aspects. First, it doesn't tell you anything (or, if it does, hides it quite well). A few examples: Apparently I've completed 63% of the first zone, after finishing it. The completionist I am, I would now like to get 100% completion there. But I don't know how, because the game doesn't tell me how completion is achieved, though I assume by finishing the levels without damage to the core. However, there is no indicator in which level I have how much progression.Another example is the interface in levels. In this kind of game you will have quite a full interface, and I found the map being very well done. However, there seems to be no information to the player's health. The next wave is announced by presenting the icons of the enemies approaching, paired with how many will appear. As someone who just started this game, this doesn't tell me anything (""Oh, these are fliers..."" or ""Oh, those things have a ranged attack...""). It is propably enough if you know the game well, but the enemy design is not distinguished enough to make this easy.The second thing really bothering me is the shooting, which is just not fun for me. When you empty the magazine of one weapon and switch to your secondary, the game automatically reloads (after some time) the first weapon. This leads to situations where you would usually only use one weapon (e.g. if you want splash damage, which only one of your weapons has), but it's more effective to empty the magazine of one weapon, switch weapons, empty magazine, switch, and so on. This is quite dull and unsatisfying.These are the main reasons why I just can not recommend Sanctum 2. The first things mentioned are just things I expect from a tower defense game to be any good, the second point is something which totally spoils the action part for me.The game has some really nice aspects, for example the choice of four different characters, which play quite differently, a nice selection of towers, secondary weapons, and perks giving you advantages/disadvantages. I think you get these things too fast, which hinders motivation a bit and takes away the possibility to use all the new things you have obtained, as in the beginning you are rewarded with too many to try them all out. The progression is a bit off here. The game also is not too easy (which is positive, I have to add), you need to build a decent maze to survive. However you are quite limited, as you can only build on certain parts of the map. A positive point I found: You have two patches of ressources, bases and money. You use bases to build the maze, and money for the actual towers, sitting on top of the bases. Therefore you don't have to compromise between having a nice maze and having decent firepower, which is a great concept.My direct comparison for this game are the Orcs must die-games, and those do most of the stuff in this game better. You don't build mazes in Orcs must die and have no shooter-aspect, but everything else is done equally good or better in my opinion; even the combat is more enjoyable there. If you don't mind the things I mentioned above and prefer the FPS-Shooter elements to Third-person action, give Sanctum 2 a try; otherwise avoid this and maybe think about getting Orcs must die, if you haven't already.

Cant lvl up your guns anymore, you get a few building blocks every turn, that you can put stuff on top or make a maze, if you fall off the map you cant re-spawn until the end of wave, that has cost me a game.

												   Sanctum 2 is a hybrid of the tower defense and first-person shooter genre. It runs in a 3D environment and posseses a stylized aesthetics. Based on the peer 2 peer system, sanctum 2 allows you to play solo with a perfect ping or join existing rooms of other players that are set to public, with a max of 4 players per room. The game also has a unique and captivating story as well as characters for those who are interested in these things. The soundtrack aint half bad either.   This game offers a variety of gameplay styles due to the abundance of perks or passives and different types of towers both made available as you level up. This is accompanied by unique character classes that offer a specialized approach to gameplay. For example, Simo is a sniper class that has better accuracy (less spread of bullets), and deals more damage on weakspots. It is also possible to draw enemy attention or aggro by getting into their face, and the character Haigen Hawkins was designed with this in mind.   One thing to remember though is that this game is both a tower defense game and an fps. You can't go one way without the other and you will be rewarded for shooting the enemies where it hurts as well as being able to conceptualize the best tower placements. It's a thinking + shooting game, and one that I recommend.			"

												Sanctum Two is an excelent game where you play the role of a person who kills things. That's it. That's all I know.Now that I got that out of the way, I can say that this game is amazing! It's a perfect mix between Tower defense and First person action. However, the game can get quite challenging without people to play with, as well as boring. Over all, it's a fun game, if you loke games that reqire a decent amount of strategy, not just how quickly you can move your mouse. So, here's the verdict.PROS:           Good gameplay           Lively visuals           Decent ammount of strategy involved           Can make the game say ""Jimmy Nutrin"" simply by typing it           Great with friendsCONS:            Nobody ever plays it            Boring on your own            Difficult solo            Virtually no story "

												It's basically Sanctum 1 that's been consolized.  No upgrading guns, you gotta level up in order to unlock more guns and gun slots (and same for towers and perks), there's only 15 max towers allowed per map, and there's sprinting and kickback from every weapon.  It's Sanctum 1 meets CoD.  Monsters are much more enjoyable and dynamic now, but the game itself is quite easy, the maps are not new in any way (though bosses punching their way through towers was fantastic), and the experience overall felt like a slow grind.  Would not recommend.  If you've played Sanctum 1 this game doesn't really have much to offer that's new.			"

												While very different compared to the original Sanctum, Sanctum 2 is an amazing FPS/TD game. It is focused more around the FPS aspect than the first game was. The enemies now chase the player, and the game now includes a ranking system that awards the player towers, weapons, and perks. It also includes 4 different characters, each with their own primary weapon and perk. I very highly recommend this game!			"

												Normally I don't care too much about tower defense games. I always felt helpless during the waves as I watch the enemies go through the defenses and I'd lose. I'm certain the developers had a train of thought similar to that when they made this game.Sanctum 2 perked my interest, and I picked it up on sale. Without a doubt it is the best game purchase I have made so far this year. Every stage has countless strategies you can try on it. One can easily spend hours tinkering around with different tower strategies. On top of the countless tower strategies are character builds. With the variety of characters, guns, and perks one can create a character build that would suit their play style. The stages themselves are breathtaking. Each one has so many nooks and crannies to explore while building. Sometimes I pause between waves just to admire the scenery.The game also has a simple, but interesting story with it that does a good job of fleshing out the world and characters.My adivce to others is to definently play this game with others, it is much more enjoyable experience. That goes double for when you are playing with all 5 Feats of Strength. Beating stages with 5 FoS alone is a challenging endevor. Many hours I have spent trying to beat a single stage; the slightest slip up can force you to start over. Sometimes I even had to rethink my entire tower build. All together it can easily drive you insane. Honestly if it wasn't for the Tactical Juxaposition + Drone Launcher combination, I don't even think some of these stages are possible to beat with 5 FoS alone.I'll admit I have never played the original Sanctum, so I have nothing to compare it to, but from what I see the 'FPS' portion of this game takes a little more active role compared to the original.Coffee Stain Studios has done a fantastic job crafting this unique Tower Defense/FPS hybrid game. I'll be following their future projects closely.			"

												Planning gets you ahead, but making choices in the heat of the moment is just as important. This dichotomy makes Sanctum 2 some of the most fun I've had with a tower defense game in a long time. Like its previous title, Sanctum 2 is an entertaining blend of first-person shooting and tower-defense-style strategy. Instead of passively watching your towers do all the dirty work, you are allowed descend into the action and distribute carnage alongside them. Both games execute this concept almost flawlessly, however Sanctum 2 has far more content than its small-scale predecessor. This is the fully featured, fully realized game this series needed, and offers lots of content to enjoy whether you’re a strategy fan first and shooter fan second, or vice versa. With 16 levels, 8 weapons, and 4 different character classes to choose from, there is a lot more to do right out of the box compare to the first title. with additional DLC being announced and there’s a Season Pass available that gets you all the future expansion packs at a reduced price.Multiplayer has been completely overhauled as well. It is now easier to drop in or out of multiplayer matches, and you can now specify who exactly is allowed to join your ongoing game. It also scales rather nicely, with each additional player adding even more resources to the pool but also increasing the overall challenge. This way, the game’s difficulty is well-balanced. There is an easy mode, but it skews the game balance a little too much in your favor and is not entirely recommended.Resources have also received a sort of overhaul. The game sort of just drops a set amount of supply for you to utilize, breaking up barricades and towers into separate categories. Credits, however are no longer a shared currency required for building barricades and towers. Instead you just get a certain amount of tower credits, and a certain allotment of barricades at the end of each round. Although It may not seem like that much, but taking away the decision of spending money on barricades really does make the game better, as you’re free to spend more thought on strategy instead of playing accountant on the battlefield. This is also mainly because on the field, weapon upgrades have been given the boot. In the first Sanctum you had towers, barricades, and weapon upgrades that you had to spend credits on. All of these things operated on the same currency, meaning that you could spend wrong and die. This would happen often. Though the field upgrades are gone, you can still tweak and improve your weapons through the smart use of loadout perks that can affect the behavior and damage of your guns. These perks however can also affect yourself, or your towers; but with the removal of upgrades, it would be smart to use the perk slots for more offensive purposes.Other improvements in the game are minor tweaks and additions that keep things refreshing and new in smart ways. You’ve got AI squad buddies that will assist you now. While they can take about as much damage as a dandelion, they still try. Weapon damages are tweaked, enemy damage values and health have been tweaked. Bosses have been added and maps are varied and consistently intelligently challenging. To top it all off, the game looks gorgeous and is really brought to life by its high gloss neon art style. A style that has clearly taken cues from ’80s futurism, and the Anime from that era.Sanctum 2 is a brilliant representation of a game that was developed with an open ear. When Sanctum was released in 2011, it was a great idea that wasn’t without flaws in the structure of its design. Here, Coffee Stain Studios have taken the time to improve upon every flaw, and produced an indie gem polished in the fire of scrutiny. While Sanctum 2 is still a challenging game, it’s tough in smart substantive ways that add up. Opting for this instead of the punitive approach that Sanctum was built on has made for a far superior product in the form of Sanctum 2.			"

												It's great!  I love it! Whether you're a tower defence nut, or a FPS nut, you should definitely give this game ago. Personally, I cannnot really compare to the first Sanctum game as I bought this first, but I bought it after playing this so it's next on the list.I'm writing this review at 55 hours in and I'm still playing. I've played the whole thing through (including DLC) with a friend and now we're going through again with all Feats of Strength (your usual upgrades to make the game more challenging) enabled. I think it's safe to say we've both enjoyed the experience.While I believe this game is mostly about the gameplay, it does manage to fit a story in there. You play as one of four Core Gaurdians sworn to protect - you guessed it - cores from an alien race known as Lumes. The importance of cores as well as the story behind them becomes apparent while playing, seen in comic book-like screens used while a map is loading. Sanctum 2 also features a fair amount of easter eggs including codes the player might enter online to discover for about the universe too. The game eases you in gently with a nice tutorial and builds up the difficulty and you level up in a well designed system in which you unlock new perks and weapons. The DLC also raises the level cap from 20 to 40 (assuming you have all the DLC) as well as featuring a whole load more weapons and perks. As the game goes on you do come across fair large difficulty spikes; levels that are extremely challenging (especially in the DLC). I have to be honest, we found ourselves looking up a way of doing one or two levels after failing at least 10 times. But you shouldn't have a problem if you're good at that kinda thing.The art style of Sanctum 2 also takes more of a comic-like approach too, straying from its predecessor who attempted a more realistic art style (from what I've seen) but didn't quite pull it off (from what I've heard). Art style shouldn't be a reason not to buy a game though, if it is to you, stop reading this and go get some common sense. Or go outside if you some realistic graphics so much.Some inexperienced players may have a problem with that in co-op play, a proportion of health is added to each enemy for each other player, making them harder to kill. While this isn't always an issue, it sometimes become a problem when the health of a enemy becomes unbalanced with the amount of damange that it is possible deal as the ammount of towers you're allowed to build is always capped at 15, no matter how much health they have. While this can make things very, very challenging using Feats of Strength, everything is still perfectly possible when you know what you're doing.Coffee Stain Studios has quickly become one of my favourite game developers and Sanctum 2 is probably the best game they've created in my opinion. A subtle sense of humour, tens of gameplay hours and a brillaint, worked on concept. I loved playing this game and I still love playing this game. Although it would be nice to include some sort of 'prestige' system to allow veteran players to still have some sense of accomplishment after reaching their level cap, that would be the only really thing I can personall complain about. This is definitely a game you should buy if it falls anywhere near your field of interest. 9/10			"

												I got a 90% off coupon for the first Sanctum, which I had never heard of. I went to the store and noticed that Sanctum 2 was also out... and it was free to play for the weekend. I downloaded it, played a few rounds, and immediately bought it along with the DLC.I've played a few tower defense games in the past, but it's not exactly a genre that I'm super enthusiastic about. I'm also not a big FPS fan (especially online games), but there's just something abou Sanctum 2 that really pleases me. The game is challenging without being frustrating (so far, at least), and there seems to be a really nice sense of progression with the leveling system and tower/perk unlocks. I also really enjoy the added touch of the 'feats' that let you increase the difficulty for extra XP. Replaying older stages with new perks and feats gives you some decent replay value. The game runs great, looks great, sounds great, and plays very smoothly. The online co-op is also a wonderful addition that really puts this game over the top. Sanctum 2 is pretty dang rad.			"

Unlike Sanctum 1 which focus on towers and strategy, Sanctum 2 focus more on gun actions to keep you busy during the wave. And i love it ;)			"

												As a fan of Orcs must Die, which was a game of similar gameplay, i ♥♥♥♥ing love this game.Join Skye, Sweet, SiMo and Haigen, as well as TSYGAN if you bought the DLC, as they defend the cores from a horde of dangerous alien creatures called Lumes. There's more to it, because this game actually has a plot. It's pretty good, i'd say. A bit basic, but good.The gameplay is fantastic. You build towers, and then you defend the core from the Lumes. But wait. The towers aren't doing all the work, YOU are helping out as well, you lazy twit. You get a good amount of weaponry to shoot the aliens with, and a variety of perks to bolster you and your defenses, and they vary from quite basic guns, to some pretty strange guns. And if you suck at aiming, don't worry. There are a few perks and guns that help counter that. You do have to do SOME aiming, ESPECIALLY in the last level of the first DLC.The scenery is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gorgeous, and they didn't even put borders around the arena, so you are free to explore the area. Do watch your step, even more so when you are playing Sweet, because there are some bottomless pits. And blasting yourself in the wrong direction can very quickly end in some fund losses in hospital bills. Well, not really, you get to keep the money. You will just have some SEVERE pain in your legs for a while. You can walk it off.If you are looking for more, there is a whole DLC campaign that continues where the base game leaves off. The quality varies quite a bit in terms of maps and towers, but all of them are pretty good. A gripe i have is that the AA tower, which you will NEED early on in the DLC, is locked behind rank 32. So you'll have to defend a bit untill then.So yeah, Sanctum 2 is a pretty good game. Even more so if you play Co-oP. So, if you dig a strangely holy concoctionof TD and FPS, i'd highly suggest you pick this one up.			"

The game sort of just drops a set amount of supply for you to utilize, breaking up barricades and towers into separate categories. Credits, however are no longer a shared currency required for building barricades and towers. Instead you just get a certain amount of tower credits, and a certain allotment of barricades at the end of each round. Although It may not seem like that much, but taking away the decision of spending money on barricades really does make the game better, as you’re free to spend more thought on strategy instead of playing accountant on the battlefield. This is also mainly because on the field, weapon upgrades have been given the boot. In the first Sanctum you had towers, barricades, and weapon upgrades that you had to spend credits on. All of these things operated on the same currency, meaning that you could spend wrong and die. This would happen often. Though the field upgrades are gone, you can still tweak and improve your weapons through the smart use of loadout perks that can affect the behavior and damage of your guns. These perks however can also affect yourself, or your towers; but with the removal of upgrades, it would be smart to use the perk slots for more offensive purposes.Other improvements in the game are minor tweaks and additions that keep things refreshing and new in smart ways. You’ve got AI squad buddies that will assist you now. While they can take about as much damage as a dandelion, they still try. Weapon damages are tweaked, enemy damage values and health have been tweaked. Bosses have been added and maps are varied and consistently intelligently challenging. To top it all off, the game looks gorgeous and is really brought to life by its high gloss neon art style. A style that has clearly taken cues from ’80s futurism, and the Anime from that era.Sanctum 2 is a brilliant representation of a game that was developed with an open ear. When Sanctum was released in 2011, it was a great idea that wasn’t without flaws in the structure of its design. Here, Coffee Stain Studios have taken the time to improve upon every flaw, and produced an indie gem polished in the fire of scrutiny. While Sanctum 2 is still a challenging game, it’s tough in smart substantive ways that add up. Opting for this instead of the punitive approach that Sanctum was built on has made for a far superior product in the form of Sanctum 2.			"

												This game is a brilliant mix of the genres of tower defense and first person shooter. It even brings variety to the game's playstyles with different classes to play as! Wether you test your skill on survival mode, or just decide to mess around with the game's mechanics on sandbox mode, this game is amazing fun. :)			"

												Normally I don't care too much about tower defense games. I always felt helpless during the waves as I watch the enemies go through the defenses and I'd lose. I'm certain the developers had a train of thought similar to that when they made this game.Sanctum 2 perked my interest, and I picked it up on sale. Without a doubt it is the best game purchase I have made so far this year. Every stage has countless strategies you can try on it. One can easily spend hours tinkering around with different tower strategies. On top of the countless tower strategies are character builds. With the variety of characters, guns, and perks one can create a character build that would suit their play style. The stages themselves are breathtaking. Each one has so many nooks and crannies to explore while building. Sometimes I pause between waves just to admire the scenery.The game also has a simple, but interesting story with it that does a good job of fleshing out the world and characters.My adivce to others is to definently play this game with others, it is much more enjoyable experience. That goes double for when you are playing with all 5 Feats of Strength. Beating stages with 5 FoS alone is a challenging endevor. Many hours I have spent trying to beat a single stage; the slightest slip up can force you to start over. Sometimes I even had to rethink my entire tower build. All together it can easily drive you insane. Honestly if it wasn't for the Tactical Juxaposition + Drone Launcher combination, I don't even think some of these stages are possible to beat with 5 FoS alone.I'll admit I have never played the original Sanctum, so I have nothing to compare it to, but from what I see the 'FPS' portion of this game takes a little more active role compared to the original.Coffee Stain Studios has done a fantastic job crafting this unique Tower Defense/FPS hybrid game. I'll be following their future projects closely.			"

												Planning gets you ahead, but making choices in the heat of the moment is just as important. This dichotomy makes Sanctum 2 some of the most fun I've had with a tower defense game in a long time. Like its previous title, Sanctum 2 is an entertaining blend of first-person shooting and tower-defense-style strategy. Instead of passively watching your towers do all the dirty work, you are allowed descend into the action and distribute carnage alongside them. Both games execute this concept almost flawlessly, however Sanctum 2 has far more content than its small-scale predecessor. This is the fully featured, fully realized game this series needed, and offers lots of content to enjoy whether you’re a strategy fan first and shooter fan second, or vice versa. With 16 levels, 8 weapons, and 4 different character classes to choose from, there is a lot more to do right out of the box compare to the first title. with additional DLC being announced and there’s a Season Pass available that gets you all the future expansion packs at a reduced price.Multiplayer has been completely overhauled as well. It is now easier to drop in or out of multiplayer matches, and you can now specify who exactly is allowed to join your ongoing game. It also scales rather nicely, with each additional player adding even more resources to the pool but also increasing the overall challenge. This way, the game’s difficulty is well-balanced. There is an easy mode, but it skews the game balance a little too much in your favor and is not entirely recommended.Resources have also received a sort of overhaul.

Mix in a hare of strategy and a Co-op fun and you'll have an enteraining game that is not short on hours of potential enjoyment.The player clases are not nearly as restrictive as one would think, with a fair dose of customization you can adapt to what you find good for you. Further unlocked upgrades and perks can augment your style of fighting to a surprising degree leaving any number of options on how to do a mission. Mixed in is a rather unique-feeling style of art and design that just further enhances the game.In my opinion, its a must have to at least say you've tried it.			"

												What can be said for Sanctum 2?  It's an amazing title!  Sanctum 2 is a tower defense/action-shooter, reminiscent of games such as Orcs Must Die & Dungeon Defenders, while still doing a wonderful job of standing out on it's own!  The graphics are incredible, and do a fantastic job of pulling you into the beautiful (albeit troubled) world the developers created; nothing instills a sense of urgency like seeing a massive alien creature in the distant city skyline, tossing buildings aside like LEGOs, and the whole thing is moved along by a soundtrack that's within a class of it's own!The gameplay is, to say the very least, addictive; even post-game, with the plethora of weapons, towers, and gameplay style-defining perks all unlocked and the engaging story seen through to it's applause-worthy finale, the player will still have NO problem feeling the urge to return to their favorite maps time and again to assure the dreaded Lumes have had their fill of lead sammich!All in all, Sanctum 2 stands as a shining example of an indie studio producing a triple-A product, while keeping the indie price tag! Play it! 5/5			"

												This game is awesome!It's a rare thing when the 2nd of an already great game, is actually a total improvement, and even better!  Usually companies try but can't quite get it right, after all it's not easy to make a great game and if you do, make another just as good based off the 1st.There's story (ish game doesn't need it but they added flavor to the game), leveling, new locations (lots), traits for your character, unlocking towers, challenges for each area, bosses (yes you heard that right, BOSSES! which aren't just full of HP, but can blow up your towers and blocks), mobs will agro on you so you can kite them ish, and overall man it's great singleplayer and multiplayer.Only con I can think of is that there are spots on the map which are sometimes easy to fall through, so you respawn 10 seconds later, but it would be nice to not have these sorts of spots.Great game on sale or not.

												After completing a good deal of the Sanctum 1 content on my first playthrough, I felt frustrated. Drawn in immediately by the premise of a FPS turret defense game, I fell in love with the freedom to play how I wanted and the amazing aesthetics. This made it harder when Sanctum 1's glaring flaws creeped up on me (difficulty by simply ramping up numbers, scatter lazer spam and the inevitability of a stale and repetitive single or multiplater experience).When I saw Sanctum 2 announced, my hopes were high. Hoping for these issues adressed, I purchased immediatealy.It did not dissapoint in the slightest.Sanctum 2 fixed nearly every problem with sanctum 1. Substituting disorienting teleporters and tall towers for an easy to see and traverse envrioment on foot aided both combat, navigation, and tower planning. More unique and interesting towers, a selection of weapons to fit every playstyle, amazing graphics, complicated and entertaining enemies and a crazy fun perk system to keep everything fresh, Sanctum 2 is easily one of my favourite games of all time.Even those poor at FPS like me can still have fun using nearly every weapon. Combat is complicated, useful and necessary to survival. Planning mazes and tower setups is both easier and more effective, and honestly makes a lot more sense. Sanctum 2 is a perfect sequel: everything you loved, nothing you didnt. It demands more from the player, and in return removes the barriers that frustated you in meeting these demands previously.It's hard to cram all my praise for this game into words. Grab a buddy or two and get playing. There's so much replay value.			"

												Sanctum 2 has come a long way since release. Coffee Stain is to be commended for listening to their community and really working hard to make this a game worthy of the ""Sanctum"" name. At this point in its history, Sanctum 2 is a brilliant hybrid FPS/tower defense game where success depends on good mazing, good tower placement and choice, and good FPS play. The strategy side is weighty and meaningful, the character perks and weapon choices carry significant impact, and in general planning is as or more important than moment-to-moment shooting skill. I highly recommend it.			"

You will want to have good internet though, if not you have a real hard time aiming at the enemies unless you are hosting the game. This is the best grid based turret deffence/first person shooter I have played.Heads up: there is one bug I know of that can be alarming if you get it, but is easily fixed. When you first open the game, if it fails to conect to you're Steam account on the first go, it won't let you passed the title screen. If this happens, restart you're computer, open Steam before you try to start the game, make sure you conect to your account and that your internet is working, then try again and it should work fine.

They also simplified upgrades, now you don't have too worry about upgrading towers and guns. Tower Bases are not these huge things you need elevators too get on top of. Everything looks better, I mean just better. The story the art, this game is a simple gem and amazing fun			"

												This game is wonderful for anyone who enjoys FPS- and TD-games. It has some RPG-elements in it, allowing you to level up in order to unlock new weapons and towers. Unlike the first game there are enemies  designed to hunt down players, adding to the action. Originally this game was riddled with game-breaking bugs but they have since been hammered out. Be warned though. This game is not like most TD-games where the difficulty slowly scales. It jumps around alot, most levels are easy-med, then SUDDENLY a murder-level. There are many towers but as you learn more about the game and start playing at higher difficulties, and survival, you will notice that only a few are worth your while, meaning that the game is fundamentally unbalanced.  However, it is still highly enjoyable both alone and with friends. The levels are absolutely stunning and exploring them is encouraged by many easter eggs, achievements, and AR-Mines that are hidden throughout the game. Take a while on every level and look up and around and enjoy the beautiful artwork. Experience an interesting story with unexpected twists and have a great time.			"

												Imagine for a second you are playing your typical tower defence game. You have waves of oncoming enemies, And only certain predetermined areas to place your towers before the onslaught hits.Now throw it all away!1.Sanctum 2 Features a fresh new combat style that blends a great tower defence game with the thrills of a FPS seamlessly. 2.It Features a wide variety of towers players earn through leveling up either online or solo in the campaign.3. Thorough Perk system makes each decision critical to the specific map at hand, while having so many makes that decision very tough sometimes.4. It's one of the best co-op/multiplayer games ive played in a long time, grab a few friends and you will be required to strategize with each other to complete the goal and manage resources, It is a very vocal game.5. The chat talks to you when you use it, it's a robot voice and i love it.6. Runs great! My graphics card is a cheap 80-100 dollar 1gb thing and i can achieve right around 60 fps (45-55 avg) during heated battles.7.YOU decide what to do with the horde. Most levels start as a big open square of sorts, with varying sizes and patterns for places you can place towers, Your team will get x amount of resources to place inbetween rounds (sometimes timed, always have at least 3 break rounds a map with no time) to fight off the enemies and give them the longest path possible before they hit the core and destroy it.All in all this game is worth every penny (especially for the dlc) if you like to strategize solo or with friends, and blow enemy faces off with over the top guns and towers i highly reccommend this innovative hybrid FPS tower defence game.

												Great game, especially with friends. Very fun and some great easter eggs. Good for strategy and tactics lovers. Just mind that friends don't have OCD or it will be a long night indeed.			"

												The mixing of a tower defense game with a futuristic shooter is a very cool concept and it is pulled off quite well in Sanctum 2. I will say however that this game would probably be rather boring singleplayer. I have been playing this with a friend since I got it and it is incredibly fun but like I said I could tell it'd be boring alone. I reccomend this if you have friends to play it with.			"

												Great game, mixes Tower Defence with a FPS.The enemies are very different from eachother, so you might need to change tatics, some enemies run really fast in a straight line, while others tank a lot of damage.All the towers you can build all feel useful at some stage, I haven't seen such a useless tower so far.Honestly its a fantastic game, the artstyle is easily one of the best I seen in a game and it's a lot of fun.Only downside is the that weapon animations looked ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when cooling.

												A perfect game to blast some enemies into oblivion, great story and quite challanging maps which tests your skills even with the feats of strenght. 50 Levels to get and so many choices of perks weapons and fresh new towers, the DLC will add even much more enlightment with many more maps etc etc.I highly recommend getting it because you gonna spend hours and hours on this game.

												I wanted this game really bad, and got notification that it was on sale! This game is a dream come true for tower defense lovers, first of all you don't just watch your towers kill alien monsters, YOU GET IN ON THE ACTION fps style, I love it <3 I highly reccommend it if you just like a tower defense game and fps game combined,  10/10 get it FOR SURE if it's on sale and if it's not and you're tight on money, you can always wait or get it for regular price because it's definitely worth :)			"

												It is not yet fully polished, but delivers what it promises: a fun FPS tower defense game.You can select between 4 classes, which are well balanced and close enough to each other that it does not feel like you have to select a specific class for a specific task, yet different enough to make them feel like a choice. Essentially it is more a question of play-style and what you like. Later you receive more secondary weapons and skills that allow you to further customize your character. Every choice can be changed at any time outside a match, so you can just try a few things till you find the combination that you like most.After you have selected the class you enter one of the many different and well designed levels, where you build your towers, then fight a wave of enemies, get rewarded for the wave, build more towers and upgrade them, and so on. If you know tower defense games, there are little surprises here, however I have to notice that the towers are well thought-through and each one is a good choice for a certain situation. Each one allows for different tactics, and all are at some point an excellent choice, as each level has a unique design and requires entirely different tactics to be completed. Certain levels are even excessively difficult and require a lot of planning, try and error to find a setup that works. While that feels refreshing and challenging, it might also be frustrating for casual players.Graphics are well done, but nothing extraordenary. Controls are well tuned for an FPS and require almost no tweaking to feel good. There is a lot of unnecessary camera shaking going on, which sometimes is annoying. Also you often feel desoriented if your vision gets blocked by mobs or you are thrown around by attacks.All in all definitely a good game that is worth the money if you are into these type of games.

												Sanctum 2 is a very robust game, it provides a lot of fun and challenge in equal measure.The graphics are first-rate, the landscapes and scenery in the game world are breathtaking, Leonard Hummer's soundtrack is gorgeously composed, the game's characters are full of personality and have very nice designs, and the consistantly different levels means there's never a dull moment.The level of customisation in the game is incredibly diverse, even without DLC weapons and 'Perks' (abilites that provide buffs and other useful effects in-game) - there are a lot of different loadouts one can equip. Difficulty level is also customisable, instead of a traditional 'Easy - Medium - Hard - etc.' setup, this game employs the 'Feats of Strength' system, allowing you to customise how hard to make the game, options to increase enemy health, speed, and strength are all seperate, giving you a more gradual difficulty slope as you get more confident.Multiplayer is another fantastic part of this game, allowing you to create or join a server at the touch of a button. You can create a private server and invite your friends to it, or make a public one and fight alongside complete strangers, or browse the public server list and help other players.As someone that's obtained every achievement for this game, I can say there is still plenty more this game has to offer, different loadouts to try, different tower combinations, different maze layouts, I now spend time on public servers, helping them to progress through the game and I'm always fascinated by all the new and interesting approaches to the levels that I'd never even considered in my playthrough.Overall, very well polished, very enjoyable game with loads of content and replayability. I highly recommend Sanctum 2, you won't be disappointed with it.			"

												It's one of my favorite games.  The good thing about Sanctum 2 is it 's good blend of tower defense and First Person Shooter genres.  If you like tower defense games you will enjoy.  If you like first person shooters you will enjoy.One thing to keep in mind is the clear line of thought that cut straight through the center of this experience.  You must use both sides of your brain to play effectively.1) You place blocks on the ground to build a maze.  Not just any maze.  Use your best creative efforts to create a maze that will make the Lumes (enemies) talk longer to get to the Core (objective).2) Place towers in a STRATEGICALLY adavantagous location.  Set up choke points where the maze becomes it's most complex and give those lumes one for!3) Suppliment the towers that you place acting like police and clean-up crew. FIGHT!Half the time you MUST think like a chess player the other half think like a soldier.  Remember that there's no such thing as the best tower.  Being a good player is as a result of  thinking defensively; Look ahead and think ahead.No, it's not all about the pew pew pew.  It's about using your brain and working for the TEAM.  Some people are good at mazes, some people are good at blowing s**t up and yet some people are good at both.My point, what makes this game exceptionally goo is the players that play for the team.  You must always remember that. I see too many people that level up yet lack basic strategy that ruins the experience.  I'll put it this way.  Why would you spend 1 hour playing 10 rounds of this game without intent to be sucessful.  I play to win and most people play video games to, you guessed it, WIN.If you can't think like a chess player then DON'T play this game.  Only half the game is fighting the other half is planning.  Really, of you 've taken a few IQ tests then some of it will look awfully familiar.  Usually a review would talk about game mechanics and I'm perhaps being remiss not going thta route but this game is unique.   I large portion of that experience comes from the synergy created between the players.  Remeber friendship is magic ;)Your lord and master,mematron aka dudeacusUPDATE (12/11/2016):  The people that play the game now are mostly morons who lack perfunctory logical thought.  It's difficult to explain to a group of players that a field of Violators (sniper towers) or any of one kind of tower combined with a straight path that mainlines to the core that it's a bad idea.  These aren't people who have survived up to wave 9 - 10 waves for each map.  They survived one or two waves and therefore believe that they are doing the right thing.  When someone like me comes on server and suggest that what's being done isn't going to win the game, that's a tough pill to swallow for them.  Especially the person who is running the server.  The game has VOIP but it's really bad so most of us use the chat feature.  As all of us know from anytime spent on the internet.  The realtime separation and coldness of a chat session can leave us with robotic and souless communication.  What could be said in the spirit of a helpfull suggestion and team building becomes a BARKING order with gamer platitudes.Essentially, numbskulls have ruined this game for me.  The current mentally slow player base.  The reaelly good players are far and few between.  I'm not saying all but most of the people currently playing as of 12/11/2016 blow serious goat.I have therefore uninstalled this wonderful game.  Again, Coffeestain dudes, you guys made a good game - It don't have some bugs that you need to fix. It's not the game it's the F­­­­u­­­­c­­­­king  N00bs that make it suck.			"

												Fun to play, yet difficult to master, Sanctum 2 is a good fps strategy game. Why didn't I say tower defence? Because EVERY SINGLE VICTORY OR DEFEAT DEPENDS ON YOU (except for in sandbox mode). Towers work more like AI in BFB2: they kill every once in awhile, but ultimately leave the job to you. Nevertheless, it's a great experience with (surprisingly enough) a storyline. How's that for a fps strategy? 6/10			"

												Picked it up while it was on sale, best decision this week.I bought this game so a friend and I would have a co-op shoot-em up that wasn't as simple as shooting, camping and getting mad at the screen. I also thought it was probably gonna be okay if I spent 4 dollars buying us both the game; it's not like I've wasted more money on a ♥♥♥♥♥ier game.. *cough*So, turns out this game is pretty fun. Spent a solid 2 hours slaughtering aliens in campaign until we reached a point where we couldn't advance; but that was perfectly fine! Every defeat offered us a new idea, a new maze, a new strategy. We got to a point where we had everything proritized and every turret where it needed to be. The feeling is glorious. My friend, who frequents the sniper class, expressed how amazing it was to have me down the sight watching me blow aliens to chunks. It's not the best game, but it's definitely worth a play through, and definitely worth buying on sale. 8.5/10			"

												First of all - If you like Sanctum 1 you will like it too (for me as minimum), it's same game with amazing improvements (characters, weapons, towers, maps, modern FPS RPG style atc...) + good story line for game this type, it becomes more active in Character gameplay and didn't lost ""Sancum""s deep Tactical gameplay.Second, if you don't know what I'm talking about - it's the FPS tower defence, where you must make tactical decisions, build towers and also need to shoot enemies, it's amazing and deep Tactical game with FPS elements, where wins smart choice and teamplay, RPG style character improvements gives this game more strategic/tactical freedom (what skill to take, or what tower-weapons).Shortly - it's amazing game with quite cheap price for it, Really, 100% Recommend...

												I have played many tower defence games - this one is my first where you build your structures from a first person perspective, standing between the tower bases and taking part in the action with a selection of rifles and other guns. It's a quite immersive combat experience and particularly fun in co-op mode, when you do not only fight the aliens, but also compete with your comrades who gets the most kills and the least own deaths... Thumbs up!			"

Tower here, Tower there... Sanctum 2 is a First-Person Tower Defense game that is amazing, and needs to be purchased and added to your library right away. The game is beautiful, I sometimes just run around taking screenshots its so pretty, I love the map designs and character designs especially. Multiplayer with someone you know is to be prefered, I personally can't enjoy a game when I'm lonely. The various towers and weapons given to you are fun and enjoyable to use, and every item has a purpose. Being a defender of the core, and building your own death maze to  murder  the invasive monsters, as your robot companion ask for coffee, is a very fun filled endeavor.  By far the best feature is the robot voice that speaks when you type to communicate to your team.  Combat has a sci-fi feel, and there is a very satisfying sound that emits from your rocket launcher as you squelch your enemies and are thrown by knockback. The easter eggs hidden in the game are a fun surprise to hunt for, and I loved the references I saw.  Overall, if you enjoy a strategic multiplayer game to play with your mates, pick up Sanctum 2 and place those tower bases.  "

												Fun tower defense game that combines first person shooting with between-wave death-maze creation. The difficulty curve is all over the place but its satisfying when you manage to find just the right combination of turrets and weapons that destroy enemies with ease. Takes a good while to play through the default levels, feats of strength and new turrets/perks incentivize multiple playthroughs of levels.			"

												This game was fun up until the boss fight at the end of the level. The bosses defeat the main purpose of a tower defense game by just walking right through your line of defense, destroying barriers and turrets in just one hit. For a more enjoyable action oriented tower defense game take a look at ""Orcs Must Die! 2"" or ""Iron Brigade"".			"

												This game does a fantastic job combining the enjoyment of strategizing in a tower defense with the fast-paced action of a shooter. Unlike a lot of games that try to combine TD with another genre, one style tends to fall short of the other in terms of importance to game content and/or quality. That is not the case in Sanctum. I saw it as a bold move combining the slow meticulous strategy of tower defense with the fast-paced twitch style of FPS but this game knew what it was doing. The tower defense aspect is fun and engaging and not as slow and monotonous as it often is in games like Dungeon Defenders, while the FPS aspect is diverse and rewarding with a multitude of weapons and augmentations.

												Mainly played this on multiplayer, and really enjoyed it.Pros:Fun blend of shooter and tower defenceTower defence needs a decent amount of strategyShooter keeps you on your feet between building phasesMonster variation, weak spots and bosses keep the game interesting and challengingMultiplayer with friends really gives that ""teamwork"" and ""divide-and-conquer"" feelGood variety of weapons, perks, towers and skillsTowers sell for full price, allowing flexibilityBrilliant and fitting graphicsAbsolutely awesome (fun and funny) text-to-voice chatFriendly fire doesn't damage allies (technically)Friendly fire can 'accidentally"" push your friends off ledges and to their deaths (oops!)Cons:Friendly fire can accidentally push your friends off ledges and to their deathsDifficulty varies, and the space for mazing are extremely limited on some mapsBosses are really really tough and may destroy towersLosing at late stages in a game really sucksThere's a stage where (depending on which paths you block) ranged units can hit (and likely destroy) your core even before they enter your maze, due to the map layout.Tips:Play with friendsAlways prepare for air/final line of defenceBeware ranged unitsHave one person take the core-healing perkKite bossesIf the round has a timer: build first, redo laterDon't rush monsters and end up in your allies' line of sightMost Importantly:Press ""T"" in-game and type something.

												Sanctum 2 is a really fun and challenging game where you will often need the help of your friends or the rest of the community to complete the maps.The game takes place in a futuristic world where you take the role of one of four core guardians. Your task is to protect the cores from advancing waves of alien monsters called lumes. The storyline is very nice and well worth following to learn more about the cores and the lumes so I won't spoil it for you. To your help you have a wide array of different towers, weapons and perks and every level you unlock new goodies to use!The game has 4 available DLCs and I recommend them all as well as they all add new lumes, weapons, towers and perks. All 4 DLCs combined provide as much content as the original game!			"

												Though I've had my fair share of bugs and crash issues with this game, I have had a great experience with it.The game accomplishes something that's truly rare in gaming. It is incredibly challenging at times, but always makes you feel as though you and your party are at fault when you fail a mission rather than the game itself feeling cheap or like the AI is way overpowered.The shooting mechanics are passable, but the depth with the perks and towers are where the game really shines. Paired with one or two party members, you really begin to find great combinations that can prove effective against the multitude of enemies and map designs you'll have to fight through each mission.

												This is a great game no matter what it lacks or where it gets less perfect than i'd like it to be.  Plays well, and looks and sounds very - sometimes incredibly - pritty. It's got its places where you just stop to look ore listen, you know.Maybe even a bit like made for girls. Yet i, as a 100% male do recommend it to everyone)).It's got a generous variety of towers, guns, perks and 5 characters to play as, though i mostly played as Simo with sniper and assault rifles, good against all around towers like cannon, violator and focus(and one AA, if needed) and all three core-saving perks.Beat its campaign as a singleplayer, now looking forward to a playthrough in a party. Ain't managed to complete everything with all feats of strength enabled, 1\3 or more are still to be beat on hardest difficulty along with the half of the achievements to be... achieved. It gets real tough sometimes or demands more idea about perks and towers than i've got for now, maybe. I think i've actually played it only half of the time recorded and about half of the time i played were failed replays on hardest.  And that didn't get too boring very fast.  So It's very involving and replayable.  Though i'd recommend not to try to break this game's neck replaying too many times in succession when it doesn't let you win a mission with all feats of strength enabled. That's how it becomes a time-waster.Many thanks to Coffee Stain, i'll even think about purchasing that goat-simulator, damn it)). Right after i kick that BliskeBlaske(or whatever it's name) big flying rear part with all 5 FoS on)) or maybe sooner. Should you ever be planning to make more Sanctum games, please think about a shooter-slasher with much more passable space full of that beautiful alien nature, reids deep into the jungle, exploring abandoned settlements, attacks on the lumes' nests etc. With the same TD elements and perks, but optional - like a smaller core and some tower-bases and tower-guns dropped to support the team of characters and simo-units on a mission with the balance not crucially depending on fortifications. Could be great to play too. After all - we're not gonna give the whole planet back to lumes, right?))			"

I'm sure all gamers have at some point played a tower defense style game, but I have never seen a spin on it quite like this, it throws in the aspect of being a FPS, you have a character who gains experience and levels with each completed mission, leveling up increases you abilities and unlocks more weapons skills and slots for the like. Each map you start out by building walls and towers to defend your core, after you build with what you have availible you start the wave, so it still requires the strategy of funneling your enemies through mazes but also gives you the ability to run around and fight yourself. With the addition of boss battles it makes it more than the typical tower defence, the bosses have the power to smash your walls and towers which makes things more of a challenge, but the ability for 4 player co op lets you call for backup if you need a hand, Great game, decent price, lots of fun. (and it never hurts if you can catch it on the steam sale for $3.99)			"

												     This game. This game is so good. It expands on many of the features of the first game and feels more like an actual game, rather than a bunch of maps to select from. In order to unlock new towers, you need to level up by playing through the maps and gaining exp from killing sh*t, which is a great featureso you feel as though you are getting stronger along with your foes (but it's done in a way that you can still get the crap beaten out of your core and lose, despite your shiny new towers), and the devs even added in a perk feature, which I didn't feel was needed until I used it and fell in love with it. You can unlock more perk slots and equip up to 4 at the beginning of each map, and holy crap they're awesome. The perks range from increasing the damage inflicted on enemy weakspots (I always equip that one), to having the core regain 10% of it's max health after each round, to you shooting lightning out of your body or jumping on an enemy and inflicting 2000 damage (Plumber Shoes ftw) or even increasing the amount of damage you inflict by 15% for every enemy near you. These perks are an amazing addition, and are super fun and add a bunch of variety to each game you play (especially on co-op, with each player equipping different perks).       Now if you read that and are thinking, ""Hmmm.... Sounds like I'm going to be overpowered.... Especially on co-op,"" and you couldn't be more WRONG. The game is really tough, as the towers now do less damage than in the first game and you have to play a larger role in combatting the hordes of mobs you will find in this game. One moment you're on top of the world, your maze is obliterating everything, and the next you have a giant Super Heavy blowing up your towers (and yes, certain boss enemies can destroy your towers, but they can be repaired for free after the round) and a huge swarm of walker pups are attacking your core. Something about the constant switch from success to failure makes the game really addicting, and can you keep playing when you could've rage quit earlier, simply because THIS turret layout is going to work, forget the four you built before. This is the one, and thats what keeps you going.     I haven't completed the game's campaign, or come anywhere near unlocking all the perks (I'm only level 12 out of 50 I think), mainly cuz I only play this game for hour bursts when I want to blow off steam after work or whatever (sometimes i binge and play for longer; 6 hours straight was the longest I could go before getting off and that was so I could go to work), and that's exactly what this game is made for. The original was good, but a lot of the maps were too long requiring you to beat 20 or 25 long waves of enemies before completing the map. In this game there are 8 (with all the DLC) regions, each one with about 4 or 5 maps inside of it (which is a lot of content), and each map contains about 10-15 waves which is a lot easier to get through than 20 or 25 in the original. Because of this the maps change often enough to stay interesting and visually appealing (they're all beautifully designed and full of little secrets like playable arcade games), and the graphics are really breath taking as the environments go from clean cities, to rusted out junkyards and train stations, to beautiful, alien forests (and more areas I haven't seen before) which are completely gorgeous on the Unreal engine this game uses.       As you've noticed earlier, I've been comparing this game to the original which I'm assuming you've already played. If not buy both of them and play them now (there's no story in the first game, so if you can only afford one, buy this one). If you were a fan of the original but read negative reviews saying the game is watered down and dumber, that is 100% untrue. Out of the entire game I can find only 1 issue, which is when you upgrade the cannon tower that tower does less than DPS than if you just bought another cannon and put it by the first one. Other than that though, the game is improved in every way. Graphically, the first game was really nice for an indy game with burnt out cities and gorgeous jungles, but this game takes the cake. Gameplay-wise, this game is far superior. It feels like a spectacular molding of excellant FPS gameplay mixed with tower defense and not TD with FPS thrown in as a novelty or vice versa. Story, the second one actually has a story now, told through little entertaining comic strips that are shown as each map loads. I haven't gotten far in the story at all, but so far so good. It's not the focus of the game, but it's nice to see all the playable characters interacting and learn some backstory on the Lumes (the enemies you'll face) and Elysion One. Music: As an owner of the Sanctum 1 soundtrack, I have to admit the first game has better music, but the music in 2 is still very strong and very good. However it is one of those soundtracks you dont notice, which a lot of people consider to be the best type, so it's good.      Overall, I recommend this game to anyone with a PC and a love for gaming. It's that good. It requires the fast reflexes and thinking of a well-made shooter (not COD), but also the calculating logic of a TD, and the creativity of building games. I may not be the most qualified to write this review, as I stated before, I'm not far in the game, but there is just so much content and so far it is all so good I can't help but write this review now, so others will dive into the world of Elysion One and kick more Lume a$$. I'll probably edit this review (if i can) when I complete this game, but as of now I am currently having a love affair with this game.Would Recommend in an instant.10/10			"

												A bright, clever, witty and down right fun fps/tower defense hybrid. Improves on the original (which I played only briefly). A well prepared difficulty curved is nicely counterbalanced by unlocks including new weapons, turrets and perks. The art direction is unique, evoking cartoons and water colors while still retaining a sense of place. Most importantly the gameplay is fun and only get's better when you add more players. Buy this game and play it with friends. The only things I would add is a slightly deeper story and maybe some unlimited skirmish type modes (which may or may not exist at the end game already). 8.5/10			"

												I cautiously recommend this game.  I like being a player inside a tower defense game and would recommend Orcs Must Die 2 or Dungeon Defenders over this one.  Sanctum 2 isn't bad, in fact it is good, just there are games out there with similar gameplay elements that are better.  If someone were committed to the space/future theme over the magic/fantasy theme, the mechanical/technical feel of Sanctum 2 might appeal to them more, though I feel the Halo-clone enemies in Sanctum 2 lose out in how they lack the whimsy of fighting hordes of cartoony goblins as one does in Orcs Must Die 2.

												Sanctum 2 a fun FPS tower defence hybrid. Sanctum 2 delivers  in everything a tower defence needs and more from easter eggs to diffrent weapons to even diffrent towers. The enemys while nothing special can be hard to deal with wether it be soakers who are walking targets with lots of health or walker warriors who can deal quick easy damage. There are diffrent worlds in this game and at the end of each one there is a boss which can be chaotic and fun. Overall this game is a fun experience and really needs to be mentioned more this game gets my rating of 5/5 "

												Before anything, I love playing as Sweet Autumn (w/ double jump), but damn does it give me a headache. Most of the time, I'm literally flying all over the map. It's fun, but I get motion sickness.When I first played Sanctum, I thought it was a really cool idea. I love tower defense and the thoughts of being able to be part of that instead of just watching was amazing to me. I bought it and it was just exactly that. I liked it.Then here is Sanctum 2, the sequel. How does it fare?I enjoy the fact that the AI for monsters are a bit more responsive (as in they attack you) rather than just running through the maze. It gives you the feeling that you are actually a person who is in the game rather than a random entity shooting at monsters who don't even realize you're there. There are new guns, new weapons. A leveling up system and perks. I find that as you level to the max, the game becomes a bit easier because you have some pretty amazing towers. But I find that countered by the ""strengths"" where you can make the enemy a lot stronger.The problem I have with this game is that they focused more on the shooter aspect rather than tower defense. Sure, you can still build mazes but the reason why I liked the first was that you basically have unlimited tower blocks until you ran out of resources. Splitting up blocks and resources and giving me limited blocks each turn kind of turns me off a bit. I mean, it's not exactly tower defense if the game gives you only three blocks on the first match. The whole point of TD is so that I can build mazes. And then a limit of towers? Seriously? What I enjoyed about Sanctum was that I did not participate in the match if I wanted to. I could've just allowed the towers to do all the work for me. Note that when I say this, I mean when I play in singpleplayer. You can't really do this with other people. In this game, it forces me to be a part of it.This leads up to the next thing that bothers me. Bosses. They destroy your mazes. So... what's the point of building mazes if they're just going to wreck it? All in all, I thought this was a good game. It does attract me a lot more than Sanctum did (as it got boring over time), but I felt that they lost a bit of the TD aspect.			"

												Man, Sanctum 2 is one of my favorite games of all time. The guys that made Goat Simulator made this game first, and it sure is a gem that should be played by everyone. I love how it uses the tower defense genre simultaneously with some first-person shooter gameplay, and without any of the clutter many games like Orcs Must Die and PVZ: Garden Warefare have shown. There's some basic class customization that's simple but changes each level's approach immensely. Also, multiplayer is awesome, especially in later levels where teamwork is key to victory. I didn't buy the DLC, but I know I should have since it unlocks tons of valuable features that are definitely worth the extra cash. Hilarious and interactive easter eggs can be found all over the normal looking levels too. One level actually has a full-on arcade in the sky where you can play mini-games, it's awesome. Grab some friends to play with, and check this game out if you haven't yet.Rating: 10/10Recommended Price: $15			"

												Amazing co-op game. There is a range of ways you can play, to accomodate everyone from the hardcore FPS type to the complete newbie - without feeling useless in a team. Great level design. There is rarely ""one true solution"", so it keeps me thinking. The enemies range from cute to cool to just plain annoying - but they all provide challenge. Love the character customization, it gives me a ton of options to experiment with such that the gameplay never gets stale. The story told through comics is a great addition as well, and I can't wait to see how they wrap things up. Also, major props to the team for providing frequent updates. I was playing when it launched and there were a number of problems, but they were all fixed within a week. They're attentive to the community, and that's awesome. <3			"

												Awesome mix of genres, it makes me wish I never bought Dungeon Defenders but that doesn't take much. This FPTDS (First Person Tower Defense Shooter) combines strategy and the FPS into an alien killing frenzy. The excitement as a new wave comes, frantically defending the core using fun weaponary and damagin towers. Levelling up also unlocks new possibilities: new perks, weapons and towers. Feats of strength are there when you fancy a challenge and the comic style story clips make this game unique, to think it is an indie game amazes me. A good entry to FPS games for those to young to play realistic ones as it is a 12, but still enjoyable as you mow down hoardes of interesting new aliens with a gun that shoots pure electricity.  7/10			"

												This is a fun game.  Take a tower defense game and mix it with a first person shooter and this is what you get.  This one is much better then the first one because there is a level system.  As you level up, you get better towers, perks, and guns.  The DLC is also pretty great.  If you buy the season pass you get 16 more levels and even an extra playable character.  There isn't much story, but there is a pretty cool comic before each level.  For 15 dollars you can't go wrong with this game.			"

 Positives +Combines 'tower-defense' with FPS gameplay in a unique way+Improves on its predecessor by introducing RPG elements via a leveling system that allows you to unlock perks, weapons and towers+An absolute blast with friends+Excellent replay-ability by applying 'feats of strength' for additional difficulty, as well as a survival mode. Negatives -Finding people to play with - not a large community :( Verdict >Awesome - recommended!			"

												I recommend this for gamers who like: TD, FPS, Strategy, or Puzzle games.Issues: The game contains language which I advise to not play this game if you dislike swearing.Story: Mostly the game is about 5 people who have to battle creatures who are trying to destroy the core. Similar to most TD games, prevent the creatures or enemies from reaching the end of the ""maze"" of towers and walls you build. I have not completed the campaign yet, so I can't add on to this really.Note: You can't simply let your towers do all the work, there will be times you have to jump in and fight as well.If you have any questions, ask me and I'll answer them as best as I can.

												A CO-OP FPS / Tower Defense.I'm not even a fan of FPS games and this is still my #1 favourite CO-OP game.- You get to toggle 5 difficulty options as you like, and you get a minor reward for playing with higher difficulty too.- Teamplay and communication is extremely useful.- Many ways to beat a level, you feel proud of coming up with a good strategy and overcoming a difficult challenge.- If you're not a fan of tower defense, then make sure you're a fan of FPS shooting to make up for it, as you'll probably end up passing maze and tower building responsabilities to someone that actually knows what they're doing.- You unlock new guns and passive skills to choose from as you progress, giving you some fun things to look forward to.

Building your defenses is just as important as defending the objective and planning what to do next in the next set of enemies as they come rushing towards you. Play as 4 different characters with a whole arsenal of weapons in Sanctum 2, along with the great sets towers and relays to help assist you on your defense that Sanctum 2 has to offer.			"

												Very great game with beautiful graphics. First person shooter hybrid which focuses quite a bit on tower defence which is great. You get to place the bases and create the path for the creeps. Very strategic too and some bases work very well on some creeps whilst others don't.Then you have the boss fights where they give zero ♥♥♥♥s and come through and just outright destroy your bases and towers with their fists leaving you to just your guns and skill.

												Sanctum 1 was a tower defense game with FPS mechanics.  Sanctum 2 has much more limited maze design opportunities but adds Borderlands-style class mechanics with perks, different loadouts, etc.   This changed the game a lot which seems to have upset a lot of Sanctum 1 purists.  However, the changes actually justify the sequel since they amount to a huge overhaul of the game and not simply a slight modification of the original.  The game is designed well, controls well, and runs pretty well.  I've had very occasional glitches but it's better than par for the most part.  Sanctum 2 ends up being much more fun in multiplayer than singleplayer - so much so that I'd really only recommend getting it if you have a friend or two to play with.  That said, it is REALLY fun in mutliplayer and since you can often pick it up for $5 per copy, it's great value.			"

The weapons, towers and maps are all vastly improved over the first Sanctum, and the added experience/level up system is very good. The first person shooting and tower defense are seemlessly blended creating a very fun experience. Very highly recommended.			"

												If you're coming from the first Sanctum I can tell you that this is a clear upgrade rather than an expansion pack.  It enhances upon the original mechanics rather than just deliver new content with no variation.  Staring at the core doesn't make your PC go ""ow whyyyyyy"" as much as it did in the first, camping on the walls isn't as sound a strategy which makes things a bit more challenging and engaging, a lot more diversity in weapons and abilities, bosses add some great ""shake-ups"" to gameplay, and overall the entire formula just feels optimized.The only thing that I feel is just uninteresting is the story.  It's just pointless, I don't care about it.  It all looks pretty and has great aesthetics but the story and character interactions are meh.  Characters themselves have some great personality and design, but in the comic book cutscenes I could really care less.			"

												A great hybrid between a FPS and a Tower-Defense game. You can play Co-op with 4 friends or even 4 random online people. 4 character classes, lots of towers, perks, and not a whole-lot of guns. If you're looking for some fun Co-op, play this. If you're looking for some hard tower-defense, just turn on all ""Feats of Strength"".			"

												So Ive always had a little sweet tooth for Tower Deffense Games. Ive always loved them and will always spend a little time playing them. But Ive never found that ""One"". Sanctum 2 is definitly the closest to what ive been looking for. 1. Its a unique game a mix of a first person shooter and a tower deffense game. 2 It has a variety of maps and enemys which i know alot of games lack. 3. It has somewhat of a storyline which not all games have. 4 Its just a fun time waster Definilty worth the money even though i bought it for $2 since the sale but no matter the price its the gamplay and rather you like it or not.

The game has a better balance between tower defence and fps skill than the first one did. They also do regular updates to the game to improve on things that may be lacking.			"

												Sanctum 2 is a tower defence game where player has to partisipate in the defence akin to FSP-game. This combanitanation brings to the player variating challenges and intriguing gameplay. Players position lies in both desing and upkeeping the defencive maze which the looms will try their hardest to breach. The dificulty scales from easy maps at the start to excingly difflcult maps at the end.After playing the game through once i expericed both the peerless joy of succes and and furustation of loss. The game requires that player is able to adapt to the situation  and act accordingly. On the topic of theme the graphics and soundtrack at least to me created a feeling of ambiance relevan to the situation. There is also a multiplayer option which i personally recomend since the game is to my mind designed to be cleared with 2 or more players.			"

Sanctum 2 isn't bad, in fact it is good, just there are games out there with similar gameplay elements that are better.  If someone were committed to the space/future theme over the magic/fantasy theme, the mechanical/technical feel of Sanctum 2 might appeal to them more, though I feel the Halo-clone enemies in Sanctum 2 lose out in how they lack the whimsy of fighting hordes of cartoony goblins as one does in Orcs Must Die 2.

												I have one version for people who played the original, and for those new to the series. I'll begin with the part for those who played the first.If You Played the First Sanctum: Buy this. If you had any fun on it, buy this. The addition of player health, ammunition, and maximum limit on blocks might be a turn off, and I know it was for me. Nonetheless, I bought it on a sale, because why not? I was not disappointed. After completing the game, I can say with certainty that this game is far superior to the last one. Trust me, buy it.For Those New to the Series: Sanctum 2 is the sequel to the popular game Sanctum, a tower defense game taken to a new direction. It combined FPS elements with tower defense and strategy, as you built mazes to slow progress of monsters travelling on the shortest route to reach the Core, your point of protection. You played down with the blocks/towers, shooting the enemies, sometimes enabling the towers to do damage to them (since a small number of them required to be hit with high damage in a small area to be able to be hit by towers). It was very fun (for me), and I spent hours on it with friends. This game adds restrictions to the maze building system, making it more balanced and fair. It also has new characters, weapons, abilities, enemies, maps, and gameplay improvements. Watch a few videos on YouTube, and if it seems like your cup of tea, buy it, you won't regret it.			"

YouTube™ Video: Sanctum 2 OST Soundtrack - Colossus 

			Views: 2,130		

			I was lucky enough to get my greedy dinosaur hands on the soundtrack to Sanctum 2, composed by the brilliant Lenard Hummer!		

A simple game at its core, Sanctum is exactly what it's called. A Sanctuary to fall back to when life is giving you a hard time.A gem lost in the sands. A simple game from a simple company, yet a beautiful game.The soundtrack is both kickass and pleasant, given the two phases of the game. Constructing and destroying.Compared to the prequel, this one has perks and different characters, allowing for diverse playstyles and some degree of customization. The focus is more on the fps side of the game, so you'll be doing most of the damage instead of the towers, as opposed to the first game.All in all, the Sanctum series is one of those rare cases of a game that had love and care and became something amazing. One of my favourites of all time.			"

												An interesting mix of FPS and tower defence. There is an emphasis on both, all though it feels more weighted towards an FPS - simply because that is your viewpoint into the game.The soundtrack is sublime, and worth listening to offline to fully appreciate. The scenery, skyboxes and level design should be making most big name game developers weep with envy and jealousy.A great game with plenty of replayability, with a good multiplayer community. Worth every penny and puts the majority of mainstream titles I've bought in the last few years to shame.			"

												Heaps of fun. Rewards co-op with good class synergising and feels a little like Borderlands 2, except tower defense. Being able to switch weapons without interrupting reloading works incredibly well, and the constant firing is great fun. There's a good variety of towers with very noticeable upgrades. Designing paths with limited resources needs a bit of thought. Such game. Like Borderlands 2, an all around improvement on the first (which, like Borderlands 1, wasn't bad, just not all that polished). To top it off, it goes on sale so often it's a steal.

												If you're coming from the first Sanctum I can tell you that this is a clear upgrade rather than an expansion pack.  It enhances upon the original mechanics rather than just deliver new content with no variation.  Staring at the core doesn't make your PC go ""ow whyyyyyy"" as much as it did in the first, camping on the walls isn't as sound a strategy which makes things a bit more challenging and engaging, a lot more diversity in weapons and abilities, bosses add some great ""shake-ups"" to gameplay, and overall the entire formula just feels optimized.The only thing that I feel is just uninteresting is the story.  It's just pointless, I don't care about it.  It all looks pretty and has great aesthetics but the story and character interactions are meh.  Characters themselves have some great personality and design, but in the comic book cutscenes I could really care less.			"

TL;DR:While it's not a game for everyone, if you enjoyed tower defence but got bored with the monotony, get this game and hail the triumphant return of Tower Defence.Full Review:It was several years ago, and I'd had enough of the tower defence genre. With countless flash and mobile games that felt almost like carbon copies of each other, it had pretty much stagnated in my eyes. It looked as if the games I had once loved was dead.And then I discovered Sanctum.Sure, the internet connection I had at the time made it impossible for me to play co-op online, but with what little FPS skill I could muster I made due, and I absolutely loved it.Flash-forward to late October 2013, when I found Sanctum 2 on sale. I immediately snapped it up and started playing, and I was far from dissapointed. Coffee Stain had used the 2 years between Sanctum and this game to truly make it worthy of being ""the sequel to the world’s first Tower Defense/FPS hybrid game."" For those of you that played the original, the biggest difference by far is the new resource system, which now has seperate units for constructing the tower bases that outline the maze and the towers that shoot the creeps (""Lumes""). New characters open up brand new strategies for demolishing the relentless horde. Gone now are the teleporter towers, now made pretty much unnesesary by smaller, more focused maps. Recycling towers also gives you all the credits put into them now, with the option to revert to only getting half your resources back avaliable in the ""Hardcore Mode"" Feat of Strength, which also includes no respawn. There are other fairly large differences (was there a 15 tower limit in the original?), but I found that they, like the ones mentioned above, actually added to the fun of the game so much I didn't actually care.For those of you who haven't played the original, this game is possibly the most rewarding co-op game I have ever played, effortlessly combining high-brow Tower Defence strategy with fast-paced, cooperative First Person Shooter action. So for those of you who, like me, became tired of simply observing your towers attempt to beat back the horde, come join us. LOEK III can always use a few more Guardians.			"

												The game is not as exact as the original, in design and gameplay - There are bugs and problems.It is a cross-platform hybrid FPS/Tower Defence game with online matchmaking of various modes and styles, featuring a few customisable character classes and an abundance of weapons, towers and perks. Maps are often not limited to the tower grid and sometimes cover vast explorable distances. Enemies are varied in type and offer ideas for different tactics and strategies though somewhat limited in count. The last wave in a round frequently provides additional challenges and frustrations.So the game offers an interesting blend of thoughtful tower defense and mindless shooting, all wrapped around cool explosions and a chance to deviate from regular gameplay.

												This is an oddity but a singular pleasure in tower defense multiplayer gaming. You're not going to find this experience anywhere else, and it really is worth every minute, but its greatest success is the multiplayer element. Unfortunately difficulty balance and graphics seem inconsistent, but nothing a good team and efficient tower placement can't solve.While you're enjoying the main game content, consider the DLC, especially if you're hankering for more of the same as each DLC includes unique new towers to be used at any time. Perhaps a Santum 3 could bring out the best elements of this title.			"

												The Sanctum series really set the standards of FPS-Tower Defense hybrid. However, Sanctum 2 is very much different than the first Sanctum. While Sanctum is 90% tower defense and 10% hero defense, Sanctum 2 is 50% tower defense and 50% hero defense. This means you can't just build-and-forget like the first Sanctum, where you just have to have enough decent towers and a well-made maze and you'll make it through the waves.In Sanctum 2, you'll have to fire your guns just as often as your towers or you'll lose the wave. This makes for a more immersive game which requires more input and interaction from players, and proper strategies will determine the border between victory or annihilation. Not to mention you can get killed if the wave mobs get close to you.Add a little RPG element to the mix where you get to select a character, equip his/her weapons, select your towers and skills obtained by leveling up, and you have yourself a semi-complex game that will keep you occupied for many hours and offers high replayability value.Pick up a bunch of friends and buy the pack for this game, and you can't go wrong. Most definitely recommended, better than a lot of games currently in the market, and it is very affordable and worth the money.Without a doubt, 8 out of 10.			"

												While Sanctum 2 is a good game, I think the original is better. If you enjoyed the original, the sequel is worth playing. But if youre new to Sanctum, start with the first game, especially if you plan to play alone. There have been several changes to gameplay mechanics, a couple of which are improvements. Some enemies will attack the player instead of just running to the core, and bosses can destroy towers. If you cant afford to fully upgrade a tower you can partially upgrade for a small stat boost. But other changes are restrictive. You can only build 15 towers per map. There are no mid game checkpoints - fail and its back to wave 1. Loadouts are smaller (2 weapons and 4 towers compared to 3 and 6 previously) which means that you cant fully appreciate the tactical depth unless you play with a coop partner who brings different gear. A new range of perks have been added, but the ability to upgrade guns has been removed, and many weapons/towers/perks are locked until you grind enough XP.			"

												Great game, struggling to beat it 100% with all the feats of strength though, stuck on that map with the giant cannon, everything before that I've 100% done. A bit rage inducing and can't alt+f4. The menus are laggy (capped at 30fps) and theres too many prompts of yes/no, the loading screens take a bit to finish. Other than that a great game.For sanctum 3, the block walls should be alittle higher, because some of the enemies look like they can hop over easily but they derp along the path which is funny. With all the feats on, theres alot of weapons/perks/towers than seem rather weak, avoiding that issue would be nice.      Also to add replayability, maybe add a rpg element like borderlands 2 badass points system, where you get points to spend in stats from doing grinding/achievements/victories or whatever, to enhance your characters alittle but not too much to avoid overpowering players. But that will probably create alot of cheaters like with borderlands 2 badass system, but maybe the system could be in the steam cloud rather than on peoples hdd, i dunno, whatever. At least I can just not play with the cheaters xD			"

												Sanctum 2 is a perfect blend of Tower Defence and FPS. It's a great game to play with your friends. Many Unique levels that you can give you great challenges. Not challenging enough? You can add enemy feats to make a challenge that's right for you (with bonus exp I might add). Sanctum 2 is fantastic and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys FPS,  Tower Defence or both!			"

												Really fun hybrid/FPS TD game. Before the level you pick your character, weapon and the perks and towers you want to equip. You also unlock more as you rank up and can gain more xp with applying buffs (feats of strength) to give you bonus XP. Before the waves start you run around building the blocks/foundations and then spend money to build the towers you've equipped in the loadout or upgrade them. Then you start the wave and while the towers you built are doing their job you just run around blowing up alien-like creatures and gunning them down. I love TD games/maps and this is really fun! Even better I got this for $3 USD on the Lunar sale instead of $15.  Still worth it either way, though. It's a must-buy, especially at sale price.Pros:-Fun as fun can be-Graphics are decent and pretty, nice environment and textures.-Running around blowing things up while towers work is fun.-Maze maze maze.-Heaps of perks and towers to unlock.-Can play solo, co-op or online. Private or public.-Bosses can smash your towers so prioritise them or build empty blocks on the outer perimeter.Cons:-Difficulty scaling isn't perfect. I'm not sure if it scales with more players if you play online/co-op. Starting levels were quite hard, middle levels quite easy,-Needs more content, although the game is cheap.-Repetitive like most TD games, not too[/] much though, just that there's not much different strats you can do, although tactical juxtaposition perk can change things up a bit.

												If you are looking for a good way to spend your time, well this is a game for you. Things to note when you finish the game regularly, you are finished right, wrong.... there are DLCs for Sanctum 2, and by the way its a blast.  And Sanctum 2 has a great story line, that be you have to read it.. All in all its still the first game to use this machanic... the first to have a First-person Tower Defence,,,,Just play the 1st Sanctum, its more as a tutorial then a game, but it Sanctum.. Sanctum2 can be play with 4 people, be it that I might be incorrect, it has a multiplayer co-op champain as well..... Its a great game that I would gladly recommend people to play....If you have children you should probable not let them play this.... it has parts of enemies that go flying, and violence with weapons.... If you are a parent and reading this, you might be thinking to yourself ""What age group can play this""?I would recommand testing them out with the first one before taking the leap into 2..... But mainly do not let a 5 year old play this... 11 is fine, 12.... yes they can play this game, if they do not have any medical problems to violence, then its fine.... 13 and over they can play it.... ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::SPOILER WARNING::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Now after finished the regulare route, then pop on over to the DLCs for more.You gain more weapons, towers and power ups..... as well as enemies....And the story line is greatly extented...There are a total of 4 DLCs and 2 DLC packs (skins and soundtracks)You also gain a super cute and helpful robot, I have found some power-ups to suck... incredibly....AND THERE ARE BEES................................. AND THE ENEMEIES WILL ALL BE LIKE ""NOT THE BEEEEEEEEEEES""And also, there is no end after this DLC, non-what so ever... but the wave count to actully finishing  the entire game is at large, I`m not joking about that.... It has so many waves of monsters on the last stand, I actully tryed to finished but got bord right around 45-50.... to be honest, you need all the players you can get.... and the sandbox to do it... (and no you cannot do it on sandbox)....If any of you who have read this, and are confused then leave a comment... I will modify this to meet your expectations.... and please do not write something if necesary... I mean it...(Also to note... Finish Sanctum, then go onto Sanctum2... You will thank yourself for doing it... It makes this game a hole lot better, and easier to finish....)I recommend the game.... good job Coffee, for making this great game........... Thank you(And note, stop reading this sentence)..........			"

												On the surface, Sanctum 2 is a basic tower defense shooter, with much better than indie graphics and voice overs (I want to marry Sweet), and a strange fixation on irrelevant details (why all this modeling of bars and security points that have nothing to do with the game?).  In contrast to Dungeon Grinders.. I mean Defenders, Sanctum eschews the farming and looting in favor of straight game play.  It does have experience and levels, but they're mostly a minor annoyance.  Like DD, the first person shooter element isn't strongly emphasized as the enemies are all very predictable and tower placement usually dominates your chances of success.Where Sanctum really shines is the point after you've beaten the normal levels by randomly throwing down some towers and running wildly around blasting everything.  Flip on all the bad guy boosts and suddenly you have a very serious co-op puzzle game.  Which perks to take, what guns, and how to lay out your towers become hard questions, with different answers for every map.  Climbing the leaderboard becomes a competitive challenge.If you enjoy cooperatively solving hard optimization problems, I strongly recommend Sanctum 2 with a friend.Sanctum 2 does have some weak points.  The experience/level system just gets in the way and should've been scrapped.    There are too many perks and even when you know them all, it can be hard to find the one you want.  Number of players scaling is sometimes a factor.  Hoard avoided this by having specific maps for specific numbers of players.  Sanctum tries to pretend boosting the health of enemies is close enough.  It isn't and it makes leaderboard comparisons problematic.  The mind control tower introduced in the dlc substantially changes the game and ruins the leaderboard for people without the dlc.  The developers should've had separate ladders for dlc and without.

												Sanctum 2 is a Tower Defense/FPS hybrid game.1. Choose a private or public match (solo, with friends or/and strangers)2. Chosse your map. (4 regions, each region have 4 stages).3. Choose from four unique character (four classes).4. Choose your weapons (primary and secundary).5. Choose your perks, (max of three) affecting your caracther, the core, or the gun.6. Manage your resources (walls and towers).6.1. Build your maze (You gather new walls each wave).6.2. Place you towers (You gather scrap each wave).7. Fight hordes of enemies (various waves).+ With multiple players monsters become more powerful but also more recourses are avaliable, making the maps more easy.+ Plays like the best FPS(s), controls are smooth (very important IMO).+ Monsters show damage taken which is nice.+ Sound and music suits the game (actually the music is really really good).+ There are interesting Easter eggs.+ The chat features Text to Speech (sounds silly, but is amazing).- In public matches people can hop in and destroy your walls and towers (trolls).- Sometimes you could find yourself trapped in the environment requiring you to suicide.- Screenshots make justice, but bould be better optimized. Please turn off the Bloom.- Some towers are simply sub-par to others.Sincerally, I'm more excited for Sanctum3 than other blockbusters.[9/10]			"

TL;DR:While it's not a game for everyone, if you enjoyed tower defence but got bored with the monotony, get this game and hail the triumphant return of Tower Defence.Full Review:It was several years ago, and I'd had enough of the tower defence genre. With countless flash and mobile games that felt almost like carbon copies of each other, it had pretty much stagnated in my eyes. It looked as if the games I had once loved was dead.And then I discovered Sanctum.Sure, the internet connection I had at the time made it impossible for me to play co-op online, but with what little FPS skill I could muster I made due, and I absolutely loved it.Flash-forward to late October 2013, when I found Sanctum 2 on sale. I immediately snapped it up and started playing, and I was far from dissapointed. Coffee Stain had used the 2 years between Sanctum and this game to truly make it worthy of being ""the sequel to the world’s first Tower Defense/FPS hybrid game."" For those of you that played the original, the biggest difference by far is the new resource system, which now has seperate units for constructing the tower bases that outline the maze and the towers that shoot the creeps (""Lumes""). New characters open up brand new strategies for demolishing the relentless horde. Gone now are the teleporter towers, now made pretty much unnesesary by smaller, more focused maps. Recycling towers also gives you all the credits put into them now, with the option to revert to only getting half your resources back avaliable in the ""Hardcore Mode"" Feat of Strength, which also includes no respawn. There are other fairly large differences (was there a 15 tower limit in the original?), but I found that they, like the ones mentioned above, actually added to the fun of the game so much I didn't actually care.For those of you who haven't played the original, this game is possibly the most rewarding co-op game I have ever played, effortlessly combining high-brow Tower Defence strategy with fast-paced, cooperative First Person Shooter action. So for those of you who, like me, became tired of simply observing your towers attempt to beat back the horde, come join us. LOEK III can always use a few more Guardians.			"

												The game is not as exact as the original, in design and gameplay - There are bugs and problems.It is a cross-platform hybrid FPS/Tower Defence game with online matchmaking of various modes and styles, featuring a few customisable character classes and an abundance of weapons, towers and perks. Maps are often not limited to the tower grid and sometimes cover vast explorable distances. Enemies are varied in type and offer ideas for different tactics and strategies though somewhat limited in count. The last wave in a round frequently provides additional challenges and frustrations.So the game offers an interesting blend of thoughtful tower defense and mindless shooting, all wrapped around cool explosions and a chance to deviate from regular gameplay.

												The first flavor is sweetness, like a sweet pickle, which I actually don’t care for. But after there’s a strong and pleasant herbal dill note along with a weird sort of garlic flavor. The tartness that emulates vinegar comes in slowly. Overall, it’s a good likeness of a pickle in dissolvable form. I would have liked a little less sweet, which I understand is hard to do with candy, but perhaps a dash of salt. Mostly, it lacks the texture, that crunch, the coldness from the fridge that are elements I enjoy in my pickle. My mouth never quite watered during the experience like it does with some good, refrigerator-cold, fresh pickles. "

												Sanctum 1 was a tower defense game with FPS mechanics.  Sanctum 2 has much more limited maze design opportunities but adds Borderlands-style class mechanics with perks, different loadouts, etc.   This changed the game a lot which seems to have upset a lot of Sanctum 1 purists.  However, the changes actually justify the sequel since they amount to a huge overhaul of the game and not simply a slight modification of the original.  The game is designed well, controls well, and runs pretty well.  I've had very occasional glitches but it's better than par for the most part.  Sanctum 2 ends up being much more fun in multiplayer than singleplayer - so much so that I'd really only recommend getting it if you have a friend or two to play with.  That said, it is REALLY fun in mutliplayer and since you can often pick it up for $5 per copy, it's great value.			"

												Sanctum 2 is an enjoyable co-op game combining tower defense and FPS gameplay in a neat integrated package. You have a build phase during which you build your maze and deploy or upgrade tower weapons. This whole process is much more streamlined than the original game. Once your team is happy with the set up you activate the wave. Then it is shoot to kill using your own personal weapons. This part of the game is also more satisfying than the original because there seems to be less clumping of the enemies and therefore less ""Blast away without aiming"" style gun play. The game is certainly well equipped to provide many evenings of inexpensive fun for a group of friends.			"

The first person shooting and tower defense are seemlessly blended creating a very fun experience. Very highly recommended.			"

												Sanctum 1 was a tower defense game with FPS mechanics.  Sanctum 2 has much more limited maze design opportunities but adds Borderlands-style class mechanics with perks, different loadouts, etc.   This changed the game a lot which seems to have upset a lot of Sanctum 1 purists.  However, the changes actually justify the sequel since they amount to a huge overhaul of the game and not simply a slight modification of the original.  The game is designed well, controls well, and runs pretty well.  I've had very occasional glitches but it's better than par for the most part.  Sanctum 2 ends up being much more fun in multiplayer than singleplayer - so much so that I'd really only recommend getting it if you have a friend or two to play with.  That said, it is REALLY fun in mutliplayer and since you can often pick it up for $5 per copy, it's great value.			"

												So Ive always had a little sweet tooth for Tower Deffense Games. Ive always loved them and will always spend a little time playing them. But Ive never found that ""One"". Sanctum 2 is definitly the closest to what ive been looking for. 1. Its a unique game a mix of a first person shooter and a tower deffense game. 2 It has a variety of maps and enemys which i know alot of games lack. 3. It has somewhat of a storyline which not all games have. 4 Its just a fun time waster Definilty worth the money even though i bought it for $2 since the sale but no matter the price its the gamplay and rather you like it or not.

												Significant improvement over the first Sanctum. Difficulty is much more quickly ratcheted up in the beginning and often times forces you to directly intervene in the places where your towers can't remove enemies. The gameplay has expanded beyond the tower defense genre with surprises that will disrupt your carefully placed turrets but careful planning will still carry the round.			"

												What can I say about this game? I could discuss its tight controls and fun combat. I could talk about the beautiful art style or the ever expanding loadout configurations. We could even focus on some of the most kick♥♥♥♥♥DLC I've ever seen. But that isn't what sold me this game. Instead, I want to explain the studio's personal touches.First of all, all of the levels have hidden in-game items. This turns each level into a scavenger hunt which forces the player to take a tour of the enviroment and possibly uncover another hidden gem. Easter eggs/hidden rooms. This game is full of them! From functioning arcade machines to secret codes, this game is full of fun surprises. It adds character and humor to another masterpiece from Coffee Stain Studios.			"

												Sanctum 2, I believe, is the only game of it's type. It's a mix of a tower defense game with a first person shooter. You place tower bases to create a path that the monsters will follow. Then you can put machine guns, turrets, etc. on the tower bases. When the monsters come in, instead of letting the turrets do everything, you play as a character of your choice and shoot the monsters as well. The game is really fun, but also difficult in singleplayer. I recommend playing with your friends in co-op because the levels get very challenging.			"

												This game does a fantastic job combining the enjoyment of strategizing in a tower defense with the fast-paced action of a shooter. Unlike a lot of games that try to combine TD with another genre, one style tends to fall short of the other in terms of importance to game content and/or quality. That is not the case in Sanctum. I saw it as a bold move combining the slow meticulous strategy of tower defense with the fast-paced twitch style of FPS but this game knew what it was doing. The tower defense aspect is fun and engaging and not as slow and monotonous as it often is in games like Dungeon Defenders, while the FPS aspect is diverse and rewarding with a multitude of weapons and augmentations.

												I really like the concept of this game.  The ability to move blocks and towers, and swap out towers without penalty, are great touches.  The game was completely different from what I was expecting, and I wish I would have heard of this game sooner.  I love finding a game that introduces me to something new and enjoyable.  Simple and enjoyable.  The maps vary enough to keep things from becoming too redundant.  I like that I can go back to previous maps, and try to set my own goals, such as: fewest blocks and towers used, all turrets, all ground pounders, nothing but blocks, and anything else that creates a challenge.  I really enjoy standing at the exit of a long maze of turrets, just blasting away at those mobs that thought they were going to make it to the end.  Chain-reaction exploding mobs anyone?			"

												I always enjoyed the tower defense games in my ipod, but for the PC, wow, and its multiplayer? i was awe-struck again! The multiplayer is populated and you can even solo if you wish, the communication system is excellent, the game reads your messages through microsoft Sam which is funny. You level up, get new guns, towers, abilities, etc. So many missions. I just got this game for $2.24 but i would still pay $15 for it. I just got the game today and i already spent 13 hours on it.. i feel like its only beed 4 or 5 hours. Time flys by and it gets intense! You rely on your team members to think up new ways on how to succeed. I went ahead and purchased the 4-Pack for $6.74 as a gift for my friends who want to enjoy this game. I want to add one more thing before I post my review - the abuse/kicking system is well thought out. There is no vote-kicking if somebody has gone insane, the host has full control and can easily remove trouble-makers. I have yet to see anybody goin crazy, the players all have a common goal to win and work together. Great game, really great game for a great price. $2.24 for this game? thats the cost of a cheese burger, if you missed the 85% off deal, $15 is just the price of a large pizza. Awesome game A++			"

												On the surface, Sanctum 2 is a basic tower defense shooter, with much better than indie graphics and voice overs (I want to marry Sweet), and a strange fixation on irrelevant details (why all this modeling of bars and security points that have nothing to do with the game?).  In contrast to Dungeon Grinders.. I mean Defenders, Sanctum eschews the farming and looting in favor of straight game play.  It does have experience and levels, but they're mostly a minor annoyance.  Like DD, the first person shooter element isn't strongly emphasized as the enemies are all very predictable and tower placement usually dominates your chances of success.Where Sanctum really shines is the point after you've beaten the normal levels by randomly throwing down some towers and running wildly around blasting everything.  Flip on all the bad guy boosts and suddenly you have a very serious co-op puzzle game.  Which perks to take, what guns, and how to lay out your towers become hard questions, with different answers for every map.  Climbing the leaderboard becomes a competitive challenge.If you enjoy cooperatively solving hard optimization problems, I strongly recommend Sanctum 2 with a friend.Sanctum 2 does have some weak points.  The experience/level system just gets in the way and should've been scrapped.    There are too many perks and even when you know them all, it can be hard to find the one you want.  Number of players scaling is sometimes a factor.  Hoard avoided this by having specific maps for specific numbers of players.  Sanctum tries to pretend boosting the health of enemies is close enough.  It isn't and it makes leaderboard comparisons problematic.  The mind control tower introduced in the dlc substantially changes the game and ruins the leaderboard for people without the dlc.  The developers should've had separate ladders for dlc and without.

												It is one of the best tower defense games! The combination of FPS and tower building gives you an unique game experience. There are various characters to choose from with different capabilities. Much more towers and weapons are available, most of them are rather interesting and have nice effects. The design of the levels is spectacular and gives the game a good atmosphere. The new monsters are cool, however some are not present from the previous game. I think the campaign mode is well balanced, with perks it is even more fun to play. There is a lot more variety compared to the first release. There are even some hidden mini games at some levels, that's a very good idea. I liked Sanctum 2 very much and I hope that there will be more DLC in the future :) I wish all the best for the Team!

												Really fun hybrid/FPS TD game. Before the level you pick your character, weapon and the perks and towers you want to equip. You also unlock more as you rank up and can gain more xp with applying buffs (feats of strength) to give you bonus XP. Before the waves start you run around building the blocks/foundations and then spend money to build the towers you've equipped in the loadout or upgrade them. Then you start the wave and while the towers you built are doing their job you just run around blowing up alien-like creatures and gunning them down. I love TD games/maps and this is really fun! Even better I got this for $3 USD on the Lunar sale instead of $15.  Still worth it either way, though. It's a must-buy, especially at sale price.Pros:-Fun as fun can be-Graphics are decent and pretty, nice environment and textures.-Running around blowing things up while towers work is fun.-Maze maze maze.-Heaps of perks and towers to unlock.-Can play solo, co-op or online. Private or public.-Bosses can smash your towers so prioritise them or build empty blocks on the outer perimeter.Cons:-Difficulty scaling isn't perfect. I'm not sure if it scales with more players if you play online/co-op. Starting levels were quite hard, middle levels quite easy,-Needs more content, although the game is cheap.-Repetitive like most TD games, not too[/] much though, just that there's not much different strats you can do, although tactical juxtaposition perk can change things up a bit.

Things to note when you finish the game regularly, you are finished right, wrong.... there are DLCs for Sanctum 2, and by the way its a blast.  And Sanctum 2 has a great story line, that be you have to read it.. All in all its still the first game to use this machanic... the first to have a First-person Tower Defence,,,,Just play the 1st Sanctum, its more as a tutorial then a game, but it Sanctum.. Sanctum2 can be play with 4 people, be it that I might be incorrect, it has a multiplayer co-op champain as well..... Its a great game that I would gladly recommend people to play....If you have children you should probable not let them play this.... it has parts of enemies that go flying, and violence with weapons.... If you are a parent and reading this, you might be thinking to yourself ""What age group can play this""?I would recommand testing them out with the first one before taking the leap into 2..... But mainly do not let a 5 year old play this... 11 is fine, 12.... yes they can play this game, if they do not have any medical problems to violence, then its fine.... 13 and over they can play it.... ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::SPOILER WARNING::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Now after finished the regulare route, then pop on over to the DLCs for more.You gain more weapons, towers and power ups..... as well as enemies....And the story line is greatly extented...There are a total of 4 DLCs and 2 DLC packs (skins and soundtracks)You also gain a super cute and helpful robot, I have found some power-ups to suck... incredibly....AND THERE ARE BEES................................. AND THE ENEMEIES WILL ALL BE LIKE ""NOT THE BEEEEEEEEEEES""And also, there is no end after this DLC, non-what so ever... but the wave count to actully finishing  the entire game is at large, I`m not joking about that.... It has so many waves of monsters on the last stand, I actully tryed to finished but got bord right around 45-50.... to be honest, you need all the players you can get.... and the sandbox to do it... (and no you cannot do it on sandbox)....If any of you who have read this, and are confused then leave a comment... I will modify this to meet your expectations.... and please do not write something if necesary... I mean it...(Also to note... Finish Sanctum, then go onto Sanctum2... You will thank yourself for doing it... It makes this game a hole lot better, and easier to finish....)I recommend the game.... good job Coffee, for making this great game...........

Building your defenses is just as important as defending the objective and planning what to do next in the next set of enemies as they come rushing towards you. Play as 4 different characters with a whole arsenal of weapons in Sanctum 2, along with the great sets towers and relays to help assist you on your defense that Sanctum 2 has to offer.			"

												Sanctum 2 is a very nice polished and overall well made game in which the developers managed to combine both the fps and the tower defense elements very well. It also has a very big variety of both towers and weapons so you can try and use multiple combination since all of them are 100% valid for gameplay use, making it so that you can create your very own build that might or might not work depending the way you use them and the situation.Personally I have found Sanctum 2 to be able to keep me entertained for hours either on a solo gameplay or in co-op with difficult stages that required me to change my strategies, tactics and placement in order to pass it. Also, just like in any good tower defense game, there was almost always a new enemy to encounter, sometime it was a support enemy healer or buffer, or others where heavily armored with weak spots or just some fast moving targets that you had to be careful about because they could one shot you my running over you. Also the voice acting is amazing the dialogues where nice and appealing to each character alike. The story might not have been just as good as the gameplay or other previously mentioned aspects of the game but it certaintly is good enough to at least keep you interested in it.So over all this game is really fun and balanced, as I said before the arsenal provided to you is really nice and useful, it might not have such a big replay value appart from finding some hidden stuff in some maps and trying a new build, but nonetheless it's a very nice, polished game with a great feelling in its gameplay, the controls are smooth, the only bad thing is that you can get stuck in some places and either have to suicide or just be unable to move but that doesn't really happens often unleash you just jump around all the map :P, and it has a very decent co-op.Oh and also there is free comics. That's always good ain't it? :D			"

												A CO-OP FPS / Tower Defense.I'm not even a fan of FPS games and this is still my #1 favourite CO-OP game.- You get to toggle 5 difficulty options as you like, and you get a minor reward for playing with higher difficulty too.- Teamplay and communication is extremely useful.- Many ways to beat a level, you feel proud of coming up with a good strategy and overcoming a difficult challenge.- If you're not a fan of tower defense, then make sure you're a fan of FPS shooting to make up for it, as you'll probably end up passing maze and tower building responsabilities to someone that actually knows what they're doing.- You unlock new guns and passive skills to choose from as you progress, giving you some fun things to look forward to.

												It's an anime-like tower defense game with a FPS view as you contruct towers to destroy on-coming waves of enemies, while reinforcing your defenses with your guns. You can play as four different character, each with thier strengths and weaknesses, but only once you unlock them (it happens quickly).			"

												Man, Sanctum 2 is one of my favorite games of all time. The guys that made Goat Simulator made this game first, and it sure is a gem that should be played by everyone. I love how it uses the tower defense genre simultaneously with some first-person shooter gameplay, and without any of the clutter many games like Orcs Must Die and PVZ: Garden Warefare have shown. There's some basic class customization that's simple but changes each level's approach immensely. Also, multiplayer is awesome, especially in later levels where teamwork is key to victory. I didn't buy the DLC, but I know I should have since it unlocks tons of valuable features that are definitely worth the extra cash. Hilarious and interactive easter eggs can be found all over the normal looking levels too. One level actually has a full-on arcade in the sky where you can play mini-games, it's awesome. Grab some friends to play with, and check this game out if you haven't yet.Rating: 10/10Recommended Price: $15			"

												This game is such an improvement from sanctum.The soundtrack is just amazing, one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard.The lore can be very catchy, I really liked. It's not like one of those games where you shoot enemies and they just keep coming bcuz they like dying, It actually makes some kind of sense why they keep suiciding to get your cores.You should really consider buying the season pack, it's pretty hard to do it without all the additional content, some achievements can only be unlocked with dlcs, so yeah.gameplay can feel repetitive, somehow this game managed to hook me in without caring about it, it may hook you too.Definetely take it if it's on sale10/10 would bang.

												Compared to Sanctum 1 this focuses a bit more on the shooter part than the tower defense part. Some of the new changes are nice (characters, weapons, leveling), others need a little work (timed build phase, resource management). Still a fun hybrid of First Person Shooter and Tower Defense. Seems like a lot of people who think it sucks just  wanted an updated Sanctum 1 and didn't bother to look into the game before buying it. The resources and tower limit were both known about before release. The resources definitely needs work, would like to see a few more towers available each wave as well. The tower limit makes you think of placement even more, and I have only hit the cap once so far. Would recommend buying the game but waiting on the Season Pass for now.			"

												Amazing co-op game. There is a range of ways you can play, to accomodate everyone from the hardcore FPS type to the complete newbie - without feeling useless in a team. Great level design. There is rarely ""one true solution"", so it keeps me thinking. The enemies range from cute to cool to just plain annoying - but they all provide challenge. Love the character customization, it gives me a ton of options to experiment with such that the gameplay never gets stale. The story told through comics is a great addition as well, and I can't wait to see how they wrap things up. Also, major props to the team for providing frequent updates. I was playing when it launched and there were a number of problems, but they were all fixed within a week. They're attentive to the community, and that's awesome. <3			"

I only wish there were more variation in the kind of enemies you encounter, though it gets kind of intense when a Boss smashes your walls down and the small stuff keep pouring through straight to the core and ♥♥♥♥ it up.Definitively worth picking it up when it goes up for a sale at like 5€ or so.

Its not very difficult to get into the game at first, the tutorial is easy to comprehend and teaches you basically everything you need to know. The only hitch of this game... unless you have more than 1 friend, this game will get boring very quick. I recommend this game to anyone who's a social monster outside of the gaming realm. 10/10 would get myself a friend to play this.			"

												This game surprised me. I had it on my ""Not gonna play it"" list and because I was bored I gave it a try, I haven't regret any second of it till then. I totally recommend it, go buy it and play it co-op. There is still awesome people hanging around who will join you and help you completting the different maps. Campaing mode isn't very long although some maps will get hard and you might replay them. Survivor mode is challenging and sandbox mode is interesting to hanging around and try new things. Some maps also have easter eggs which gives the game also a little touch of exploration (plus the fact that you must understand how each map works).Definately looking forward to Sanctum 3 or get the DLCs when they are cheaper.

												If you liked Sanctum or are interested in tower defense games then you will probably love Sanctum 2! On top of what the original offers, it has new maps and several new enemies, weapons, and towers. Even cooler are some of the other new additions: you now get to select one of 4 characters/classes each time you play, the characters gain levels, and other than weapons and towers you also get abilities for your character to customize them further to your style. They also made coop play easier, and you can play any of the maps or campaign solo or with friends, or join other random players if you want. They also added some challenge parameters you can toggle if you choose like increasing the speed of the enemies or giving them regeneration and so on. Definitely worth picking up.			"

												I and my friends loved sanctum1 and for us, this game seemed like a no brainer purchase.  Over a year later I come back to see if they fixed any of the grievances people had on launch and it looks like they haven't really done much since on day one, one of the devs was flaming people and telling them ""Just go play Sanctum 1 then.""   This game isn't horrible, but compared to what it could have been it is just a big disappointment.  The dev team fell victim to a common mistake in gaming where they get rid of old (good) features and add some new ones instead.  IMO they could've had both.  Whereas the first game could easily be given an 8/10 by me, this one sits at a 7/10.  So why the negative? Because the developers made it clear on day one that they'd rather you go play Santcum 1 than spend your money on this second-rate sequel.			"

												 This game is really quite fun. I liked Sanctum, though I had trouble getting into it, it seemed a bit too daunting to me in terms of what it demanded from me. I had no qualms with the mazing aspect, though allocating money to many different areas on the game field was very daunting. Sanctum 2 fixes all that. All resources earned are decided to mazing. One can easily and respectibly call this a sequel, in that it not only adds new content, but it improves the original in just about every aspect, while still sticking to the core of the game. Don't expect the exact same as Sanctum 1. The maps are smaller, though there are many more of them. I would recommend buying Sanctum 2 now for a great summer experience! This game has incredibly high replayability in trying to earn spots on the leaderboards based on the number of waves survived in survival mode, as well as in trying out different strategies, and in just playing with others. With much more content promised through DLCs and a large amount of existing content, what reason is there to not get a game as awesome as Sanctum 2? If you are a fan of Strategy and First Person Shooters, this is for sure a game to check out.			"

Lovers of classic tower defence games can immersive themselves into their mazes round after round, rebuilding and reimagining the map as they see fit when they see fit, while the FPS half of the game is equally entertaining and allows for you to get dirty with your creations while adding even more strategy to the mix.Conceptually simple and easy to understand Sanctum 2 can be picked up and played by almost anyone, anytime, with no shortage of depth to the game and without being tediously repetitive.Loved it.

												This is, quite simply, the best co-op tower defense game ever made. That's not a huge claim because there aren't that many of them in the first place, but for someone who really loves the gerne like me this game really is a blessing.Its production values are high, which means that the ingame comics, the graphics, the sound and the effects are all top-notch (especially considering the price when it was on sale or in the Humble Bundle).The way the game is played is simple, it's a Dungeon Defenders-esque TD+shooter where you place blocks in squares on the map in a way that makes the enemies lose as much time as possible. Those blocks act as walls and as tower bases, which means you can either leave them there or build towers on top of them.There is also a metagame, as you can level up and unlock more weapons, more towers/tower slots, more weapons and more perks/perk slots.There is not much grinding as far as I have seen: you won't need to endlessly repeat old levels to be good enough to make it to the next one, although you will occasionally hit a wall where you're going to need to replay previous stages.The variety in weapons, enemies and towers is more than satisfactory, and you're going to find out each enemy's weak spot soon enough, as they try to make it as obvious as possible (for example, there's one type of enemy that will take literally 0 damage from the front, so you need to distract him with something else as you hit him from behind).One thing I will say about the difficulty though is that finishing the game solo is pretty much impossible. This game was made with co-op in mind, and if you don't have anyone to play with you better either find someone or join public servers, as it's really the only viable way to play this game.And speaking of public servers, you MIGHT have a problem with latency with this particular game. I couldn't connect to any pub games without horrific lag, and couldn't even play with a friend that lives relatively close to me.However, if you happen to stumble upon this problem, I have a solution for you: Tunngle.Just download it, google ""Sanctum 2 Tunngle"" and play there. It is not illegal in any way, so don't worry. It will create a fake LAN server for you to play on, without lag (assuming your co-op buddies don't have terrible internet).			"

												Sanctum 2 is definitely worth the purchase.  The game is difficult but not too difficult or frustrating like most Tower Defense games.  The difference here is that you actually have control of the game in a FPS way.  Not only do you place walls, towers, and other goodies, but you are also in the arena fighting the waves first hand.There are a few issues with the game.   For one playing by yourself is just not fun.  Difficulty scales with number of players but teamwork is far superior than lone wolfing.  Another issue is the controls being awkward.  Playing with a controller makes things easier, since the game is made for the Xbox 360.  But what makes the games' controls awkward is that you have to understand that it's an FPS so you also have to place/upgrade/sell the walls/turrets/dispensers in first person view.  The placement system is also bright and kinda distracting.  The weird thing is that you also see what other players are ""planning"" to build.  It makes for easy communication when building the path way but sometimes you get your build tool mixed up with your allies build tools.  At least the upside on that is if you misplace your wall/tower you can always sell it for all of your resources back.Besides the issues which I would consider pretty minor, I would rate this game extremely playable and worth the purchase.  Tower defense games are naturally addicting but then you add in FPS too it?  Well I'm sold!			"

												a fantastic hybrid of tower defense and FPS. Do not play singleplayer.. multiplayer is where it's at.Working together and using your wits and skills to survive is a blast...a bit of a steep learning curve due to the limited amount of weapon towers, timed build rounds, and ability to build diagonal walls. Howver once the learning curve is passed it's great. I'm not sure if 15$ is the best price. 10 bucks seems better. big problem is this is a game you NEED to play with friends to enjoy, but you can jump into random groups.Game rating: 8/10. GreatPricing: slightly too much. Wait till on a minor sale.Recomended: hell yes.			"

												As a fan of the original Sanctum, playing this game can feel a little weird. Firstly, you're far more limited on towers, with you starting off only being able to deploy/upgrade 1 kind of tower and can get a max of 4 as you progress. You also only have 2 weapons. Before you had a giant blank canvas to develop into a maze of towers with your core WAY off at the end, now your core is almost in the middle of things. So if you've developed tactics from the first game, they won;t fly in this one. Instead of a ton of towers, you're better off with a few that get a lot of upgrades. And instead of only really needing to shoot a few special enemies, now you're gonna be in the thick of it, so pick your weapons carefully.Honetly, from what I've seen this game takes Sanctum in a direction that it seemed to be heading for anyway. The first was almsot all about tower placement and maze formation, while this game gives the FPS elements more of the spotlight. The two work well together despite what you'd think, and it adds a level of tactical gameplay with the limiting of towers and weapons not to mention character selection since each has their own signiture weapon and defauly bonuses.

												So,here comes the sequel of a good game.What differences of it? The 2nd part involves both FPS and TD elements as vital,snice in original you could just upgrade your guns to stronger than towers,or vice versa.The funniest things is humor related to weakspots and easter eggs.The coop game experience varies from player to play and their prefrences(i.e not being overpowered).It has bugs though,but thanks to devs,its feels so much better than it was at launch(where reviews where mixed).Ethier way,its worth your time even at full price. And i'd rate it 8/10 due to some bugs and some bad elements on it. The original one is 7/10 instead due to reason above.			"

												8/10A great concept, FPS meets tower defense, in up to four player co-op going against hoards of aliens trying to destroy your precious white orbs that float in the corner. The artistic style in this game is unmatched, particuarly the future city levels, and the comic book style taken between levels. A major advancement of the first, it offers four playable characters, and a fifth DLC, along with a hoast of different map sizes, layouts and routines to challenge even the most competitive and prepared teams.The level of strategy comes from the types of towers that are placed in the arena, As you level up your character, you unlock new weapons and towers, with each one being more or less useful against the dozen or so different types of enemies. There are a number of modes, but the best action comes from the frantic end stage bosses that leave teams struggling to survive and defend the last of their resources.The reload mechanic is odd, with no actual ammo being required, rather you just wait or change weapon for stock to reload. Careful balance of shooting, dodging and tower preparation and location are crucial to survival. A truely unique, enjoyable tower defense game.			"

This game is extremely fun to play. It looks cool, plays cool. The main point of the game is Tower Defense mixed with FPS. In Sanctum 2, it's not one or the other. BOTH need to be utilized in order to be victorious, which adds a further challenge to the game.As if the game wasn't hard enough. You need the help of some fellow buddies to accomplish your goal. They bring along extra firepower and resources to build more stuff.In terms of gameplay, hybrid tower defense and FPS is a splendid idea. There are tons of towers, guns and perks allowing you to mix and match to your specialty. The towers range from laser beams, tripmine dispensers, super long range sniper towers, amplification towers, drone launchers and even rocket towers!The guns range from melee saws, Tesla beams, shotguns, snipers, rocket launchers, and even drone launchers, wait didn't we have those..BUY THE GAME WILL YA I NEED SOMEONE TO JOIN IN MY PARTY			"

												You can be a little girl that goes flying from the recoil of a rocket launcher. 10/10 for real physics.Simply put... It's like playing some of those really great Warcraft 3 mazing tower defense games, where you build your towers to maze and fight enemies wave after wave. Instead of merely watching your towers though, you can join in, like any smart builder would do, using one of four (five is DLC (I THINK)) characters, and a choice of weapons, towers and perks, you can frankly, change the output of any game by pulling aggro (bit sorry for the MMO term).There's a bunch of easter eggs ingame, and there's a butt load of fun to be had by parkouring your way out of the maps, or in Bio Lab's case, merely dropping through a hole, next to a Gandalf easter egg. Just, try not to get mad if you're online and didn't discuss the mazing technique to be done.Oh and, if you do use the rocket launcher, try not to commit suicide. You really underestimate how far the closest cliff actually is sometimes.			"

												At first I did not want to buy this game, the screenshots didnt look very promising. But then I got convinced by a friend and started playing it --- it's incredibly awesome, a must have for a tower defense fan like me.It combines:- tactical towerdefense with a lot of different and interesting towers, each one you can upgrade 3 times and then overcharge them, so they get even more powerful- a kind of ego shooter to support your towers and a lot of possibilities to increase your strategy- many different monsters with abilities and weak spots, making every one of them a challenge and worthy opponent- a lot of hours of fun playing due to a long campaign and currently 4 addons, also a survival mode and hardcore-options- multiplayer fun with up to 4 playersI just can recommend this game to everyone who loves strategy and tower defense.

												One of the best cooperative games out there for sure. The FPS is clunky at first but gets very smooth when you learn it.Map variety is not huge, the theme however is very vibrant, and the monster variety- well, the variety of how to kill monsters, are quite good. Not to mention, this is clearly a Tower Defense game too, but dont forget your character can shoot, and it really comes in to play if you're a good player or not by the way you setup perks and shoot, rather than letting your towers do all work. There is TONS of hours you could sink in to this with friends to play with. I also recommend to buy the game from a third party, cause you can basically get the whole package with all DLC's for most likely cheaper. Ahem, hint hint G33 two A (you know what i mean).			"

Each type of monster is pretty unique and boss battle are very tense. I dunno if multiplayer is alive, but this game is definitely WORTH checking. I highly enjoyed playing with others. It also has different types of difficulty , so i DOUBT that you will be bored. Also very well drawn insert comics ( i like the style ) .And music. Music is AWESOME. Unique characters, unique atmosphere, i love the game.			"

												Excellent game to play with friends. Although playing solo is doable, the game really shines when you have a team, since you can bring more towers and split up to cover multiple objectives.Pros: - Fun gameplay, especially in co-op- Stunning graphics, great soundtrack, well-paced progression system, lots of guns/towers/perks to customize your playstyle- DLC is a great value and effectively doubles the length of the game + number of guns/towers/perks at your disposal- Wide variety of enemies with different abilities, strengths, and weaknesses- Optional Feats of Strength add an extra level of difficulty, great for second playthroughs- Entertaining text-to-speech in the chat boxCons: - Performance isn't the best on lower-end machines- Can get rather difficult if you're playing solo- Not much reason to return to the game once you're level 50 and have beaten all the missions on 5 Feats of StrengthEven though I've finished everything this game had to offer, I had a great run with it, and would definitely recommend it to anyone.

												Great mix of TD and FPS. I've enjoyed many hours of game play. This game has lots and lots of replay potential. Game plays well on Linux Mint 18.Beyond that, I'm not going to give a detailed review of the game because so many others have already done a far better job than I would have. This review is just to add my 'recommend' to this game's rating. Please see the other reviews for specifics about this game to determine if it's right for you.PS I almost exclusively play offline. So Steam only shows that I played 0.4 hrs although I've played at least 30 hrs (as of the time of this review) and plan to play much more. It seems like offline game time would be an easy enough metric to collect that it makes me wonder why they don't.			"

												While Sanctum 2 is a good game, I think the original is better. If you enjoyed the original, the sequel is worth playing. But if youre new to Sanctum, start with the first game, especially if you plan to play alone. There have been several changes to gameplay mechanics, a couple of which are improvements. Some enemies will attack the player instead of just running to the core, and bosses can destroy towers. If you cant afford to fully upgrade a tower you can partially upgrade for a small stat boost. But other changes are restrictive. You can only build 15 towers per map. There are no mid game checkpoints - fail and its back to wave 1. Loadouts are smaller (2 weapons and 4 towers compared to 3 and 6 previously) which means that you cant fully appreciate the tactical depth unless you play with a coop partner who brings different gear. A new range of perks have been added, but the ability to upgrade guns has been removed, and many weapons/towers/perks are locked until you grind enough XP.			"

												Great game, struggling to beat it 100% with all the feats of strength though, stuck on that map with the giant cannon, everything before that I've 100% done. A bit rage inducing and can't alt+f4. The menus are laggy (capped at 30fps) and theres too many prompts of yes/no, the loading screens take a bit to finish. Other than that a great game.For sanctum 3, the block walls should be alittle higher, because some of the enemies look like they can hop over easily but they derp along the path which is funny. With all the feats on, theres alot of weapons/perks/towers than seem rather weak, avoiding that issue would be nice.      Also to add replayability, maybe add a rpg element like borderlands 2 badass points system, where you get points to spend in stats from doing grinding/achievements/victories or whatever, to enhance your characters alittle but not too much to avoid overpowering players. But that will probably create alot of cheaters like with borderlands 2 badass system, but maybe the system could be in the steam cloud rather than on peoples hdd, i dunno, whatever. At least I can just not play with the cheaters xD			"

												The Sanctum series really set the standards of FPS-Tower Defense hybrid. However, Sanctum 2 is very much different than the first Sanctum. While Sanctum is 90% tower defense and 10% hero defense, Sanctum 2 is 50% tower defense and 50% hero defense. This means you can't just build-and-forget like the first Sanctum, where you just have to have enough decent towers and a well-made maze and you'll make it through the waves.In Sanctum 2, you'll have to fire your guns just as often as your towers or you'll lose the wave. This makes for a more immersive game which requires more input and interaction from players, and proper strategies will determine the border between victory or annihilation. Not to mention you can get killed if the wave mobs get close to you.Add a little RPG element to the mix where you get to select a character, equip his/her weapons, select your towers and skills obtained by leveling up, and you have yourself a semi-complex game that will keep you occupied for many hours and offers high replayability value.Pick up a bunch of friends and buy the pack for this game, and you can't go wrong. Most definitely recommended, better than a lot of games currently in the market, and it is very affordable and worth the money.Without a doubt, 8 out of 10.			"

Increasing waves of diffrent enemies within a 3D environment demand a lot of planning and foresight thus you have to choose carefully which character, towers, skills and weapons you let come to use. Sanctum 2 proves, that lovely but simple browsergame genres like tower defense games are absolutely capable of evolving to the next level of gameplay and long term motivation.			"

												The base game is an interesting combination of tower defense and first person shooter and it gets even more interesting in multiplayer when you can have four players jumping around with a combination of sixteen different towers shooting everywhere. With the combination of weapons and perks you can choose how you want to fight, a sniper, an area damager, a distraction, and so you can tailor your towers to fit. The DLCs for the game all together basically double the base game in most respects and are tottaly worth it if you enjoyed the game.			"

												An amazing tower defence game - and probably the only one truly good hybrid between FPS and TD. If you liked Orcs Must Die and don't mind futuristic setting then you almost surely going to like Sanctum 2.I played the first Sanctum and I HATED it because of boring shooting mechanics and clunky building process. But the second one is such a great improvement in every aspect! Shooting guns now feels a lot more satisfying and game mechanics overall greatly improved in both tower building and FPS aspects. Also this game have one of the best visual designs I've seen in a long time. Everything - guns, towers, characters, enemies and maps environments - looks very nice and stylized. Even If you hate the first one, just like I do - the second game is worth a shoot, it's A LOT better.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game. I still recommend you buy it, especially if you played the first game, but let's go over a few new details. In Sanctum 1, it was all about the towers and a lovely first person tower defense game...however, in Sanctum 2 there are tons of changes from the first game that make it more of a challenge and overall different feel compared to the first game. You get a limit on how many towers can place, they cost more, they are harder to upgrade, and it relies on you to kill most of the enemies with the towers as support instead of vice versa from the original game. To me, I had to rethink and form almost completely new strategies for this game. That being said, it is still a fantastic, albeit difficult, game. The maps are all new with beautiful design to them, and many of which can allow you to go back and play them again by creating a new path they may be better than your original to lead the Lumes (enemies) through. The towers in this game are familiar with the first one with a couple of new editions. Also there are 4 characters you can play as and customize with various perks, weapons, and towers for endless possibilities strategically. Some maps are more difficult than others and will frustrate you as they did me. Sometimes I'm led to believe this game was meant to be played with others through co-op in order to beat the levels, but then I find a new plan that works and even though it may be hard, you can solo this game should you wish. Overall, I give this game a solid 8 out of 10 if I had to, and I recommend it to those of you who love real time strategy, FPS, and/or tower defense games. This game just has it all wrapped into one. Also, I strongly recommend it to those of you who are in need of a game outside of TF2 and looking for another great multiplayer game you can play together and have some fun. The single-player side is great--don't misunderstand--, but that feeling of success when shared with friends after beating a level makes it oh-so-much-more satisfying.			"

												Bought this game on a sale - 40 hours later I'm wondering where my time has gone by.This is a very active FPS tower defense game. You have a vast choice of towers which are effective against various ennemies  and therefore suit different strategies. You can instantly check how effective they actually are in terms of total damage, damage during the last mob round, etc. You are also able to re-arrange and replace them if necessary ; but on a higher level this would result in a money penalty, therefore prompting you to think well ahead. The various classes add great variety as each of them have their own strengths. Fear not if you worry about your aim: there is a mad rocket launcher girl. Just shoot away and blow stuff up.Over time you gain experience and levels which unlock new towers, new weapons and new stat effects. They become extremely relevant once you play with other people. Do you prefer a passive support role or would you rather be a living killing machine with infinite respawns? The choice is up to you. The multiplayer is defintely a lot of fun ; and the community has been surprinsingly NICE. Maybe the text to speech ability encourages others to be friendly? The setups are pretty simple: you can either play your campaign on your own or allow other players to join you. While you have no control over who joins you, you're able to kick/ban players if necessary. Loot is always fairly distributed which allows everyone to participate actively in reinforcing your defences. The gameplay is definitely top-notch. Consequently you actually don't even pay attention to other facts - such as surprinsingly good graphics and music. I had no lag / spike issues either during my online campaign. The game goes even beyond being a FPS TD game by pushing the player to explore its maps in order to find easter eggs, secret areas and even playable arcade games. That's pretty unique - and also rewarded through achievements! To be honest I'm only annoyed by the fact that you need all the DLCs in oder to get 100% achievements. I'll wait for a sale, but so far the game has been fantastic.Edit: Recently got the Season Pass - and it's amazing! The DLCs provide awesome content in terms of story, maps, new ennemies, etc. Fantastic. :-)			"

												It is impossible to deny that Coffee Stain Studios took just about everything good in Sanctum and amped it up tenfold for Sanctum 2. Enhancing the coop mode by adding three new player characters alongside the original protagonist, each specializing in one of four weapon categories (Assault Rifles, Snipers, Shotguns and a big happy rocket launcher that blinds the entire right side of your screen).Like the previous title, Sanctum 2 is a fast-paced FPS tower defense game that requires a heavy load of brainpower to keep the waves of alien enemies away from your core. In Sanctum 2 the challenge level is increased, giving the player less resources after each wave and removing the ability to upgrade weapons with resources, forcing the player to focus less on weapon damage and instead on carefully placed towers, walls and turrets to keep the enemy waves back, as well as the addition of a timer to mix things up and make the waves more chaotic. With an immersive campaign mode playable in both single player or coop, Sanctum 2 offers mind-blowing gameplay complimented with a level-up system that rewards the player with unlockable towers, weapons and perks as well as a digital comic that offers insight into Sanctum's world which reveals a page or two before every stage. Sanctum 2 is a direct upgrade to Sanctum, and is well worth the time for any fans of the original.			"

You get to choose your way to play and when you feel like you need more of a challenge you can activate the game's Feats of Strength to increase the difficulty. You also have a multitude of choices in secondary weapons; There are some who do more of a nuking, single-target damage while others hit an area. All in all very fun to play and hey, you can be a little girl with a lazer bazooka!			"

												A fun take on tower defense games. Similar in gameplay to Orcs Must Die, but instead of traps, you put down towers, and you can build walls to maze the enemies. It seems to have the traditional towers; the fast-hitting, low damage gattling gun, the slow but powerful cannon, and of course, the slow tower. All in all, this is a really fun game to jump into for a while and mess around in.			"

												It takes everything interesting and novel about the original, reworks and retools the gameplay, and refines it down to a science. 4 player co-op FPS/Tower defense. It's a wonderful thing to behold. Also when you type it game it speaks out your words in a robot voice! Hilarious!			"

												Sanctum 2 is a somewhat huge leap from its' predecessor. Adding co-op to the list of having fun plus all the other tweaks make this a must-have for td/fps lovers. I agree with many other reviewers on the fact that this game is heavy on co-op playing instead of single player. Nevertheless, even solo, this game is a beauty and will keep you occupied for much longer than the original one.			"

The art designs are amazing gives you the 1st world and 3rd world future feel when you play certain level. The guns got variations that makes 2 guns work well or not together and each character is unique of its own.I cant explain the experience more than to advice you to try playing the game yourself. Overall i love this game, i cant wait for Sanctum 3 if it ever to comes out in the future			"

												Underrated game. I think this game would have a lot of potential to hold a strong userbase if they had focused on more multiplayer things, like ramping up the difficulty in ways other than hp or maybe something like a vs mode.If you like tower defense you'll like this game. Tower defense is the core of the game. If you like FPS but don't like tower defense so much, you probably will get bored. The FPS aspect is very central to the game, but there are ways to make it easy to have an impact even if you're no good at fps games at all (drone launcher + tactical juxtaposition on sweet, anyone?)I'd recommend it. If for nothing else, then for the robot voices that read chat in multiplayer.			"

Build up a maze and throw down defensive towers ranging from gatling guns and rocket launchers to slow-fields and placeable mine dispensers then take up arms and fight alongside your towers! Each playable character has unique weapons and traits and the ability to select and use different perks as you level up. What's not to like?			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game. I still recommend you buy it, especially if you played the first game, but let's go over a few new details. In Sanctum 1, it was all about the towers and a lovely first person tower defense game...however, in Sanctum 2 there are tons of changes from the first game that make it more of a challenge and overall different feel compared to the first game. You get a limit on how many towers can place, they cost more, they are harder to upgrade, and it relies on you to kill most of the enemies with the towers as support instead of vice versa from the original game. To me, I had to rethink and form almost completely new strategies for this game. That being said, it is still a fantastic, albeit difficult, game. The maps are all new with beautiful design to them, and many of which can allow you to go back and play them again by creating a new path they may be better than your original to lead the Lumes (enemies) through. The towers in this game are familiar with the first one with a couple of new editions. Also there are 4 characters you can play as and customize with various perks, weapons, and towers for endless possibilities strategically. Some maps are more difficult than others and will frustrate you as they did me. Sometimes I'm led to believe this game was meant to be played with others through co-op in order to beat the levels, but then I find a new plan that works and even though it may be hard, you can solo this game should you wish. Overall, I give this game a solid 8 out of 10 if I had to, and I recommend it to those of you who love real time strategy, FPS, and/or tower defense games. This game just has it all wrapped into one. Also, I strongly recommend it to those of you who are in need of a game outside of TF2 and looking for another great multiplayer game you can play together and have some fun. The single-player side is great--don't misunderstand--, but that feeling of success when shared with friends after beating a level makes it oh-so-much-more satisfying.			"

So pick a class, make a maze, and lay down a limited amount of towers, then start the waves and shoot away. Great for co-op with friends, has staggered timed and untimed preperation periods between waves, keeps a good balance between frantic shooting defense and times to unwind and map out the strategy.

												So the premise of this game is that humans have established colonies in the skies over an alien planet. They use magical blue balls of light (cores) to convert the gasses present into oxygen and kill the native spores. The problem is that the planet is already occupied by an alien race of highly evolved mushrooms. The mushroom people under the direction of unknown telepathic boss entity whom you never fight create giant organic shafts to the colonies to try to murder them dead.In the game you will create a maze of towers in an attempt to halt the advance of the mushroom people before they destroy you're magical blue ball as is typical of a Tower Defense game. you will spend 5, 10 or 15 minutes per level depositing towers that will ultimately only do about thirty percent of the damage necessary to kill the enemy waves. The rest is up to you. You can choose two of a plethora of weapons to aid you in the struggle. The game does not address why a gun held by a five foot two to six foot tall human out damages half dozen tool shed sized tower mounted guns you drop and arguably that means this game isn't really a TD. There are ""perks"" you can select to improve you're characters/towers performance but there’s really nothing that will turn this game into an actual Tower Defense, which is unfortunate.The longer you play the game the more powerful guns, perks and towers you can unlock, particularly if you buy the DLC. I'm sure we all know the DLC drill by now. For an extra five dollars you will get access to all the content that was cut from the game during the alpha and beta tests for quality control and balance reasons. Ideally that content has since been fixed/balanced/polished but we never know until we shell out the cash. To their credit the DLC for Sanctum 2 does provide a lot of interesting content. The towers, perks and maps it adds do a great deal to increase replayability of the game and it rounds out the base games story that ends on a cliffhanger.The real strength of this game is the level design. Like every other piece of science fiction made in the past twelve years almost everything looks like an Ipod that said this game does it particularly well. The integration of organic vines and spores growing over the utopian surfaces/structures in this game are very imaginative and well done. A lot of games (Doom 3/Dead Space) place a strong aesthetic emphasis in a human environment being reverse terraformed by some perverse alien influence but truthfully Sanctum 2 does it better. The levels are distinct from each other in groups as you proceed from an idealistic lived in colony under attack to the deteriorating front lines to an industrial themed colony abandoned some years or generations earlier. The theme is that the further into the game you go the closer to the planet you get until ultimately you are beneath its surface in a giant cavern with mushroom Jesus. In the tradition of classic FPS games there are many many secret areas and players are rewarded for their diligent exploration. Ironically the maps are far bigger in scope then the developers were prepared to work with and you’ll shudder when you realize that you can’t incorporate some of the games incredibly ideal choke points into you’re defense as they are simply too far away from where the action will be…. If they allowed you to place your own cores the quality of the game would quadruple immediately but thats something they will have to consider for a sequel.The biggest issue with the game is the many many clipping errors. This game will kill you or force you to consul command suicide many times as you fall through solid objects or get stuck between them. In the basic game it doesn’t matter very much as you can wait out the 9 second respawn time once or twice and it isn’t likely to lose the game for you. Tragically the developers compounded this issue by encouraging the players to play with “five feats of strength” on to create a more challenging experience… One of these “feats” is a no respawn mode…  So basically each time you die to a developer error, which will be once or twice a game, you’ll also lose the level. Since playing with the feats of strength on is going to be your last real experience with the game they are brutally poisoning their consumer base who will only remember losing 30 minutes of an expertly played game because Coffe Stain Studio's didn’t properly patch or beta test. Hardcore modes are made for polished games made by hardcore developers. It might be a tough pill for Coffee Stain Studios to swallow but they just haven’t reached that point yet.For ten dollars it is a really cool indie game. The maps if not always utilized ideally are a clever visual spectacle and it does have a lot of replay value. If Coffee Stain Studio focuses on adding general content to their games and take their player testers a little more seriously these guys could easily be around for another few years. Otherwise they'll find themselves doing the 3d effects for their regional weather channels talking about once whens.			"

Posted: December 17, 2013
												I held off writing this review until all the DLC came out because as is the case with many games nowadays community feedback and devoted developers often cause games to undergo big changes even after release, and this game is no exception. Many of the problems people had with the game when it came out are gone, and as a full package with all 4 DLC the game is fully realized and certainly worth your time and money.This game is in a weird spot. If you're a shooter fan, it may feel like a fairly competent shooter, with some other weird turret things thrown in. If you're a Tower Defense player, it will feel very strange not always having a bird's eye veiw mainscreen (though there is a minimap and pressing a button will enlarge it so don't worry) and having these wierd variables of teammates and not having perfect aim all the time. If you like both, it is an outstanding blend of the two genres. And I recommend it to both fps and td fans. Fans of both sides may be dissapointed in the lack of this or that, but if you forget about games you've already played to compare it to for a minute, those things may not make sense in this hybrid.That being said, the gameplay is phenomenal. A great blend of strategy and skill, but without requiring too many desicions and responsibilities that the player can easily become to overwhelmed. You build a maze, build towers (you choose what to bring beforehand) and then get to shooting. Mistakes are punished but don't mean the end until very late in the game. You have many ways to fix your holes and mistakes, even mid-wave. There is also an immense amount of freedom. Pro FPS-er? Take a bunch of perks that help you kill enemies and just let the towers clean up. TD Vet? Create a build that buffs your towers so you don't need to do much shooting. There's loads of combinations and styles of play that make the replay value even bigger. There's always that weird combo you want to try out for fun just to see if you can beat the level with it. The levels curve in very nicely, and there are enough modes and difficulty modifyers to keep you playing well after you've reached max level. Speaking of which, there's also a level up system where you unlock new weapons and perks. Early unlocks tend to be more general and easy to use, while still being powerful in their own right. Later unlocks are more specialized and require a bit more skill and familiarity with the game, and offer a slight better advantage if used correctly. No one unlock completely invalidates another, either. It's a very good system.In addition, the single player and multiplayer are vastly different experiences. Play both. They're the exact same game but as soon as you have a team, its an almost completely different one. The way multiplayer and singleplayer seamlessly blend together is great as well, and usually only requires you to shift mindsets, not builds (at least in the middle of a map - organizing for the next one and specializing is one of the myriad ways the game becomes different). The outstanding team at Coffeestain is one of the most hardworking and talented development teams I've seen from an indie studio in a long time. I often find myself drawing parallels between them and CDProjekt Red when they started out. You can see the level of attention to detail if you look at the game closely, how every little piece seems to sort of mesh together to make a very nice whole. The art and music direction is phenomenal, without saying anything and before the first wave even starts you get a feel for it, where you are, what you're doing, and the impact you're having. The comic book for loading screens just gives the right amount of context to understand what's going on, the environments, music, and enemies tell the real story.The game isn't without its flaws though. Sometimes it can lag a little bit or disconnect you, but that could just be my bad internet. Many guns don't feel terribly satisfying to shoot because things don't have so much health, and many of the enemies look similar. It's hard to find to many criticisms for the game though.Overall, I highly recommend you pick up the whole package. It isn't for everyone, I will concede, so I also recommend trying the demo and see how you like the first few levels. Then pick up the whole game and if you want to the season pass or individual DLCs. They're all fantastic additions to the game. One even includes a fifth playable character. Don't worry if your friends aren't getting it and you think you'll have no one to play with, the community here is also one of the friendliest I've ever encountered.			"

												I love Sanctum 2! It is very original and offers a unique fps experience that is constantly surprising me. Sanctum 2 sets itself apart from other fps games by implementing a strategy based tower defence aspect. The story and art style are oddly intriguing to me. The leveling up system has had me been striving to do my best to earn awesome perks and weapons that greatly add to the experience. The multiplayer mode is well thought out, balanced, fair, and is mostly oriented on team work. Sanctum 2 is well worth the cost. I know that I will be playing SAnctum 2 for years to come. I give Sanctum 2 a 9.3/10!			"

												To be honest I bought this game when it was on sale, and didn't really think I would ever play it. But I decided to give it a try and now I can say it's probably one of my favorite games.... The combining of FPS and tower defense is a brilliant idea in my opnion and unlike many games nowadays, it isn't super graphics intensive. Therefore, even a low tech computer can run the game with it still looking really good! The co-op play is what makes the game for sure... I mean, who doesn't love slaughtering alien hordes together with friends??? Hardly ever are there any problems with glitches or crashing, at least that I've noticed. Great game, totally recommend it!			"

												Incredibly worth the buy.Sanctum 2 is a healthy combination of two of my favorite genres of games: FPS, and tower defense. I never thought that there would be a game that combined the two so brilliantly until I played Sanctum 2. The tower and upgrade system is comprehensive, movement and aiming is smooth, and the artwork and design is outstanding. Not only does it stop there, but multiplayer adds a whole new level of enjoyment when you can defend against waves of aliens with your friends.Totally satisfied with this game.			"

There are four classes that each have seperate strengths and weaknesses, as well as a varuety of unlockable weapons, towers, and perks. The game is better with multiplayer, and online play has been buggy in the past. I think these issues are fixed now. I recommend this game on sale.			"

												TL;DR: Massive improvement over Sanctum 1. Leveling system doesn't feel grindy, and helps to introduce old and new sanctum players into the new towers and features. Multiplayer can be annoying sometimes with trolls public play, but overall the community is helpful and welcoming. Playing with friends is very rewarding and fun.Let's start from the top. If it is not obvious already, Sanctum 2 is the sequel to Sanctum, the Unreal Engine-based game that came on the scene slow at first before it made a big breakout on Steam, prompting this sequel.First impressions from a Sanctum 1 player: WOW, this game has fixed a lot of gameplay annoyances that the first Sanctum had. Sanctum 2 has trashed the high, inaccessible walls of its predecessor with more sensible barriers that the player can actually mantle. Also, towers can now be partially upgraded in between the proper ""levels"" so no more sitting on 99 credits that can't do anything because you are one short of the upgrade. All of your towers maxed out? You can now OVERCHARGE them with excess money, with diminishing returns of course.Next up, the UI. Another massive improvement. Sanctum 1 didn't really give great descriptions of each tower, and the stats of towers were not as easy to read, so knowing the proper abilities of a tower (essential for a Tower Defense game) couldn't be done at a glance. Now, a simple mouse over on the tower tells the player everything they need to know, and range is displayed in a helpful holographic overlay.Now, the new progression system, at first it may trigger the eyeroll of shoving grindy RPG elements where they don't belong, but the implementation is solid. The player isn't hamstrung from completing levels due to being a lower level. Grinding simply doesn't happen, in the since that you don't find yourself needing to repeat levels endlessly. You can however, enable ""Feats of Strength"" when you replay old levels to substantially increase difficulty (and your XP reward) if you find yourself wanting to level faster. Being low level also doesn't exclude you from playing with higher level players. Because each player is limited to a certain number of tower and perk slots, you can always find a niche to fill in multiplayer (I enjoy playing the rocket launcher character and managing airborne minions).Overall, I can't see a reason not to get this game if you enjoy Tower Defense or Action Shooters for that matter. Sanctum offers short, replayable fun for a very low price. Buy this game!			"

												They changed quite a bit from the first one. On the first one you had the choice of upgrading your weapons or towers. Sanctum 2 has a level-up/perk system which allows you to choose between playing more offensively or defensively allowing you to mix and match to your desired playstyle. FPS + Tower Defense = <3 And they still have those giant aliens that have big orange balls as a head.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game.While the gameplay is incredible, the difficulty is too high to maintain in early stages. You often lack the basic resources to have a small chance at defeating the massive hordes of enemies. While this is not a initially bad thing, as it is a TD/FPS hybrid, it stays that way throughout the entire mission. Difficulty does not seem to scale with the lack of players you have.The tutorial is one of the worst I have seen, giving very little information about how to play the game or what anything on screen means.I can't say much about the story, as I haven't played the original.The characters/weapons are okay at best. The only one I truly enjoyed playing was the sniper robot, because it is the most diverse. The Squad Leader character's weapon has too much recoil to be worth the shot (thank you, thank you, I'll be here all night).TL;DRSanctum 2: Yet another reason we need a in-between review button.			"

												This game is ♥♥♥♥ing trash. Sanctum 1 felt a little underdone, but at least it was a fun tower defense with fps elements. Sanctum 2 is an atrocity and isn't the same game in any way. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ wave survival FPS that happens to have a couple towers.Remember those giant mazes you constructed in sanctum 1? Say hello to a 15 tower limit. Playing with friends? SAME 15 TOWER LIMIT. Have fun dividing those up.Remember that effective and useful overhead map? ♥♥♥♥ you, that's right outta here.Remember televators making it easy to move around the map? Haha, yea ♥♥♥♥ing right. Remember upgrading your weapons? Nope. That's gone.Remember how your used to be able to craft a path with your towers? SAY HELLO TO BOSS UNITS, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They'll kick stomp right through your♥♥♥♥♥♥and go straight for the core. Because ♥♥♥♥ you, that's why.Oh, but you can turn on sandbox mode and place all the towers you want. But it's unranked, you don't level up and you won't ever unlock anything. So enjoy placing your 1 tower over and over again. The devs claim this has to do with resource utilization. It hurts my brain to think they can't run more than 15 towers and a handful or NPCs when the first one could run dozens on older tech.Any the game will start before all players have joined and readied up, meaning some players can miss the first wave entirely. And, and base tower blocks are now a separate resource and are randomly and unevenly distributed to players. Wave 1: Player 1 gets 0 base block points, Player 2 gets 10. Have fun.And despite all that, they still have the nerve to charge for multiple overpriced DLC packs. Want a powerful weapon or tower? Pay up, ♥♥♥♥♥es.Coffee Stain took Sanctum 1, which had some fun and relatively unique mechanics, and tossed it in a blender with some feces and broken code and then took a big ol' sanctum steamer right on our chests. This game is worse than Sanctum 1 in every conceivable way. Do not buy it.			"

												A good tower defense game smashed up with an FPS. It plays smoothly, with plenty of unlockable stuff to keep you busy. It is also nearly impossible to play alone after the first four levels without unlocking some of the more advanced towers and weapons, so it's really a co-op experience, with support for up to four players on the same map.

												if you like tower defence games you will enjoy this game.it allows you to construct pathways to construct choke points,then place your gun emplacements accordingly.in this game once your placments are done,you take a fps stance to run and gun across the map,areas range from outdoor to indoor areas.you can choose from four charachters each with two weapon choices,which are futuristic,plus special abilities which unlock.enemies look as though they could of come from spore,from flying creatures to huge hulking beasts.waves seem to come in eights their aim is to get to a core and smash its life line.there are AI soldiers on some areas but dont rely on them.graphics are bright and colourful think Japanese anime.also the characters you choose from are female,something differant,instead of generic American macho.team up online to make it a bit easier,whatever you earn in online carries over to single play and vice versa.

												Sanctum 2 is an excellent game, and in my own opinion, better than the first, a rarity in the gaming industry. Players of the original Sanctum will find that it has a similar feel to the original, but the small things take a lot of getting used to, for example the UI is packed with more information than before on a different location of the screen. Initially because of this, I found the game difficult to play, but after playing a few levels the interface was fairly easy to read from and playing was comfortable. The levels themselves are colossal, full of secrets, and both graphically and aesthetically pleasing. The game is well optimised, as shown by my less-than-stellar PC being able to handle this game fairly well with some graphical options turned off. The gameplay feels like a less-flamboyant Borderlands, which suits the aesthetic of the game well. The game does have it's bugs. I, on more than one occasion have found myself wedged between two slanted sections of wall and getting stuck. The game does have a suicide button for this purpose, but during a wave it can be irritating dealing with the 10-second respawn time as the enemy skips merrily towards the core. I have encountered crash bugs, although I suspect they're my PC's fault.I heartily reccomend Sanctum 2, and by extension, it's predecessor Sanctum. Sanctum 2 is certainly one of my top-5 games of all time and you should certainly buy it if you think it'd be your thing.			"

The maps maybe small in the beginning, but you have the potential to be creative.The FPS mechanics add a new touch to the TD format.If you liked Orcs Must Die, you will like this game as well. The difference is, that you have a bit more punch with your character, and there is a little less emphasis on the turres.Remember that when you switch weapons, your empty weapon will reload automatically, while you are using the other weapon!

												The classical Tower Defense game remastered. A great way to have a ton of fun with your friends, it gets repetetive some hundreds of hours into the game I suppose because I have not found it so a single time. If you add one friend it gets twice as fun. If you add another you might as well be playing Super Mario on your old N64. It's that much fun. If this ever goes on sale it's a definite must, otherwise I recommend this if you're looking for an active group oriented Tower Defense that is more than just a TD Game.			"

Posted: November 30, 2013
												EDIT: While the below review still holds true for the most part, after having played the game more, I've come to the conclusion that Sanctum 2 has much more of a learning curve than Sanctum. Sanctum is pretty easy to just jump into and enjoy, while Sanctum 2 requires you to learn how to really play the game and get some specific upgrades before it starts being really good. However, once you get to that point, it is a great experience possibly even better than the first despite the shortcomings.I give this a thumbs up overall because it is still a fun game; the blending of FPS and tower defense that is Sanctum is here, the maze-making strategy is here, and the multiplayer is better and more worthwhile than before. There are some good new features, but as a fan who loved and played a lot of the first, I am disappointed with a lot of the things they did here. But I'll start with the good:Multiple characters to choose from adds a new element of strategy, and equipping appropriate perks adds further. As all bonuses that can theoretically stack together do, equipping each character with appropriate perks for the best results is a welcome addition to the franchise that allows players to experiment for the combos that best suit them.Maps are much better designed than in the first Sanctum with much more attention to detail and more thought in strategic use of the environment. The campaign and leveling system are also a welcome addition, giving a feeling of progress, though some unlocks may take a bit too long to unlock. Lastly, there's a wider range of guns and towers available to choose from.It also looks really nice graphically.But now, the disappointments. I know this is a new game and shouldn't just be compared to the first, but as this is a sequel, things should get better, not worse, and a comparison will be necessary to make my point.Most of my issues can be summed up as such: the maps may be bigger, but the game feels so much smaller. Customization was supposed to be an important upgrade from Sanctum to Sanctum 2, but I honestly feel like the first had better customization. Number of guns allowed to each player has been reduced from 3 to 2, with 1 of those being locked to the character until capping your level, meaning only one weapon can actually be chosen for any given character, AND they can no longer be upgraded. Yet despite this, the game is actually more FPS-centric due to the limits on blocks and towers, as even without any feats of strength activated one can't really get away with just towers, again unlike the first, making for fewer different ways to actually play the game.Number of towers brought to a map maxes out at 4 per player, down from the 6 of the original. Additionally, floors are gone completely and Holo tower and Televators have also left the building, leaving basically only the two slowing towers to support the FPS aspect at all, and no guns which do the reverse (Freeze is gone), severing that integration completely aside from a few perks. Also, towers can only be upgraded to level 3 instead of 6, after which they go into ""overcharge,"" which is just throwing as many extra resources as you want at it to make it more continually more powerful, and I guess is basically the same thing.Blocks - now tower bases - are limited and given out per wave instead of costing a small amount of resources, preventing players from really building a maze until the map is over, seeing as maps are not longer than 10 waves, which was the shortest in the previous game, where it went as high as 30 in standard mode. Additionally, only 15 towers can actually be built per map, and the base cost of them has increased as much as 10x, no exaggeration; base Gatling now costs 100 instead of 10, and resources given hasn't increased to compensate (if anything it's lower). I guess as compensation upgrade costs don't increase as you continue to upgrade, but it doesn't matter much since they only go to level 3 and then overcharge anyway.What's the point of the maps being so big if I can only realistically use small portions of them?Good multiplayer is definitely not a bad thing in my book, but the game kind of shafts solo players. Many maps have multiple entry points for the enemies, occasionally in ways that prevent the two sides from ever joining before the core (and some have two cores), requiring a solo player to juggle two sides, a problem compounded further by the limitations to blocks and towers. A few of these maps existing would be fine, but not as many as there are here, especially since televators are no longer around to allow the player to move around quickly.The game is definitely a better multiplayer experience than single. It can be played single player, but it will be frustrating at times. Best to get a friend or two in on the action. Again, still a good game overall. If you liked Sanctum but thought it needed some improving, this might be for you. If you liked a lot of things in Sanctum, give it a shot, but be careful.			"

Controls feel nice, and the ability to make your own maze and fight in it feels pretty darn fun. Sadly there are some good towers and some towers that downright suck. It could use some balancing, but other than that, it's a great pickup...especially if it's on sale. Which it is a lot.			"

												Sanctum 2 is a great follow-up to Sanctum 1. It's a tower defense, FPS, action, strategy Co-op game, based on defending the core from lumes, alien invaders trying to destroy the planet.Sanctum 2 is, yes, a online game. You can make your world online, so that other players can join, or private, so that it is just you. There are 4 worlds, not counting the DLC worlds. There is a campaign to the game, but I don't really know how to explain it. The game is great for playing with friends, and I really enjoy this game. The DLC for the game, uncover the rest of the story, since the end of the game left players at a cliff hanger. Some of the achivements in the game can only be unlocked by getting AND playing them. The main strategy is to maze the level, and place down as many ""attack towers"" down as possible.Overall, this is a fantasic game. I really like it, and it was one of the first games, (besides Borderlands 2), on Steam that I ever played. I recommend this game to everyone. "

												This is NOT Sanctum 1. If you are going into this expecting it to be exactly like the first, then be forewarned that it is not. Also, in this review, I am including all DLC in my considerations, and I am including into consideration what this game has set out to be rather than what I personally expect from a TD or FPS game.That having been said to appease the die hard purists of the original and the two genres, this game is on it's own merrit absolutely awesome. It has it's highs and lows like most any game, although there are a lot more highs than there are lows. There is a little bit of pacing and balance issues when it comes to playing straight through as you will inevitably hit a point where you are forced to improve not only your skill but also your choice of armaments or when certain armaments or combinations that are just completely overkill for the level you are facing. With sufficient skill and sufficient experience with the different combos, there is no reason you can't make almost any combination work, but getting to that skill point will take a bit of time and some trial and error that you just wont nail down on your first play through or until you've played enough to cap out you levels. On the higher difficulty levels though, that skill and knowing the combinations is critical and on the hardest difficulty for the most part you will need to bring your A game and the best combos you can muster. That is all part of what makes a good TD game though; possibilities and choices in how you play, replayability without getting stale fast, and the flexibility of different difficulties that includes something for the casual to the hardcore.The FPS element does feel light, and the TD element does feel somewhat simplified when compared to their pure counterparts, but the state of both is perfect for the sake of trying to play both at once without getting overwhelmed as a new player and in order to prevent requiring days of number crunching or rote memorization of patterns. At some point though, you will beat everything and then it will boil down to just survival mode and how many waves can you kill before it's impossible. When you get to that point after playing for many many hours, it will inevitably get pretty dull for most.All in all, just considering Sanctum 2 and only the scope of the game, I would give it a 80/85 in terms of what it set out to do and how well it delivers (points docked due to lack of really long term replayability for completionists, and minor pacing/balance issues). I would give it a 80/100 when comparing it against all other games I've ever played of all genres.			"

												For anyone who played the original Sanctum.. this is a complete resdesign. A true sequel to a game, every aspect has been revamped or improved in some way. The graphics are something you'd expect from a top FPS.  With that being said, some of the changes are still a bit foreign to me, but I am enjoying the game none the less. For anyone who like Tower Defense style gameplay and/or a fan of Sanctum.. I'd reccomend it.			"

												A good tower defense game smashed up with an FPS. It plays smoothly, with plenty of unlockable stuff to keep you busy. It is also nearly impossible to play alone after the first four levels without unlocking some of the more advanced towers and weapons, so it's really a co-op experience, with support for up to four players on the same map.

												Sanctum 2 is a tower defense game with fps, and done surprisingly well. The artstyle of the game, in my opinion, is great, good soundtrack, and multiplayer works great. If single player is a bit lonely for you, then hop online and defend the base with others. This game is a nice addition to anyones game collection, whether it be a tower defense fan, or someone who is looking for a different fps to play.			"

												This game and the orignal are two of the most fantastic multiplayer Tower Defense games i've ever played. Sanctum 2 gives you great growth over time as you unlock new towers and guns through leveling. While the single player is fun and immersive, the multiplayer aspect is where Sanctum 2 shines above other Tower Defense games. With aliens that are combative against the player, it's not just your towers or core taking damage, it adds aspects of FPS perspectives to a tradional TD. Being a moving target also changes how tower placement can be managed. the game is well thought out and the storyline is interesting. Whether you're looking for a fun game to LAN, or a game to kill some time at a good pace, Sanctum 2 is a diverse and exciting game.			"

												This is a great game, the combination of tower defence and first person shooter is brilliant, I recommend this game to all.If there is anything I had to say was bad about it it is the lack of upgrades to your weapons, bacause as the enemies get stronger, your weapons stay the same, you do get more weapons when you level up, but your primary weapon just doesn't do very well, also as the levels get harder, you can't put more towers down, but that is just part of the fun i rate it 9.5/10			"

												Sanctum 2 is the best game I've found of it's genre. I'm sure Tom will nab you on the game's faulty floor design, if you've got friends to play it with, go for it. Controls feel nice, and the ability to make your own maze and fight in it feels pretty darn fun. Sadly there are some good towers and some towers that downright suck. It could use some balancing, but other than that, it's a great pickup...especially if it's on sale. Which it is a lot.			"

												Sanctum 2, in my opinion, surpasses Sanctum 1 in many ways. First off, the levelling system. Although people may dislike the fact that you have to unlock the towers that you at access to right from the get-go in Sanctum 1 in Sanctum 2, I think it gives more incentive to certain aspects of Sanctum 1 which I think needed it. For example, in Sanctum 1, Survival Mode felt like it was a bit lacking in motivation for me, whilst in Sanctum 2, I was heavily motivated to try my hardest at all times during survival because I knew that the longer I survived, the more experience points I would get. The Second improvement would be the sheer amount of content this game has! Sanctum 2 has about twice as many maps to play through than Sanctum 1 and many new enemies to learn about! Thirdly, the controls gained a major improvement. In Sanctum 2 the controls are more FPS-like than ever before! If enjoyed how Borderlands 2 controls, you will like how Sanctum 2 controls. There are also many core gameplay elements tweaked in Sanctum 2. The biggest example of change is in the Combat Phase, which requires much more input from the player in skill. Another example of improvement is the new upgrading system. Each tower now only has 3 tiers and upgrading is investment based! So even if you don't have enough resources to upgrade a tower to the next tier, you can still invest in it to boost its stats slightly. You can even invest after the tower reaches its maximum tier. Doing this will result in you ""overcharging"" the tower, which will boost a prominent stat or some prominent stats (eg. Damage, Range, etc) even further! The last improvement is with the graphics. This game looks gorgeous and compared to Sanctum 1 is the equivilent of today's FPS graphics. This game is a 100% ""WIN"" in my book and you should buy it right now.			"

												The classical Tower Defense game remastered. A great way to have a ton of fun with your friends, it gets repetetive some hundreds of hours into the game I suppose because I have not found it so a single time. If you add one friend it gets twice as fun. If you add another you might as well be playing Super Mario on your old N64. It's that much fun. If this ever goes on sale it's a definite must, otherwise I recommend this if you're looking for an active group oriented Tower Defense that is more than just a TD Game.			"

												The classical Tower Defense game remastered. A great way to have a ton of fun with your friends, it gets repetetive some hundreds of hours into the game I suppose because I have not found it so a single time. If you add one friend it gets twice as fun. If you add another you might as well be playing Super Mario on your old N64. It's that much fun. If this ever goes on sale it's a definite must, otherwise I recommend this if you're looking for an active group oriented Tower Defense that is more than just a TD Game.			"

												Pros: Incredibly unique concept and done near-perfect, wide range of customizable features, refreshingly new style of game, overall visual qualityCons: Lack of diversity for enemies, tower building only from first personWhen I first heard about Sanctum and what the gameplay is like my initial reaction was “Yes! Yes! Yes!”, never did play Sanctum however as Sanctum 2 was just being released and whatever people may say about the first I have to say that the 2nd does not disappoint. Sanctum 2 is a unique and refreshingly new concept of mixing the tower defense / tower grid concept with FPS. It’s a bit of RTS as well in that you place your towers with the tower grid and then you play a unit in your own FPS and become a soldier on the ground during the battle.There are a few main classes that have set perks and primary weapons, then a list of universal secondary weapons, towers, and passive perks. For sure there are lots of options with towers and perks to adapt to a very wide variety of play-styles. And the multiplayer coop allows for interesting blends of play-styles or an all-out stacking of a set style with synchronizing to get the most out of the various perks.Overall it’s a brilliant game, and I for sure recommend it. I think the build phase being only in first person is a mistake however, would have liked the choice to view the grid and place turrets from a bird’s eye of the entire grid instead of having to constantly refer to the mini-map to make sure I’m placing things in the correct square. Also the enemy units are immediately redundant so while there is a huge range of variety on the player side with perks and weapons there is just the same few enemy units (the DLCs seem to address this – as well as add even more weapons and perks!). No difficulty option but the game has five “Feats of Strength” options to make it both harder and give greater rewards, similar to Bastion’s “Idols”.All in all the wide range of turret types, weapons, and perks are all blended and balanced nicely to make a very nice RTS / FPS blend that – and I cannot state this enough – was soooo refreshing to play. Indie games like this or something like Frozen Synapse that push the boundaries of the gaming development “norm” will forever be welcome in my gaming libraries, they are fantastic. The RTS to place the walls to funnel enemies into pinch points and U-turns while placing the proper turrets to take advantage of the situation then starting the wave and going into the battle yourself in an FPS with your own highly customized class unit is something that will not get old quickly for me.

												EDIT: While the below review still holds true for the most part, after having played the game more, I've come to the conclusion that Sanctum 2 has much more of a learning curve than Sanctum. Sanctum is pretty easy to just jump into and enjoy, while Sanctum 2 requires you to learn how to really play the game and get some specific upgrades before it starts being really good. However, once you get to that point, it is a great experience possibly even better than the first despite the shortcomings.I give this a thumbs up overall because it is still a fun game; the blending of FPS and tower defense that is Sanctum is here, the maze-making strategy is here, and the multiplayer is better and more worthwhile than before. There are some good new features, but as a fan who loved and played a lot of the first, I am disappointed with a lot of the things they did here. But I'll start with the good:Multiple characters to choose from adds a new element of strategy, and equipping appropriate perks adds further. As all bonuses that can theoretically stack together do, equipping each character with appropriate perks for the best results is a welcome addition to the franchise that allows players to experiment for the combos that best suit them.Maps are much better designed than in the first Sanctum with much more attention to detail and more thought in strategic use of the environment. The campaign and leveling system are also a welcome addition, giving a feeling of progress, though some unlocks may take a bit too long to unlock. Lastly, there's a wider range of guns and towers available to choose from.It also looks really nice graphically.But now, the disappointments. I know this is a new game and shouldn't just be compared to the first, but as this is a sequel, things should get better, not worse, and a comparison will be necessary to make my point.Most of my issues can be summed up as such: the maps may be bigger, but the game feels so much smaller. Customization was supposed to be an important upgrade from Sanctum to Sanctum 2, but I honestly feel like the first had better customization. Number of guns allowed to each player has been reduced from 3 to 2, with 1 of those being locked to the character until capping your level, meaning only one weapon can actually be chosen for any given character, AND they can no longer be upgraded. Yet despite this, the game is actually more FPS-centric due to the limits on blocks and towers, as even without any feats of strength activated one can't really get away with just towers, again unlike the first, making for fewer different ways to actually play the game.Number of towers brought to a map maxes out at 4 per player, down from the 6 of the original. Additionally, floors are gone completely and Holo tower and Televators have also left the building, leaving basically only the two slowing towers to support the FPS aspect at all, and no guns which do the reverse (Freeze is gone), severing that integration completely aside from a few perks. Also, towers can only be upgraded to level 3 instead of 6, after which they go into ""overcharge,"" which is just throwing as many extra resources as you want at it to make it more continually more powerful, and I guess is basically the same thing.Blocks - now tower bases - are limited and given out per wave instead of costing a small amount of resources, preventing players from really building a maze until the map is over, seeing as maps are not longer than 10 waves, which was the shortest in the previous game, where it went as high as 30 in standard mode. Additionally, only 15 towers can actually be built per map, and the base cost of them has increased as much as 10x, no exaggeration; base Gatling now costs 100 instead of 10, and resources given hasn't increased to compensate (if anything it's lower). I guess as compensation upgrade costs don't increase as you continue to upgrade, but it doesn't matter much since they only go to level 3 and then overcharge anyway.What's the point of the maps being so big if I can only realistically use small portions of them?Good multiplayer is definitely not a bad thing in my book, but the game kind of shafts solo players. Many maps have multiple entry points for the enemies, occasionally in ways that prevent the two sides from ever joining before the core (and some have two cores), requiring a solo player to juggle two sides, a problem compounded further by the limitations to blocks and towers. A few of these maps existing would be fine, but not as many as there are here, especially since televators are no longer around to allow the player to move around quickly.The game is definitely a better multiplayer experience than single. It can be played single player, but it will be frustrating at times. Best to get a friend or two in on the action. Again, still a good game overall. If you liked Sanctum but thought it needed some improving, this might be for you. If you liked a lot of things in Sanctum, give it a shot, but be careful.			"

The game istelf is very in depth but if you buy all of the DLCs (LIke me)  ist even more in depth . The way it makes you whant to play and play and oh i have made very long and long well if i would say just buy the bloudy game and try it for your self :)			"

												This is NOT Sanctum 1. If you are going into this expecting it to be exactly like the first, then be forewarned that it is not. Also, in this review, I am including all DLC in my considerations, and I am including into consideration what this game has set out to be rather than what I personally expect from a TD or FPS game.That having been said to appease the die hard purists of the original and the two genres, this game is on it's own merrit absolutely awesome. It has it's highs and lows like most any game, although there are a lot more highs than there are lows. There is a little bit of pacing and balance issues when it comes to playing straight through as you will inevitably hit a point where you are forced to improve not only your skill but also your choice of armaments or when certain armaments or combinations that are just completely overkill for the level you are facing. With sufficient skill and sufficient experience with the different combos, there is no reason you can't make almost any combination work, but getting to that skill point will take a bit of time and some trial and error that you just wont nail down on your first play through or until you've played enough to cap out you levels. On the higher difficulty levels though, that skill and knowing the combinations is critical and on the hardest difficulty for the most part you will need to bring your A game and the best combos you can muster. That is all part of what makes a good TD game though; possibilities and choices in how you play, replayability without getting stale fast, and the flexibility of different difficulties that includes something for the casual to the hardcore.The FPS element does feel light, and the TD element does feel somewhat simplified when compared to their pure counterparts, but the state of both is perfect for the sake of trying to play both at once without getting overwhelmed as a new player and in order to prevent requiring days of number crunching or rote memorization of patterns. At some point though, you will beat everything and then it will boil down to just survival mode and how many waves can you kill before it's impossible. When you get to that point after playing for many many hours, it will inevitably get pretty dull for most.All in all, just considering Sanctum 2 and only the scope of the game, I would give it a 80/85 in terms of what it set out to do and how well it delivers (points docked due to lack of really long term replayability for completionists, and minor pacing/balance issues). I would give it a 80/100 when comparing it against all other games I've ever played of all genres.			"

												This game is a mix between a Tower Defense and a First Person Shooter. When you type in the in-game chat, they have voice overs, which can allow for some pretty funny (and raunchy) robotic dialogue. This game is truly unique, and I'd love to see a third installment in the franchise, because I'm sure that they can make an even more elaborate game with unique features that are limited only to the Tower Defense First Person Shooter genre they've created. TL;DRThis game is really fun blend between Tower Defense and First Person Shooter genres. I enjoy this game, and you will (hopefully) enjoy it too.			"

												Solid Game mixing tower defense and FPS. Feats of strenght mean there is another level to the game which is very challenging and may require additional help from other players but for me that adds to the fun.The levels on harder difficulty and latter game require the right strategy and tower setup which is fun to work out and can require trial and error.I really cant understand the negative comments around his game but then again most dont have many hours logged, it is very customisable with different perks / weapons and towers to pick from, hours of fun and enjoyment and will also drive you insane at times.The most challenging/contested aspect seems to be the boss waves that can destroy towers, firstly all towers can be repaired after the round and secondly thats kind of the point?.... a difficult boss that needs a different tactic to beat meaning you cant simply glide through the game without breaking sweat.  In terms of value for money, if you like tower defense games with a bit of call of duty thrown in this game is definately worth it. "

Pros-Fun gameplay-Very good sound design-Nice progression system; Not too slow, not too fast-Fun guns Cons -Optimization. Its not very good. And its CPU Intensive. But im hitting stable 60fps, but 60fps usually just doesnt cut it for me since i have a 144hz screen. But in this game, i dont mind it.-Saving is there, but it doesnt work. It always says the save is corrupted or deleted. And its level based, so you lose all your progress.			"

												A tower defense with a fps twist to it. If you like tower defense games you'll love this one. While the game may appear easy at first the real challange is trying to figure out how to handle the stages with all feats enabled. Also tactics that work in single player may not work at all in multiplayer. With a lot of perks, guns and towers available there is a lot of tactic variants. Also the game runs really well on my age old pc which is great. A good performance is a great plus for any PC game.			"

It is def easier with friends playing too but playing alone works too. The only problem I had with multi player is there is usually too many chiefs and not enuf indians :p so deciding where to put blocks and the like gets frustrating. All in all I woud give the game a 10 outright. Well worth more than I paid. It has alot of playability too, I am not very far along in the game because later levels are extrememly hard to do alone. Top notch strategy combined with FPS.			"

												A great combination of FPS and tower-defense.Each tower have their own ability(~ies), to make them a good help depends on how you use it.But if you're too counted on towers, like a boss sitting in his office and do nothing, get your butt kicked.After all, YOU are the one who in charge.Amazing story setting, what happen next will shock everyone, I hate buzzfeed user setting their title like this.Stunning environment, god look how beautiful it is, I wish I could live on it. (Sadly it's full of deadly spore)Fancy look weapons, and their incredible fire power, blast everything into pieces.Powerful towers, like a girlfriend(Which I don't have one) you can relay on, sometimes you can't.Various gamemode, cuz' you offen get bored by playing the same thing over and over again.Text-to-speech function, kinda annoying, but hell it's awesome.And also, easter eggs all over the map, gotta find'em all.By comparing the prequel, everything is way much better than it.Except one thing.You can't upgrade weapons like you upgrade towers.

												Sanctum 2 took the best parts of the Original and brought it to the next level, adding something of a story to the mix, expanding on the First person shooter aspect by allowing the player to traverse through the game world from one level to the next and involves the player more in the defense as opposed to just focusing on towers. Visually speaking, Sanctum 2 is crisper, cleaner and more up to date with graphics of newer games even though it was released in 2013. There were some changes to the tower building component as well as the use of personal weapons. In the original you built towers by spending resources, now you are given a number of towers to start with and can place them anywhere, with more towers given to you upon completion of each wave. This makes the challenge a little different as it may take a few waves to redirect the flow of enemies. The changes to personal weapons are that you now need to reload, as opposed to the auto-reload of the original. This makes it more realistic and presents challenge by forcing you to manage your ammunition. I thought Sanctum 2 took everything to the next level and was a great sequel from a pretty fun game. It has similar options to the first regarding single player or multiplayer, so if you enjoyed playing the original Sanctum you should really enjoy Sanctum 2.			"

												This game is aweeeesome!!! I loved the original Sanctum for the fact that I LOVE Tower Defense games. I loved building tonnes of towers all over the map and was kind of disappoined by the way that Sanctum 2 was re-engineered compared to it's predecessor...I recently got myself a new graphic card and decided to buy the game when it was on special. I tried it and was slightly confused by how the game worked.. There seemed to be a restriction on the amount of towers which was 15....???But after playing the game more with my friends online I have started to enjoy it much more and begain to quickly realise exactly why these changes were actually HUGE improvements over the original game.As much as I loved Sanctum 1, Sanctum 2 has just become a much more immersive experience and enjoyable experience.I'll give reasons why I love this game below!1) Building even more complex mazes than the original game.2) Experimenting with the awesome variety and different combinations of towers. (There are so many different towers, from long range cannons, lasers, lightning, mind control, anti-air, ground pounders, slow generators, supports towers to increase damage and range of neighbouring towers as well as other misc ones I'll leave up to you to find out about yourself)3) HUGE selection of perks that allow you to drastically customize how your character plays.4) The maps are really well designed, both in aesthetics and well thought out design to really make you think about the most appropriate towers for each situation.5) The challenge that comes from trying to deal with different combinations of enemies AND the bosses that can wreak havoc on your maze.6) The gorgeous graphics in general.7) Huge selection of maps.8) Sandbox mode that allows you to have as many towers as you want(Which shows that the game was designed to have 15 turret cap to keep the game strategic and trust me, it really forces you to make the right decisions and think strategically)9) 5 different characters that have different traits and primary weapons.10) Secondary weapons are unlockable and allow you to completely change the feel of each character.11) Completely overhauled enemies from the original sanctum as well as a big variety of New enemies, some gargantuan aliens that I can guarantee you will have a tough time dealing with!12) Easy and Fast game creation allowing drop in and drop out at any time for your friends to come and join the fray, with each player having their own choice of 4 different towers to use.13) This time the enemies can see you and react to you. They are actually intelligent and won't hesitate to mash your face to a pulp if you get too close. Some of the enemies just run straight for the core, but others will spit and shoot at you, blast you with shock waves, charge at you and pound their fists into you until you are dead. This time they are not push overs. But neither are you. You can  hit back, and hard!This game is NOT Sanctum 1 so do NOT expect to just let your towers do all the work.This game focuses a LOT on First Person Shooter action.. This time, when you use guns you actually feel like you're doing damage which was a problem in the first game as the enemies got tankier and tankier.This time around the enemies don't get any stronger as the waves progress, there are just more of them and brutal combinations of enemies that will really force you to make the right choices for tower selection.If you are quick witted, strategic and with good aim then this game will be right up your alley.Before playing this game I was frustrated and annoyed by the choice they made to have a cap of 15 towers to use in the campaign. I loved the tall tower blocks and slow fields in Sanctum 1. I loved the way you could upgrade 6 times in Sanctum 1. I also loved the way I could upgrade my own weapons.But this time around in Sanctum 2 I can Guarantee that there is NO need or WANT for upgrading your weapons as the perks system is far superior in allowing you to create a much more enjoyable experience.The weapons feel far stronger in Sanctum 2. They are extremely customisable in how they function. The towers are FAR more interesting. The maps are far superior. The graphics are MUCH better. The Character selection is AWESOME.The Towers can be upgraded from Level 1 to level 3. Which might not seem like much but you can permanently over-charge towers. (Some towers gain more range when over-charged, others gain damage.. But it doesn't stop at just range and damage... Find out for yourself! :D )I give Sanctum 2 a Solid 10 out of 10 for gameplay, graphics, strategy, customisability and simplicity.The story however seems completely not relevant to my experience, I have barely read a word of the story in fact... But somehow it makes you feel more in tune with the characters, making the experience just that tad better.The only thing I could see done to improve this game would be to add rendered cutscenes but this is completely irrelevant.Awesome game and worth buying whether it's on special or not.A Big Thumb Up The Bum for Sanctum 2!!!10/10			"

												FPS tower defense?  Yes!  You will either love or hate this blend of different game elements.  There will be little to no middle ground.Your ""maze"" and towers are primarily to support you in your fps activities.  To funnel and weaken your enemies while you blast them down.  That's a very basic breakdown of what to expect but it should provide insight as to whether you will enjoy this style of game.This got my vote of confidence.			"

												Fun gameplay, good class customizations. The game is 20x better in cooperative play. Not generally a huge FPS or Tower Defense fan, but I highly recommend this one.I've never played the first one, so I'm not sure on its improvements. But based on the game alone:Pros:+ Great Co-Op & Party System+ 4 classes (5 if you get the DLC) may seem limited at first, but they all have a good amount of customization.+ Multiple selections for weapons, turrets, and perks.+ Fast learning curve+ High replayability (Level Modifiers that increase difficultyCons:- Honestly, can't find any quite yet. I'll update if I do though.  "

												This game is good but it doesn't feel like Sanctum. The old Sanctum was a bit silly with enemies wearing hats and dancing around when you lost or that upbeat happy music you got with the big victory screen as your character danced around with the ai.Everything was unlocked from the start so you could play everything your own style instead of waiting for the towers to be unlocked. you know what problem that creates? grinding! grinding for levels, something that doesnt belong in Sanctum or any tower defense. comparing to sanctum 1 it is a lot less polished i'd say. i cant easily scroll to change weapons i have to press e. and i cant make my maze the first round i have to wait until get more bases rather than use resources. u just lost alot of ocd customers. these are more minor complaints but why was the bases changed form blocks to little round disks. In sanctum 2 bases can be placed diagonally but unlike the towers in sanctum 1, they are small and can be easily jumped over which feels unrealistc. the ""Lumes"" could easily jump over Sanctum 2's towers. Sanctum 1 had massive blocks that trapped them inside and it felt like they couldnt escape and they needed to follow the path. the actuall gameplay is the same to sanctum1 but with more flashes and pazzaz! for an indie developer it is supprising the graphics make any AAA game look grey and smudgy.Conclusion- Sanctum1- more charm bigger maps no grinding more polish greater sense of accomplishmentSanctum2- more serious story smaller maps grinding for towers and weapons better graphics better gunplay(slightly)     get sanctum 1 it is a better game in my opinion and you still support the same guys who made this game so get it get it get it!

												At first this game isn't too special, the maps are very simple and getting new towers/abilities/weapons takes a while. But once you've hit the lv20ish range, chances are you'll have made your way to the more interesting maps and have plenty of stuff in your arsenal. The DLC also provides quite a few good maps that I liked better than the originals, along with two new towers in most of them.Aside from the relatively slow leveling curve, there isn't really anything to complain about. Obviously it's better to play with others but luckily usually someone else who's made their way into at least the mid-teens knows what's going on and will recognize a good setup, so arguments over tower placement aren't an issue or at least haven't been much of one for me. Aside from some pair of two year-olds that muted me and wouldn't dare let me touch their sacred wall segments where they hadn't even placed turrets. Every game has some ♥♥♥♥♥♥s playing it, I suppose.If you think whatever resources you're given after each wave are 'yours' then either drop the greedy mentality or don't even bother playing this game with anyone but yourself.

												FPS meets TD!the game is fairly easy to pick up, for fans of Tower Defense. towers behave fairly well, with sufficient variety and strategic placement / upgrading involved. just try not to sell other people's towers without saying anything!the First-Person gameplay is very rewarding, with challenging creeps who would chase / shoot you, requiring some good acrobatics to stay alive and be useful. the weakspot system works well with the weapons, which take some skill to feel useful.the best for last: Co-op pve! getting a good team to play with, communicating, sharing resources, modifying each other's mazes... it's just the most fun you can get in any TD. kinda reminds me of Warcraft 3 custom TD maps; but those usually can't support co-op and most definitely exclude the FPS.tried it, bought it. totally worth the $4.9/10EDIT: nominated this game for The “Game Within A Game” Award - both because it has the hardest ""game in a game"" achievement, and the amalgamation of two genres makes this game literally an FPS within a TD.

												A game that looked promising at the first 2 hours, First Person Tower Defence is something i have bareley seen (exept for orcs must die), However... after those 2 Hours it felt like i was playing a Early access Alpha game, let me explain.[ Disclaimer: i did not buy or play the season pass and all the DLC content this game has, which doesnt effect the ""rating"" in my opinion because the ""Base game"" should have enough content to start, you shouldnt have to pay more to them for fixing the lack of content.] [ I also havent played the first sanctum, and i wont, since this game ultimatley scared me off buying and playing  the first sanctum.] [FEW SPOILERS WARNING]Pros: * Most of the levels have great Level and are quite unique and cool* The Turret AI is Good* The Enemy AI is OK* Most Enemies Look really awesome and cool and unique* Working with other players is fun and works fine* The Backgound music is Good* The Story is DecentCons: * The Player Characters are Bland* Most Player Guns are Boring and ugly OR just bland and non-unique* 0 Customization for your Characters AND Their Guns* Level progression is USELESS and feels unneccesary since all it does it unlock more guns, turrets and perks. but why they didnt tie it to you progressing trough the campaign instead is beyond my understanding.*  Most perks feel cheap* VERY FEW TOWERS* Very few tower types  * 1 Wall type only* The way the walls connect is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥* Nothing else when it comes to Building defence (exept for Mines), no... Floor spikes or... Flamethrower... just 0 Traps.* Upgrading your turret is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, instead of just clicking 1 button to upgrade yor turret, you have to fill a meter to upgrade it, which takes way too long to do, i know its there for the purpose of your Teammate to be able help upgrading them as well, but this upgrading system doesnt work great, just bareley good enough.* Customizing your Turrets? diffrent Colours? NOPE, not even the walls can have a diffrent colour (which is understandable)* VERY FEW ENEMY TYPES* ONLY 3 BOSSES!?! and they are Re-used trough the campaign several times * Only 1 Enemy ""Race"" which is quite dissapionting* The map locations have very few types of  art style ""enviroment"". Basicley your in a jungle or a cave or in a base IN the jungle, the whole campaign * Only 1 Gamemode, what i mean is that you ALWAYS DEFEND A ""CORE"", every single stage in the campaign.* the Graphics are awful, it looks like a early xbox360 game. (only that its 2013 now)* Framrate is also awful and unstable sometimes, and you will have a hard time even running this on a cheap ""400$"" computer for an example, Forget about even buying this game, if you have a computer that is cheaper than 400$.* Ive crashed 4 times* My game Froze once* Ive clipped trough or got ""out of bounds"" on Maps COUNTLESS times!And the most insulting thing of all, is at the last level of the game, You fight the 3 Bosses all at once, 2 times (correct me if im wrong) and you see this ""Final Boss"", HUGE Creature slowley approaching you, and you think this is going to be a badass final boss showdown, but NOPE, YOU DONT EVEN FIGHT HIM, THERES NO FINAL BOSS, instead, you get a final cutscene. WHICH IS A CLIFFHANGER, which is some huge random creaure (might be this ""final boss"" but hell if i know) slowley approaching a city, while the credits are playing... THATS IT!!!!* Also theres 0 determination to complete all the levels on hardest difficulty and with harder ""challenges"" WHEN ALL YOU GET IS MORE XP and an achievement or 2.I want to like this game, i really do, the first 2-7 Hours was alot of fun, but You would see the flaws immedietley after 2 hours, but it gets you determined to complete the campaign anyways because its alot of fun.but i understand if im one of few gamers that completed the campaign. And the ending just shatters all of my hopes for this game, im sorry.My final rating is 4/10 ""Slightley below average""Do i reccomend this game? usualley i would say ""If its on sale, buy it."" But due to the extreme lack of content, awful graphics and FPS, and DAT ENDING.I DONT recommend this game, even if its on sale, buy it at your own risk, if your not a stratergy gamer, then forget about buying this game.I just hope in the future that we get sanctum 3 with all the missing content, AND a final boss.EDIT: i played this game on summer 2015, why i didnt do a review back then.. well i dont know. i was too angry. Im doing a review NOW because i dont see any legit reviews of this game, the only thing i see is people Reccomending it and saying ""its fun and creative"", and have only played the game for 1-4 hours. now, im not expert but i dont think you can finish the game under 4 hours, let alone 1.

												I wouldnt call this game good. The first game was so good and had a great gameplay with the player relying on their guns only when their towers failed. This game, however, barely implements towers as a viable defense system and thus makes the player rely on their guns, something that is doesn't make sense in context of the last game. The gameplay by itself isn't very interesting, either. I wouldn't reccomend spending money on this.			"

												Sanctum 2 the game I almost bought.Interesting looking game that I had heard was very good so decided to try it out while it was free. What I found was solid enjoyable gameplay and co-op style playing that I rather enjoy.... and then I discovered it is nigh impossible to join a game. It took around 2 hours for me to  give up trying to join people via invite, custom and quick searches. The result turns this into a single player game which with some of the bigger harder enemies and turret option restrictions makes it into a no buy for me. Which is a pity as I did want to buy it but couldn't bring myself to buy a broken game.			"

												I really like when people do something interesting with tower defense. This is one of those interesting things. People have tried doing ""hybrids"" of these before but they've always felt either forced or biased towards either the shooting part or the tower part. Here they did a pretty good job, and the level design (which is important) for this kind of thing is great. Not only do the levels offer good options for setting up towers but they are pretty. That's something people skimp on when doing this kind of game design because often people are looking at terrain formation to figure out their towers rather than the aesthetic, but not here. There is so much to look at on these levels and it really works well with that signature Unreal-engine-shiny look. This seems like one of those times where people chose the engine based on the game design rather than the other way around, because unreal works very well for those sterile-futuristic-glowy arrangements. Some friends and I have an ongoing series of highlight clips of our sessions here. (first video is me doing it solo)			"

												If it's on sale for $5 or less, there's no reason to avoid it, but there's also not a lot of reason to invest more than a week into it.The fps element added to the tower defense adds less than one would expect.  The game gives the player an empty field.  The player makes rows with pylons to maze the monsters.  The player upgrades one of his towers between rounds and pew pews in fps mode during them.There are only a few monster types, and despite having different strengths and weaknesses, the tower placement strategy is no more interesting than making sure the right types of towers are built for the right monsters.  The fps strategy is similarly simple: shoot them in the weak spot until they die.The level of challenge is good for most levels, and the multiplayer is pretty fun.  Nevertheless, I can't think of a reason to prefer this over Dungeon Defenders, which has a lot more tower and character configuration strategy involved in addition to a more compelling levelling system.

												This game gets boring after few hours and while I loved Sanctum 1, the sequel didn't reach my expectations.It is more an ugly fps with little mechanics of towering. You have limited tower pool, limited money income to build and when you start to defend 3 cores it gets boring to run around and do the job that tower should do instead since it is heavily build to be an fps . I personally think that not having a 3d person view is one of the major flaw of this game. "

Sanctum 2 ReviewWhat kind of game is this? How do you play? What do you do?Sanctum 2 is a direct sequel to Sanctum, as one would expect, it draws several of the same gameplay elements from it, and changes them. It retains genre, which is exclusive to the series, the first person shooter tower defense cross over. You hold your ground against of hordes of monsters that will attack your core, should they reach it. You do 2 things to avoid this, shoot them, and build towers. Shooting is straight forward, but it should be said that you have infinite ammo. You can place towers on an overlaying grid on the map. Some towers attack, and some towers buff others. you must then hold out against the horde with whatever you have.ControlsThe controls are standard of the FPS genre and work well. It also has Xbox 360 controller support, and plays decently with a shield controller 10/10SoundThe music in the game fits the atmosphere well, and the sound effects are fine as well. Most all the voice acting is decent, but nothing special. 9/10GraphicsThe games graphics are nothing to complain about, everything looks good in unity, except some of the player models 8/10DifficultyThe game has a good difficulty and gets progressively harder as you go. however, I could not play solo at the end of the game, and needed to call for help from a few friends. 8/10StoryThe story is told in comic strip panels in loading screens, this works well, as it gives you time to enter then game when you are done reading them. This is good mechanic, sadly, the story is nothing ground breaking, and is kind of stereotypical. You also have to click on each individual panel at a menu to read the comics, rather than be able to use arrow keys to scroll. 7/10MultiplayerBy far the best thing about this game, resources are evenly distributed among you and your friends. you can place your own towers, and tower bases where ever you like, which makes communication a necessity. 10/10DLC All the DLC in the game is well worth the money.Just be sure everyone has it in multiplayer, other wise only the personal characters and towers work.OverallAll in all, this game is a must have on steam. If frequently goes on sale, and is well worth it at its default price, I highly recommend you give this unique game a try.9/10, Near perfect.			"

												Sanctum 2 is a unique Tower Defense style game with a twist. This time you have a champion/hero character that you are in charge of along with building towers to defend against waves of enemies.  They have tried to add a small story line, but its not really important, it is a TD afterall.Feel free to watch some of my gameplay ( and live commentary ) on YouTube here -

			Sanctum 2 Gameplay Walkthrough - Part 1 Co-op w/ Ruskie - PC Commentary Jonlaw98 If you enjoyed the video please leave a like - I'd really appreciate it, thanks! Interested in playing with us?		

Pros:• Co-op with up to 4 people is always fun• Unique level layout & design for walling• Tower customizations are plentiful• Each hero has their own special attacks• Beginner friendly• Quality settings are impressive• HUD is very niceCons:• Not many types of different enemies encountered • The first few waves are usually challenging due to mass spawn and not enough resources. ( Late game is fine)• Questionable weakspots for enemies aren't always detectedOverall, i'd rate the game a solid 8/10 - I would definitely recommend it and of course its more fun with friends!(maybe not randoms since everyone has their own creative wall in patterns which can be changed easily)If you enjoyed the video please leave a like - I'd really appreciate it, thanks!

												I had fun for about 5 hours, exploring the build options, learning the enemies moves, and creating and testing new defense strategies. After that, it became really repetitive, really fast. It was simply packing on more and more enemies without much variation or new, unique challenges. To me, it's a game with very little lasting power. Get it on sale if you want it.			"

												Sanctum 2 is a unique Tower Defense style game with a twist. This time you have a champion/hero character that you are in charge of along with building towers to defend against waves of enemies.  They have tried to add a small story line, but its not really important, it is a TD afterall.Feel free to watch some of my gameplay ( and live commentary ) on YouTube here -

			Sanctum 2 Gameplay Walkthrough - Part 1 Co-op w/ Ruskie - PC Commentary Jonlaw98 If you enjoyed the video please leave a like - I'd really appreciate it, thanks! Interested in playing with us?		

Pros:• Co-op with up to 4 people is always fun• Unique level layout & design for walling• Tower customizations are plentiful• Each hero has their own special attacks• Beginner friendly• Quality settings are impressive• HUD is very niceCons:• Not many types of different enemies encountered • The first few waves are usually challenging due to mass spawn and not enough resources. ( Late game is fine)• Questionable weakspots for enemies aren't always detectedOverall, i'd rate the game a solid 8/10 - I would definitely recommend it and of course its more fun with friends!(maybe not randoms since everyone has their own creative wall in patterns which can be changed easily)If you enjoyed the video please leave a like - I'd really appreciate it, thanks! (Subscribe if you're feeling generous as well)			"

												For the multi-player aspects of the game, I almost want to  recommend giving the game a shot. I can't do that and feel honest about it, saddly.I loved the first Sanctum. The combination of tower defense and FPS was brilliantly done and made multi-player even more interesting as one could choose to focus on either towers or weapons when spending resources. This made the experience more versatile than other games out there. The mazes one could craft could be complex and powerful all on there own, needing only minimal FPS support to bring down the enemy.In Sanctum 2, that has all gone away.The addition of a seperate resource for tower bases means that some maps, while having the potential for gread mazes, allow no more than a very basic level of defense and no real ability to slow the advance of enemies that are much more dificult to bring down than in the original game. The ability to upgrade weapons has also been removed, meaning that all attention from resources must be given to the too-few towers players are able to build. The weapons start off feeling a bit under-powered against the early waves and regress from there to seeming useless by the later waves. Many of the maps seem poorly made as well. Some do not allow bulding on the path of the enemies at all, while other have such narrow, short paths to the core that bulding more than a half-dozen towers is simply out of the question. Some maps seem like they should be well suited to certain characters (good sniping points for one, narrow turns perfect for shotguns or rockets on others) but the inability to propperly maneuver enemies severly limits the effectiveness of those advantages.Having set weapons for each of the four characters also takes away a lot of the customization options available in the first game. Each character also gets a passive ability to help make the most of their primary weapon. It seems to me that if the makers wanted to create four classes, it would have made things much more itneresting to give them each some kind of active ablities to use. While the passive abilities are nice, they tend to vanish into the background during gameplay.The two things that make the game playable for more than one sitting are the leveling system and the multiplayer. The leveling system makes replying maps a viable option and gives players something to look forward to. Multiplayer increases playability by allowering the player to have a fighting chance on later maps. Saddly, the map designs also make certain characters useless in muliplayer. For instance, if a map has lots of cliffs to fall off, or water (oh-so-deadly water!) to fall into, you can forget using the shotgunner in multiplayer. He will spend most of his time re-spawning after having been blown off the map by a teammate's rocket.I enjoy certain aspects of the game, and it might be worth getting on sale, but for the full price of this one, you can pick up much better games. Dungeon Defenders or Defense Grid come to mind, and I would recommend either.			"

												This game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ It takes everything that made the first game great and throws it out, focusing instead on the first person shooter aspect, which is horribly mediocre. The towers in this game are worthless coupled with the fact that you are limited to only a handful in number at any time anyway. Also bosses will smash through very limited mazes that you can build, destroying swathes of blocks and towers like they aren't there, forcing you to full engage enemies with your hand held guns, which as stated previously are barely passable. A strange design choice was to also add player death, which means that this time around mobs can attack you. While this in itself isn't a bad thing, alot of mobs will throw you around like a ragdoll or nuke you down in seconds - you have very little health. If you are thrown off of a bridge or cliff into the abyss, you will die. Some mobs will do an area of effect throw, throwing anyone near them.. it makes some mobs almost impossible to kill if they are on thin ledges and are immune to attacks unless you hit the weak spots. Often the respawn point is right near the core too, so if they are at the core, doing the AoE, you will respawn and instantly get thrown off again. If you are lucky enough to survive you will probably land in scenery and glitch into it, unable to move, unable to respawn (and did I mention that they removed televators? So you can no longer teleport like you could in the first game)This game was obviously designed with consoles in mind due to the limited number of things that you can do and the unintuitive interface; A bizarre decision by the developers considering that the first Sanctum did really well on PC. It tries to dazzle you with ragdoll physics and huge bosses but ultimately fails to provide the gameplay to back it up. This game is less about tactics and clever maze building than the first, in favor of bouncy, flashiness and guns. Buy the first game instead, Sanctum 2 is a wasted opportunity and not worth your time. A shame because I was really looking forward to it after the fun and original game that was Sanctum.3/10.I should note that the only reason I gave it even 3 points was due to the developer improving on a few issues that players unanimously complained about, and they did so very quickly. Unfortunately this still hasn't fixed the game and it's still no where near as good as it should have been. Still, a developer who listens to their fans deserves respect as that is a quality that developers lack these days - it's just a shame that they decided to listen to players AFTER the game was released and not bouncing ideas around before they had started the design phase.

												As a fan of the Sanctum series, I have alot of fun when playing Sanctum 2, it just has its own one of a kind atmosphere, coupled with fun co-op based gameplay makes for a recipe for hours of fun. Hopefully sometime in the near future we will beable to get our hands on a Sanctum 3, after all can you have too much Sanctum?			"

												I didn't play the first Sanctum so I wasn't sure if I was going to miss out on the story.Also Sweets is adorable.Ok, initially, I thought this game was really stupid. It seemed really easy. The difficulty kicks up at a good pace, though. Hoverers and Bobbleheads are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, though. You have the option of playing as 4 (5 with the DLC), possible characters , each with a different specialization. Skye is the rifle-wielding, double jumping, increasing damage as long as you maintain accuracy character,Sweets, Skye's sister, is the MASSIVE Rocket Launcher-wielding girl who can set fire to enemies she hits for a nice DoTHaigen is a rough rider with a shotgun who don't need no man and is willing to get all up in the lumes' businessand SiMo is the sniper who has great accuracy and does more damage to weak spots (orange/red colored areas of the enemies)If you have the DLC, there's also Tsygan who is very overpowered with the right set up. Moreso than anyone else. She does more damage on the shot that clears the clip.So you get to make mazes through tower bases in this game and your goal is to defend the core from the attacks of Lumes, the alien enemies on a rampage to get rid of cores for seemingly no reason.You also can place towers to help you dispatch any Lumes that might come your way.So this game is basically a tower defense game. It's a really good one, though.There is such a large variety in towers and there's so few towers you can carry at a time (4, I think). But that's not all. You're also a tower. As such, you can unlock perks that give you special abilities ranging from extra damage to making it so you can GOOMBA STOMP enemies. There's also a plethora of guns you can use to give you more possibilities with how you want to play a particular wave. At level 20, even, you unlock everyone's primary as a possible secondary.The enemies vary from small suicider to giant heavily armored behemoths. There's a lot of diversity among the enemies, but it's all really generalized to (Fast/Slow) (Ranged/Melee) (Low/Med/High Health) (Light/Med/Heavy armor) (Fly/Walk). What is that, something along the lines of 144 possibilities? Something like that. Overall, very interesting game with some unique gameplay. Solid purchase.			"

												Best game out there. If you're into a game like Defence Grid this is the game for you! Defence Grid is a game exactly like this but you don't just plant down turrets/machines, you actually fight up close and combat the aliens. Main part of the game is to have fun enjoy and meet new people. Aka, Defend the core. "

												I have been looking for a tower defence game like this for years... You get to design your layout while in first person mode and while other players are also working on the tower layout.  You can move eachothers towers and fight monsters with differnt weapons and skills you aquire...  up to 4 players can join a match which makes it entertaining to be able to play with with your friends in a match.At the current price of $5 for the complete package, I couldnt resist...

												It is much more polished and better all around imo than the first game. I find this game much easier to play and understand than the first, however it is still very challenging. What I really like most about this game is that you don't have to make the decision on which to upgrade, your guns or towers. Juggling between those two in the first game was a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Here, your guns automatically power up after each wave so you can just focus on tower upgrading, making it much less stressful. It is the type of game where it is best enjoyed playing online, much like Killing Floor or Payday 2. Playing solo is alright but there is no reason to not leave the game open to public and let people play with you to make the game easier. Well not exactly easier because the more players the harder it is. But with practice, you can get it down. Just always build your walls in a way that makes the enemy have to walk in a maze pattern to take them as long as possible to get to your cores and build the right turrets and upgrade them.The only downside is that you can get some stupid f--k who doesn't speak english and just sits on 12 tower bases and 800 upgrade points and barely does anything, forcing you to kick him before everyone gets♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and leaves. Every game you play online is at some point going to have a complete idiot, and this game has no shortage of them.The graphics are the high point of the game, some of the best looking enemy and level designs I've ever seen, and the game is optimized well so it should run smooth for most everyone. The enemies are very cool and everything looks awesome. It has great sounds and music too. It runs perfectly smooth at 60fps and never drops below that for me on max settings. Great mix of fps and TD, lots of fun, very challenging. 8/10			"

												It's depressingly disappointing. Sanctum 1 was a briliant and fun game that I've sunken many hours of my free time into all through my college years, Sanctum 2 on the other hand feels like they didn't quite grasped what made the first one fun.Sanctum 2 feels just... off. Your ability to make a maze is severely limited and you have to rely on your own guns to do most of the killing. The towers just feel like glorified peashooters, and the music just isn't as memorable and beautiful as in the 1st game. Unlocking new guns and towers adds some life to the game, but I couldn't really be bothered to grind them when I just plain did not enjoy the gameplay of this one.Sanctum 1 had a great formula down, and all it needed was some improvement and balancing, so what went wrong? I suppose the devs wanted to innovate more to avoid people whining that it's the same game. "

												If you enjoyed the first sanctum, do not play this game. I don't want to say it's worse, it's just different. Some parts of it are better: graphics got a huge upgrade, the comic portions of it are pretty cool and give it the story the first one never had. New wepons, towers, and enemys are cool. But while changing so much in the game, they just didn't keep the few solid things they had that made the first game a great game. If this game was released under a new title name then I probably would've given it more of a chance. I came into this one wanting more sactum and it just didn't quite hit that mark. But to be brutally honest, there were a handful of points throught the game that just made me go ""god ♥♥♥♥ this game"". Points where the ""different"" of sanctum2 wasn't the problem, but the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game design was (a problem I never had with the first game). These points were few and spaced throught the game but god they really stacked up and got to me where I just couldn't stand to finish this game.			"

												If your like me and you loved Balloons Tower Defence back when it was a thing, but you also desire an immersive first person shooter, then this is the game for you.This game is fairly well optimized and has surprisingly nice textures (considering its a couple of years old now). Even on its highest graphical settings I can get well over 100fps.I would recomend this game to everyone... except people who want a brilliant campaign with an exiting story to tell. This game lacks a decent campaign in my opinion. But otherwise this game is amazing.			"

												This game has a nice little idea. It mixes a strategy with an FPS, 2 genres in 1 game. You need to reload alot, but you have unlimited amo, which makes you a god. The turrets can do some damage, but not alot. The control keys feel extremely weird when you are reloading and aiming your weapon. The enemies are hard to take down, which makes it more difficult. The game has a Halo feel when you're playing. Even the weapons are Halo-ish. This is not the best game, but it certainly is pretty good game. I wouldn't recommend it to hardcore fps players, because the gameplay feels like it came from 2006. But I do reccomend it to people who are looking for a not expensive game under $20, or if you're a hardcore strategy gamer, I will reccomend it, because the gameplay tries something new with strategy, and strategy gamers might find that intresting and fun.

												Loving this game. With the complexity and physics of a tower defence game, and FPS gameplay added in, this unique game is very fun. It has many challenging levels, and tough enemies. And when you beat them, just crank up the difficulty by giving the enemies perks. This game is even one for the completionists, it is tough but at the same time quite achievable. You can even play online with friends. Loving it!			"

												This is a very different game from the first Sanctum. It places a MUCH heavier focus on the FPS elements of the game, and actual tower defense takes a disappointing back seat. Going into a map, you can only bring a maximum of up to four different types of tower with you. Once in, you can place a maximum of 15 before hitting the hard tower cap. However, because you're constantly starved for resources, your towers will never be able to do much more than soften up the enemy-- you are expected to do most of the actual killing.Furthermore, the game seems to have been explicitly designed with multiplayer in mind. Because the bulk of attention is shifted towards the FPS elements, without having another player to help you, you will struggle to keep up with the waves, especially on the maps with multiple pathways (which are most maps).Sanctum 2 might be a pretty fun game to play with a friend or two, but if you're a solo player, and if you're expecting an actual tower defense game, and if you were hoping for gameplay actually reminiscent of the first Sanctum, then I would not recommend Sanctum 2.

												This game is surprisingly fun. I played several hours of the original Sanctum. It was neat but not really addicting. This one definitely makes some fun and cool improvements. More variety with characters and guns. More towers, more maps. Better graphics and it feels much more action packed. I've had a lot of fun with it so far. I wouldn't expect to get more than about 15-20 hours personally, I got it on sale and definitely feel like I got my money's worth.10/10 much better than Sanctum 1, would buy on sale again.			"

Sanctum 2 is a fantastic combination of first person shooter and tower defense games.The leveling system allows you to grow stronger and gain powerful towers, to fight against the monsters with special abilities. There's no need for upgrading weapons because they always do absolute damage. Feel free to combine different perks together and gain special abilities. As you progress, every item will be unlocked and changeable. If you are solo player, I recommend this game for you. If you like to play with friends, this is a must-have game for you!			"

Even on its highest graphical settings I can get well over 100fps.I would recomend this game to everyone... except people who want a brilliant campaign with an exiting story to tell. This game lacks a decent campaign in my opinion. But otherwise this game is amazing.			"

												Well...I just got this game, because it was in a bundle and didnt know what I should expect, when I desided to install it, but damn, it was a fine piece of art.Being on a planet attacked strange plant like creatures, that seem to be awaken by human technology and destroying of nature, you have to hold back waves of enemys, to first start an counterattack, then...oh wait, spoiler!The game is a mix of FPS and Tower defence, so you have to fight enemys with a primary and a secondary gun and build new towers and most important walls in between.The Core features are:- Having 4 (5) classes with each a unique main weapon- abilities to customize your characters- a set of towers, you can build- an experience system, that unlocks new guns, abilities and towers to customize your tactics- enemys with different behaviour and weaknesses- a lot of different levels- customizable difficulty- a short story, explained by cutscenes between levelsIf you like tower defense games and shooters, you should try out this game.

												This game is a great mix between a FPS and a Tower Defense.  Good graphics, the sound effects are addictive ( love hearing the rattle of my gun) and the hero's are all different, well thought out and give each map a good replay.  So why the thumbs down?  Toxic community.  It's supposed to be a Cooperative game.  The default settings are public.  I've never had a problem hosting others.  The problem comes when joining someone else's server.   Your IP can be banned from a server the first second of a game (and I'm surprised how often this happens).  With a decent matchmaking UI this game could be a real winner.			"

												A very fun Tower Defense game mixed with FPS. Can be a bit difficult at times, but the co-op function works for all modes. Personally, I would suggest getting this game to play with friends, as solo it can get a bit repetitive (And very difficult) after a while. However, the difficulty doesn't seem to detract from the game. I would like to point out, you end up using the towers for mainly making mazes. The turrets will not be the #1 defense, for the most part you need to actively get in and attack using your characters, so if you are looking for a Tower Defense where you sit back and watch the towers do the work, it will probably not be for you.

If you have some friends that owns this and wish to play the game it is a great experience in multiplayer.It isn't just a Tower Defense game, it's a FPS/Tower Defense hybrid game! The enemies have weak points, you have perks, you can upgrade your turrets ( and infinitely boost them ).My only CON was just the game felt a bit repetitive, nonetheless it was a fun experience!			"

												Caligula is a 1979 Italo–American erotic biographical drama film directed by Tinto Brass, with additional scenes filmed by Giancarlo Lui and Penthouse founder Bob Guccione. The film concerns the rise and fall of Roman Emperor Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, better known as Caligula. It was based on a screenplay by Gore Vidal, co-financed by Penthouse magazine and produced by Guccione and Franco Rossellini. It stars Malcolm McDowell, Teresa Ann Savoy, Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud. It was the first major motion picture to feature both eminent film actors and pornographic scenes. It remains one of the most infamous cult films ever made and remains banned in several countries to this day.			"

												I cannot recommend this game enough. The number of perks and towers is absolutely excellent and there really is no 'Holy Grail' build that will beat every map without fuss. Each map calls for different playstyles and so the variety is there. My only qualm is that if you opt for the hellish experience that is 5 feats of strength solo then get used to hating this game for 2 hours then absolutely loving it for 10 minutes and thus repeating the process.

												It is an interesting idea for a tower-defense game: Only allow a very limited number of towers (15 attack and amp towers) and rely on the players to shoot the attackers.There are other games which do the cross between tower defense & FPS much better. I recommend Orcs Must Die 2 if you weant two-player.Many of the levels on Sanctum 2 will require at least four competent players to win. Very few are playable on your own.The graphics are nice, the game play is mostly okay, though the game is rather buggy. I have experienced a series of critical crashes that cause me to be tossed out of games with no explanation or support.Don't spend much money on this, though it might be worthwhile if: A) you can get it cheap, and B) it does not crash for you.tl;dr If your idea of a good tower defense game is a (potentially-buggy) FPS with very limited towers, only get this one if it's cheap.

												While game could be described as mix of FPS and TD, there is much more FPS than tower defense, especially when compared to previous game - dealing with Lumes yourself during action phase is much more important, while you are limited in how much towers you can place or how much resources you get to upgrade them.Yet, game is still fun and worth buying. Especially, if you find team for co-op.			"

												Fun TD with the FPS element. Best played with a group of friends you can skrew with while drunk. Bosses will maul your turret line so build expensive stuff on the sides and get a big mess of crap buildings in the center/or out of it's path and you will most likely succeed. Look around some maps for hidden free items, and don't jump off any cliffs! (but shoot your friends off them, the chick with the rocket launcher is the best.). I found the best gun to be the rocket launcher for clusters paired with the heavy hitting single target cannons, you can OVERCHARGE turrets, so if it is fully leveled pump more points into these suckers it can really pay off with alien fisting action!

												I did not like the original very much.  It was sterile and dull, and just felt like a less awesome version of Orcs Must Die! 2.Sanctum 2 is fantastic.  I don't know what it is.  And what?!  Three girls and one guy?  That ratio is rare as ♥♥♥♥!  And I like all the characters, especially Tsygan, the DLC character.  She is such a creepy, androgynous weird.  Like me!I don't know, I mean, the game seems really basic on the surface.  But it just gets brutal later, and immensely satisfying.  Customizing your character is neat.  Endless mode is just cruel, but great.I like the silly little comic book storyline.  And I like the limited, but spirited voiceover work.  This game is a steal at the current price.  It really just has the feeling of an indie title that went all the way and wisely used its resources to make its own version of a higher-level experience.  It comes off as a bit rough around the edges, but this is one of those rare cases where that actually adds to the charm.The whole campaign experience is just like some adorable sci-fi fan-fiction graphic novel.  Is it particularly inspired?  Not really.  Is it surprisingly engaging, just by virtue of its own earnestness?  I'd say so.  The game really puts itself out there and has a lot of self-esteem.  It has that sort of childish wonder approach to sci-fi I remember from Final Fantasy and other JRPGs.Worth checking it out.  Great fun with friends, or even alone.			"

												Sanctum 2 is a game where you (and up to 3 friends) stop waves of incoming monsters (aka lumes) by building a maze of towers and shooting them.One Part I LikedBy choosing between weapons, towers and perks there's tons of ways to defeat the lumes -- and even more when you have friends around. It's not just about upgrading perks or doing more and more damage either, new perks and weapons are usually side-grades that offer new playstyles.One Part I DislikedDuring the tower building phase, team organization can become one person planning the maze design and tower placement with everyone else not really interacting much.

												I have been playing sanctum 2 for only this past free steam weekand, but have invested the most amount of hours I possibly could during the time, and boy was it fun.The game is a sequel to ""Sanctum"" in-case you didn't know, which is a tower defense hybrid/ fps-game, with some light rpg elements to it. You have 4 classes to choose from I will list them in such a manner that will be easier for people to understand the quick and fast ""assault class"" with an assault rifle and a secondary weapon of your choice starting out with just 1 but collecting more as you level up. Next comes the ""grenadier class"" think a mixture of soldier and demoman from tf2 she can lay down a good amount of fire power, which causes spalsh damage and is good for keeping control of large crowds.Then comes an artificial a.i. which is ""sniper class"" just as it says in the name you can hit critical points of the monster from a far greater distance than everybody else and I recommend that he should stay behind everyone else as he is most useful from a distance.Finally the ""heavy class"" you carry a shotgun with 4 shells and can do the most amounts of possible damage, your goal is to try to get as close to the monster as possible and shoot him at point-blank range, you can also charge up your shot to do 1 mega ""buckshot"" of supercharged ions.Now comes into play the surprising and impressive tower defense mechanics they are pretty deeply implemented in the game and setting down the right guns and tactics for each monster are essential to survive, especially in the later levels.While not particularly difficult from the get-go, players will have a trial and error session with mulltiple losses and learning which ""turrets"" are more effective than others depending on the upcoming enemys. Once you get in the final mission of the ""first area"" you will have a challenge on your hand which will require good communication and teamwork, oh and I cannot stress this enough ""Sanctum 2"" is meant to be played in co-op mode with 4 players if possible, the game is just built from the ground up with co-op in mind, so if you can try to find good teammates who work together and listen to each-others advice.The sound of each weapon is appropriate for the guns belonging to them and feels good when pulling the trigger to each of them particularly charging up the ""rocket"" and letting it go for a barrage of missles, although some weapons do feel weaker in comparison and should be boosted up in terms of sound quality and volume of noise it creates, the voice-acting is limited but what the characters do say in there ""one liners"" is entertaining, cute, and cheeky.Most of the story is told through non-dialogue graphic novels, comic book style with the main characters going around their world to try and stop these hordes of aliens from attacking the core's of oxygen which powers the area they are in. The core of oxygen is the main point of the game to defend ""AT ALL COST"" because if you don't, game-over and civilians and soldiers die so feel sorry for them.... heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.Finally the graphics come into play the world around them and the level design are gorgeous and very stylized this is one of the better looking games i've come across that isn't a big developer, the character models ehh not so much. While they look cool in their mech suits and giant robotic arms, they lack proper detail which I would have liked to have seen for higher-res rigs like ""sub-surface"" scattering of some type and more detailed face, they seem to lack any emotion even when talking.Also the anti-aliasing in the game im no sure if it has some issues that need to be taken care of but, the AA does no visual quiality improvement what-so-ever. I cranked it up to max 8x msaa is what im assuming and nothing really at all. Eh but don't listen to me im just ranting now, all in all it's a good looking game with some minor draw-backs, or maybe after seeing crysis 3 and battlefield 4 running at max settings, everything looks ugly to me now ;P.Overall my final verdict on this game is an8.5 OUT OF 10,enjoy and cheers.

												Tower defence games can become somewhat repetitive but Sanctum 2 has several advantages in this regard. Firstly, it has FPS action - it's no Borderlands in terms of depth, but it's certainly fun and adds a whole new dimension to the genre. Secondly, it has some interesting class choices and thirdly it's no pushover. Add in co-op play and you have a winner.			"

												A tower defense game that isn't actually about tower defense, but rather about grinding (because all the good stuff is locked behind 50 hours of grinding). There are also only one or two winning strategies, the rest will only last you in the first few levels. Good luck figuring out which specific combination of the 50 sub-par towers will actually win you a level!There's also a huge emphasis on the players, rather than the towers. Not what you expect in a tower defense game.Overall, it's a pretty good game, but not a good tower defense game. Forced grinding is not fun.If you want a fun Tower Defense FPS hybrid, get the first game instead.			"

												READ THE LAST PARAGRAPH BEFORE FREAKING OUT.I played the first Sanctum pretty throughly, if I recall correctly, and it actually feels like the second game is a step down. Sure, there's unlockable perks and custom characters/weapon loadouts/perks, but the game feels incredibly rough compared to the controls and friction/feel of other FPS and TPS games.It seems to be a good game thus far, but aimations are sharp and clunky, many art assets feel out of place compared to others nearby, the game seems to be poorly optimized, the UI is not great and it's not easy to see what you're doing in an MP lobby, and there's a huge disconnect between the neat 2D art style and the mundane look of the 3D models and world.All that said, I can't recommend this game for everyone, and Steam has a horrible binary review system. I'm rating it a thumbs down because the game is currently very hghly rated, and I feel like these criticisms would severely impact someone who isn't specifically looking for a TD/FPS game. If that's what you want, and you can wade through what seems to be an unpolished execution, go for it.			"

												---=Update=---Here it is quite some time later and I bought the DLC on sale. This added some amusing things and also some very pointless things. My opinion is still mostly negative of this game, despiteThe game is now limited to 15 towers and unlimited maze length. Thanks, but thats not exactly what I was hoping to get.There is a sandbox mode that allows unlimited, but it gives you no progression or completion of the story.Still no floor traps of any kind. I miss my slow fields and killing floors.On the plus, the game is completable (finally), but only in multiplayer.The DLC adds more maps, TSYGAN, and new perks. The perks me want to bang my head on the table at how useless some of them are, but I completely understand some of them because of coffeestain's humor.Hostiles/Lumes are slightly less dangerous, but its still not soloable.---=Original=---After enjoying the gorgeous and insanely fun prequel, I bought this game as a 4 pack. After the tedious downloading of 8GB across 500kB/sec, we finally get to play.Storyline: 8/10It goes without saying that CoffeeStain has done a stellar job at creating characters and art. Being the writer that I am, I felt cheated by the fact that the gameplay masked the plot holes I broke my neck falling into.You start off saving the day as Skye. Obviously something horrible happened to her to have such a scar across her face. No clues or hints as to what happened there.We're intoduced to 3 more of the cast, Sweet, SIMO, and Hagen. Each have a primary gun perk and attitudes to match.Game Play: 5/10Maze game, cant get any simpler right? WRONG!! We started off thinking this would be cake. New guns, towers, etc.-You're capped at 10 turrets per map. Yes TEN!! You're then left to fend off the waves of Lume's with you, your guns, and your friends guns.+With the limited number of turrets available, all you can do is direct traffic.+Crushing your friends with your deployables? Priceless+New turrets are wonderful. They're a bit more intelligent at what to shoot.-Bosses are interesting, but a few are just OP. Many of them you have to shoot them in what looks like their mating orifice! Eeww! Just wrong. Minus one point.+Perks are a nice touch, but many just dont make a toot worth of difference.-You have to wait to reinforce. No more instant respawn.-Turrets and walls can be destroyed-TIME LIMITS!! If you hate deadlines, then you're going to hate this. Every checkpoint is time-limited. You have 100 seconds or so to do something, then get to a defensible position. The few 2 or 3 waves between are not limited. No option to turn this off.General notes:To say the least, the game was absurdly more difficult than before. Now you have to think about diagonal connections, not just left or right turns. The AI controlled minions that you'd typically find cowering in their bright orange suits, are actually taking up guns and doing something other than looking like static scenery and poor typists.We did not finish the game. We were left demanding 'm0ar!!', if not a partial refund. Shortly after, DLC was released. At its (still the same) price, it was simply not worth it. The first was more fun.			"

												It's a bit straight forward, and by a bit I mean a lot in conventional gaming lingo, but for a defence game it just feels off that the towers are not upgradeable to the max (all of them) and that you rely more on losing over and over to boost your lv. to be able to get to the next level. I really would not dare to buy it (I tried the free trial) because it has potential but it simply not a defence game... there isn't enough focus on the defence part and it is based in an 80% on you, the player, to do all the work which is basically just stand in there and take hits while unloading on the enemy. There are more negative than positive comments regarding the game, it may be an improvement in certain areas over the 1st Sanctum, but it simply isn't enjoyable as other free to play games. The only good thing is the trailer, it gives a false sense of action packed gameplay when it actually is more like: ""I'll kill 40% of the waves and then start all over until I get some one to play with me and not be cooperative, as in most online coop games, or get enough firepower to do it myself"".On a side note: I was crying of laughter with the chat system, my friend and I were fooling around with it instead of actually playing xD.

												I'm a big fan of both Tower Defense Games and FPS.Sanctum 2 = a very basic tower game + a subpar FPS = a game I can't play anymore after only 4 hours in it, while usually I always finish the games I start to play.Maybe it's super fun when playing with 3 friends, but in solo, it's a no-go.In a near genre, Orcs Must Die 1 & 2 are vastly superior games in all fields : controls, strategy, visual, story, atmosphere, polishing.Pros:- Can be played in coop at 4 players (but I didn't try it)Cons:- FPS controls are a shame compared to all good FPS games of the past 20 years- No saving during a map- Big Boss comes at end and destroy all ; no way to be prepared for that the 1st couple of times + no save = restart from the beginning- Gameplay designed for grinding (you get XP even when you lose, thus you get additional powers even if you don't pass the current level)- Tower Defense part couldn't be anymore basic and uninteresting (could be ok for you if you actually never played a Tower Defense game before)- We spend more time reloading our guns than actually firing at enemies- Pressing 'Esc' key doesn't pause the game, even in solo- Tower descriptions are shown only on the start screen, so good luck remembering which one does what during the game... >_<			"

												Utterly dissapointed... First game may have had a problem with weapons being not powerful enough, here thay fixed it a bit but in exchange they've taken away all the fun from the game... Finished it, played for few hours multi,  got bored out of my mind so I left forever...I loved Sanctum one, and I honestly recommend buying the first one to play with your friends, guaranteed fun and messing aroung... This sequel? Avoid it at all costs...			"

												I Don't hate the game I really enoyed it, I would like to give it both a thumbs up and a thumbs down because I have mixed feelings about it.Pros:+Greater variety of weapons and towers+Game has a story now+Pretty good level designs+Enemy varietyCons: -Most towers and weapons are pretty boring-Only 4 tower slots and 2 weapon slots-Limited money and waves force player to spend on roughly 5-6 towers before map ends-Maps are too short (singleplayer campaign that isn't on endless mode.)          For what it's worth, it's a good game for a good price. I don't think it's superior to the previous game. I think this game should have allowed the player to have more weapon slots along with tower slots which would allow the game to use more enemies and make the game a lot more of a challenge. As it Sanctum was more of a challenge with it's massive hordes of enemies compared to this one and it's 20-30 enemies per wave. I never found much challenge in this game because of the limitations. As I stated earlier I don't hate this game I think it's worth buying and playing, however don't play it with the highest expectations. If you're a fan of Sanctum this is a game for you. If didn't like Sanctum feel free to avoid it.			"

												I was hesitant on buying this game because it was made by the same people who made Goat Simulator, which is in my opinion a terribly overrated game, I decided to buy it anyways, and I can safely say, I wasn't wrong to question this game. I haven't heard a game scream ""lost potential"" so much in a while, the concept sounds fun, a first-person shooter tower defense game, but fails to do either of those things, as mentioned in some other reviews, it's more of an FPS than a TD, and I understand why people say that, but personally I think they messed up both aspects, the tower defense is dull, there is a very limited variety in towers, and you have to be good at actually using the ""FPS"" part to actually be good at this game, but even that is boring, you jump around to different spots, and just hold the trigger on an enemy until he dies, and the animations make it even worse, the enemies don't move or show any sort of blood or anything when shot at, and the reload animations are just the characters bringing the guns close to their chests, and pulling them back out ready to fire, there is a large arsenal of weapons to choose from but as with the towers, the variety is miniscule, they all practically do the same thing. As for the community, it feels like playing with bots, they rarely ever communicate, and for some reason will kick you mid-game for no reason.Instead of writing long paragraphs, I'll list the pros and cons here:Pros:Original conceptPretty good graphicsDecent voice actingLarge arsenal of towers and weapons to choose fromCons:Ugly or no animations at allCalls itself ""Mac compatible"" when a bunch of the features hardly work on OSXThe gameplay itself is dull, you'll find yourself doing the same thing over and over againHardly any tower or weapon varietyPretty bad communityRather rude and unhelpful developersHighly wasted potentialConfusing hud and mini-mapHighly repetitiveDLC even though the game does not feature enough content already to be worth 15$I did refund this game, I don't want to waste my money on this type of thing, so if you're reading the reviews to know wether you should buy it or not, I wouldn't reccomend that, almost all the people I know who play it only manage to get 1-3 hours of playtime out of it, and the game just isn't worth the price it's asking for, if it was free, I would still un-install it. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this game.			"

												The actual tower defensive aspects of this sequel are depressingly limitied. I remember in Sanctum 1 I could set up what seemed like an entire artillery battery, which would send me into harrowing WWI flashbacks if I wandered into them! Maybe it would be better with friends. Maybe my life in general would be better with friends. Either way, it feels like an odd, half-step backwards when compared to its predecessor. Worst of all many towers and even some of the character choices seem just plain worse than others. tl;dr I cry myself to sleep every night. Play Sanctum 1, and then maybe get a bit tipsy with some friends and play this game. Never play the robit, despite the fact that he looks cool. The sniper rifle isn't great.			"

												One of the WORST Towerdefenses. While the basic idea is fun, mixing FPS with TD, you have no overview whatsoever, some enemytypes are simply unfair and completly imune against the usual turret-damage and some some maps clearly show that they never have been truly tested, resulting in a hard difficultly because the creeps start to do things which is not intendet. Also you die often because you fall into the void, may you be pushed by the enemy across the map, glitch trough the tiles or simply step into a hole, because this games validates the core-meaning of starwars: there are no railings in the future which would prevent a meaningless step into certain death.

												I think it's decent, but I can't possibly recommend it to others because on top of requiring good aiming with high recoil and low accuracy weapons, you need to have almost perfect tower and perk setup - there is no room for error even if you are constantly switching weapons at the most effective times while the other one is reloading.Indeed, weapons are also pretty unbalanced. Some waves can't be done without shotgun, some can't be done without any lightning.. and so on... and when you don't know that and you attempt the mission many times over, you feel more frustrated than accomplished.Weapons do 75-90% of the damage while towers do 10-25% even if well placed, most of the time. When there are obstacles everywhere and you have to keep moving while the enemy is catching you up, even the weapon dps is low and enemies get to the core pretty easily.Ultimately, as a tower defense game it suffers from the same problem as ""Pixeljunk Monsters Ultimate""... that is, the difficulty ramp-ups, randomness and the resulting DPS decrease.(Been playing this with 2-5 feats of strength)7/10			"

												Sanctum 2 is a fun smart game. In sanctum 2 you can take the role of 4 different characters in an fps to shoot down alien weird bug things. You also build towers to help defend yourself and the other nps. You can build cannons miniguns mine launchers and other things to slow down the bug things or whatever they are. This game is very light in story because there really isn't a story. Through the ""campaign"" if it can be called that you play a first tutorial mission then you move on from stage to stage. In the loading screen it plays a comic that supposed to have a story but really it usually just a bunch of people in looking weird at a pipe and saying ITS""S LEAKING! Or something of that nature so no real story there. The thing is though I never found it a problem because of lack of story. This game is a bit like left 4 dead in the sense as it’s meant to be played with friends and your go in against big hordes of different enemy types. The tower defense part is okay but you feel like you do way more than the towers sometimes. The npc in the game are horrible though in this game. Most of them die in the first wave and they don't help. They also look very ugly. Also the player models look like crap. There are also a couple of glitches that can be annoying. This game feels like it should have been in late beta and should have had its problems fixed. Overall it is fun but make sure if you buy make sure it's on sale because $15 maybe a little too high. 7.5/10			"

												If you didn't played sanctum or don't play much of  tower defense games this might not be the game for you.For a new player to this game Sanctum 2 looks like it could be a a great co-op first person tower defense game. but it has a severe diffculty issue. Mainly the normal diffculty is too hard and the easier diffculty is too easy, there's not much in between. Also some of the levels seems to be dragging on forever, there's sometimes too many waves that takes forever to pass, it seemes to be padded for length. a much shorter waves at least in the first chapters would be better i think.This is the main issue here, the first chapters plays like the last ones diffciulty wise and time wise. i can only recommend this game for hardcore first person tower defense players.What i do recommend:It does plays well if your'e already highly experinced in sanctum games, the weapon switching mechanic each time you need to reload is nice although a bit cumbersome if you are used to waiting for reload as in regular shooters, the fact that you build your'e own maze for the enemies might appeal to some. it is a good game but for a very specifc group of sanctum fans.

												Beware of the♥♥♥♥♥♥control coding. Have xbox controller plugged in? Well, there is no way for you to play with keyboard until you unplug it. This is ridiculous, why can't I select preferred control device? Why can't I play a game that is partly FPS with the default(for PC) FPS control theme? And even more ridiculous, WHY THE HELL DID KEYBOARD WORKED IN THE TUTORIAL LEVEL AND THEN STOPPED WORKING WHEN THE REAL GAME STARTED???I really can't believe somebody was so infinitely stupid as to make such a basic design flaw in the commercial game. Not going to buy this♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												its an okay game at best. its a tower defense game. not much to be said. you set down traps and weapos and wipe out mobs. is it fun? sure. but its fun to be had in small chunks or if u have some time to kill. the only reason i got it cause it was free during the beta test. but even then i still want my money back. so i am rating it a 5/10 and giving it a thumbs down. theres people that will recommend it. but i cant due to the fact that these types of games are not for me.

												The idea is solid and the game mechanics work well as a tower defense game in FPS mode. I wish there had been more attention to detail in a few areas:-Weapons feel underpowered and not fun to shoot. There is no feedback from firing a gun.-The animations in general are not great. Enemy movement is stiff and rearmament of a 15 year old game.-Difficulty does not feel balanced to me. (this is not a huge issue)-Lots of non-exciting repetition.It does not excel as a tower defense game and it definitely is subpart to the current generation of FPS shooters. Unfortunately I found myself getting bored pretty quickly... "

												I can't recommend Sanctum 2 to anyone.Being a fan of Tower Defense and shooter games, I really thought I would like it. But the boring maps, enemies, towers and even classes made my friends and I give it up after merely 3 hours of gameplay. Having bought the Complete Pack I honestly regret spending money on this.I'll tell you whyClasses: The classes presented in Sanctum 2 is poorly designed, if not a complete uneccesary addition to the game.You don't lvl up the individual classes, so you can switch in-between maps without being punished for choosing something you disliked. But the only thing the different classes offers is a main weapon type (Sniper, Assualt Rifle, Shotgun etc) and a bonus like double jump or extra health. Unlocked perks can be used by all classes. The are NO customization, except a cheeky DLC that makes your character get a new skin.Enemies: Bring nothing new to the Tower Defense genre. Enemies are dull and the AI is stupid. Many of the mobs can easily be tricked to run back and forth by the player simply jumping between walls.Maps: Extremely stupid layout of maps makes me wonder what the developers what the hell they were thinking. Most times you're only able to build on half on the map. Useless friendly AI that dies of tower is placed near them, not that it matters because they die by the sight of an enemy.Towers: The Towers in Sanctum 2 is nothing you haven't seen before in ANY other Tower Defense. Most of them is rather useless and is not even worth building, since you're only able to have 15 towers in total on a map. Rest is just maze building. The towers can be upgraded to lvl 3, and after that you can 'Overcharge' it. Giving it extra stats, but these stats are determined by the game. You can't choose which stat to boost, the game allready decided that for you. Which in my oppinion just takes away alot of game customization (yet again).Conclusion: Sanctum 2 is a highly overrated game that offers nothing new to the Tower Defense genre. The amount of uneccesary stuff and stupid decisions made by the developers makes me want to ask for a refund after merely 3 hours of gameplay. Even playing it with 3 other friends couldn't keep me or my friends playing with the horrible AI, map, tower and class design.If you're in to the whole Tower Defense + running around with a builder. I can highly recommend Dungeon Defenders, but NOT Sanctum 2.EDIT: Also, having the weapon you're holding take half of your screen isn't pleasing in the slightest maner.			"

												I didn't care for the multi-player focus of this game compared to the first one. There's no true ""single player"" option. You have to start a match then set it to private or people can just join your game whenever. And since you're always considered to be in an ""online"" match you CAN'T PAUSE THE GAME! There's no teleports and the levels are much larger, so you really can't be everywhere you need to be with just one person. The towers are much stronger, but you're only given enough resources to build 4 to 5 towers in a level, which means the players have to pick up the slack, which is again a problem with only one player.I have absolutely zero interest in playing games with other random people because SO MANY PEOPLE ARE BAD AT GAMES!!! It's always a frustrating experience every time I try it.The campaign can be completed solo because I've done it. But the entire game was frustrating because so many levels were obviously designed with more than one person in mind.			"

												glad i tried it free first, what can i say, it's just not a fun game. feels like some hashed together alpha of what could have been a game. I didn't play the first sanctum, so i have nothing to cpmpare it to, multiplayer lacks communcation or planning, the game itself has litle or no explanatio of whats going on or what to do. if you want a tower defense game for free get DOTA2 or LoL. if you want a non free FPS well that's not going to happen, drop some cash on a fps.Probably tyhe thing that♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off the most, was you had to click the reload button every time you wanted to reload, even when empty, games have been refilling your clip when you'er out for DECADES. so in the heat of a fight wondering why you aren't shooting bullets and missing the R because you're trying to use 3 buttons at once, is ♥♥♥♥ed up.Don't see why this game even costs money when the tower defense aspec is done better in SCORES ans SCORES of f2p games.

												Buy the first one instead. The sequel has been turned into a generic borderlands clone with Call of Duty features. Amazingly, this sequel, which you would think would have more funding and be a more polished game, runs like absolute garbage despite the original running extremely well even on weaker computers. This game is a complete downgrade, adding nothing to the original except bland features that you have seen thousands of times before on every AAA game ever, such as recoil and reticle bloom, instead of being the unique game with character that the original was.

												Quick summary: More FPS, Less TD, now it feels like another FPS with a gimmick.Original Sanctum offered a nice blend of Tower Defence and First Person Shooter, where carefully planned blocks and tower layout was crucial to completing higher waves and individual skills as a shooter certainly contributing to keep the enemy mob under control. Sanctum 2 however seem to have watered down the strategy part and heavily leaned towards the FPS orientated game by applying constraints to the towers you can build.In the original Sanctum, the aim of the game was in-line with the Tower Defence genre, building up your defence as much as your resource allows until you're overwhelmed by the enemy or until you ride out the wave. Sanctum 2 has made three major changes from the predecessor;1.  blocks and towers now have separate resource pools2. there is a limitation on the number of towers you can have built at anytime.3. no more weapon upgrades.The above changes diminishes the reward for carefully thought out, long-term planning and favour on-the-fly, impulsive decisions. With blocks, towers and weapons not sharing tje resource pool, there are no more dilemmas regarding the early game. There used to be a choice on how to begin the game. Should I start building the maze early?, Add more towers and supports? or perhaps upgrade your own weapon and take responsibility for the enemy to come? you had a choice. Now the guns you picked cannot have custom upgrades, you can build only certain amount of blocks per wave and have a pitiful amount to build maybe couple of towers. There really is not much you can do different. This also affect the mid-game where you are left with more blocks than you need with no resource to upgrade your tower. For a tower defence game where resource management is the key, it seems so wasteful.The changes also shorten the length of the game. No weapon upgrade, limit on tower number and reduced resource for tower upgrades means the game cannot grow out for too long. In tower defence games it is a battle between how much and how fast you build your defence against how tough the enemies grow. Cripple the player's ability to upgrade and it is obvious that the waves count has to be reduced. To compensate and ""up the difficulty"", the big boss monster will walk straight through the maze you built, smashing away the beautiful defence you have planned and built. No tower defence for that part, just shoot.For Multiplayer, Sanctum 2 has introduced player levels with towers, weapons and even the tower slots using the ""unlock at this level"" mechanism. At first it may seem that this may encourage players of equal progression to play together but it significantly reduces the amount a new player can contribute to the game. A new player would have to do a little grind before joining a match.With that said, Sanctum 2 brought few nice ideas into the game.Player Classes encourages the players to work as a team, each taking on a particular role to play. the idea is nice although some role may feel left out when their speciality is not required or ill fitted for the job at hand. The original allowed for 3 weapons, which gave a little more freedom and perhaps better backup weapon would have been nice. Sniper class especially can be frustrating when the team requires fire rate than firepower and even worse if you are fighting alone.Sanctum 2 have lowered platforms and hostile enemies. This is one thing I actually commend and it feels like an improvement. In the original Sanctum, the enemies simply followed the shortest path to the core and players couldnt really be killed unless you stood in front of them. This time, the blocks are lowered in height and some of the monsters will actually chase you and attack you. It adds bit more action to the game without destroying the strategy of Tower Defence. No more of being lazy, letting towers do the work and watching the action as the overlord; you gotta get down there and contribute.In conclusion Sanctum 2 feels like it has deviated away from the planned, strategy cored gameplay that made it so unique and interesting. The higher dosage of FPS was welcomed but to sacrifice the TD element for it is highly questionable in my opinion. Perhaps for those who prefer more shooting this maybe more enjoyable. But for me who enjoyed  the careful planning of the Lumen killing floor, can't help but compare it to the original Sanctum. The boundless possibilities of building your own defence was what I was after and I feel rather disappointed by the lack there of.			"

												Sanctum 2 is the huge let down of my gaming list. After enjoying so much the first game, I was looking forward to prolong the experience. However, significant changes in the game core design completely altered my in-game happiness. Somehow, it feels more like a FPS than a tower defense. Restriction to build towers, shared resources, and overwhelming graphical effects were not the improvements I was looking for. Perks, leveling, and attacking enemies, were not the choices I would have made. For me, it is a disappointment because it doesn't capture and expand the atmosphere from the original title. It is a different game with which I did not fall in love. Maybe you will.			"

												Sanctum 1 included some pretty cool concepts. FPS tower defense? Hell yes. Everything about the game was perfect. The FPS aspect, admittedly was a tiny bit half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ But it did play an important role against some enemies.Sanctum 2 however ♥♥♥♥♥ all over the first game, by overemphasizing the FPS aspect, leaving the tower defense aspect in the dust. While leaving weapons about as weak as they used to be, you're lucky to kill 1, MAYBE 2 enemies tops before you're forced to reload (And reloading takes about 5~ seconds) Towers are far too weak, far too expensive to build and far too expensive to upgrade. Other than walls to block the enemy, there is literally no point in building a single tower because they don't provide much help.There also a larger emphasis on the co-op aspect, which hurts the single player experience considerably.Over-all, this game is just a terrible game. Take a pass on it.			"

												This game is not too bad in my opinion. I really like the tower defense and FPS look and feel to it, and how you can create defensive walls and turrents against enemy waves (even a boos fight). The challenge of stopping the waves of enemies, as well as how you must work as a team to achieve victory is what makes it fun.			"

												This game - contrary to it's prequel - is more a shooter than a tower defense game. While you can still build mazes the fact that your tower capacity is limited to a maximum of 15 towers IN TOTAL per map does not leave room for trying out neat combinations. Coupled with the fact that more often than not you're presented with 2 separate enemy-paths forcing you to spread your build and focus out and leaving you with just enough income after a wave to place one new or upgrade one already placed tower. The enemy variety is ok even though there are numerous enemies that your towers won't be able to deal with due to ""immune everywhere but red spot"" mechanics force the player to chase around big baddies at least a couple of times per map. The climax are the ""boss"" enemies that you face. In the last couple of maps I played i faced at least one boss per map. They spawn and... just smash your towers. They walk up to them and smash them or shoot lazers at them destroying your laid-out maze opening paths for the hords of enemis to simply bypass your defences making you deal with everything on your own. After this happened thrice to me I quit the game and just deinstalled it. It my be fun in co-op but i've lost interest before trying it out. In my opinion, just get the first game and ignore this, unless you want a horde-coop shooter with maze building elements. I liked the first Sanctum but this game was more frustration than fun.			"

												if like me you were expecting an imporved but basically same game as the origonal sanctum.... you'd be very VERY wrong. i find the level select menu a bit crap, the first game you could basically play any level you liked from the start, every game was relitive to itself, where you leveled up towers and wepons in game from level 1-6. not only this you could choose from all tower types and wepon types to suit your needs, now its more like an rpg! leveling up everything over a campain, sounds like an improvement? nope, your scientifically wrong, just play the first then the second and you will see what i mean. not only that you do not get all the towers from the start. i feel they tried to over complicate the game and in doing so made it♥♥♥♥♥♥ i doo like the new path system, but being stuck with one charicter, who cant have three weps like before. a stupid and frankly confusing game desperately in need of a custom game mode or a survival mode. as stated before, if it was sanctum 1 with the new tower bace layout (small rinbgs rather than blocks) it would be good. but its not. 3/10.

												Well, I dunno what happened to the beautiful TD/FPS hybrid Sanctum used to be. This mediocre co-op FPS seems to lack a lot of the charm and sandbox gameplay of the original, instead opting for a perk driven shooter mechanic with minimal tower involvement. The level design may have a few gaming culture references but no hidden areas to explore and a mere 12 achievements up for grabs. All in all it's a bit disappointing and lacks the longevity of the original. I'd recommend Sanctum 1 and Super Sanctum TD over this any day.			"

												I have taken it upon myself to fill in some of the blanks in this Game's pock-marked plot:Aliens are attacking (I'll assume it's a political ideological disagreement that has exhausted all efforts at diplomacy), and, to add insult to injury, the incompetent city planner responsible for the outrageously poor placement of the Energy Cores (of apocryphal importance) also ran up a considerable amount of debt, so a reliable team of two sisters, a random dude and a sniper-robot must fend off these Alien saboteurs on a very tight budget. Despite the state of war, it is expected that you play fair. Although it would be more efficient to build a 50ft wall with hundreds of maxed out turrets everywhere, it wouldn't be fair to the aliens, who request that you leave at the very least, a pathway one metre wide from their entrance all the way to the Energy Core. In return, the aliens have shown the decency to wait until your walls are set up before they attack in waves that gradually increase in speed, power, and numbers. The aliens will stop at nothing to destroy the Core, until you stop them once, then they give up and move to a different undefended core in a different terrain. This game attempts to be a fusion between the genres of First Person Shooter and Tower Defense, but the addition of Tower Defense mechanics to a First Person Shooter requires too much suspension of disbelief to operate soundly.

												This is a neutral review, even if I placed it negatively.Overview of Sanctum 2 - The Bumbling Monster Tower Defence game. I played this game when it went on the weekend sale of Jan 25 - 26, of 2014, as of now, its locked and requires purchase to continue.Graphics:This game... it looks 'Ok', the AA is meh, the graphics don't really detect your optimal settings so you might have to adjust this on the first boot of the game. Textures are meh as well, I don't think you would notice it much either while playing.Gameplay:Gameplay is mostly about tower defence as it was branded, the FPS mechanism  is there as well, a rather odd one, you can basically do the first level of any stage just with your guns, however, you rely on this progressively as you play. The guns are mostly bad in their starting shape, the extra secondary guns were better, the rocket gun was nice, then you got the Prototype Lighting gun, which was awesome, however, you do NOT get much XP from it. Either this was a method to balance the gun (you just sat there and fried enemies), or something else with a similar aspect. The perks mechanism is odd, mostly you do not notice this at all, mostly they simply gave stuff like more damage every 3 shots. You get a limited amount of slots for your towers, which you unlock as you level up. This is ok IMO. AI/ Logic:This is where the game mostly sinks. At first when I started into the game, I am greeted with dancing men. (screenshot was not provided because I forgot to upload it when I 'had' the game) I was... well OK, great, dancing men, then I saw a man running around in a circle like an idiot. It just left me a peferct taste in my mouth. Then I entered the game itself, more problems.http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198033530482/screenshot/612789213469161154I saw that my comrades were bulky spacemen with yellow eyes,  and did not know how to handle beyond a pistol. Great. Then I saw they died almost immedietly after a wave of monsters spawned. I supposed that added more to their value: nothing. Spacemen are usually like those in ME3 or Halo, defeatable but brave and standing, I got nothing but bumbling idiots. Towers:The towers are somewhat limited. In your starting position you are given a gattling gun and a rocket launcher. Later on you get more towers to your collection. They are mostly limited to a general 5 meter range. Even the largest and most perked gun didn't surpass this. The thing that did was a earthquake machine that did some damage to the enemies. It appears (quoting CyanideBillzard here), that Sanctum 1 had a better assortment of towers as well in terms of range and varierty. Monster AI:The monsters are fine, but mostly just a running animal that wants to destory the core, there is nothing wrong with that except that perhaps that an element of randomness could have been added, the badass warriors could have lept over the walls, flying monsters could have had more attacking AI, rihnos could have smashed walls. Perhaps I was too early in the game to see more advanced AI, but this is my opinion of the initial monsters. I was also pleased when I saw that the boss did bother to destroy all the towers, makes him look like an idiot, because naturally all the bosses go directly to the goal(AKA, the core). This boss didn't.Hardware abuse:Although I am running on a GTX 660M with 8GB of RAM, I suppose some lower end units might feel the pain, some people were complaining about lag. I didn't really notice much.Bugs:To be surprised I did encounter some. For example, some enemies did stupid things like taking a longer walk around the corner, I was flown into a fence and got myself stuck there( had to suicide to get out), and my shotgun got stuck in the tower creation mode. 


this game is bugged

By: Lot Creator




The multiplayer.The multiplayer is there, but it feels artificial.  I found the multiplayer communication in this game several times worst than any other game I have played in my life. There is no way of communicating with the other players(or if there is, I never noticed it or I'd knew where to input my help). The team works independently and you have very little idea what to do, just believe the team has a general idea in 1 minute. Also, be fast, or people will start to hit enter and the game starts regardless if you still haven't upgraded your turrets.Overall:5/10 game, - Game Feels like: It was a game you play, but you don't feel like you played it or will... in a long time. **This of course is my opinion and you are subject to see fit as how you please to read this review. This review was meant to extract the game's faults and pluses.			"

												I was going to write a good review and recommend this game for being decent and worth buying during a sale, but then I reached the Abandoned Lab level.This level shows how very flawed the game is:- Bad movement compared to similar titles (Orcs Must Die)You have the ability to jump, but I would not recommend you use it. Especially if you are using a weapon with any sort of knockback. Half the time you are going to get stuck in textures, fall off the map or just fall directly through it. This is not apparent in the early levels which are simple and flat, but as soon as you reach a map with multiple props or walls... Good luck, just good luck there, buddy. Impossible to play Sweet without getting stuck, unless you're high enough to change primary weapons. Also, bouncing pads? Bugged as hell. Rather than shooting you to their determined destination, they just bounce you up a tiny bit and then either cause you to drop down into enemies and get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by enemies OR keep you bouncing for a good 10 secs, letting the enemies destroy your core before you can intercept them.- Without DLC, you're going to have a bad time.There's little weapon variety and useful perks in vanilla Sanctum 2. Soloing the hardest maps (even without any Feats of Strength) is going to be extremely frustrating without DLC weapons and perks... and even if you do have those... have fun grinding for hours on end to unlock them!- Multiplayer? Multiplayer is a joke. I understand that it's a great thing if you play with a friend - and some levels are extremely difficult without co-op, but playing with 4 people quickly becomes a cluster♥♥♥♥, especially since enemies seem to get 10x hp. The 15 tower limit stays the same, so you will cap it very early unless you just pump all your resources into overcharging maxed towers - and believe me, you will be doing this most of the time in multiplayer. If you do play Multiplayer, do not play with random people. It will be horrible.- Limited towers? Another annoying thing is that you will be stuck with only 4 towers to take into your game. Really doesn't give much variety. The standard cookie-cutter build is Amp + Lightning + Scatter + Kairos.  Incidentally, some of the best towers outside this selection are DLC-only. ALSO, you will usually get the same amount of resources every wave, regardless of whether it's the first or the last. With the lower max level for towers, this is understandable, but it sometimes feels like you could have done a lot better if you had 50 more for an extra tower or upgrade.EDIT: Not to mention the computer resource drains if you alt-tab this game. First time I ever experienced that every single program would lock up and an on-going voice chat would lag in sync with the game's dropped framerate.			"

												I have played this game almost all the way through. It was a blast playing this game multiplayer with friends, and we came across two problems:1.)The last DLC is COMPLETELY UNPLAYABLE MULTIPLAYER. Everyone other than the host crashes constantly rendering the game unplayable.2.) The last map of the non-DLC was too difficult to complete on normal difficulty with two people. All the other maps had challenges, but we couldn't finish this. Take this problem with a grain of salt.			"

They are very ugly, they look like anorexic meth addicts. No reason for them to look like this as you only see them a few times. Not saying they need to look like supermodels but meth addicts? Seriously ? Update and change please. Its almost bad enough I don't really feel like recomending this game as I don't want other people to have thier eyes bleed too lol			"

												Discounted to a couple dollars, spammed like crazy on everyone's library even though no one wants it, and they still can't unload this drivel. As a FPS it sucks, movement is not at all smooth, the interface feels like a sloppy console to PC port, the gameplay is repititious and jerky even on a high end system. I noticed no major bugs but really, but I expect that as a bare minimum. The concept is solid; a FPS that allows you to build turrets and use your NPC allies to stop wave after wave of monsters in a maze-like setting, but if that really appeals to you Dungeon defenders does it all and so much better, in terms of graphics, mechanics and gameplay.

												I'll start by saying that I have never played Sanctum 1, and write this review for other people like me who are new to the franchise.As a tower defense game, it does little to reward creativity, and as a FPS it does little to reward skill.Maps are typically open, allowing for a standard horizontal-maze style defense which is mathematically optimal in every scenario for creating the longest creep path. Different tower types are similar in damage and upgrade potential, making a choice in towers somewhat meaningless. Different styles of towers are geared towards different mobs, but one is nearly equivalent to any other against all mob types in many cases; at least for three of the most obvious choices in primary damage towers.Character choice is extremely unbalanced, with the shotgun-wielding character capable of dropping the toughest creep in the game in a single shot, and all other characters being far less effective than a single tower. This makes the only important skill in the FPS side of the game being in the right place at the right time to drop the tough mobs.Social aspects of the game are emphasized and facilitated well by the UI, with an effective (and kind of funny) text-to-speech program, and public matchmaking. However, addition of more players limits the ability for a group to think through tower defense design since build time is limited (loosely though, plenty of time for an individual to plan the field), and building resources are automatically divided amongst players.Sanctum 2 may be a fun game for players who are playing with people they know, who can organize a well thought out tower defense layout in a relatively short amount of time, but other games such as Dungeon Defenders offer more potential for skill, creativity and character development.No offense to Coffee Stain, but they should be spending more time with great (and hilarious) games like Goat Simulator.

												I don't play many tower defense games, but I really like this game due to the blend of fps and strategy. It gives you something to do while the waves go on, and it's a seperate line of defense in itself. Using the proper perks and weapons, your character can deal some real damage. I would recommend playing on a harder difficulty because normal isn't very difficult at all.			"

												for those hoping for a sequel to sanctum, you will be disappointed. they turned it into a dumb first person shooter; towers and mazing strategy are now a distant secondary to your player and your weapons. whats even worse is that its not a FPS against other players, but vs bots with mediocre AI.  a real disappointment and waste of money after playing the first sanctum for dozens or hundreds of hours. I uninstalled the game after half an hour.			"

												A FANTASTIC SEQUEL to Sanctum. Feels way more like a AAA game and far less indy game. So many improvements and a developer that fixed my only complaint with the game within 36 hours of release. So glad I picked this up, so glad I didn't listen to the haters on the forums. A trully fun game with your mates, team work isn't essential, but still needed. LOVE IT>			"

												Let me preface by saying that I would not recommend any tower defence games on Steam. I love tower defence games, and none of them measure up.If you think the idea of Sanctum--tower defence with first person shooting--sounds interesting, then play this game. It's a big improvement over the first game.However. . I found the game a bit unstable. It crashed maybe 50% of the levels I played. Now, my computer is getting outdated, and I'm going to build a new system soon, which would likely improve this issue, however, you should be aware of this if you're only meeting the minimum requirements.I found the levels themselves to be too short. I played through about half the campaign. Levels rarely have even a dozen waves to them. I want to fight through, like, 50 waves. I never have enough gold to populate my maze with even a dozen towers, especially if some need to be upgraded. Often my mazes are only half finshed, if that. I'll enter a level, and plan out in my head the form the maze will take; establishing towers that will be extra effective as the maze doubles back on itself, but the level is over before the maze reaches that point. Although I didn't get to the end of the game, I never felt like I got to go out all, and only in one of the levels can I say I build a maze that was like the maze of my dreams. All the other levels just end too soon! Though, to the games credit, the level design themselves are really good. Actually, like, really, really good. There's a lot of variety, and they never feels like I'm playing the same levels I've played in a hundread other tower defence games. It's just that the levels end too soon; I never get to appreciate their designs. I can understand that, doubling the number of towers, and the number of enemies, may cause some issues, so it is understandable, however I'm left feeling like the levels are cut short. Another issue is that there's no in-level save. It's a good thing the levels aren't any longer, really! If your game crashes, or if you lose a level for any reason, then you have to play the whole thing over again! That can get frustrating. Especially if you only lose at the last wave because you anticipated something wrong, so now you have to rebuild the same exact maze and do everything over again, only on the last level build one tower differently, or something like that. It's just frustrating. Although it's nice getting to build a maze differently, it sucks when the game crashes and you have to play the level over again.A lot of the other things in the game are well done, and make the game stand out as a very unique entity. It feels very personal: with so many ways to loadout your character, and that gives you a lot of freedom in the game. It's very relaxing to play; I've enjoyed playing it a lot, it's just not meeting my desires for tower defence planning.The game looks and sounds great. If you want to play something different; something that you can play multiplayer cooperative with your friends, then this game is a great choice. I hope there will be a Sanctum 3. This game has been a great improvement over the first game. With levels that let you build more complex mazes, it would be an easy buy. I feel tower defence fanatics will feel the levels are unfinished when they end so soon, though people looking to casually play a game with friends will have a wonderful time here.			"

												What killed this game for me is the scaling of enemies when playing co-op with friend. It felt like I was punished for playing multiplayer. Levels were a lot easier to solo. Every single enemy takes over a clip to kill (except the speacial weak enemies). I do understand the point is to work with your towers but it still makes you feel really underpowered and pretty useless.Also in some levels it was annoying to constantly fly off the map, when there were random holes on the ground.Other than that it was fun to play until the point where I got overwhelmingly fed up with the enemy scaling.

												If you're a fan of the original Sanctum you probably are not going to like this one.While the first sanctum was a rather seamless mixture between Tower Defense and FPS, focusing more on the Tower Defense aspect, this game quite the opposite focuses on the FPS aspect and extremely little on the Tower Defense aspect.To be perfectly honest i found this game very boring, about as boring as any other modern FPS game, the Towers could just as well not be there because they feel so weak.This game is not for everyone, and especially not for people who liked the original. Make sure you really really want this before buying it.			"

												Sanctum 2 has terrible Linux support.  Not only does it run much less smoothly than its Windows counterpart, it frequently crashes.  On some levels (such as ""Canopy"") it will crash 100% of the time.  Changing the MPAA graphic setting also reliably causes a crash.  Sometimes the game will freeze, making you forcefully close it, or X server must be restarted, or the OS must be restarted entirely.  No combination of GPU drivers, GPU settings or game graphics settings resolves this.Sanctum 2 is brought to you by the same developers as Goat Simulator, the game that's so buggy users have decided (as you will see from MetaCritic reviews) that they must have developed it buggy >>on purpose<< as a joke.  But the joke is on us, the consumers, for paying for such shoddy software as this developer puts out and refuses to fix.			"

												unpolished and evidently abandoned so that the developers could devote their time to a stupid goat-joke-game.i put my trust in this publisher and bought this game based on the merits of the first one.doing that, sometimes turns out out be a mistake and that is what happened here.this game showed a great deal of promise. and unlike many owners of their previous game, i didn't much mind the change in play style or even the pointless cartoons that can not be bypassed but there are a lot of things wrong with this game including performance issues and unwinnable maps but it's become apparent they will never be addressed.performance issues on the unreal 3 engine is where i draw the line, if a developer can't get that much right then they aren't even trying. also the game probably would not be as difficult if it weren't for the poor performance when the on screen action gets heavy.fyi, i play on an 8350fx, asus crosshair V mobo w/16gb ram and an r9 290x for gfx and it's all water-cooled, yes, i know what i'm doing. there is no reason on earth that any unreal engine game should lag on this system @1080p besides poor programming. doubtlessly, coffee stain studios' fanboys will attempt to contradict me on this, well i say ♥♥♥♥ them.regrettably, i put coffee stain studios on my pay-no-mind-list of game publishers. i waited very patiently for them to polish this game up and remove only the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥ flaws but here we sit a year and half later and these flaws remain.devoting their resources to developing that goat game and never going back to finish this one, was a huge stab in the back to their customers. i tryed to like this game but every time i play it, i leave♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. i will never buy another one of coffee stain studios's products based on this purchase.

												A complete 180 in game design for the worse. The original Sanctum was a great change of pace for tower defense games, putting you into the battlefield with upgradable weapons (a tower defense with shooting). Sanctum 2 takes the original's premise too far in the opposite direction in terms of game balance. Sadly, all the towers are too weak and this has become a first person shooter with towers. With very limited resources and base blocks, you will be building or upgrading on average one tower per wave with mazes only becoming effective near the end of the map. Even when you do finally make a great maze that is somewhat defensible, many of the bosses can smash their way through your base blocks, destroying your towers and creating a free path for enemies. The worst part is the difficulty curve; the early levels are tutorial-esque cakewalks which quickly drop off into frustrating trial-and-error tests of endurance.The map design has improved significantly, including 16 levels with improved music and sound providing great atmosphere. While the drawn slideshow cutscenes are entertaining and provide some pretense for the missions, the story and characters are never really fleshed out. Sanctum 2 combines sub-par FPS elements with sub-par RPG elements and sub-par TD elements to create... a surprisingly mediocre game. This could've been a fantastic co-op game if they just built on the original's game design instead of going for the CoD/console audience.			"

												Sanctum 2 is not about tower defense, it's about monotonously shooting waves and waves of enemies with sub-par guns and grinding your way to decent towers so that some day, you might be able to play a game that starts to look like it could be called a tower-defense game. Instead of unlocking towers per map (Like Defense Grid 2 did), you only unlock towers and weapons by leveling. This means, in theory, that you could grind level 1 over and over and have all the towers. It also means that if you don't like grinding and just want to play through the game, you'll be stuck with some very basic towers, upgrades and weapons that may not suit your play style.The updated graphics and larger array of weapons, playable classes, passive abilities and towers does not make the game feel any less inherently broken.""Boss"" creatures can break through your walls and towers and seeing as they can do so rather randomly, they might end up targetting vital blocks forcing you to pretty much restart your game because all of a sudden your initial investments become a complete waste of money. Some maps are well-designed and fun to play but a lot of maps are either an exercise in boredom or an exercise in futility as you struggle to find the tower set-up that the developers had in mind when they created the map.Your main weapon can never be exchanged, only your sidearm can. Unfortunately, there's no way to upgrade your main weapon and although powerful, it will never evolve to deal with situations on the battlefield. Instead, memorisation of enemies is key. If you enjoy running around and holding down the left mouse button constantly listening to lasers go ""pew pew"" constantly and putting very little though into creating and optimizing your tower maze then Sanctum 2 is for you.Everyone else should just avoid it unless it's for sale with a 80% discount or higher, go play Defense Grid 2 instead.

												Played this game for many hours. It is very fun, addictive, and enjoyable. But I discovered the further you get, the more Sanctum 2 has a distinct identity crisis. The cohesion of FPS and tower defense breaks down becoming dysfunctional.This results in the biggest problem Sanctum 2 has: its difficulty curve. The game gets disproportionately more difficult the further you get. Eventually it gets to a point where it becomes impossible to beat levels solo. Eventually it even gets too hard to beat a level in co-op. A lot of this deals with the unreasonable restrictions Sanctum 2 places on players. Some of these are due to Sanctum 2 being designed with a heavy bias towards co-op play. Others are the foolish methods to control which genre the game is trying to beFor example- There are tons of towers available to unlock, but you're limited to using 4 at a time relying on co-op parters using their 4 tower slots to fill in your deficiencies.- You're encouraged to corral enemies in an enormous maze BUT- There's a low restriction on the number of turrets that can be placed. - Not all turrets are created equally. Some are weak and meant to be replaced by a stronger tower as you unlock them. Unfortunately ranking up is unreasonably slow and requires grinding.- Not all FPS weapons are created equally. Some characters feature a default weapon (the one you can't change) that is useless weak garbage.- Certain enemies were designed to bypass turret defenses throwing favor towards FPS elements- A few of these FPS specific enemies result in a very uneven increase in enemy strength.- Certain enemies are just plain bawllshiat. Specifically bobblehead enemies that take zero damage from turrets, and can only be damaged and killed by shooting their extremely tiny and constantly moving weak point.-Some of the later stages you will find yourself losing (typically near the end) because of a wave of these same stupid enemies that take the burden of defeat off your turrets and place it squarely on the player's FPS skills.The sad thing is I actually like Sanctum 2. It is a good game! I would recommend it if it didn't get so hard for stupid reasons so early in its campaign. That just kills the enjoyment got out of it. If you wish to get Sanctum 2, thankfully it tends to go on sale frequently. The base price for the core game is extremely high and not worth it.			"

												Generally a unsatisfying experience. I'll try cut it short and put down the ways that make the game something I cannot recommend.The level design is unenjoyable. While it trys to escape from the tropes of regular tower defense ways, the method it does it just doesn't quite work as well as it could. The thing that makes a good tower map layout is loops. Causing the mobs to go round and round hitting the same turrets as many times as you can. But many of the maps don't really allow for this, while there is certainly some room for loops often I found the shapes to have these awkward little spots where you just can't make the loop work and room goes to waste.There are ways that you can screw yourself over if you build up a maze in a certain way and in the next turn the game changes the flow of monsters in a way that means your high powered turrets aren't being used and you have to panick while enemies bash away at the powercore while you try to pick them off with your weapons. I understand that the game wants you to adjust your maze in major ways between waves, but sometimes I've built it in a certain way that I just can't or I'd rather not.The special enemy types can be frustrating to take down. There is an armoured one will armour everywhere except a little spot on it's rear, so you'll be running behind it shooting away at it, and when the enemy hits a corner it will suddenly snap to a new angle. There's no smooth rotation, it's just bam, it's now at a new angle and now you have to move to compensate for this. All of which might just be okay, but perhaps you've built a maze with many angled corners. Now the monster will be snapping to new angles every few seconds while you're trying to shoot away at it's rear. The only way to do a significant amount of damage is on straights. Ahh it's just frustating.The sound design is lacking, especially in the weapons. I can't quite put my finger on what it is exactly, perhaps the lack of punch that makes you feel like you're actually making a dent.I didn't like having abilities that and towers make you more effective and make the game more fun locked off until you put in the required time to unlock them. Some people like this.. and I know it was designed to keep you engaged and also to make you to try some unlocks that maybe you wouldn't use.. but I just don't like these systems.It really feels like this genre could be something special, but I can't see that something in this game. Perhaps another studio will be able to fill that hole.I played it for two hours with a friend and another three on my own and I've found that it wasn't something I found fun, which is too bad.			"

												This is a pretty standard FPS TDYou try to combo your weapons and your towers to take down waves of aliens (imagine mvm_ from tf2)The problem with the game is that it's absolutely a very bad follow-up game to Sanctum (1). If you want to play a nice TD you don't really want limitations on the amount of blocks (paths) you can use, and the class-system from Sanctum 2 is just awful.Conclusion: Just buy the original Sanctum game, it's actually way better.

												I can't think of a single game in my library that made me say: ""I really regret purchasing that."" Sanctum 2 does just that. The game it self doesn't even feel or look finished. The animations are poor, and the ""cutscenes"" or ""story line"" is made up of a couple of images with text bubbles. Alot of things felt like they were just place holders and that this game didn't get the attention it needed. The barrier building and upgrading isn't fun or exciting because the pathfinding for the AI just charges through whatever maze you make. Once you've made one maze though, you've made them all. The game lacks variety. The good news is, there is still a little bit of a community that continues to play. So it's not hard to find a game if you are interested in getting it.			"

Some times it's 1000x sensitive, and others I'm pulling it around the screen.*no reload or health bar?*no health bar on the defense target? how do know when I'm about to lose?* The levels are what I expected, level ups etc, it's not a bad game, but it feels like it's running on 20 year old engine. As with all gaming these days, ok concept, not polished whatsoever. But hey, I'm sure they made the deadline.PS and due to spinning left, I had to unplug joystick(s) to play... awesome QA guys lol			"

												It's a clever and interesting concept, but not very well executed. The game engine used is very clunky and limited and doesn't suit the level or gameplay type very well.Also, there are a lot of problems with lag and player connections with online play, which is a big problem given that games are very fast paced and hectic. This is only really worth getting when it's on sale.P.S. Good luck finding a match that isn't hosted by a control freak.			"

Or maybe after, say, 12/24 hours of gameplay, you cannot refund it for full price.			"

												A great take on classic Tower Defense. If you like Fps with fun gamplay, i think you might like this to. You don't need to be a Expert tower defense player to like this game. Get it and love it!			"

												Not a bad game if you get it with friends, other then that getting a match in multiplayer is just awful. You will get kicked from lobbys for no reason and people will ban your IP just for putting up towers. Other then that only get it if it is on sale. Great game terrible community fix that and I will reinstall.			"

												Sanctum 2 is the sequel to the world’s first Tower Defense/FPS hybrid game. Pick from four unique character classes and embark on a mission to protect the oxygen-producing Cores from hordes of deadly aliens who are threatened by their existence. Outfit your character exactly the way you want through the new and extensive customization system. Choose your own loadout of towers, weapons and perks, but choose wisely because you are humanity’s last defense against the unrelenting hordes set out to destroy it. Sanctum 2 is a new game completely rebuilt from the ground up using community feedback and innovative design to really push the bar of what an independent studio can do.In Sanctum 2, you will utilize elements from multiple gameplay genres to succeed. Construct towers and walls during the building phase before the enemies attack, then jump into the fray and blast everything to pieces in FPS mode. You can progress through the single-player campaign yourself, or play with up to four friends in co-op to discover the secrets of the planet LOEK III and learn the backstory on why the aliens are so intent on destroying the Cores you are sworn to protect.

												Boooring. I tried this during the free week for the hell of it, and it's as mediocre a shooter as they come. No special gameplay features to set it apart from anything you've played in the last ten years of FPS's. Plus, even with graphics turned down, it chugs like a frieght train. If you're a complete tower defense fanatic, it might do something for you... I guess.			"

												Sanctum 2 seems to draw inspiration from the most mediocre tower defense and fps games to deliver a bland experience. The shooting mechanics are floaty at best and unfulfilling, and the defense options are overly simplistic. I do enjoy the class system, but a great opportunity to fleshed them out with unique towers is squandered.The game isn't necessarily horrible, but I would expect more from a sequel to a popular game. Orcs Must Die and similar games offer a much better experience.			"

												This game is pretty dumb. I got it in a bundle and thought I'd give it a try since I do like shooters, and you'd think an FPS/Tower Defense hybrid could be cool, right?Wrong. Unless of course you like shooters where you can't possibly die and are pretty much ignored by the enemy, who just runs along a pre-determined path around your barricades just to attack your core.They could have simply left the shooting the player does out of it, and just had it be a tower defense game with a unique camera angle for all the good it does you.If you like Tower Defense, you might like this. But if you're looking at it for an FPS experience, I would advise you to look somewhere else.			"

												Sanctum 1 was 100x better...Pros:Better graphics/animationsHealth bar that shows how much health enemies have, in numbersCons:Have to unlock weapons and towers before you can use themYou can be killed by monsters? Seriously? Who thought that would be a good idea?Towers are smallerEnemies are smaller and harder to hitEverything is smaller, it just feels crampedYou can't teleport around by going into overviewIf you can get a teleport tower, you have to unlock it first... but I haven't played enough of the game to get that far, and I don't really have any desire to play this game anymoreOverall, the gameplay is less emersive and harder to follow than Sanctum 1. What I loved about the original Sanctum was how simple and easy to get into it was...Sanctum 1 was 10/10, this I would give maybe 3.5/10. Really a huge let-down and dissapointment. Save your money.

												A complete betrayl after the success of Sanctum 1. Gone is the granduer of defending your base; in its place are unsatisfying weapons, dull tower choice, uninspired level design and frustrating difficulty. This game is no true sequel to the earlier Sanctum. Still a great uninstalling simulator in 20152/10 dumb ♥♥♥♥ baby game.			"

												Sanctum 1 is better. and probably cheaper. This game just did not feel as fun as Sanctum 1 and I found that it strayed too far from its Tower Defence roots.			"

												Whoever designed the character models needs help. They resemble walking, anorexic corpses with massive hulk power fists on their left arms. For all I know, they might have been designed by a 6 year old who is inspired to make a rip off of transformers. For this reason alone, I cannot recommend this game. However, everything else in this game is pretty good. So if you can handle the world's ugliest character models, then I would recommend this game. If you cannot, stray far away from this product.
