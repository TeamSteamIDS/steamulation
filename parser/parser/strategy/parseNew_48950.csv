												Greed Corp is a turn-based strategy game that you can play either singleplayer, vs up to three pcs, or multiplayer.  The story is a basic one for each of the four playable groups; however, their differences in-game are graphical only.  The full story took me around twelve or so hours to complete.Greed Corp uses a hexagon-tile battlefield in which you can use the land in order to gain more money to buy units and buildings.  However, the more you use the land to gain money, the more it deteriorates and disappears completely.  It is a delicate balance between building units to conquer land and kill enemy units, using the land for money before your opponents do, and conserving the strength and number of tiles in your control.  The win condition is to be the last player left standing.I greatly enjoyed this game and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a turn-based strategy game.  Learning how to play the game is fairly easy, but there is definitely strategy to be had in this game.			"

												A fantastic indie game with a moral that, though prevalent throughout the campaign, doesn't overshadow the wonderful mechanics of the game itself. The game is focused around a world made up of tall hexagon-shaped pillars which stand in the middle of a massive ocean. The various factions which occupy the world have finally begun to reach the bottom of the seemingly endless supply of resources in the ground and their constant drilling and mining has caused large portions of the world to simply collapse into the ocean. The turn-based mechanics are easy to grasp and are complex enough to let even veterans of such games enjoy the fun. The graphics quality is fantastic with a low setting capable of running on very low end machines. The game does possess a significant amount of replayability thanks to the multiplayer mode although the single player campaign is reasonably fun the second time around.			"

												You know, even with how obscure this game is, it's possibly one of the best strategy games I have ever played just for the pure sake that it's so simple, but so mentally, strategically challenging. Territory only lasts for so long, since you harvest money from the land, and that land is slowly destroyed because of it. The war can only go for so long before somebody's section crumbles and falls down into the endless abyss of clouds.			"

												At first blush, this game seemed like it would be pretty good - but that feeling doesn't hold up over time.   While there are 4 different factions in the game, they share the same 4 units.  The single player campaign quickly becomes tedious when all battles consist of the same exact strategy,  I can imagine this game might be more enjoyable multiplayer, but that aspect is pretty dead.

												How horrible of me, to have forgotten to write a review for this game. Go and play it. Greed Corp is a great example of a game with a few, simple mechanics that is easy to learn and harder to master. I liked most things about it - the low count of units and associated rules, the gameplay mechanics (especially the collapsing terrain), the visual style. 10/10 will buy for my friends, too.			"

												greed corp is a turn based hex game but different to most strategy games. the difference is its much more simple. but that is what makes it awesome! so simple yet so fun.the game takes place on some world were either incredibly cute walker like robots or people piloting incredibly cute walker type machines live. the place they live is also so way high up in the sky that it would probably take half an hour to hit the ground if you fell off. and its divided into hexes that you fight over.the fighting or gameplay is very simple. you can either build a barracks or harvester to start off with. harvesters harvest the floor to make you money but also destroy the floor as they do it. and when a piece of land is destroyed enough it falls down into the clouds taking everything with it.in other words harvesters can be an effective weapon for destroying your foes land while making you money in the process.when you build  a barracks you can build walkers. walkers can claim 1 hex forward per turn and battle your opponents walkers.except the battles are  little more just basic math as the walkers simply cancel each other out. so who ever has more walkers will win.and once you claim a hex you can build on it also the more hexes you have the more money you get per turn.the 2 other things you can build are the air ship and the cannon. the air ship transports all the walkers on one hex across the map and are the only way of getting around late game as nearly everything is broken... most of the time.the cannon on the other hand is used to shoot a hex. when a hex is shot it moves down one level getting more broken. it is the same thing as what a harvester does and when a hex losses all of its levels it crumbles into the clouds. cannons also kill 5 walkers so your foes will have less men.so that's basically how the game goes you harvest stuff break the land while doing it then get cannons and air ships and either try and conquer your opponents land or break it.also the theme of the game is very nice with the greedy theme being taken very light heartedly and the way fighting works having no actual fighting or blood at all. if I gave this game a ERSB rating it would probably be PG for very mild violence.as for the real rating I give it a 8/10 and a 9/10 if its on sale for $3 or less. for it being a really good game to play with friends but maybe not so much with sore losers. it also has a great steampunk style awesome funky soundtrack and last of all great mechanics.

												This a small TBS worth due to it's simplicity and effectiveness in its mechanics. It is a Risk styled game, where you control a faction that must destrtoy all enemy factions in a hexagonal tile base map. In order to do thta, players must generate income, done so by placing Harvesters accross the field; the important bit here is that harvesters generate income by smashing the tile where it was placed, in addition to all adjacent tiles; every time a tile is smashed, it lowers it's height, reaching a point where the tile fractures and subsequently collapses - what this means is that, as income is generated, the battlefield gets eventually destroyed, and by the end game, its rather common that only a couple of tiles remain in the whole battlefield.The game is entirely deterministic - no dice is rolled at all. A duel is resoleved by the size of the attacking force, with the casualties determined by simple substraction (invading force unit count - defending force unit count). Addionally, all maps are perfectly symmetrical. This leaves the game's conflict to be entirely resolved by player's strategy and nothing else. This is easier said than done, however, as the tile destruction inflicted by harvesters (and player-deployed artillery) constantly change the battlefield, your strategy is in an ever constant need for change.The game lacks a bit of variety, so it can easily become a little repetitive - this is not Chess nor Go in regards to depth. An expande sequel would have been indeed welcome, but this never came to pass. I still recommend it heartily if you are a fan of TBS.			"

												I'm normally not into turn-based strategy games, since the gameplay is slow and there's not a lot of action involved, and this game is no different. If you do like these kind of games, you'll most likely enjoy this one as well. But don't get me wrong, it's not a bad game by any means. It has a certain charm, and the game is easy to play. The towers gameplay aspect is a pretty cool idea. But when it comes to turn-based strategy games I'd rather play Advance Wars. Man, that game just plain rocked ! But that's a story for another time...[Rating: 71/100]			"

												I bought this game during the 2014 holiday sale when I had a few bucks left over and nothing else on my wish list. I am very glad I got it now, as opposed to the other prospects I had lined up. This game plays like Risk, but has some really awesome new mechanics that make the game worth getting. The biggest mechanic is the game's titular use of greed to change the landscape: you can use harvesters to work the land and get money, but ever time you do, the land they stand on is slowly lowered until it collapses. This introduces some seriously awesome strategies in the game; one time I planted a harvester in the middle of an enemy island in order to collapse it and take out everyone on the island. I didn't have to use any of my troops or engage in a time-consuming siege- all I had to do was attack an unprotected square my opponent had left neglected, plant a harvester there, and laugh as the ground literally crumbled under their troops. This review is getting really long, but let me just tell you this before I finish: GET THIS GAME. It's definitely worth it, and the only things wrong with it aren't even part of the game itself, they're problems with the developer, whom has discontinued supporting the game and thusly Greed Corp's servers are dead. The campaign is about 10 hours of gameplay, and it's pretty nice. However, the true worth of this game comes from the multiplayer, which can still happen... we always find a way. My only regrets is that this game doesn't have any steam workshop support, and that the developer seems to have done a disappearing act.			"

Greed Corps just isn't very deep, and once you master the mechanics winning or losing will be more a matter of luck than one would expect from a turn based tactics game. 1 vs 1 matches against the AI are fun, more than that it's just let them fight among themselves and just finish them off. The worst aspect is that the online multiplayer doesn't work. In fact it haven't worked for years.			"

												This game is challenging.  As many other reviewers have noted, there isn't much in the way of multiplayer gameplay, which leaves the majority of the game to be played as Single Player.  The problem with single player strategy games is it can be difficult to determine what your opponent is going to do.  Sometimes your ""Skilled"" or ""Expert"" opponent is an imbecile, and other times they are Alexander the Great.The game is frustratingly difficult.  Part of that is in no small part because it revolves around four units, physics, and board game mechanics.  If this were a more popular game, or at least had steam integration so I could invite friends to play it, this would be a great time waster with friends.  However, as it stands, its an ultimately just a test of patience.			"

												Good game and I really enjoyed it, but it's also fairly flat in depth.  There really isn't a lot going on in it.  Each battle plays out pretty much the same as the last, with some variations due to differences in map design.  Still, I enjoyed the unique combat and how the terrain worked well enough to recommend it.  I think everyone should check it out, but after you get how to fight/win there really isn't anything else going on.			"

												A new take on an old formula. It's RISK gets greedy in this turn-based strategy game. The dice roll mechanics are simplified to a straight ""walker vs walker"" (the only unit) numbers game with the edge going to the attacker. But then add in buildings, the most iconic of which is the harvester. It adds resources each turn that you can use to build more buildings and walkers, but it also lowers the tile it's on -- until it crumbles and ""falls off"" the map, taking any of your units and buildings (or the enemy's) on that tile with it. Now start considering those as offensive weapons and the game just got way more interesting.			"

												Greed Corp gives a unique way of planning out a TBS. While you naturally want large forces, the production of forces comes directly from destroying the ground beneath your own feet. This turns an otherwise aesthetically pleasing but unoriginal game into a very compelling game, and also opens may types of attacks and force build ups. As an added bonus, it's (or sometimes is) a very cheap game to buy, giving hours of enjoyment in medium sized battles for pennies on the dollar.			"

												A round-based board game at heart, Greed Corp makes you fight your way through a 24-map single player campaign, destroying your enemies with your workers, cannons or by just removing the ground they are standing on. It's definitely following the 'easy to learn, hard to master' approach, with just a few possible moves working together to create a surprisingly sophisticated strategical challenge.The original idea is that your main source of income comes from harvesting the ground below you -- which then quickly breaks down, so you need to keep moving. Gaining money is closely tied into gameplay, as in that being greedy really limits your other options a lot.Clean graphics, day/night cycles, cleverly written mission briefings and debriefings, it all adds up to a astonishing level of polish for an indie game. The swingy and jazzy music isn't the obvious choice, but it's great and ends up being surprisingly fitting by giving it all a lighthearted feel.			"

												Great little strategy game with an excellent aesthetic.The gameplay is a fresh variation on classic turn-based strategy action; you need to harvest resources to pay for units, but harvesting will also damage (and eventually destroy) the very land you stand on. It's all about balance.Good scenarios and maps, a great visual style, and awesome retro ragtime soundtrack. It's just a shame the online play is so dead.			"

So its not about luck, not about different units and balancing, its solely about thinking and planning your next move before your opponent.Really really interesting and unique and definetly deserves to be bought by any strat lover out there... Unless you like luck based strategy games... then this game might prove to be too challenging for you.			"

												This is a nice, turnbased strategy game with a nice twist: You have to destroy the enviroment you play on to get funds, but you also destroy battlegrounds this way. Keeping the balance between harvesting and defense/attack ground is very challenging and fun to boot. There are also plenty of options for multiplayer with friends or against others online for leaderboard points. I highly recommend this!			"

												I have only played the tutorial, but if any of you have played Galcon Fusion (Indie Game) then you know what this game will be like. The basic premise is the same. You simply have to have the same amount or more of your ""walkers"" than the enemy to take over their land and destory enemy walkers. However, there are a number of ways to do this. This strategy game maintains a beautifully ""greater in numbers"" turn based tactics but adds diversity too with the addition of different units to utilize. There are long range stationary cannons, transports, walkers, and harvesters (that can both harm you help you and be used as a weapon). Overall, it is an intuitive strategy experience that is part puzzle, part turn based tactics. I definitely recommend this title.			"

												I first found this game on Android and it recently came up on a Humble bundle. I must admit I very much doubted that it'd scale well to PC, after all there are so many games that just don't scale to a PC well. Greed Corp isn't an exception to this. It's begging for a windowed mode. Let me explain.The strategy and gameplay is still pretty good it's a nice game to just sit and play. It's very area or control based, but doesn't tax your concentration too much. You could easily be playing this whilst watching something else on your computer. If you could window the game it'd be great to multi-task on the computer with. Sadly, I don't seem to be able to do that here.Personally, I'd recommend putting the game on your phone or tablet rather than PC. It's a decent little game and has a fair play time (at least two hours to complete the campaign), but isn't really a fully fledged PC game.			"

												Greed Corp is akin to checkers, easy to get into but very difficult to master. At first glance, this game may appear to be overly casual. There are two building types in the game, one mortar unit type, one attack unit type, and one transportation unit type. Play it a few times and you will come to realize that this game is anything but casual, frustrating even. To win at all, you will have to be very careful of where you place your mining units which can collapse the platform your other units are standing on. Play recklessly and you end up trapped with nothing left to do but pray for a miracle. I’ll conclude by saying this, if you can stand playing checkers for a dozen hours or more, this game is right up your alley.			"

												Hex grid turn based strategy game where you destroy terrain to gain resources. The single player campaign can be frustrating because there is no mid-mission saving. The AIs will always either: gang up on you and destroy the terrain under your bases or turtle in a corner for 20 turns and then snipe you from across the map. I haven't tried online but I'm sure they are even more prone to boring, exploitative tactics.If you enjoy strategy games this might be a nice change of pace. However there isn't much depth to it and has very little replay value apart from MP.			"

												Greed Corp is a rather simple turn-based strategy game. There are no random elements or hidden information, so in practice the game often plays a lot like a puzzle game.The core gameplay is fun enough. You use your walkers to capture territory and your harvesters to generate additional resources. You need to be careful with your harvesters, however, as completely strip mining a hex will make it disappear. You also have access to a few more advanced tools such as stationary cannons used for ranged attacks and carriers that can transport your walkers across the map.Unfortunately the game gets repetitive pretty quickly, at least in single-player mode. The core gameplay is rather simple and while there's some variation in the maps, most of the time you are executing very similar strategies. Even the expert AIs aren't that challenging, and can usually be defeated pretty easily. Furthermore, while the game has four different factions, they all play exactly the same.Greed Corp is not really bad game. However, at least in singleplayer it gets repetitive too quickly and lacks depth. Not recommended unless you have friends to play multiplayer with.The good:- Fun and simple gameplay- Interesting theme/setting- Good controlsThe bad:- Very repetitive- Boring map design- The story is rather forgettable- All four factions play exactly the same- AI is not very good			"

												Needs a level editor, once you play majority of the maps multiple times, it can get repetitive. Does not even need workshop support, just some level editor so those who own the game can create their own local maps to keep the game interesting. I've played through all the maps multiple times, and you can guess the AI's moves because they react to what the players build. This is a fantastic game, and the only thing missing is the editor, give this some life and a chance, please add an editor, thank you.			"

												This is essentially a computerized board game. Is it good? I don't really know.Here's the problem: there's no online strategy guides available, and nobody has really done any proper analysis of the game. This makes it hard to really get a handle on the strategy. Even if you do spend the time to figure it out yourself, the odds are pretty low that anyone else on your friends list will have done the same.So you're faced with a problem: If you play as a novice, you won't understand the strategy well enough and the outcome will seem almost arbitrary; and if you learn to play the game well, you'll have nobody to play against.

												A very different kind of strategy game, based on non-sustainable resource farming, height advantages and tactical demolition. The story is only there if you want it, presented in big ungainly paragraphs of text, like in Braid. However, the jazzy big band music adds a really nice 'booming 20s' feel to the industrialized madness!As mentioned in several other reviews on this game, there are times when the slightly unforgiving gameplay mechanics create a stalemate; where the first person to move will ultimately lose the match.

												Not only this is a great turn-based strategy game with a different and fun mechanic but it's also a nice analogy for humankind and what we're doing to our planet...Morality aside, the way you gather resources by slowly destroying the very map hexagons you need to stand on and/or build is genius! It opens up different ways of destroying your enemy while making you think carefully to see if you're not dooming yourself as well.			"

												This indie game is a superb light turn-based strategy game, where four different armies clash over hexagonal pillars standing above the clouds. All four sides are functionally the same, but with differing aesthetics. Balance is vital, however, as the money-making harvesters you build will eventually destroy the hexagons around them. As such, the need for money creates a conflict with the need to have an actual battlefield to war upon. This need for balance produces a very unique array of strategies to employ. The music and night-time ambience really adds to the feel of the game, as do the army designs. A light-hearted game that nonetheless provides a challenge thanks to its unique take on resource gathering one so often sees in strategy games.			"

												A very different kind of strategy game, based on non-sustainable resource farming, height advantages and tactical demolition. The story is only there if you want it, presented in big ungainly paragraphs of text, like in Braid. However, the jazzy big band music adds a really nice 'booming 20s' feel to the industrialized madness!As mentioned in several other reviews on this game, there are times when the slightly unforgiving gameplay mechanics create a stalemate; where the first person to move will ultimately lose the match. I have been observing some of the pro players of this game, who appear to have got the turn-based mechanics down to a math.But if you're a fan of cartoony little robot characters, gramophone jazz, or just sick of hearing about global warming and dwindling rainforests, this game is for you! 3/5 from me.

I always think im gonna do good, then i get super smashed and lose.. it's got a cool vibe to the game play, even tho i suck I still think its fun..Its a good game to play on a rainy evening when you run out of things to do.. the greed over takes yer mind and you really gotta plan yer attack.. games that take skill instead of luck always catch my eye more than stuff like magic cards, where it doesnt matter what you do, cuz its all random and super weak.. 7/10			"

												A very different kind of strategy game, based on non-sustainable resource farming, height advantages and tactical demolition. The story is only there if you want it, presented in big ungainly paragraphs of text, like in Braid. However, the jazzy big band music adds a really nice 'booming 20s' feel to the industrialized madness!As mentioned in several other reviews on this game, there are times when the slightly unforgiving gameplay mechanics create a stalemate; where the first person to move will ultimately lose the match. I have been observing some of the pro players of this game, who appear to have got the turn-based mechanics down to a math.But if you're a fan of cartoony little robot characters, gramophone jazz, or just sick of hearing about global warming and dwindling rainforests, this game is for you! 3/5 from me.

												An easy-to-pick-up strategy game that explores the balance between conquest and survival.  You're fighting for control of an island, but to raise the funds necessary to build your expensive army and maintain your costly defenses, you need to sacrifice your own territory.  There are only a handful of units and skirmishes are simplified to battles of numbers, but the constantly-shifting landscape and the emphasis on proper budgeting encourage deep long-term planning.

												A great little turn-based, board-game style strategy game. Very simple to learn but very absorbing and a lot of fun. Take turns moving around a hex-board, extracting resources (which slowly destroys the landscape) and buying units, artillery or air-lifts to beat your enemies. At the end of the round very little of the map will remain.The game really comes into it's own when playing with 3 other human players. Online play is integrated into Steam so use the 'Invite' option from your friends list.			"

												This indie game is a superb light turn-based strategy game, where four different armies clash over hexagonal pillars standing above the clouds. All four sides are functionally the same, but with differing aesthetics. Balance is vital, however, as the money-making harvesters you build will eventually destroy the hexagons around them. As such, the need for money creates a conflict with the need to have an actual battlefield to war upon. This need for balance produces a very unique array of strategies to employ. The music and night-time ambience really adds to the feel of the game, as do the army designs. A light-hearted game that nonetheless provides a challenge thanks to its unique take on resource gathering one so often sees in strategy games.			"

												a fun little game, especially great when you have friends to play against, the game really shines in multiplayer. it reminds me of a game of chess, a thinking mans game with many tense moments. the destruction feature definately puts a sense of urgency to the game, as it is a way to both earn money and destroy enemies. There are so many different elements and features to consider in a game of greed corp that you can never really cover all possibilities, and it is a game of deception and feigning attacks just as much as it is a game of tactical and economical prowess. the feeling of winning a game with a chain reaction of crumbing tiles is an amazing feeling, and you definately feel like you have achieved something when you win. It is almost inherent that these indie games dont last as long as their AAA counter parts, but i guarrentee that months or even YEARS after buying this game, you will have an urge to play a match or two, just to get that feeling back... speaking of which. :)			"

												Greed Corp is a turn-based strategy game, based on controlling territory then destroying it for fun and profit. The rules of the game are pretty simple, but the strategy remains deep. That alone makes this game worth considering for strategy fans. I really have no issues with how the game works mechanically. The story's uninteresting and unimportant. I usually ended up turning the music and sound off; they don't add much. The graphics look pretty good, with one complaint: it's very hard to tell which building does what from appearance alone, which is sometimes problematic.Fans of slower strategy games should look at picking this one up. There seems to be lots of support for online play, if you're in to that. The biggest issue I would worry about is that there aren't any extra play modes, and there's no difference in the factions, so you may not get much milage out of the game if you find the battles boring. $10 may be a little much, but it's worth getting if you find it cheap.

												Gotta admit... this is an interesting title. Whilst no doubt infuriating in single player, the 4 player potential is immense. Attempting to do battle on a field that you and your enemies are simultaneously destroying to get credits to build troops to war with is a groovy concept and it proves hard to plan long term, the balance of power shifting rapidly as well placed troops and harvesters fall foul of your enemies' next move. It's only a pity there's never been any DLC to expand upon this, more layers, some different troops. In fact, this is crying out for some form of modding community. Grab it while it's cheap folks and I'll take you on.			"

												This is a great turn-based strategy game which may look simple on the outside but actually contains a reasonable amount of depth. Central to this is the fact that the field you fight your opponents on is continually collapsing. You have to balance resource collection, which destroys the land you fight on, and production of units and buildings in order to  triumph.I'd liked to have seen more differentiation between each of the 3 races. As it is, they have the same mechanics; just different skins. Multiplayer is also fairly dead but that's to be expected of an indie game.If you can pick this up cheap (I got it for $2.50 during the Christmas Sale) I'd really recommend this.			"

												Greed Corp is very simple. That said, it is also very cheap. There are no unique units and the different ""races"" are really just different skins of the same things. You're not going to be incredibly drawn into Greed Corp's campaign, but playing with friends is where the game really shines. It is infuriating and unbelieveably fun backstabbing each other, and watching a well-timed cannon blast cause a chain reaction that knocks a majority of your buddy's land (and in turn, resources) out of the sky is ridiculously satisfying. Sure you aren't going to get a tremendous amount of hours out of it, but Greed Corp is great for a quick couple games to sit back and banter with your friends.			"

												This is a very clever, colorful, and fun strategy game.  Getting it for $3.00 is a total steal.  Get it while you can.			"

												This game may look adorable and cute, but it is full of sinister intent. It is competitive, entertaining, frustraiting, addicting, and aesthetically pleasing. It's fun. It was not given enough attention.			"

												This is a very well done and put together game. It is simple enough for anyone to get into, but challenging enough for even the most seasoned strategy gamers. To put it in short, its foundation is like that of the game of chess, but more creative in the fact that the king cannot hide on the back of the board least he risk plummeting to his death as the ground crumbles around him.

												A surprisingly complex simple little game where you build and conquer in a grid based world and wrecks it.Not much is left after you and the other warring companies are done.The Multiplayer player base is unfortunately rarely very much alive, bring a few friends with you and this is awesome.

												Some neat gameplay mechanics, but, honestly, it wasn't my kind of thing. The pacing is pretty slow and the tutorial is laboriously long (I spent more than half my time in the tutorial), resulting in a slow game with an overabundance of functionality all thrown at you at the same time.

												Easy to learn, difficult to master turn-based strategy. Within the first section of the campaign, you will know how to do every single action in the game, and when a game's controls and interface are this accessible, gameplay really does boil down to pure strategy, which is exactly how a great strategy game should be.

												Greed corp is a fun little RTS. Its a little unsophisticated (If you're crazy about Starcraft, I say stick to Starcraft) but for someone a little more casual like me who feels daunted by the depth of SC but still wants to play an RTS, this is it.The best part about the game is the slowly fragmented and shrinking land, which adds a cool level of movement strategy to it. I'd say its worth the full price.			"

												This is probably the best light war/board game on Steam. The idea is that as you capture parts of the board, you slowly remove them from the game over each turn and convert them into resources. The idea is to be the last player standing.You can accomplish this by either taking over their bases, or destroying the land they stand on. But be careful, because in destroying them, you also risk destroying your own ground as well.Games quickly become a scramble of resource management, and fighting against the clock.			"
