												Ok, my first review ever. The reason I bought this game was because I was going through one of those ""I have hundreds of games but nothing to play"" phases on my day off. It honestly took me by surprise, and I quickly got addicted.Farm for your Life seems to have been put together by ideas from other games. -You have the farming aspect which is similar to that of Harvest moon and runic frontier. The farming is the bread and butter of the game, as you can imagine by taking a look at the title.  You have some land, you clear it, plow it, barter for seeds, sow them, water them, and occassionally sprinkle some fertilizer to keep the plants from dying.-You have your restaurant, which is really the feature that caught me. You serve dishes made with your produce at the restaurant. Instead of getting paid in game currency or something, you barter with your clients and can actually choose what you want from their inventory (which is pretty awesome when you desperately need more of a specific supply). As you expand your farm, you can upgrade your restaurant to accommodate more people and expand the range of dishes you serve. Also, to learn any dish, you must first purchase it from the peddler, go to the oven, and play fruit ninja with the ingredients. The better you do, the faster you can cook that particular dish.-You then have zombies. When night falls, zombies pop out from paths at the edge of the map and walk ever slowly towards your farm and restaurant to destroy it. Like Plants vs Zombies, you will end up using your crops to kill them by throwing it at them. You can also use items you bartered for in your restaurant to create defensive turrets like a corn cannon to cover one side of the map while you fight in the other. This all seems like a lot to do, and it is, specially when your farm and restaurant are heavily upgraded. But you recieve NPC help in exchange for shelter and a daily meal. They pop up as you expand. The story overall was decent, but not much different than endless. It could use a few more tweeks. I would give the game a 9/10. With a little more indepth story and some more content, it would be perfect.			"

												(I bought this 7 months ago on their site before the Steam release, don't let my logged play time fool you!)During the day there is a sort of Tycoon-style farming game while you still maintain a restruant a la Cooking Mama and buy supplies to keep your restruant ahead of demand. To optimize recepies you can play a sort of Fruit Ninja-style minigame At night you go solo against zombies with nothing but veggie-powered defenses and your throwing arm to protect yourself.After you get enough employees you can start exploring the woods for some helpful items and additional building materials. You might even argue in favor of this game being compared to Animal Crossing or The Sims in some aspects, though those games are not as goal-oriented. When you've completed the campaign's tutorial, if you find the story boring or short you can switch to Endless Mode. Arguably the more enjoyable mode.The depth of this game will sneak up on you.			"

												I really wish I could recommend this game. It’s fun and all BUT ….It’s broken and it seems as if the development team has absolutely no intentions on fixing any of its issues.  For the first week or so it was out on steam the developer was active with the community, but once they made sales.. poof, best magic show disappearing act ever!   Check out the HUGE Bug Reports discussion in the games Community Hub, if you glance it over you can see the developer say he will look at them all ""over the weekend"" them come back and say he was too busy to look at them.    That was.. over 50 days ago as of this review… still no word on fixes.I don't think I will ever trust Hammer Labs with my money ever again, Its clear that they are only out to make a quick buck then move on to the next thing, there is no care to if the product actually functions or not.

												Good game for the price your paying. I feel like this is a combination of Alice Greenfingers and Plants Vs. Zombies. Not only do you get to farm, you protect your home by attacking zombies with vegetables and can provide the locals with a restaurant. The only bad I have found so far is the flying vegetables when creating food does not always register you've clicked them, and the tutorial doesn't realize you've completed it and will have an annoying green patch glowing for a while. Otherwise, a cute quick game to play.Edit: With more hours of the game going by, I can see why many people on Big Fish find it annoying. 1. You REALLY cannot go back 1 star for meals. 2. When in the woods trying to chop wood, you will never defeat the zombie so you will always lose 1/2 the supplies you have already gathered.			"

												Fun and cute game. Don't think it's worth 9.99 but if you get it on sale, go for it. It does get really tedious but shows lots of potential. Unfortunately I doubt the devs gonna constantly update this game. About a few hours in, you'll reach or feel like you've reached end game already.So if you're curious about this game but don't want to pay the price for it, get it on sale.Not recommending it due to the lack of content. So buyers beware.			"

												What is Farm for your Life?Overview:Farm for your Life is a nice mix of casual farming and casual restaurant simulation, without however a time limit on the restaurant part. People will pay you and stay until they are served, taking up spaces in the restaurant instead, so you can't get any more customers until they are gone.The game is controlled entirely with the mouse from an isometrical perspective. It clearly is inspired by games such as Harvest Moon or its clones without however reaching that depth. There are two relevant options at the start of a game - campaign or free play, zombies attack at night or not. If you choose the campaign mode you start with practically nothing, and can build up your farm relatively freely. The ultimate goal then is to survive the zombie apocalypse. If you choose to be attacked at night, you must waste your resources on defeating zombies or they plunder your farm.Gameplay:The game, as said above, is controlled with the mouse entirely. The controls are 95 percent fine, but if you have the shovel selected you can very easily destroy your plants by accident. You can select four tools, but with the exception of the shovel they are used automatically without being selected anyway. In your farm and restaurant level, you build up the farm while in the forest level you can collect wood and stone which are needed for buildings and stone as ammunition for the slingshot weapon. Every resource except coins can also be used for trading. Coins seem to be only a tutorial leftover without any real use.The farming is done by planting seeds, watering plants and fertilizing them every now and then. Talking to plants makes them grow faster, but the effect seems limited, probably to one growth boost per individual harvest. Seeds are very expensive but only expire if you don't take care of them. If they are watered and fertilized - water is for free while fertilizer costs a small amount of resources equal to one harvest or two for corns - before the meters drop to zero, the plants last forever, so you make a profit sooner than later.The restaurant must be built first with your wood and other resources, then guests will visit it to eat something. You can buy various recipes at the merchant for high prices, but they eventually amortise. The guy in front of it allows you to buy improvements and other useful tools. After a while - probably depending on how many recipes you have - several other people join you and automatically cook or farm. The help is very welcome since the AI works very fast. However, it once messed really up for me, resulting in plants being not watered, etc.You can have chickens and cows but they take a long time to produce eggs and milk and eat a lot, so you will need to grow wheat and grass for them. As far as I see, they won't die even with few food but won't produce resources then.At night you get attacked by zombies if you chose so in the settings. You should turn this off since it is just annoying. Zombies take several resources to be defeated and give no benefits. They destroy your fences pretty quickly as well, so later several weapon systems are a must, which - you guessed it - also eat a lot of resources. Slingshots take stone and seem pretty fine, but you need many then. Corn cannons are also fine, but eat a lot of corn. At first it is fun but if you need to defend against 5 or 6 zombies every night it becomes just annoying. Just turn it off before you start the game, unless you enjoy survival things.Logic error: The zombies in the forest attack you - you must avoid them to keep your resources. The zombies in the farm steal only your resources and maybe destroy your things (I didn't test that).Graphics:The graphics are the usual casual cuteness style. Positive is that you can customize how your character should look either at the start of the game or later by entering your house - which is the only purpose of your house.Sound:The sound is fine, it is nothing spectacular but also not disturbing.Achievements:Several achievements are bugged, as far as I read. This diminishes the value of an otherwise enjoyable game.Recommended:Since the developer seems to have given up the game in a state with a few bugs left, it is worth getting in a sale or - like now at IndieRoyale - in a bundle. The price of 8,99€ would be okay for the length, but not for the gameplay and support. I recommend waiting for a 70p off or more sale if you miss the bundle.			"

												The game's premise is fun, and it is fun at first. But then the issues start cropping up.First off it's very buggy. The NPC's pathing is terrible and they can get stuck indefinitely making them literally useless. Often they just stand there and pick up and put down items continuously. Gathering resources from the forest is just frustrating and not fun at all; there's just too many zombies and they seem to always know where you are but you can only see them when they're close. They move slowly, but a lot of times you'll lose everything you collected in unfair ways. The controls are a bit clunkly as well. The game doesn't explain things very well. It feels random when the NPCs come by and it takes too long for them to show up as if they were just trying to pad the game knowing the actual content is very minimal. Yet despite this, it uses up more resources on your computer than you would think for a game like this. It's not exactly a bad game, though. If the problems above did not exist, it would be significantly more enjoyable.			"

												Fantastic little game for what I paid for it.I completed the entire story mode in roughly 10 hours. I definitely feel like i can cut that time in half now that I know what to do and how to do it all in the game. Very little in the game is explained unfortunately, but it doesn't ruin too much of the experience as you can always google some of the answers. More than half of the achievements don't get unlocked for some reason, but who cares about that. There are some very minor detailing issues which could have been fixed but instead were overlooked, again, nothing worth complaining about though. Character customization feels a little bit weak and everything available in the customization minus hats and glasses, you see in the game on NPCs, but at least you have some customizing options which is nice. The game is much better played using the keyboard to move the map around cuz side scrolling gets irritating as the GUI prevents the scrolling. The some of the recipes training is annoyingly difficult to get 3 stars (fastest cook time) but at least once you get the stars, it's permanent unless you get even more stars, and 1 star is simple and easy to get... just take your time and get it done. The helpers do a pretty good job with the restaurant and farm, but there are still things they cannot do, like cut grass, milk the cows, make the deal with the customers, and they sometimes glitch in an annoying way where they pick up and drop something about a dozen times while they wait for more work, they also put the basket down in weird places making you have to search for them every time you want to use them. Since I muted the music cuz I tend to play for many hours at a time and music usually becomes repetitive and annoying (no idea if this one's any good though), the game ends up really lacking in sound effects... like when I throw the potion at zombies, no sound, you never hear birds and wild life in the background, etc... still not game breaking though. In this game, there is always too much to do and never enough time to do it which really keeps your mind sucked into the game trying to rush into everything and you can easily spend several hours into the game without even realizing it. The ending of the game was a little disappointing and too simplified as you basically cure the old man and he thanks you in a bubble text and the end credits appear. Also, the game froze after the end credits during loading (at 86%), probably bringing me back to game menu? Other than that, the game is very stable, plays fine on my gaming rig without having to hack the game apart in order to force it to work like some EA and Rockstar games out there...I definitely recommend this game to anyone who is into farming and time consuming games. Zombies are optional as you can disable them. Endless mode is also available if you prefer to play without an ending. I didn't play the game for the story and neither will you, but the gameplay by itself is definitely worth the money. I would suggest waiting for a sale though as I doubt those minor issues mentioned will ever be fixed and the way I see it, ""why hand a developer 100% of the money when he only delivered 90% of the game?""

												Farm for Your Life is a fantastic game if you are looking for a little bit of everything - the hybrid genres and gameplay make for a unique and charming take on classic elements that are already very popular on their own. This was a perfect game that I got in a bundle, especially considering that I had already recently played many fun tower-defense games (like Tower Wars) and great restaurant managemen games like Cook, Serve Delicious; and Dead Hungry Diner. This game mixes mechanics from those games very well.If you like farming (agriculture, AND also RPG/dungeon-style grinding), restaurant management, the zombie theme, tower defense, and bartering systems, then you will really love this game.The aesthetics are good, the cute character models and graphics remind me a lot of the Mii avatars you can make on the Wii (or your avatars in Xbox Live), with large heads and small bodies. The character customization is limited, but still has a decent variety. The music and sounds are good and match the semi-casual (the game can get brutally difficult if you let it) and (at times) relaxing gameplay.The controls are easy to learn and the tutorial quickly covers the basics of the game, however, balancing everything there is to do in the game can get overwhelming at times. The learning curve is moderate to difficult, depending on your experience with the different genres present in the game - and especially your ability to juggle different priorities. There is a ""peaceful"" farming-only mode (no enemy zombies), and if you are not interested in that extra hazard, I suggest you give that a try. Personally, I really believe there is already a lot to do in the game, but I picked the story mode and welcome the added challenge. The story is decent, but many things are left unsaid and you may end up having to consult a guide if you do not understand what to do.In regards to the actual gameplay, there is a lot of things to do, and each aspect of the game really appeals to me for different reasons. As a farmer, you can dig areas to plant with your shovel, harvest wood/rocks with your axe/hammer, and use your sickle to collect grass (that you plant), among other things. Be advised, you cannot use these tools to attack zombies. Your plants have two requirements for life: water and health. You are given a blue watering can that can nourish up to 4 plants before you need to refill it - 2 red watering cans are available at the store and can be used to water significantly more plants. For maintaining health, you can use fertilizer on applicable plants - I am fairly certain that doing this will restore a plant's health to full regardless of how low you let it get.When you harvest plants, you can only hold one item at a time, however, building a crate will allow you to carry up to 4 items.You also have a kitchen service, and customers will come starting from late morning/early afternoon until the evening (there is a clock that will show you the time splits). These customers will ask for different food/drinks from you, and you can accept/decline, as well as negotiate the terms of the trade. This is one of my most favorite parts, because I have recently gotten into Steam trading and really enjoy it. You can haggle pretty well, and you will also notice that your ability to lowball will increase as you progress through the game (because different plants have different values). You can even trade for plates and cups and use them at the store (extremely high value). Upgrades to your kitchen (and farm) are available here. Examples include more tables, tents (to attract and house helpers), and sprinklers (very useful).There is a store that provides different recipes and plant seeds - these will expand as you progress through the game. It is almost impossible (if not completely) to haggle with the shopkeeper. There is a good feedback system that will tell you ""x more required"" for each item you hover over when trying to achieve a balanced trade.Helps will become available as you progress, and you can assign them to either help with farming or in your kitchen. You must also feed them every early morning before they will work. To learn recipes, you must do a short mini-game that is a lot like Fruit Ninja - you use the mouse to ""slice"" the correct ingredients into a pot. You can achieve 1 to 3 stars, and having the max amount will allow you to cook much the item much faster. You can wander into the forest at any time for rocks and wood, however, zombies are roaming all over the place. If you are touched by one, you will lose all of your collected materials by half. I've noticed that there is a short window after being hit by a zombie where you will be ignored by all zombies. This part can be very annoying, especially if you get trapped by a horde.At night, zombies will sometimes try to attack your farm. During this part, you can try to herd them by arranging your fences like a maze. There are also turrets you can purchase from the kitchen, each doing significantly more damage than the last. At first, you will most likely be defending your farm by throwing any food items at the zombies.Admittedly, the AI is not the best, as your helpers will most times prioritize picking up ripe plants versus watering ones that are about to die. I've also noticed that your character will sometimes pick up a plant instead of watering it (happens infrequently). The game is appropriately challenging and really tests your planning and priotizing skills - do I attend to my farm or my customers first? Expanding takes a lot of work and effot, as it is very easy to become overwhelmed. I once spent an entire day just working on my farm and ignored all customers. You also unlock chickens and cows later on, adding even more variety to the gameplay.Overall, if you like any of the themes mentioned in the beginning, you should definitely give this game a try. There is even an endless mode that allows you to really unleash your inner farmer. The game may be slow in the beginning, but it quickly picks up in a short amount of time.Highly recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												It's a pretty fun game but still rather buggy.  The zombies sometimes walk right through the fence even though there's no opening. People sometimes get stuck at the tables even after they've been served and never leave. Taking up a spot. And the part where you learn the recipes.  The food zips over a pot and you have to chop it and have it land in the pot.  It rarely does and it flies by really fast.  I love fruit ninja and I can hardly complete most of the recipes to get the food into the pot.Also you can assign workers to work in the kitchen.  They get stuck running in place.  At one point all three of them wandered off to the corner of the map and were stuck running in place against the river.  I couldn't figure out how to get them to stop.  Conceptually it's really fun, if it didn't have all the dang bugs I'd recommend it. Hopefully they'll fix them.  "

												This game is a well balanced combination of farming, Diner Dash, Zombies, and Tower defense. Plus a ridiculous element of Fruit ninja (but using a mouse for that is @$^#*$^#&)General:- Learn to maintain your farm with many different crops - Use your crops to cook dishes for people- Trade your cooked meals for vital materials to be used in crafting- craft tools to help the farm; use materials to expand the restaurant; use materials to trade for new seeds or other things; and create tower-defense type weapons to deflect the zombies- Day/ night cycles, where you can hire helpers during the day, and defend against zombies at night.- The zombies will take your produce, so use those weapons to deflect themGood stuff:-Awesome 3D cartoon style that operates smoothly.- Insanely fast loading when resuming the game (game takes a little while to load on first play)- Save mechanic is fantastic: easy and quick to use, and also has auto save.- always something to do. If there's some time to kill, then kill time by fast forwarding.Bad stuff:<<ERROR. NOT FOUND>>  "

												It's surprising to me how entertaining and relaxing this game is. At first glance it looks like nothing special but i quickly realized the amount of care that was put into this game. Althought very short, the game has lots of replay value, like most games with farming as a theme.And would you believe it? The game keeps getting and update every now and again. (as in, every couple months or years) Which may sound infrequent, but considering the dev team is 2 people that develop the game in their spare time, the game is finished (no early access bull****) and the amount of bugs is very small anyways.Graphically, the game looks cartoony and childish, despite being the zombie theme there are no elements of horror or gore in it, that is not to say that the game can't give you a bit of a startle when scavanging in the forest. Those familiar with Harvest Moon will feel confortable with graphics in here.The music while it's good and relaxing there are only a couple tracks which will wear off quickly. And, this is personal opinion, but the music gives me the vibe of christian music, idk, it sounds to me like something i would expect to hear on a church.All in all, for 5 bucks you won't get it better than this... I got 33+ hours of relaxing gameplay with it's goofy moments every now and then.			"

												A bizarre mash-up of farming game, dinner dash, fruit ninja with zombies and elements of tower defense.  Odd combination  but thoroughly enjoyable.  The story mode is 7-9h of entertainment and I expect to get more out of it in endless play.  Not a high stakes game as at the end of the day the zombies are pretty harmless but sometime it is nice to have something relaxing to play.  Kudos to the developers it looks like they put a lot of love into this game.			"

												You get what you pay for.It's a cute game with hours of gameplay on endless mode, or a few hours in story mode.It's a game where you can farm casually, or choose to fight zombies.You don't have to do both.You can hire people to work for you in the farm or the resturant, you can buy animals and ranch for the food market. Upgrading with materials is also a large part of the story mode and game.It's a cute game and worth a shot.It would not be on the same level of Recettear or any shop simulation game though.My only regret is that it's not too long of a game, but it's got an endless mode so it's all right.I'd rate it 7/10 probably.

												Its a very good game! Not great due to some bugs that make it fail to load so make sure you save before you talk to a quest NPC or before you go into the woods or your home. It autosaves when you learn to cook so no problem there. There was only one spelling mistake through the whole game but it obviously did not ruin the experiance. Now for the good. Great, cute graphics and its soooooo addictive! I was on my laptop for however long i said i logged and never left it except to work and sleep which was only once cos I completed it in a day! The whole just one more game day...just one more upgrade kept me going and it was great. The farming can be a tiny bit fiddly but it still rocks and the whole beating zombies with veg is kinda great. Building catapults and seeing them defend your farm is a great feeling. The resteraunt is really good and very frantic so always have a helper when you get more than one, The AI helpers are great two except when you have to feed them, its repetitive and time consuming why cant they just come over to you? Other than that I give it an 8/10 and a high reccomendation.			"

												A surprisingly enjoyable casual game blending influences from titles such as Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing various tablet and social media games to produce a fun resource management game. The three key aspects of the game are upkeep of the farm, management of a makeshift diner and repelling zombie attacks. This encompasses watering, fertilizing, harvesting food, chopping wood, pounding rocks, management of livestock, fulfilling food requests and general progression through upgrading your farm using resources gained mostly through serving customers at the diner and harvested crops. An example of the upgrades is the recipe system, these are purchased from the town merchant and are then learned via a fruit ninja style mini game. Various upgrades such as seating capacity, food storage, tents which allow the recruitment of helpers and even a bridge to access your stranded cow all require the use of resources to unlock. All but the most basic seeds also need to be purchased before you can set about farming them.An enjoyable game with content and longevity being the only obvious stumbling blocks.			"

												Very much a casual game but very addictive as well, I got this game very cheap during a sale and thought 'yeah, I'll only end up playing this for an hour or so'... 4 hours later I resurfaced.It's a combination of harvest moon, diner dash and fruit ninja with zombies thrown in. I would classify this game as non violent because when the zombies ""attack"" you, you just get into a slapfight and are left dizzy at the end (and depending on whether you are in the forest or not as to whether your gathered resources halve). On the farm zombies, go for your crops, not the people and are capable of destrying a farm pretty quickly if you don't fend them off. On the whole they're more annoying than they are threatening, I turned them off after a few nights because I was getting bored of throwing my vegetables at them or building resource chewing defences to throw at them. The meat of the game is in the restaraunt part of the game, you barter meals and goods for parts and seeds and feed the people, once a deal is made, they won't leave until they are fed, so you won't have to worry about them getting mad or anything.TLDR: Addictive, very shallow, pick it up cheap in a sale.

I've been looking for something similar/better than Farmville as I detest playing games on facebook.  Especially with the money sink that can occur with them due to power ups and limitations.Farm for your Life was a fun alternative and with added features (like Zombies!) I found myself to have a lot of fun playing it!If you like growing things, farming, or gardening in games I would definitely recommend this game for you!			"

												I got this game when it was on sale for a few bucks and did not expect much. However, the game manages to combine two things i like to do the most in survival games (Minecraft, 7D2D, ...), namely: Harvest resources and take care of other survivors by providing food and shelter. The trade aspect in this game was rather surprising and the cooking minigame is fun the few times it appears. If you want a perfect playthrough you can expect about 10 hours total; A fast playthrough can easily be done in under 5 hours. Overall i was surprised that when i started this game for the first time and after a while checked the clock, several hours had passed - so i can only recommend this if you get it for under 5$ and want to hit zombies with corn cobs while feeding people in your restaurant and getting the next upgrade for your farm from that greedy merchant whilst running around to make sure your plants don't dry up. Also, your farm hands expect bed & (warm) breakfast. For the casual look it surprisingly feels like there is much to do all the time :) I hope there comes a way bigger and more complex sequel with a longer/better story and more in-depth gameplay - I'd buy it!

												A fairly weak attempt to mash up quite a few different genres. It's a little bit Fruit Ninja, a little bit restaurant manager, and a little bit of a farmer, with some random and totally unnecessary zombies thrown in to annoy you at night and while you're gathering wood and stone in the forest.I got sucked into the routine of it all for a couple of hours, and then realized that I had basically plumbed the depths of the game already by that point, and from then on it would be nothing but repeating the same thing over and over.If that sounds like something you'd be into, go for it.

												I just picked this game up when it went on sale and I think it's definitely worth the amount I paid for it. It reminds me a little of Harvest Moon with the idea of a time-management farming game. Once you start to get produce you can sell it at your restaurant. NPCs pay you crafting materials that you will need to craft things like a sprinkler, food storage and creation items used at the restaurant. Zombies come at night and can be fended off by throwing produce at them.I created a series of videos of me playing the game for the first time. Check them out below:First Video

												OK, so besides the crashing and the broken achievemnts and the failing to load after the game has been beaten... yeah if you don't take all of that into account then the game is pretty fun! It's a really simple farm that you can build anything you want, anywhere you want it. Do what you like each day and build your farm up just the way you like! Fun little minigames make the game more enjoyable and the colorful graphics are also a big plus. It's got it's shortcomings though, it's super short, and has quite a few bugs. I would wait until the developers actually complete the game before buying it, otherwise you will be frustrated as i was while playing it. Hope this helps!			"

												I bought this game on sale and it was.. sort of alright for the first 20 minutes. After that it's just a boring mess though.TL;DR:+ Character customisation is very basic and quite limited but there's a couple of interesting options to make.+ The art style for the game is interesting and it's quite well done. It doesn't interest me personally, though.+ Nice concept for a game.+ Fruit ninja style minigame is fairly fun because of the physics but it's also quite pointless.- Has quite a lot of game breaking glitches.- Expensive at full price (or anything less than a heavy discount) for the amount of content that's here.- Very repetitive and slow gameplay which has you standing around a lot doing nothing for a lot of the time. - The trading system in the game is unbalanced. Items such as seeds that you need at the start are so expensive that it takes around half an hour just to buy one seed.- The english in the game is atrocious. It's obviously not the developers' first language so it's acceptable, but hardly one sentence in the game is spelt or worded correctly.-  The single music track in the game isn't anything special and is quite repetitive.The first time I played the game, the first 20 minutes went alright, i'd finished the tutorial and I got onto the main game. Then I exited the game and came back to it, and my save file had somehow become corrupted and the game had saved me at the last section of the tutorial but some of the main characters were invisible so I couldn't actually progress.After I started the game a second time, I got onto the actual main part of the game and honestly, it's just boring.There's 3 ""sections"" to the game; Collect ingredients (apparently mostly by farming), restraunt simulator where you serve customers, and then a fruit ninja minigame. The fruit ninja game from what I could tell was alright but completely pointless and too difficult because the recipes required you to chop so many ingredients in 10 seconds which didn't even appear on time for you to chop them up, nevermind to add them into the bowl as well. You get a star rating but if you had anything more than 10 seconds (which was impossible to get anyway), you only got 1 star for the dish, and it seemed to have no impact on the dish.Unless i'm missing something, the game is ridiculously slow. There's not really any sense of direction in the game after you start serving customers in the restraunt, You ""trade"" with customers and they give you an order of what they want to eat, and then sit at the tables eternally. I had a customer sitting at the restraunt taking up space for 3 days because I had to wait for the ingredients to grow for what she wanted to eat.The controls are awkward. I don't think there's a way to actually drop items from your basket without actually using them up or adding them into your chest.  Double clicking seemed to be involved a lot and it didn't seem to always work.""combat"" is horrible. I'm not sure why it was included because it doesn't actually fit in with the game and the zombies don't even really pose as a threat. It's just annoying to have to find something to throw at the zombies when they appear, and for the first hour of the game it seemed to be only one zombie a night that would appear. There's a trading system in place which allows you to barter for items. But the items that you have to actually buy are so costly that I found myself giving away pretty much all of what I had just to be able to aquire a single seed.Also, the customers at the restraunt will ask you to cook them things that you haven't even unlocked yet, and if you accept you'll have to have them wait until you've actually unlocked it, and then wait even longer so that you actually have the ingredients to cook it.There looked to be some sort of exploration aspect to the game but I haven't gotten that far because the game hasn't actually asked me to explore for any reason yet.

												First, let me say that I don't recommend this game NOT because it is a bad game;  it's just that there isn't much to it. It's a bit too easy (it took me very little time to beat it - less than 10 hrs).Not bad for a short-term time waster, and it's even kind of cute, but honestly I'd recommend playing something else as the playability is short-lived and the replay value just really doesn't exist.It's kind of like Farmville meets Diner Dash; plant a crop once, harvest that square repeatedly over time to get the ingredients for your restaurant, occasionally fertilize, don't forget to buy sprinklers.  You throw crops at the zombies to make them disappear, occasionally you venture into the ""forest"" to get some needed tool, and the money you make from your restaurant gets used to buy more ""farming"" items (seeds, cows, chickens, etc).  That's pretty much all there is to it, in a nutshell.			"

												""Farm For Your Life"" This is a really fun easy addictive game. It is similar to other farming games such as Harvest Moon and Farmville although fairly more simple farming mechanics. Also this game has a twist to its play style that includes towers to defend your farm from hordes of zombies. This game can be played in a more relaxed form focused on the farming aspect or you can play it the normal way and fight for your farm which provides more playtime and more challenge. The game is featured in a top down veiw with fairly decent graphics, well rounded and well done. The game sounds are fairly basic, music is decent but plays in loop. Gameplay is slow to start, very hard to get your farm going but once things get going it can be hard to keep up with, but makes for a fun exciting challenge. I actually enjoyed this game more then i thought i would. I wouldn't suggest this for players who can't stand repetitive gameplay. But for all who can stand repetitive gameplay and love farming games its well worth the time.			"

												It is a fun game that get a bit repetitive but the game is short. A mix of a basic farm sim, restaurant sim and tower defense with a Fruit Ninja minigame and a simple zombie storyline. What you get in about 30 minutes of gameplay is pretty much all there is. You unlock a new crop and recipe around each 30 minutes until you finish the Story Mode in about 6 or 8 hours if you don't waste time. Then there is endless mode and a few pretty vague achievements left for about a 10 hours game so the game's price seems about right and it's a good purchase on sale.An interesting addition but also a flaw to the farm life are the helpers that you need to feed each morning and they will help you on your farm or restaurant. They are very helpful and even a little too much because you will be left with almost nothing to do as soon as you have 2. In story mode you can have 3 and an overkill 4 in endless mode while 1 alone is enough for the restaurant and it require a lot of crops for more than 1 not being enough on the farm. They also won't cut grass or milk cows and the only other thing left for you to do is to barter with the visitors to allow them to enter the restaurant and get their meal.You can and have to enter the forest to get wood and stone a few times for some upgrades but you can't attack those annoying zombies and they will make you drop your resources. Since helpers won't gather those and the few on the farm won't respawn, you are forced to navigate around those zombies and return multiple times. I'm not sure if it's totally a good or bad thing but time stop in the forest so you can't go there while your helpers work to spend some time while they do everything else.The tower defense minigame is actually optional (When starting a new game.) and it's a good thing because it's not that good and actually make you waste some of those crops in the beginning by throwing them at the zombies by hand or with towers. Zombies will steal your crops and break your fences to get there and will give you nothing in return. So they steal your stuff, towers cost some precious resources that could be spent on sprinkler instead and make you waste your hard earned vegetables. It is required for at least an achievement otherwise I would suggest always playing without them.Overall it is a good game with not that many flaws but there are also better games for all types this game try to include.

												A fun little casual game.The zombies aren't too scary, the animals and toons are cute, the gameplay is easy to learn.The storyline provides what is being advertised. 5-6 hours of story-related gameplay. After that, one can always continue in ""freeplay"" mode.Replay value seems limited, as is the content. No procedurally generated world, which makes replays seem all alike.A few bugs here an there, nothing major though:Customers sitting on each others' laps, dishes occasionally getting stuck and being hard to remove. Not a big deal, most of these are self-clearing when the restaurant runs out of customers during nights. Saving and re-loading the game cleared all these issues too.Mob pathfinding sometimes ignoring fences. Re-building fences ""in one go"" solved that for me though. Might also be related to mobs being ""locked out"" and thus destroying fences because they find no other way.Issues I've seen in other people's reviews that I have not encountered:Performance issues: None for me, and I'm on an outdated Windows7 platform. Not exactly a super gaming PC, and the game runs just fine - even in later ""freeplay"" stages.Crash issues: None for me. Have played the game for about 20 hours now, and not a single crash.Bottom line:Fun game.Bought it on sale for 4€, and would do that again.			"

The farming life may seem simple and relaxing at first but nobody ever mentions the zombie attacks.  Then there are sudden devastating storms that not only destroy everything but also traps the only cow in town across a mild stream making it impossible to reach.As a click heavy casual farming game players slowly work their land back into it's former glory while every other town folk sits around without lifting a finger to help.  While waiting for plants to grow players are also tasked with running a restaurant for strangers that pay in vital scrap metal for upgrades or exploring the zombie filled wilderness.			"

												Farm for your Life feels like a combination of several different facebook games.I was able to get a few hours out of it, but once cleared, I felt like I wasted the day and don't plan to pick it up again. There are other games on steam that do a better job than Farm for your Life.The farming aspect seems too basic with only a hand full of crops; the fighting/defence system doesn't pose any challenge after the first night (or two); and the cooking is a fruit ninja minigame, but each time the fruit(vegetables) come out in the same order, so it's more of a memory game. The only thing they did ok(ish) in is the crafting recipe’s prerequisites, requiring you to craft the basics before more complex items are unlocked.Length wise, it took me 10 hours to complete the game at a slow pace (with lots of AFK) so most people can complete this in 3-5 hours, considering the price, this game is not worth it.In my opinion, this game seems to target children and wouldn’t find any place in most people’s library. If reading other reviews has convinced you otherwise, remember, there are better farming (with fighting) games out there.(It’s my first time reviewing, so give me a break if this is done poorly, and as everyone says, this is only my opinion and may not match your opinion, look at gameplays and other reviews and consult your specialist to see if this is right for you.)

												Farm for your life should be commended for combining genres and mixing together lots of different play mechanics. It definitely stands out from among the dozens (hundreds? thousands?) of zombie games on Steam. After you play through this game for an hour or so, though, it's hard to miss the conclusion that there just isn't anything original about it except for the combination of thoroughly derivative game play mechanics. What's worse, none of the core mechanics are particularly well executed. The tower defense aspect is clunky albeit serviceable, but the lack of combat is a bit odd when your character is literally holding a hammer and an axe. Similarly, the restaurant management aspect of the game works, but lacks anything particularly interesting to make it addictive in the vein of Diner Dash or Miss Management. The recipe creation minigame is a poor match to mouse play and is highly derivative of Fruit Ninja... probably would have been smarter to copy Chocolatier's factory efficiency minigame instead. A derivative game can be fun if they nail the gameplay, just as a creative game can really carry subpar game design... this game lands in the middle of both, putting it in a no man's land that's not really worth visiting.

You are farming, retreiving items, solving little puzzles, and fighting zombies.I felt like I was being led by a carrot tied to a string.  I was always chasing the carrot, but could never reach it.

												It's got a lot of bugs. Someone forgot to add the second ""s"" in grass for the seeds. Slicing games just are not fun on the PC. I enjoyed it for a little while but I can't justify spending more than a couple dollars for this game.			"

												It's not _just_ a farm or restaurant sim, it's both and much more. There seems to be plenty of content, good handling and some small entry fighting involved. Having to manually feed your helper every day is a bit annoying though but at least he really helps out.Subjective: ★★★★★Objective: ★★★★★ — Graphics: ★★★ — Content: ★★★ — Handling: ★★★http://played.today/farm_your_life.html

			The game I played today is called Farm Your Life. It's a combination of a farming sim (*shock*), restaurant sim, and an RPG.

												I really like this game so far. The farming is fun and when you get helpers you can either assing them to the resturant to feed survivers or have them work on the farm while you can go collet wood and stone. I have really come to enjoy this game I played it for 9 hours straight not even realizing it.			"

												Farm for your Life is a simple point and click farming/restaurant simulator. It's a mix of Cook, Serve, Delicious! and Harvest Moon. It's polished, but also very simplistic so that anybody can play. It's oddly addicting, although it's also very repetitive. If you're a fan of simple mind numbing repetition than this is a game for you. If you're a fan of simulation, this might also be for you.FEATURES Story Mode is very short, but there is also an Endless Mode that will allow to you play until the end of eternity.  Characters are customizable whenever you want, however you want at any time. You can go in between genders and there are countless possibilities. The main objectives are to grow crops, raise animals, build a successful restaurant, cook and serve food, gather materials and help a mad scientist cure the 'zombie' problem. Oh, did I mention that there are zombies? You also have to build an array of weapons and defense mechanisms (like fences) to keep the zombies off of your land!POSITIVESEasy to play for anybody regardless of how experienced a gamer they are. Easy to follow tutorial that explains anything you'll need to know, and you only have to use the mouse! Very easy to get into and very easy to come back to at any time. Relatively speaking, the game itself also has a very easy difficulty level. The achievements are also pretty easy to obtain. Hours of mind numbing fun. Seriously. Although repetitive, there is enough to do that you don't feel as if you're always doing the same thing, even though there's only a few things that actually need doing. No DLC or add ons of any kind. What you pay for is what you get. The game also has no bugs that I've come across and runs very smoothly.NEGATIVES The game has a 'peaceful' mode, but it doesn't actually exist. Zombies will raid your game at night even if you've selected the 'peaceful' game mode. There doesn't seem to be a fix for this in story or endless mode yet.  Many of the achievements are bugged, despite a recent patch from the developers. At this point, it seems as if it's going to be forever bugged... so that's really a bummer.  The developers seem to be largely finished with the game, so any bugs, compatibility issues, etc that come up may not be fixed. The recent patch that they did, despite their best efforts, didn't seem to change anything at all. I have yet to find much wrong with the game besides the bugged achievements, but other players may be experiencing issues with little to no technical support.  Repetition. I put this in the positives as well, but it's a double edged sword. Eventually you're going to get bored, or you'll have done absolutely everything that your farm will be so damn self sufficient that you'll hardly need to play. Also, for those who don't like repetition, this will obviously be a huge minus because that's most of the game's mechanics. I definitely recommend giving this a try. I would give it a solid 8/10. I've played it over and over again for hours and have enjoyed coming back to it every time.			"

												01/11/2014Reviewed with a press copy of the gameA really good game to play if you like farming type games with a small bit of tower defence (although you do have the option to remove attacks at night if you just want to farm).The story is very basic but introduces you to how to play very well and gives you a reason to farm, there is also the 'Endless Mode' which obviously goes on forever and doesn't have a story of any kind, just farm. When the game properly begins you will have to plant crops and chop wood and mine stone so you can build and make various things from recipes to catapults to heed off zombies.In conclusion the game is very basic but even if it is also a little buggy is a very enjoyable experience and I throughly enjoyed my 2 hours of playing so far so I give it an 8/10 for being fun, interesting and sort of unique.YouTube Video:

The mouse controls everything and it runs really smoothly on my PC. there are a few minor glitches left in the game at this point, but hardly gamebreaking. This is actually one of my favorite games of 2014 thus far and hope there is a sequel!!!Got this last night and started playing, next time I looked at the clock it was 7 am and the sun was coming up!

												tl;dr - Decent game, but at $1/hr I can't recommend it. Nothing particularly wrong with it, but nothing truly worth remarking upon. It's a decent little game, if a bit short. I think I did a pretty good job of covering all the side-quests and everything you can possibly do in 10 hours. Bits of it are incredibly unclear, like what causes someone to move into a tent, but for the most part it is very straight forward and easy to understand. As described, it's an odd mix of diner dash, farming, and tower defense, but I couldn't help but find myself wishing for more of the character of Don't Starve or deeper mechanics from any of the builder games. At 10 hour max, I think it makes sense at $4, but I generally don't spend $1/hr on most games. A little bit of fleshing out the content, the characters, or the story would go a long way to changing my review, but I doubt that it will ever truly be remarkable.			"

Maybe designed for touch screen? I can't even two star the first recipe. Not even close. The food just flies everywhere and off screen and never gets to the pot it needs to land in, that is when the game even reconizes that my curser actually cut the food in the first place. Not fun.

												Short version: The zombies aren't zombies; the gameplay's a joke; the graphics are horrendous and look like a product from ten years ago; the story is sickeningly unoriginal; the entire game is a cross between three much better implemented casual games which are much cheaper at the same time and the characters are about as interesting as cardboard. Don't waste your money.Long version: This review is based entirely on some of the key features which are listed, so get ready for a rant.""Combining elements from farming, tower defense and time management genres"" - now I agree with 2 out of 3 of these points. Because this game is literally Farmville, Plants vs Zombies and Fruit Ninja smashed into one - and considering the price for this really unoriginal idea, it's much much cheaper to find and play all of these separately. So really, this game isn't claiming anything new - especially when it wears the zombie apocalypse t-shirt.Now this really could be forgiven if it redeemed itself through the story or the characters or the graphics. On all three of these points it fails miserably; the story and characters are non-existent, each person that gets hired or visits the restraunt you own is literally a robot that has decent AI but has nothing compelling about their characters despite looking different from the rest. The models are unique enough to give some sort of personality, but when absolutely none is given, it completely destroys what little story there is. It is literally a point A to point B step by step proceedure and despite clocking in a fair amount of hours I don't feel like I'm progressing or enjoying any moments that I wanted to or expected to.""Protect your farm by building mazes and towers. Our zombies are vicious vegetarians!"" ... So? This is a very particular problem that desperately needs addressing because there are no stakes. All that happens when zombies 'invade' your farm at night is that they eat your produce. Obviously you don't really want this as the food is literally the only way you can progress, but you need to attack them with your produce anyway, and additionally - these are zombies! Zombies eat brains not food like us, that's the one fundemental thing that zombies do - eat people! Vegetarian zombies aren't zombies, they're just rude vegans! And it would be slightly more interesting and tense if they went to your AI partners; it would be slightly more interesting and tense if they went for your customers waiting for food that you didn't have the produce for - but they just ignore them! They just go straight for the produce! So what? I can just grow more, why do I need to waste food to protect the food that I'm wasting! That makes no sense!""Original soundtrack"" Yep. You can count that as a key feature of this unoriginal, boring mess of a game. It has it's own original sountrack. Oh yes, and when they say that - they mean one song that plays during the day over and over again until your ears start bleeding. One song isn't a ""soundtrack"" guys! And the effects are about as generic as you can get as well.So no, I can't reccomend this. I wouldn't reccomend this game to a brick wall. I'd prefer actual zombies to gnaw on their balloon heads until they explode, which would be a million times more interesting. Hell - I'd prefer staring at the brick wall that I'd reccomend this for, at least it'd give me time to rethink how on Earth I managed to think that this would be a good game to buy with my hard earned money. Why people are giving it good ratings and are calling it one of the best games ever completely baffles me - it's unoriginal and isn't a game that belongs in 2014. I'd expect this POS to be around ten years ago, but nowadays?! No way!			"

It's a kindoff stressfull relaxed stress-release game.I still havn't figured out what can happen if the zombies that ""invade"" at night get to someplace, wherever they're going. So far nothing have happened, except that one time in storymode.The fruit ninja part is cute and fun... but can be really anoying since... sometimes a hit seems to miss, and such. "

YouTube™ Video: Farm For Your Life first impressions review 

			Views: 495		

			This is my first impressions review of Farm For Your Life by Hammer Labs and Published by Headup Games. It has recently been released on Steam. Enjoy. Please like comment and subscribe.		

You manage your farm, a restaurant and occasionally fight off Zombies by tossing your produce at them.The characters’ bobble heads are so big clip they into each other. But it looks fine for a four dollar game (I got it on special). You build and upgrade your farm and restaurant using resources gained from your farm, found through foraging, trading and in exchange for serving customers at your restaurant. You can explore the forest outside the central area but I didn’t venture out there much in the time that I played.Juggling farm and restaurant management can be challenging. But after an hour or two in I’ve only been approached by two Zombies. The main problem is I encountered a bug. That made it so that I only had one usable plate in my restaurant. I couldn’t prepare the next customer’s order until the last customer had finished their meal and the plate was washed. So I couldn’t keep up with demand and customers were leaving.I like it. I’d have to be pretty stubborn to keep playing if the plate bug is persisted. I’d say it’s worth the price if they at least fox that bug.Click here for more let’s play videos =)			"

												It seemed interesting enough, and I am a huge sucker for indie games. I was enticed by the idea of micromanaging plant growth with tower defense and a silly art style. As it is, I could only squeeze out about 30 min, and I had had enough.Bugs, bugs, bugs GALORE! I failed the turtorial missions about 5-6 times due to the game breaking under bugs. The main character freezing, the controls freezing, UI bugs (pop ups that never went away, also freezing or pop ups that never show up; leaving you to guess what you do next), people that get stuck, people that run through walls and typos....omg the typos. I think the writers/editors should go back to 3rd grade where we learn this thing called ""proof-reading"". Jackfilms's ""YGS"" series on youtube would evicerate this game. No kidding: there was typo in almost EVERY SINGLE TEXT BOX. I don't care if:-English wasn't your first language-Budget-Time constraintsIf 50% of the dialogue in this game isn't grammatcially correct, that's not acceptable in a full release! Fix the bugs! Fix the typos! FIX ANYTHING!!The idea is you use various tools and abilities to grow plants and use them as weapons. I didn't get far enough to see how it actually works because the developer(s) p***ed off the ice goddess Shiva who froze everything and cursed the land to be invested with bugs while screwing up the language to create the grand Promised Land for Grammar Nazis. There is no denying it. There is no excuse, explanation, theory or otherwise: the game is a massive cash grab. Unplayable, untolerable. One word review: broken. 0/10I should have taken the $9.99 and threw it to my dogs. Money better spent.			"

												I bought Farm for your Life in the sales as it was 50% off and looked like a fun distraction for over summer break, and I was definitely right. I completed story mode in only a few hours seeing as it's very short, however Endless mode contains the same features and is just as engaging. My only issue with it is the amount of bugs I've came across- plates, cups and people bugging out and staying at a table or clipping over each other, zombies clipping through fences designed to keep them out, getting tasks mixed up and freezing, difficulty loading scenes etc. These bugs weren't gamebreaking mostly (the loading problems were incredibly annoying as it froze when loading just after I'd completed the game but luckily I had saved not long before), and they didn't really impede my enjoyment of the game. Other than that, I had a lot of fun playing Farm for your Life- if you're looking for a fun, stress-relieving casual game that doesn't require too much time investment, then this is the game for you.

												Really fun game, and totally worth the 5$ in the sale, idk if it's actually worth the 10$ it is though.  I beat it in two days just playing for like 5 hours if that.  It wasn't that long of a game and while the idea behind the story is great there isn't enough dialogue to make you feel for any characters so I just kind of grinded through the game purely because I wanted to win.  The gameplay is AWESOME, the mix of diner dash, harvest moon, plants verses zombies, and fruit ninja is HILARIOUS.  I will probably be playing this again for sure, and perhaps try the endless mode.  WARNING if you're looking for something challenging and or difficult this game is not for you, unless you intentionally make it harder for yourself because the game gives you tons of helping hands and machines to deal with the work around the farm.

												A very addictive and entertaining Farming game, where your objective is to rebuild the farm while defending from zombie hordes.It's a very cute textures Harvest Moon, and since you can hire people to work for you, its very relaxing game. There are also other minigames, like Fruit Ninja for learning cooking or Restaurant Tycoon for serving people food.The only bad thing I can tell about the game is that it has several bugs. Sometimes your workers glitch, there are several missing texts, sometimes glasses or dishes bug.... but I could see in the threads on Steam forum that a developer is actively reading our comments and fixing them, so I can rate the game with 9/10. It would be 10/10 if the trading system was fair enough.			"

												As a few other people mentioned, this game is quite short and only took me 10 hours to beat. But, a good length for what it's doing. Farming and trading is very enjoyable and the restaurant is a good challenge to manage-- but the only part I disliked was learning a new recepie. I found it incredibly difficult and tedious.But overall, I'd definitely recommend giving this game a try.			"

												Farm for your life.  Zombies, an unexplained event...yeah.  Right down to it, it is a farm, cooking, running simulator.  Farm, harvest, cook, look for resources, and set up a few defenses to stop the zombies.  Not much more to do.Pros: Easy to play.  No learning curve.Graphics are bright, very geared for younger gamers.Its cheap, but i would still buy it on a sale.Cons:Its geared for younger gamers.The control response is shockingly annoyingStory mode is about six hours, it does allow you to play on afterwards, but...After story mode your only real objective is to find the golden tools.The zombies don't hurt you, but they take your resources.Overall, it feels like Sesame Street helped develop it.  Only kept my attention for a few minutes at a time.  Dont get me wrong, it really had a lot of potential, they just gave up.  Only reason i played for so long was because Playfire payed me.Who wants it?People that like farming sims, kids, or the really casual gamer looking for a few minutes to kill.I recommend it simply because of the effort put in to it, and the ease for which a child can play it "

												This game is a nice time waster. At first, I didn't think it would be all that fun. Then 4 hours past. Then 2 more.It combines Fruit Ninja, Cooking mama, Don't starve and farm sim all together.  It blends nicely with all of themHowever, there is some things that need to be changed.....1) Wood. People that come to eat your food should have wood as one of the things in their inventory. If you are able to feed them, you shouldn't have to risk your life in the woods to get 3 wood and run before zombies eat your face.2) EVERYTHING should be worth something. You start out with a watering can. You can't sell it, even after you upgrade it to the red one (Holds twice as much water). So you are stuck with it or give it away. 3) Coins should be common. Common currency. I can see scrap metal being some sort of currency, but why have the player start out with some for story, then it never to be seen again?4) You should be able to attack zombies in the woods. You have an axe, sythe, shovel and hammer! But yet you get into slap fights that end up with half the things you gathered on the floor.5) There should be one or two more available spots for helpers. 3 is great, but eventually you need a lot more help on the farm and resturant...6) Helpers should be able to go into the woods and get wood. Would help out with #17) It would be nice to be able to destroy a fully grown plant to get the seeds back but no yeild. That way you can rebuild after learning new things, but instead you lose it all...All together, its a fun little game. Best to get it on sale.7/10.			"

												Overall premise: Harvest moon + zombie defense. You start out the game with a handful of seeds and tools and start farming away, periodically defending from zombies and serving food from your farm to refugees in exchange for resources. Over time you can unlock better recipes, crops, and farm equipment.The concept of the game is actually cool, but it's pretty clearly designed for mobile and the controls suck on a PC. For instance, the cooking mini game is basically fruit ninja, which you have to play with a mouse. Farm / restaurant management is all micro (go here, pick vegetable, put in box, repeat until all plants are harvested) which gets to be a tad tedious.This game has some charm, but it's a miss as a PC title.

												It's really not bad of a game. I bought it when it was on sale... probably the only way I would have bought it. It's a great game, but I wouldn't pay ten bucks for it. If it's on sale though? Go for it. It's entertaining and rather addictive. I played it for hours at a time and it flew right by. The only things I'm not a fan of is the fruit slicing game and the fact that the game freezes a lot (at least for me) at random times. But hey, that might just be me! If there were expansions of some sort or updates in the future, I'm sure the game could really be an excellent source of entertainment for everybody, seeing as it has a little bit of everything. At first I was wary because of the toony-ness and I put off buying it... I thought it might be weird and buggy, but it really proved me wrong.			"

												Fun game, really enjoyed it when i just started out. However, it soon turns into a quite a grind, and with your helpers bugging out constantly (by dropping their watering can and picking it up again rapidly), getting in the way of my clicks, or 2 of them performing the same tasks on the same tiles. Despite that, it is a good game, looks like it has great potential if the developers expanded on it more. Wouldn't recommend for 10 bucks, but if it on sale, not a bad purchase.			"

												Pretty tasty recipe is as follows. 1 cup of Harvest MoonA Dash of Fruit Ninja9oz of Diner DashA few hundred (very) fresh zombiesand a pinch of Tower DefenceStick them in a blender and beat until awesome.  Bon appetit, Farm for your life is served. Farm for your life is a sweet little gem of a game that takes the elements of a few classic games (referenced above) and somehow manages to pull it off.  You begin your life on a pretty sweet looking farm in the middle of the cutest little Zombie apocalypse ever, lose it all to a storm and refurbish it all from the ground up. Plant your crops, harvest and rennovate a restaurant that caters to other survivors that will trade you goods for food, allowing you to upgrade and improve.  Reinforce the farm, build corn cannons, slingshots and pumpkin catapults to fend off the hungry (and cute) undead.  Attract survivors to live on your steading and help out with the tasks you assign to them.  Farm for your life is a regular jack of all trades, yet master of none.  For what it is, it pulls it off brilliantly and delivers hours of enjoyment.  There's something here for the casual and not so casual gamer. The game isn't without it's faults here and there, but nothing that can't be easily overlooked (especially for the price of the game + bagging it during the Halloween sale).  The farm itself isn't huge, the buildings and upgrades are pre-determined in their positioning, removing most of the customizable options for those that would be seeking it.  Some of the dialogue in English has been misspelled due to translation (which is a tiny complaint, owing to the fact that it's like 98% fine.)   The most amusing translation error is that ""Grass"" is labeled as ""Gras.""  When altering your character's appearance at the house, it has a tendency to randomly alter beard/hair colour (which is easily fixed by going back into the house and selecting the colour you intended.)  Full plates of food/beverages can get stuck on the tables in the restaurant and become non-interactive at times, which I've only noticed happening when I've set my character to perform a task that a worker suddenly attempts to perform at the same time.   This is easily fixed by saving, exiting to the main menu and returning to the game.  Nothing game breaking that I've run into, yet.  The flaws really do feel so minor to me that I don't even notice unless I'm forced to recall them (like writing a review).  It's hard not to love a game that pays homage to existing classics and owns up to in the achievements.  One of the real winning points for me was that I noticed you have the option to play the game without zombies in it.  My girl's very phobic of zombies, yet loves games like this.  It was great to know she could play without having to worry about that, which turned out it wouldn't be a problem anyways.The zombies in this game are adorable, they don't even eat people.  They're vegetarian zombies that bust down your fences to eat your crops.  There's not a gun in sight, you defeat them by lobbing corn husks at their heads, or letting your automated defenses finish them off for you.  A concept that might seem a little blasphemous to viscera chomping, plague spreading, Romero-esque zombies that I've been a fan of all my days.  But, jeez... just look at em! Farm for your life is triumphant!   Stop reading and buy it already!			"

												La la la~ I'm just workin on my farm....OH CRAP ARE THOSE ZOMBIES? Yes. Yes, they are. Farm for your life is a funny harvest moon like farm simulator combined with a zombie apocalypse game. Add in a cute story and cute characters and you got yourself a pretty decent game.This game reminds me a lot of Harvest Moon and if you are a Harvest Moon addict, like myself, then this game is an excellent way to get your Harvest Moon fix if a new game isn't out yet. It has farming, zombie hunting, mining..what more could you ask for? Well...I have some ideas in mind.While going through the storymode they do cover a lot of ground but after a certain point they stop telling you what to do. Which is fine when ended correctly but it just suddenly stops and you are left clueless as to what you are supposed to do. This is right at the beginning. They don't tell you how to properly fight zombies, they don't tell you what goals you are supposed to achieve...You just have a farm and pure confusion. Once you figure out to do then you are smooth sailing but it is something that should have been incorporated into the game. Instead you have to go out of your way and figure it out yourself.So to sum it all up... Pros: Cute characters and graphics. Pretty decent character cusomization. Cute story. Almost a Harvest Moon look a like without a dating aspect. Zombies. Pretty straight forward.Cons: Costs $10. No demo. After a certain point you are left to your own devices when there should be more information given to you.Overall it is a pretty good game and I would definitely recommend it to someone who needs to get their Harvest Moon fix. But I kind of wished there was a demo I could have tried out and I think that 10$ is a little steep for this game. But if you like Harvest Moon mixed with zombies then this game will be right up your alley.			"

												As a guy who played this game for a Solid 5 Hours last night, this game is addicting beyond belief, the simplicity of the game and the unique and not too shabby Art style makes it a joy to play, It reminds me of back when I used to play the old Zynga games (Farmville & ChefVille), but with Zombies.Now you are able to squash Zombies in a number of ways...no there are no Pipe Bombs or Machine Guns, but more traditional and family friendly ways, such as throwing Apples or 'Taters at their faces, or buying Pumpkin Catapult's from your trusty Architect friend. The game in Story Mode can be completed in over 7 hours, I've been playing for 5 hours, and are nowhere near finishing.The game maybe bugged in many ways, but I have not ran into any thus far, which is always a good thing. Also, the Market Exchange is way too high, I have to throw half my Inventory to get a bloody Empty Glass or Plate. Last problem I have is that the Devs do not interact with the Community. You Built the game. Now listen to find ways to improve the damn thing, so more people can buy and enjoy the game.In my Honest Opinion, best 'Tater Boiler Simulator of 2014: 10/10			"

												It's a short game and fun for the price you pay, I'd still just recommend buying it on sale. It's like a mix of Harvest Moon and a restruant sim. And you can't forget the dodging of weird blue-ish zombies and throwing corn at them so they don't eat all your stock. There isn't much to do after you beat the game and you're only able to plant crops in the grass.			"

												It's really not bad of a game. I bought it when it was on sale... probably the only way I would have bought it. It's a great game, but I wouldn't pay ten bucks for it. If it's on sale though? Go for it. It's entertaining and rather addictive. I played it for hours at a time and it flew right by. The only things I'm not a fan of is the fruit slicing game and the fact that the game freezes a lot (at least for me) at random times. But hey, that might just be me! If there were expansions of some sort or updates in the future, I'm sure the game could really be an excellent source of entertainment for everybody, seeing as it has a little bit of everything. At first I was wary because of the toony-ness and I put off buying it... I thought it might be weird and buggy, but it really proved me wrong.			"

												Do not buy this game. Not because it is not fun playing it - it IS fun. But because when I saved my game first, and loaded it, I got a blue loading screen and could only access the lower buttons. This is a known issue since 2014 (!); not resolved yet as it seems. I found a solution via google, this time I could load my game but half of my things were missing. I thought it was a one time-thing and started another game. I was cleverer this time: played for five minutes, saved, quit the game, reloaded - worked fine. I did this four or five times during my next two hours of farming and saved in different slots just to be sure. Then I quit the game, shut down my computer, went to sleep and today loaded the game again. AND: ALL SAVEGAMES ARE GONE but the first one from when I had only played five minutes. This is ridiculous. I tried to get a refund, but know what?! I can't, because I have played more than two hours. HOW ON EARTH should I have known savegames are only saved by... pure luck? Only when the number of seconds played is even (watch out for the irony)? I don't know and I don't care. Worst thing is that the game is really fun and I want to go on playing. But I can't recommend it. Do not buy this game.			"

While none of the gameplay is super complicated, it's fun to build up the farm and improve the restaurant while fending off zombie attacks. The fruit ninja part was kinda hard for me but I'm not too coordinated.The art style and writing is pretty cute too--overall an amusing game if you're in the mood for something light and fun!			"

												This game is a nice time waster. At first, I didn't think it would be all that fun. Then 4 hours past. Then 2 more.It combines Fruit Ninja, Cooking mama, Don't starve and farm sim all together.  It blends nicely with all of themHowever, there is some things that need to be changed.....1) Wood. People that come to eat your food should have wood as one of the things in their inventory. If you are able to feed them, you shouldn't have to risk your life in the woods to get 3 wood and run before zombies eat your face.2) EVERYTHING should be worth something. You start out with a watering can. You can't sell it, even after you upgrade it to the red one (Holds twice as much water). So you are stuck with it or give it away. 3) Coins should be common. Common currency. I can see scrap metal being some sort of currency, but why have the player start out with some for story, then it never to be seen again?4) You should be able to attack zombies in the woods. You have an axe, sythe, shovel and hammer! But yet you get into slap fights that end up with half the things you gathered on the floor.5) There should be one or two more available spots for helpers. 3 is great, but eventually you need a lot more help on the farm and resturant...6) Helpers should be able to go into the woods and get wood. Would help out with #17) It would be nice to be able to destroy a fully grown plant to get the seeds back but no yeild. That way you can rebuild after learning new things, but instead you lose it all...All together, its a fun little game. Best to get it on sale.7/10.			"

												Pretty tasty recipe is as follows. 1 cup of Harvest MoonA Dash of Fruit Ninja9oz of Diner DashA few hundred (very) fresh zombiesand a pinch of Tower DefenceStick them in a blender and beat until awesome.  Bon appetit, Farm for your life is served. Farm for your life is a sweet little gem of a game that takes the elements of a few classic games (referenced above) and somehow manages to pull it off.  You begin your life on a pretty sweet looking farm in the middle of the cutest little Zombie apocalypse ever, lose it all to a storm and refurbish it all from the ground up. Plant your crops, harvest and rennovate a restaurant that caters to other survivors that will trade you goods for food, allowing you to upgrade and improve.  Reinforce the farm, build corn cannons, slingshots and pumpkin catapults to fend off the hungry (and cute) undead.  Attract survivors to live on your steading and help out with the tasks you assign to them.  Farm for your life is a regular jack of all trades, yet master of none.  For what it is, it pulls it off brilliantly and delivers hours of enjoyment.  There's something here for the casual and not so casual gamer. The game isn't without it's faults here and there, but nothing that can't be easily overlooked (especially for the price of the game + bagging it during the Halloween sale).  The farm itself isn't huge, the buildings and upgrades are pre-determined in their positioning, removing most of the customizable options for those that would be seeking it.  Some of the dialogue in English has been misspelled due to translation (which is a tiny complaint, owing to the fact that it's like 98% fine.)   The most amusing translation error is that ""Grass"" is labeled as ""Gras.""  When altering your character's appearance at the house, it has a tendency to randomly alter beard/hair colour (which is easily fixed by going back into the house and selecting the colour you intended.)  Full plates of food/beverages can get stuck on the tables in the restaurant and become non-interactive at times, which I've only noticed happening when I've set my character to perform a task that a worker suddenly attempts to perform at the same time.   This is easily fixed by saving, exiting to the main menu and returning to the game.  Nothing game breaking that I've run into, yet.  The flaws really do feel so minor to me that I don't even notice unless I'm forced to recall them (like writing a review).  It's hard not to love a game that pays homage to existing classics and owns up to in the achievements.  One of the real winning points for me was that I noticed you have the option to play the game without zombies in it.  My girl's very phobic of zombies, yet loves games like this.  It was great to know she could play without having to worry about that, which turned out it wouldn't be a problem anyways.The zombies in this game are adorable, they don't even eat people.  They're vegetarian zombies that bust down your fences to eat your crops.  There's not a gun in sight, you defeat them by lobbing corn husks at their heads, or letting your automated defenses finish them off for you.  A concept that might seem a little blasphemous to viscera chomping, plague spreading, Romero-esque zombies that I've been a fan of all my days.  But, jeez... just look at em! Farm for your life is triumphant!   Stop reading and buy it already!			"

												It's a pretty good game. LIke it and it's good for when you're looking for a simple game to play that doesn't require too much attention. It's a good cross between farmville/harvest moon and tower defense (with cooking). The story mode is short but that's good cause otherwise it would become tedious. I just wish you could skip the opening tutorial on repeat play throughs. My one complaint is that endless mode is good in theory but not execution. You get to the point where you have way too much of everything (including vegetables) I don't even have to worry about zombies anymore other than just making sure to replace fence posts. I mean I can keep going in that game file but there's really no point because it's just so easy it's boring. Over all good game but not the best thing you'll ever play. Probably not worth $10 but it's not that bad a price.			"

												Man. I really love this game.It has a very intuitive farm - make food - fight zombies setup which is mind blowingly addictive, at least for me (a self-professed lover of casual games and farm games). I bought it and promptly spent eight hours playing it, no breaks, until I beat it.I then played it again. I'm now playing it a third time, but trying to not use the vendor (except for recipes and fertilizer).I do wish it were a little longer. Maybe it could have an expansion? But I would absolutely plunk down $15 for the game again, even with its shortness.And a big thank you to the developers for how completely glitch free it's been. A lot of indie games & casual games have frustrating bugs that might or might not get fixed later, but on this one I didn't run into a single issue.			"

												Overall premise: Harvest moon + zombie defense. You start out the game with a handful of seeds and tools and start farming away, periodically defending from zombies and serving food from your farm to refugees in exchange for resources. Over time you can unlock better recipes, crops, and farm equipment.The concept of the game is actually cool, but it's pretty clearly designed for mobile and the controls suck on a PC. For instance, the cooking mini game is basically fruit ninja, which you have to play with a mouse. Farm / restaurant management is all micro (go here, pick vegetable, put in box, repeat until all plants are harvested) which gets to be a tad tedious.This game has some charm, but it's a miss as a PC title.

												This game is charming, it lays out what it is from the get go (which is as ridiculous as it seems) but that allows you to go into it with little expectations, and thus little disappointment.  A little bit like Goat Simulator it's a good game to blow off steam with as much or as little stress as you like. The characters, environment, and animals are stylistically simple.  The developers clearly had as much fun developing it as they hoped you would enjoy playing it.  It's definitely worth the money, and because of the cute and ridiculous nature of blending all these casual games into one, you're going to find parts that suck you in and make it a good relaxing time sucking game.

												If you're bored and want a simple time waster this isn't too bad. There's no replay value though. By day you manage your farm and spruce up your makeshift restaurant with the help of farmhands you feed breakfast. By night zombies attack (sort of, they're vegetarian so they're only interested in crops) and you have to fend them off. Despite having an axe though you can't attack them, your only means of offense is vegetable throwing cannons/catapults. Not much of a storyline- towards the end you get two small quests easily completed in a few minutes and then the game is over.It's a cute little game but lacks a proper plot. Not really worth the $10, get it when it's on sale instead. Would probably work better as a tablet game used to keep			"

												This game is such a nice surprise. First you think it's just like all the other farming games, but then you play more and find out there really is much more to it!			"

												fun little game. it could have use a bit more polish to iron out a few non-critical bugs and small issues, but overall, it is a lot of fun for a few hours. i think it usually goes on sale during the big holiday & summer sales, so look to pick it up then for some cheap entertainment			"

												Amusing puzzle game -- puzzle in terms of trying to figure out how to keep them darn zombies out of your stuff and still live to see tomorrow. Bought/was gifted it (Can't remmeber if I bought it or was gifted XD) and amused myself for quite a while with it. Well worth the purchase price~			"

												This game is relatively easy whilst maintaing a sense of not being too easy and does give the player a bit of a challenge. There are some nice aspects in here that give it the foundations to be a great game and you can pick up on other game vibes within it - Fruit Ninja, Farmville/Hay Day, Bakery Story etc - and it gives it an enjoyable ""chill out"" vibe, the type of game you play to waste time, and that is what I enjoy about it.However, for every good there has to be a bad.Whilst this game is easy with the presence of a good challenge, this game can quickly become boring and or frustrating. Gathering rescources can take its time, which in result leads to trades taking longer, declining of ""guests"" at the resturant, failing to grow certain crops, etc. That is what I don't like about this game. If it could present rescourses at a moderate and consistant pace instead of over-supplying at the start and fading to practically nothing a few days in then this would make the game more enjoyable.Overall it is a fun little game to waste time with, but in it's current stage I wouldn't say worth buying at full price.

												It was fun for the frist 5 days but later not so much I would not recommend this game if you are looking for a game that last more than 20 hours but if you are just looking for a small cute game about farming and  fighting zombies maybe this is your thing			"

												If you like Harvest Moon, Plants vs Zombies, or time management games then this is a good choice. The main quest line is rather short and all depends on how quickly you can stockpile materials, but the game still has decent play value even after the quests end. It's a short and sweet game but I really enjoyed it.			"

												I take this game when was on sale (I don't remember how much I paid). At the time I was interested about farming games, and this was quite a surprise.What it's about? Well after the ""usual"" apocalypse, whe had to manage both a farm and a canteen: you have to grow your own products and gather resources, you use the crops to prepare the meals asked by the costumers of your canteen, in excange they will give you seeds for your farm and resources you can't find around. With these resources you can obtain upgrade for your canteen (like more tables, an extra oven, etc.), items for your farm (coop, sprinklers...), defense turrets to keep at bay the zombies that come during the night (corn machine guns and pumpkin catapults XD) and, more important, houses for people who will help you in the farm and in the canteen.If you are in need, you can trade with a merchant in a barter system, represented by a weight scale to show how favourable is the trade, if with your customers you can get more favourable exchanges, the merchant isn't so easygoing, and it's quite greedy when come to sell you seeds or animals. But I think is typical of game merchants.The combat against the zombies is, how I can say, strange? You pratically have to throw your crops on their face to stun them shortly, and after two-four hit they die. This until you don't get proper defence, then you have some ""Plants vs Zombies"" feels.Other Thing is when you go into the forest to gather wood and stone. You will be attacked by zombies and if you don't manage to escape from them, you will lost part of what you gather.Another thing to mention is the minigame of the recipes: Fruit Ninja. Well, with some differences like you have to cut only specific vegetables and make the fall into the pot below to fill a bar. Faster you fill the bar, better is the level of the recipe, and higher the level, the faster the dish will cook. As expected, more advanced are the recipes, harder will be get the top level.What can I say? The idea is nice, actually well made but lack of content. After some hours you feel like you have seen all the game can offer. The story is almost absent and when you recieve some quests, there isn't nothing that show you what actually you have to do. Another thing I find pretty annoying is the absence of good description: I mean, thanks, you show me how many resources I need for this... but how it work? Or, you probably will need the wikia to understand how to get special items, because the game didn't explain this!And yes, you can customize your character, but right now the variety of clothing or face details are very scarce, and since the npc use the same items, it's not so hard to find your clone between the costumers.To end this review, I think is a nice game, well developed and I didn't find any bugs. But, as I say, there's still a lot of work to make it a Good game, but the base is better than other game I see around, plus it's a pretty unique mix that you will not see around. Still, considered what the game offer, I suggest to buy when it's at 5€.But is a nice time killer. I give 7,5/10			"

												Really amazing game, was slightly confusing at the start but easy to pick up and play.  Although only get this game on sale I got about 2-3 hours on the Story Time, and going to be playing this game from time-to-time.  So overall very fun short game but had a blast with it :)			"

												This game is well implemented with charming graphics and fun farming and shopkeeping mechanics. However, the zombies are complete pushovers. With the undead posing no threat, Farm for your Life ends up being just another farming sim, and games like Stardew Valley and World's Dawn make much better alternatives.			"

												I did enjoy the game at first, but after a few hours..it lost it's appeal for me. It does tend to crash quite a bit and has a couple of odd features, such as the cooking system and characters standing so their faces are merged. Overall, its not a bad game, just would probably be better suited to an Iphone with a touch screen.			"

												Really love this game! It's fast paced during the nighttime, but relaxing and repetitive during the day to balance you out. Also then it has strategy management, so taxes your skills evenly!Cute story, good length, nice visually, fun ideas - well worth it!The only thing I was diasppointed at was the complexity and depth of the world outside :( it could have been more complex!

												Such an amazing game, it really tapped into my love of management and multi-tasking and the satisfaction that it gives when everything is running smoothly. For a casual gamer (like me) it has the perfect mix of farming and combat. My only complaint is that it's not bigger.			"
