Early Access Review
								Cosmochoria tells the off-the-wall story of a lone astronaut, equipped curiously with nothing but his trusty laser pistol and space helmet. No, seriously, that's all, this dude is completely naked. Not much is known about our naked astro-protagonist other than his mission to bring color and life to a dying galaxy randomly sprinkled with lifeless planets. You'll jetpack around in classic arcade fashion pew-pew-pewing all that stand in your way as you rocket between the rocky spheres in an effort to rescue these planets from bleakness.Your early career as a cosmic space horticulturist will be painstakingly difficult and a bit of a slow start. The game starts you off with the core essentials and not much else, including a basic jetpack for floating between planets, a puny peashooter and just enough seed to get you started with your first plant of each run. The planets start off barren and empty but as you fertilize them with your psychedelic plants become more and more cosmic and groovy. With each anomaly you plant a new wave of enemies approaches and you're faced with defending yourself while managing to plant more in the process. The further you get and the more you plant, the more intense and difficult the enemy waves get forcing you to skip and jump over shots and fight back the small alien creatures dropped by UFOs.Luckily, filling a planet with enough funky space plants to fill the empty heart at the core means you've accomplished reviving it, and the planet gives back its lifeforce to your missing health as some strange act of gratitude. This lengthens your lifespan giving you a chance to collect the dropped gems from enemies used for buying new equipment or items between plays. The equipment you accumulate through your many playthroughs are what take Cosmochoria from being just a fun arcade romp to a fully addictive and almost roguelike experience with persistent elements that expand on the length of each trip. You'll find permanent upgrades for everything from maximum health, speed of your character, to the amount of starting seeds you bring with you at the beginning and all will help push you on your journey to discovering the secrets of Cosmochorias world.The world is chock full of secrets to discover, and given the randomized nature of the game will appear at the least expected of times and runs. These secrets are obviously.. a bit secret so I don't want to spoil them but can come in the form of anything from strange and mysterious turds to ancient space eggs. Their usage is generally as cryptic as the item itself, and usually involves finding another oddball character in the galaxy to bring the item to. The rewards you gain from these strange, cryptic, and secret side quests randomly sprinkled across this colorful cosmos are extremely worth the trip and usually give you permanent upgrades that will carry over and speed up your future endeavors into this trippy realm.Cosmochoria makes me feel like a kid on saturday morning again, the oddly nostalgic twinklings of the opening song evoke a melancholy feeling in me that is both very happy and at the same time a bit sad. The memories of childhoods filled with imagination and creativity seem so close to us in our minds, but are also far in the past and unreachable in our adult lives. Perhaps this is the point of Cosmochoria? To remind us that even though we're adults, the world isn't so bleak, that we can still escape to worlds inside our minds the same way we did as children and forget the troubles of reality and really expand our imagination even during the mind-numbing process of growing older. This is a game without a demographic, for anyone and everyone to enjoy, it's a showcase of the kind of creativity and imagination games can and should have, and the only requirement is that you have a serious passion for fun.Cosmochoria is an incredibly fun and addictive journey into a fantastically colorful world of cosmic entities.Filling each planet and watching them transform is addictive to me in the same way watching your ball in Katamari Damacy fill with the trinkets and relics of the world you roll up around you was. It's very accessible in its arcade-like execution and controls, but retains the high skill ceiling of a roguelike that keeps you pressing on to find what you need to increase your survivability in future plays. It's the kind of game you can pick up and play for a few minutes, or get lost in and obsess over upgrades and collectibles for hours on end. Not only is it just plain damn fun, but it features a stylish world with a unique cast of characters and monsters that I won't ever forget in the same way I never forget the cartoons or picture books that shaped my childhood. Yes, Cosmochoria is that kind of an experience.			"

												One small step for naked man, one giant leap for naked mankind.Cosmochoria is an action adventure game with rogue-like elements that recently left Early Access. You assume the role of a naked cosmonaut (kinda reminds me of the naked mole rat from Kim Possible) who has found himself stranded in a strange galaxy far from home. You must explore this new galaxy while searching for artifacts, fighting enemies and gardening! As you play you will unravel an interesting story which tells you how and why the galaxy you are in has become the way it is. Your main aim is to travel from planet to planet planting seeds and growing enough plants to 'create an atmosphere' for the planet, doing so not only rewards you with items but also allows you to heal on said planet+Charming vector illustration art style+It's a very open-ended game so you're free to do what you want, if you just want to grow plants on one planet and defend it then you're free to do so for as long as you wish+Procedurally generated galaxy, you'll never play the same game twice+Lots of different kinds of enemies which are introduced as you get further into the game+Lots of weapons, skins and upgrades to unlock as you play through finding unique items or by collecting enough alien poop crystals to buy things in the shop+A number of towers to build on your planets+Some rather interesting mechanics, such as portals which teleport you across the galaxy+Challenging boss fights+Great writing and an interesting backstory+So much to discover and understand+Lots of NPCs to find across the galaxy+Very original idea+Awesome electronic soundtrack which fits nicely with the game's setting+Active and friendly devs+Cool, and worringly naked, protagonist+/-You have to do a fair bit of grinding to get enough poop crystals for upgrades+/-You can't save your game, if you want to quit you have to die+/-Due to how open ended it is it can be difficult to know what to do at times-The gameplay is a little too simple for it's own good and often feels repetitive particularly when you restart a game-You only get a mini-map by finding it(? I've never really worked out what causes me to get it when I do have it) which is irritating because it's hard to navigate without itVerdict:8Cosmochoria is a great action/adventure space game with an awesome art style, procedural generation, lots of unlocks and an original idea. If you're a fan of space games or have some strange desire to become and extraterrestrial botanist I strongly suggest you pick this game up.***This review was written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***El K.

												I was first sceptical, especially after the first few playthroughs but I'm a sucker for upgrades when done right and slowly but surely I became stronger and next thing I knew a 10 minute play session turned into two hours and now I'm hooked. If you like planet hopping physics and planting seeds to make planets grow (and give you health) then this is for you. I'm a 33 year old male and find it hard to get into games the older I get, even though I still love them.  So, if you find yourself in the same boat and are looking for a casual game where you die often (and that's okay) then this is for you! Anyway, I'm not great at writing reviews, this is my first one. I liked the game that much I felt compelled to come here and tell you all that I love it!			"

Early Access Review
								This game is a fun little action game set among rotating planets, little prince style. You start on a planet and defend it while planting seeds to make an atmosphere appear (which helps with defending from various baddies.) After you feel you have built up the planetoid enough (or at any time for that matter) you can use your jetpack to fly to other planetoids and keep going. The game is procedurally generated with a progressive unlocking system for new abilities and weapons. Each time you play the game starts out pretty slowly, allowing you to build up your planet and as you explore your solar system the difficulty progresses at a nice pace. There are bosses that show up and a nice variety of enemies.			"

								Cosmochoria! Still don't know how to pronounce the name, but who cares?! This game is loads of fun, I got to be part of the alpha testing and it was so great! This game is really easy to pick up (but it is challenging) It's a great way to blow through some extra time you might have. This is an arcade styled game and therefore is easy to play for just a few minutes or even hours upon end! Not one game is the same, sometimes you get lucky and find a bunch of pyramids (little tower things that shoot lasers) or sometimes you get overwhelmed by aliens. This game isn't like other survive as long as you can type of games. Because unlike others of this genre you never get frustrated or want to rage quit. The game slowly gets harder and harder the longer you play. So as you start to buy upgrades the longer you last.This game is incredible, even if you don't want this game buy it support the developer. He is awesome and works so hard!			"

												It's certainly unique. So the basic mechanics are: jet around in space from planet to planet, planting trees to restore them. Once a planet is restored, it dispenses a random treasure and heals you. While this is going on you will be assaulted RELENTLESSLY by enemy aliens, which gets pretty frustrating. I was having Spore flashbacks for a while. After X time has passed, a massive boss monster will spawn, which necessitates jetting through space while managing your fuel and hopefully hopping between restored planets for healing. This is the phase where you'll usually die horribly and start over -- and if you don't, you plod on until the next boss spawns.From treasure chests you'll either get some gems (for postgame upgrades), bombs, bricks (build largely ineffective towers with), or artifacts. Artifacts can be traded in for mutators accessible from the main menu, such as disallowing towers, more enemies, less enemies, ""no eggs"" (???) and the like. Most of these are also largely ineffectual, as I've noticed no difference even playing with fewer enemies and lower enemy health. Each time you start a new game the galaxy will be mostly randomized, including planetoids, what types of enemies will appear, and whether or not weapon powerups (which are crucial, as you can't buy weapon upgrades) will actually appear. The RNG swing is kind of ridiculous, I've had games where apparently every chest has contained an artifact, and others where they don't seem to exist. I've repeatedly gotten duplicate artifacts, and sometimes I've been unable to trade a new artifact in for no apparent reason. I somehow collected a pickup from a boss after the game was over despite dying to it, which gave me a white screen and a weird three-minute musical number.It's really hard to tell how much of this game is actually functioning as intended, what's glitching out and what's just plain dickish design, and much like Rogue Legacy the necessitation of perishing repeatedly to grind upgrades is starting to rub me the wrong way, but to a certain extent I'm still quite enjoying it anyway. I'm just not sure if it's more fun or frustrating yet.			"

Early Access Review
								Definitely my favorite arcade-style shooter in a while. Not only do you get to fly around in space NAKED, (which is amazing all on its own), but the tree-planting, planet-revitalizing aspect of the game really adds a unique element to the familiar space-shooter gameplay. The planets add some interesting dimension and strategy to the game; for example, large planets take much longer to revive than teeny tiny planets but also provide much more protection.The map is randomized each playthrough as well, which keeps the game from becoming stale or dull. There are things that spawn randomly throughout the universe that you will stumble across, (such as NPCs and other secret things) that offer upgrades or sidequests. I would tell you about them but they are seekrits. (Spoiler! PETS!!)Cosmochoria is challenging, but not punishing. After dying, the crystals you collect from gunning down enemies can be used to buy various upgrades, (from increased health to new weapons, to special abilities) that will help you progress further the next time you play. (And some of the weapons are really really fun!)But yes! Expect to die. A lot. You will be swarmed by aliens. You will accidentally fly into the sun. All your hard work will be destroyed by some angry UFO who was, apparently, having a bad day and decided to take it out on you. But know that there is always some crazy new stuff waiting for you upon your inevitable demise, and you will do better next time.But the most important thing, I think, is that Cosmochoria is simply fun to play. It's fun to blow up enemies while desperately trying to keep your baby trees alive, and it's satisfying to watch planets come back to life after you've worked so hard to protect them. There's a zen-like quality about the game that somehow comes through despite all the crazy hectic alien killing. (And did I mention that you're NAKED?) "

Early Access Review
								Cosmochoria is an action game set in space where you control a naked cosmonaut that wants (and has) to explore the secrets of the universe by planting seeds, floating through space in search of other planets and by killing gigantic bosses. Got your attention ? Good. Let’s read on.The gameplay dates back to a time when the action genre was still one of the most popular genres out there. Cosmochoria is thankfully a bit deeper than that, and even though you will still blast tons of enemies there’s more to do than just killing alien life forms.By planting seeds and growing plants you’ll earn additional seeds. These seeds can and have to be used in order to save dying planets. Plant enough of them and the planet will come back to live again. This is shown by a huge heart put in the center of the planet itself. The heart acts like a meter and when it’s filled up you’re done saving that specific planet and it’s time to move on again. The meter will decrease if you have less than full health. That’s because the life of the planet is also used to recharge your own health meter. Anyway, if there’s a warp point on the planet you can use one of those to transport to a different planet and if not then you can use your jetpack to get moving again.While planting seeds you will be regularly attacked by invading aliens so it’s your job to kill them while growing these seeds into plants. Once you stop planting and you’ve killed all of the remaining enemies they won’t spawn as quickly anymore. Killed enemies will drop crystals that can later be used to buy better gear and upgrades.Occasionally a boss will spawn. These are extremely tough, especially at the beginning when you have nothing but your starting equipment, and they take a lot of patience and skill to kill. They’re even harder to hit when you’re out in space so let’s just hope for your sake that you’ve already landed on a planet when the fight begins.Your jetpack is part of your default equipment and it can be used to dodge incoming fire (by hopping around) or it can be used to propel yourself into space. Once you’re out of the atmosphere you have to rely on your jetpack for navigation. If you stop using it you will still continue to float into the direction you were moving. The jetpack’s meter will very slowly refill and it’s key to time is as efficiently as possible. There are red zones (I think they are some sort of suns) and if you come in too close you will burn up and die. If you approach a new planet and enter it’s atmosphere you will automatically drop on the ground. Then the whole process repeats itself.After you die you will lose everything but your crystals and before starting a new game you can use these same crystals to upgrade all kinds of stuff. You can select an upgrade that allows you to take extra seeds with you or to move around faster. And as I already mentioned you can also bring more powerful guns with you and even unlock new outfits.Cosmochoria uses pretty, but simple, 2D vector graphics. The whole game looks sharp and has a nice style of its own. Some enemies could benefit from some extra or more animations but that might eventually be fixed or added in a later version of this Early Access edition. The game uses minimal sound design at the moment of writing this review but the sounds of gunshots, completed planets and your jetpack (among others) sound perfectly fine. The music is catchy and electronic, but it repeats itself a bit too often and could use a little more variety. But again, these might be implemented at a later stage of development.You could play this game until the end of time. Unlocking every upgrade could take you tens of hours and since every galaxy is randomly generated nothing is ever completely the same. Completing a ‘perfect’ game will take you weeks, if not more. The game also has integrated Leaderboards so that you can compare your stats with other players and friends.Plenty of updates are still being planned for this game and it will take at least several months before it’s remotely complete. But what’s there is already very much in a fully working, playable state. And above all, it’s quite fun. It does start off slow, but by slowly collecting a couple of crystals with every game you play you’ll be able to afford an upgrade (or several) in no time. Things really pick up when you have a few upgrades in your possession. Still, a bit of tweaking so that you can afford something earlier would be nice (progression feels a bit too slow at the beginning) and would also be better for the casual gamers out there or those who don’t have the time to play it as much as they’d like.The developer is also actually working very close with the community to make this game even better so if you have any suggestions or things that could be improved – anything really - don’t hesitate to post in the forums or to mail the developer himself; he's actively listening. I was surprised to see some of my suggested feedback make it into the game within days of reporting it.Overall, I really enjoyed Cosmochoria. So there you have it: a big thumbs up from me.[Rating: 81/100]			"

Pros:+ Kawaii+ Wonderful planets+ Nice soundtrack+ Epic boss fightsCons:- Expensive upgrades- Issue with retrieving the artifacts- BSODThis game have a charm but there are some things that I believe should be fixed.The goal in Cosmochoria is to grow plants until the certain planet create its own atmosphere (there are 50 planets). Visual style is kawaii and neat, every planet is colorful and different. During exploring you will be swarmed by many different foes, some of them are annoying, some of them are really bad. Boss fights are nice but ice dragon is overpowered and the green cloud boss is really easy, you can just stand in one place and shoot around until it's defeated. When I was almost done with the game I found some kind of easter egg or boss, still don't know what was that because I was immediately terminated by blue screen of death (in the game). About artifacts - it's hard to find the place to bring the artifact back, for me it's not worth it. I think the solution would be some kind of radar to point where you need to go. There are some weapons to unlock but they are expensive, after 2 hours I was able to buy homing blaster which is worse than laser blaster that costs 15x less. Some upgrades are too expensive and I was not even bothering to buy them. And one more thing, when you accidentaly find the crystal there is 80% opportunity its a monster...			"

								Cosmochoria grabbed my attention instantly when I saw it in the store and I knew I had to have it. I am incredibly impressed with this game and how much the developer continues to add to it. I love playing this game and so do all of the people that I've shown it to. While this game can be difficult and it is easy to get lost, it is a great play and it keeps bringing me back for more. Cosmochoria is fresh and new, I've never played anything like it. And you like indie games and you like floating around space and blowing things up, this is a must buy. 100% highly recommend, I'd even buy it again.			"

								This review originally was one that did not recommend the game. I have changed it. Here's why:The developer of this game is fantastic. I had a rather lengthy discussion with him about various aspects of the game I thought could be improved, and we talked about some of the logic and thought processes behind our opinions. These discussions resulted in an update in the game. Needless to say I now have a huge amount of respect for this developer.I am still trying out these new updates, but am largely enjoying the changes. Reasons to buy the game:-You are supporting a great dev-It is funny and cute, and those things will come in handy when tackling the difficult enemies present in the game.-Gameplay customization. The weapon upgrades allow you to change your gameplay to something that suits you. None of the initially unlocked weapons upgrades are any better than any of the other weapons by straight numbers (I still haven't unlocked two of the weapons) , so play around and see which one serves you the best.-It's a bullet storm with a purpose. It's a semi-rogue-like with a fun  and potentially non-linear  save feature. It's an interplanetary, psychadelic gardening simulator. You start the game off naked.			"

												Cosmochoria is a very fun and whimsical game that I highly recommend at full price. Amazing value during a sale.Explore a procedurally-generated galaxy using a jetpack, grow plants to terraform planets in order to heal yourself, shoot a variety of enemies with fun weapons, and uncover the secrets of a post-cataclysmic universe. Great fun.Beautiful 2D art with a lot of character, and a very polished overall feel.The controls feel very smooth and responsive (I've been using a 360 controller) and there's a good variety of unlocks and content to discover.Although there's no saving of galaxy progress, it's possible to start a new game in a galaxy that's at roughly the same stage as when you've defeated one of the game's bosses, so if you wish you can ""skip"" bosses you've already defeated. Plus, all your unlocks and bricks (the resource used for building turrets and other structures) are retained when you die or quit the game, ready for the next attempt.The developer is very responsive to the community and seems very friendly and reasonable. In short, deserving of your support if you like the sound of the game!			"

								(bad pun) have you ever wanted to fight naked with laser blaster in space? Well if yes, this is the game for you. The has still a lot of possibilities and probably some more updates for more feautres. Cosmochoria has a good and cute atmosphere yet challenging at the same time. Everytime you start anew, the map is randomized and basically your goal is to defend yourself while planting plants in a planet. Everytime you plant, the plant recovers and gives you health if it is fully recover. You could also upgrade stuff and turrets (the pyramid with one eye). I recommend this game because it is fun and a good game overall.			"

Cosmochoria is a fantastic little game where you play a lone, naked cosmonaut who is trying to bring back planets in a dying galaxy one seed at a time.StoryCosmochoria doesn’t seem to follow a specific linear storyline, instead it is a very do-at-your-own-pace style game. You do unlock snippets of story as you revive more planets but it’s never done in a ‘do this’ or ‘follow this’ kind of layout. The general story behind Cosmochoria is very simple yet very enjoyable. You’re a little astronaut tasked with reviving planets which are dying out across the galaxy. Armed with nothing more than a jetpack, a single seed and a small gun it’s up to you to save the galaxy before it’s too late.General GameplayThe gameplay is simple, you start on a planet which will vary in size play from play and you must start by planting seeds which you’ll only have one of at first. You must plant and tend to your seed whilst defending yourself from the various enemies you’ll run into with your aforementioned peashooter. Once your seed reaches full sproutyness it’ll give you more seeds and heal that planet a little. After you’ve planted enough seeds the planet will be fully healed and you’ll be rewarded with a chest which can have many things inside ranging from building blocks to random items or snippets or information and tips. Since there is nothing forcing you to leave the planet you are welcome to stay and keep planting there but you’re better off using your jetpack to fly off and find another planet to save.Each planet has it’s own center of gravity and once you leave you’ll be floating through space using your (limited) jetpack fuel to guide you around. If you decide to fly right out of the edge of the map you WILL die so don't try it like I did. As you’re travelling through spaces you’ll can come across ‘glitches’ which teleport you elsewhere on the map which can be fantastic or really, really awful so use them which caution. The enemies you encounter start fairly simple but as you progress and heal more planets you’ll find harder enemies. When you kill anything it’ll drop crystals which you’re able to level up yourself with once you die and the bigger the enemy and harder, the more crystals they drop. Bosses will spawn periodically when you heal a certain amount of planets and they are a lot bigger and stronger. It’s usually wise to have a small base on a planet by then to avoid being obliterated right away since bosses can seek you out from anywhere they are. You’re not alone when it comes to killing enemies and defending yourself though! You’ll earn something called ‘building blocks’ which allow you to build various towers on the planets you land on which can range from turrets to healing towers. Building blocks do not seem to be massively common and have to be bought with crystals if you can't find any and run out so spend them wisely.Since you cannot level up during a run you’ll find yourself dying a bit at first until you manage to get some crystals and get a bit stronger but once you get the hang of it you’ll be able to survive a fair amount of time each time but at first it can feel a little bit grindy. Since you’re able to choose what you spend your crystals on in which order though you can quickly progress the way you want choosing to prioritize health over speed if you’re dying a lot or focusing on jetpack fuel if you find yourself running a little low. The further you progress and the more planets you heal will allow you to start further in the game each time so you are not constantly having to beat the same bosses over and over. Planets are randomly generated each playthrough so nothing is quite the same and there is plenty for you to explore ranging from NPCs, random backstory snippets and giant bosses so it never feels boring and has high replayability.Pros--- Addictive gameplay--- A level-your-own-way system.--- Randomized world each time for extra replayability.--- Great graphics with accompanying soundtrack.--- Wide range of weapons, planets and enemies.--- Very friendly and active dev who is quick to solve any issues.Cons--- Can feel a little grindy.--- Gets a little repetitive after a while.--- No saving during runs: if you exit you have to start over.SummaryI got Cosmochoria in a bundle and this game alone is well worth the price of the bundle itself. Hours and hours of relaxing gameplay paired with cute graphics and a brilliant little soundtrack makes Cosmochoria a fantastic purchase and a game well worth checking out. Though a little hard at first the game eases up a lot and becomes a very enjoyable and time-consuming game. Well worth grabbing on sale.			"

												Beautiful and fast-paced, Cosmochoria is a rush of emotion as you hurl through the stars in this space-farming arcade shooter. This game is its own tutorial as you are thrown into the game, buck-naked with your jetpack equipped. The onslaught of bosses is heartbreaking sometimes, but maybe you collected enough points to upgrade your stats. But actually, writing this review is taking time away from that game. Time to get back to it.			"

Once the heart of the planet is restored, shoot off into space and do it all again, but beware of the many dangers of the cold and dark galaxy. Keep your blaster handy, you're going to need it!Gameplay gets enhanced with consecutive random playthroughs, gaining currency and putting it into character development. Additionally, it's possible to build a range of defensive and offensive structures to help you keep space monsters at bay. Fans of Rogue Legacy might get a kick out of this one.Did I mention how cute it is? It's pretty gosh dang cute.Full preview: http://segmentnext.com/2014/09/29/cosmochoria-early-access-preview/ "

								The lil videos and screenshots dont do it justice... This game imo is ""pure kfc gold"" A fantastic little gem thats a bit like a ladder as the further you progress the more hektic it becomes untill you feel like your playing old school sinistar...     Theres a decent mix of baddies and I especially enjoy the ""Jaws"" type dun dun dun music when the bosses begin to approach. Also each time you play its different the little planets come in different sizes and varieties and theres hidden secrets like eggs you can eat or hatch when you find correct planet its comfy with and the pets that hatch have thier own distinct traits...not to mention the warp gate system and lil alien people you find with stories and some that can assist you as you progressHonestly the people who put this together are genius... I love the little art style chosen for this game... I simply cant wait to see whats next =)			"

								Wow, such a great game already, and still with unlimited potential for even more. It is easily my favorite new indie game of 2014. I only stumbled upon it two days ago and it has blown my mind since I got a copy last night. In its current state it sits at my all time top favorite games list on my profile already. I love everything about this game.The difficulty level. The unforgiving nature of the gameplay.The art style.The music style.The way your playing many short games that all work towards upgrading yourself for future games.The way you move.The gravity.The wild colorful and unique enemies I've seen in just the short time I have been playing it.The fact that this game is as captivating as my favorite games are, possibly even more so. IMO this title is already ranked similarly if not equally in gameplay to the ever unattainable Plants Vs. Zombies gameplay, single player Terraria, FTL, and Don't Starve... (4 of my top 5 favorite games)This game is pure gold!Don't miss this sale price. You just can't go wrong!			"

												Gotta be honest here, I thought there was an honest chance I was not going to like this game. I'm pretty sure I got it on sale, but honestly, I'd have paid the full price knowing what I was about to experince. The game's premise is that you're an astronaut, wearing nothing but a helmet, terraforming worlds to support (plant) life again after a galaxy wide apocalypse. You do this by putting around on a jetpack, planting seeds as you go, although all kinds of aliens will try to stop you. At first, this game is going to kick your butt so hard, you'll be farting out of your eyes, but each kill, each secret item found, each boss annilated will make you even more powerful for your next playthrough. I will personally keep playing this game (as I already have for hours now) , and I strongly recommend you buy it and do the same. With a story shrouded in mystery, tons of plants, even more bullets, poetic style achievements, and an egg I still haven't figured out how to hatch, this game is a real catch.			"

								I love this game sooo much. I have made multiple YouTube videos for it and I love just jumping in and playing. Whenever I get an upgrade it just makes the game so much better and exciting because I can get much further and destroy even more alien scum. The graphics are very nice and the detail is amazing for a 2D indie game. Another great thing is the fact that the planets and plants are randomly generated colors so it is never too much of the same. Thanks Nate for being the best. My very last thing I NEED to say is that I have contacted the developer before and he is very easy to get in contact with and responds within a reasonable amount of time with such a nice response too. It's just great to see a game developer who cares about the fans so much.			"

												I find it really hard to find the right words to describe how I feel about this game. I could certainly use innovative, addictive, funny (like in the description), but I think the most important part is how I feel about it. When I play it, it feels like I am really lost in the world of this tiny, naked, astronaut. You could say that the visuals are cute, but - for me, at least - they are not disruptive, and they don't really give me the feeling that the game was actually create for kids. (No, definitely not.)Whenever I am bored and tired, I just start it up and play a short - or some days, a bit longer - game. I fly around, heroically planting plants, without pants. To me, this is one of the best indie games I ever tried.Besides all of this, the developer is an extremely likable person. Whenever I need advice, or just want to give him feedback, I ping him on twitter, and usually get an answer soon after. That's definitely a big thumbs up for me.			"

												I LOVE a few things about this game but I just can't recommend it.+ros:- Great art style.- Cool hybrid of retro and modern gameplay.- Totally fresh idea.The probelm I had was that the playitself got repetitive quickly and the combat itself is difficult, difficult without being challenging (read, tedious) and not really relevant to the long term game. I wish I could control the bad guy output, or that the combat offered a tangible reward so I could justify exploring the game a little more. If I have to advise to spend your time and money, I have to say no!			"

												Cosmochoria is a game that I backed when it was just a kickstarter. Even since then, the developer has been very involved, thanking me personally for backing before the campaign even ended. Early Access is something that I am usually wary of, but in this situation, I would not worry about it at all.Current State of the GameIf Cosmochoria was complete right now, I would recommend it. This game is a lot of fun, and its one of the first games I pull up when I need a break from homework and studying (College life). Its a relaxed shooter that somehow still feels challenging and intense. The upgrades are meaningful without being too far away form each other, and have a nice pacing. I haven't gotten far enough to delve into the story, but I've seen snippets and parts, and it looks good without intruding into the gameplay since you have to seek it out. If you just wanna be a naked space gardener, you can!Oh, did I forget the best part? You play a NAKED SPACEMAN. I don't think any other game can say that.EDIT: After Early AccessThe game is still awesome and now has much more replayability!			"

Visually it is appealing and enjoyable to watch. The 'story' as I said is roguelike and a bit of a mystery.You wont be sorry if you buy it 8/10.			"

												This game has a very original idea (healing planets by planting seeds on them), nice graphics and music, and a very enjoyable exploration side.Sadly, the gameplay is not good, so the game manages to be frustrating without being difficult - most of the time I'm just ignoring enemies (and ignoring being hit) because destroying the enemies is boring and pointless. Weapon upgrades are pointless as well, since when you get hit you lose them and most of the times they are not worth recovering. And above all, the game is very repetitive after a while.It's not that bad, but having to choose between yes and no, I'd rather not recommend it.			"

								Once upon a time, there was an Ancient Great Black Wyrm who ate the Earth.  However, a little baby in a rocket-propelled basket, and some other generally forgettable NPCs escaped the calamity!  Somehow, everyone - except the baby - learned how to breathe atmospheres with lower pressure than the Armstrong limit, in order to facilitate the baby's future revenge.No, this is not D&D; this is Cosmochoria, a simple and refreshing action-roguelike.  In this game, the goal is to reinvigorate as many worlds with life as you can!  However, enemies - who shoot lasers, for good measure - intend to stop you.  There are also gems that you need to pick up, so that when you inevitably die, you can buy supplies and important upgrades so that the next time takes a little longer to kill you.What WorksFirst, each planet has its own gravity, which makes the shooter gameplay really interesting, because you have to learn to aim around the planet you're on.  Also, the gravity serves a more important purpose - being anchors for the deep space, Asteroids-esque travel you do through the title.  On a planet, you can move and jump as you'd expect.  In space, however, gravity goes away, and all of a sudden it's up to the supplies in your jetpack to nudge your velocity such that you intercept other planets.There's a neat TD mechanic in this game, in the form of the things that bricks can create.  You can fortify a planet with towers of various kinds, which is oh-so-necessary, because every third planet you revive invariably leads to a boss fight, against at least one big, nasty Chinese dragon, who spews projectiles the way you spew...well, never mind.  Moving along.What doesn't workThe first parts of the game allow you to progress really fast, but for me after getting the Laser Pistol - an exceptionally useful upgrade - the game slows to a crawl for me, probably because I'm having difficulty beating the Fire Dragon.  It seems that beating bosses unlocks some upgrades, which leads to a slight balance problem between a boss standing between you and an upgrade you need to more easiliy defeat it, instead of the game giving you tools that actually help you defeat the boss.Should You Buy This Game?Yes, if on sale.  I'd absolutely say it's worth $4.99.  I think the normal price is high for the game that you're actually getting.			"

								Cosmochoria is a strange, strange game.  This doesn't mean that it isn't fun mind you, though flying into this game blind will confuse the heck out of you for a little while until you get an idea of the general gameplay.  In short, you'll be planting seeds on planets to bring them back to life.  Once that happens, they'll heal you (but drain its heart in the process).  Planting more seeds will refresh the planet's life force so that it can continue to heal you.  At any time, you can travel to other planets via a jetpack and repeat the process.  While this is happening, the game gets progressively harder and throws more enemies at you.  Luckily, you can use the diamonds you pick up to purchase upgrades for your profile (which stays with you from game to game).  Overall, it's a pretty fun game with a lot of potential.

Possibility to upgrade between ""deaths"" could possibly save it for someone.

												What is Cosmochoria?Genre: 2D space adventure & shooterSetting: cartoonish astronaut trying to revive a dying galaxy by planting seeds on small-scaled planetsDifficulty: 5/10 (normal playthrough), 8/10 (going for achievements and how to figure them out)Length: 5 minutes to 2 hours for a single stint, 5-7 hours for a campaign playthrough, up to 15 for getting all rewardsMode: singleplayer campaignThe positive aspects:- fresh and funny gameplay. The player travels through a galaxy of 50 planets, planting seeds, crafting defence towers and shields, battling bosses and probably saves the galaxy by beating the so-called cataclysm - a variety of powerups and perks. In every stint you do you will gain credits which you can invest in powerups and perks before starting another one. Those will permanently boost your abilities and thus make it easier to progress further. Very motivating!- neat cartoonish graphics and funny dialogues- Over 20 ""artifacts"" (to be randomly found in chests that pop up as rewards for revived planets) to twist gameplay mechanics in either a positive or a negative way, such as half/double damage, no planet healing, fast planting etc. The negative aspects:- rather short, repitive gameplay - simple story (galaxy is dying - please help!)- lack of content: galaxies are basically the same - not much variation; towers don't have upgrades; boss fights don't require special tactics most of the timeResult (and summary for those who have no time reading):What a great and cute game cosmochoria is! Saving the galaxy and unlocking perks several times will make you spend hours ingame. If only there was more content, like additional galaxies, upgradable towers and more challenging boss fights! But hey, its an indie game and it does a great job - hopefully there will be a sequel one day!Definitely worth the buy!			"

												Im suprised this game isn't as well known or widespread as it should be considering how well done and entertaining it is.It's basically a roguelike game that takes place in space. Some be gotten evil has destroyed the galaxy and rid it of life. Your task is to hover over to each planet and plant seeds to restore life on said planets while at the same time fending off invaders and monsters.The monsters start of simple and easy to deal with but increase in difficulty and variety as time progresses (Or as your save more planets, im not particularly sure). Every now and then, a boss has a chance of spawning in an attempt to ruin you for good.The area you will be playing in is widely blank (It's space lol) save for a few planets here and there, big and small, which you will need to roam around to find, inhabit and restore. While it seems simple, floating in space combined with limitted jetpack fuel actually makes roaming space more lethal than it sounds since you would have to ration your fuel so you are not caught floating in space on an empty backpack towards the edge of the galaxy (Which causes death if that isnt obvious enough)There are collectibles and artifacts that you can gather and send to the ""Wise one"" to be examined (Which is basically a way of cashing in your found items to be used in your next playthrough or identifying what it does). Permanent Stat and character upgrades are also available with currency you collect while playing the game which improves your chance of survival each time you traverse the abyss. There's also artifacts in the game which you can activate to change the base game mode either making it easier (Enemies spawn less/do less damage) or harder (Less Jetpack fuel). Top that off with procedurally generated map layouts to the game and you've got yourself a good replay value game.Overall, the game is completely worth getting and trying out. For the price tag they put on the game (23RM for me), I would say it is actually a pretty good deal considering how well fleshed out the game is. A discounted price is like taking Bacon and Eggs and adding MORE BACON AND EGGS.Edit: I seem to have forgotten one other thing. Im fairly certain it's obvious enough but the game has a strong childish and cartoon like art style which some might like or not. Personally it gave it a more innocent and simple atmosphere. The game would look more serious and action oriented if it was painted in another way. Like imagine Risk of Rain's explosion, art and chaos in this game. Pretty sure it'd probably be less about saving planets and more about destroying them. (Would be interesting to see the Magma Worm here :D)			"

								A beautiful twin-stick Rogue-like, where you jump from dead planet to dead planet, bringing them back to life by planting seeds, while trying not to get eaten by a fire-breathing space-dragon. Relaxing; haunting; and brimming with replay value as you level-up your survivability for the next round in the cold recesses of space. It has tight controller and keyboard/mouse controls, and nigh limitless exploration potential!Only flowers can bring life back to the universe, and you're the last gardener.			"

												From the prototype to greenlight, from Kickstarter to Early Access, I've been following this game and it's brought nothing but fun and happy times. This is how it should be done. A great game with loads of replayability. It has bags of character and a real heart. Basically you are naked space messiah tasked with creating garden planets and fighting loads of aliens along the way. There's a great variety of weapons and upgrades, outfits with abilities to unlock. When you die you are dead but there are permanent checkpoints you can collect and use if you want and a persistent upgrade system, so even if you fly off into the lethal edges of space and croak, you can spend some of your space diamonds to make your jetpack more gangster.Great music, lovely art and a joy to play. A seed in one hand, a laser spitting weapon of death in the other.			"

												Ever wondered what it would be like to colonize Space... That too alone lost in the universe travelling through space starting with nothing but a gun, a seed, a jetpack and a helmet. Well if you did you should definitely get this game. But beware this game can take hours of your time without you even noticing it.Cosmochoria is a cute little indie game which has relatively no rigidity of dimensions and thats exactly what makes this game so good in orientation. The story is not rigid as in you dont have to do a certain things to unlock certain levels. In other words you can play any ways you like and still get to the end result. The basic story being (as explained) you start off with a seed, a gun, a helmet and a jetpack. Your task being to save the galaxy one seed one planet at a time. There are interesting plot points every now and than as in they give clues to how the galaxy came to be the way you find it.But no rigidity in storyline.The gameplay is superb, as in spontaneous, rapid, smooth and graphically nonperiodic. You have to infuse life into the galaxy and make life spawn again in the galaxy one seed at a time. In your path there are alien creatures, spaceships and bosses.They are tasked with stopping you. But dont be afraid. You get bonuses by killing them, like building points for healing towers , etc.One peculiar feature of the game being every time you die you can level up your gear if you have certain gems in your tally. (you collect them by killing aliens)The game has smooth graphics, good music and neat storyline. All in all there are many positives about this game, which overshadow the negatives. A few being:-PROS-1.addictive gameplay2.Nonrigid storyline3.replayability4.easy on the pockets5.A very active devCONS-1. Could get a bit boring as you play through, for you being the only player in the game2. no saves during the gameAll in all the game is 7/10 for its nonrigid storyline. Definitely a must get for any gamer.			"

But before I get to all that, I must write this review.This game has such a great FEEL to it. This game has relaxing, stone cold music.This game has Outer Space. YEAH BROTHER, I've been there.This game is more important than the chinese food in my beard. And the beat goes on.	To put the smackdown of FOUR STARS on this game! AND THAT, is macho madness.			"

												Cosmochoria is a game where you heal planets void of all life because of a cataclysm that happened millions of years ago... while fighting off wave after wave of stuff that wants you dead.In many respects, this game is a rogue-lite. Permadeath, unlockables that can be used over multiple playthroughs, procedurally generated maps, etc.. However, unlike most rogue-likes, the difficulty comes mostly from personal choice. You can unlock artifacts by finding them in the game and having them identified. Half of the artifacts will decrease the difficulty in some way, like, for example, giving you the ability to instantly plant seeds, which is how you heal planets, or have less monsters on screen. The other half will increase your difficulty, like not allowing turrets, or no healing, which will essentially turn the game into a survival. The story is a nice addition, though not necessary to enjoy the game, and completely optional. You can learn about how the world came to an end by randomly generated messages on planets. The main issue I had with it is that there's a lot of nonsense in between the messages themselves, and while it does actually fit in to the story, it makes it a bit confusing to cope.When it comes to gameplay, you'll find yourself dying a few times at the beginning. The game has an upgrade/unlock system that you can only access when starting a game. There's a decent weapon variety once you have the currency to unlock it, and there's some costumes you can unlock in game for that added variety, all with their unique benefits.You might find that a session, once you get used to the combat and pace of the game, takes a long time. A run from start to finish would take 1-3 hours, which is why the game has a milestone system, which will place you after the defeat of each of the bosses.All in all the game is a good bit of fun. With a nice difficulty range, artstyle that's pleasant on the eyes, decent story, and fantastic soundtrack, I doubt you'd be disappointed.			"

Early Access Review
This is based on a build from back in October of 2014.  Also I should mention that I received this game from indiegamerchick for her #GamesMatter campaign on Twitter.Cosmochoria is a new action-adventure/strategy title with roguelike elements from developer Nate Schmold in which you, as the astronaut Cosmo, must breathe new life into a lifeless galaxy by planting seeds and fending off aliens.  Armed with nothing more than a laser blaster and a jetpack, (seriously, that's it, our little hero is buck naked) your task seems daunting at first, but all doubt washes away once you dive into the game and start shooting aliens and planting trees.GameplayOne of the first few things you'll notice is that Cosmochoria is by-and-large an homage to old-school games like Donkey Kong and Asteroids, complete with high scores and tons of pew-pew goodness.  The gameplay recalls a time when action games were one of the most popular games available.  To its credit, Cosmochoria goes a bit deeper than that.  Movement is done with the WSAD keys, you fire with the left mouse button and use your jetpack with the right button, and the S key brings up the action menu, from which you plant seeds and build structures.  When you start a new game, the first thing you'll see is the upgrade screen, where you can purchase things like bonuses and new equipment, as well as acquire new structures such as defense towers and force fields.  You make these purchases with crystals that are dropped by enemies, and they can come in real handy, as sometimes you will be faced with alien creatures and spaceships coming from all directions.  At some point, a boss creature will appear, with a big, red life bar as long as the screen.  These boss battles can be pretty tough, especially when you're first starting out and upgrades are sparse.  However, it's absolutely worth the struggle, as bosses tend to drop a plethora of crystals.I mentioned earlier that Cosmochoria has rogue-lite elements.  The game is challenging, but not in a way that's really punishing.  When you die (and you will, a lot), you lose all of your progress, but keep your crystals to spend in the upgrade shop.  Some of the items in the shop include new equipment, extra health, and a mini-map.  The mini-map is a huge help, as it will help you keep track of what planets you have saved.  As you start to plant seeds and allow them to fully grow into trees and other plants, the color will return to the planet.  Your progress here is marked by a heart in the center of the planet.  Once the heart meter fills up, you have saved that planet and can move on to the next one.  As an added perk, saved planets can actually heal you as well, as long as the heart meter isn't empty.  More trees means more life to give.  I couldn't tell if the planet can regress once it's been saved, but I'd imagine that isn't a feature that's being considered as it would equal a ton of micromanaging.PresentationGraphically, Cosmochoria is very cute and colorful.  The game is drawn with a hand-crafted 2D vector style of illustration, and while there isn't a lot of variety to the enemies at this stage, these creatures are at least presented in different color palettes to present a sense of variety, although some of them could also benefit from some added animation.  All in all, the game is very sharp and pretty, if simple.  The sound is excellent even this early in development.  Minimal sound design is employed, but the sounds of gunshots, revived planets, and your jetpack sound just right.  The music is electronic-based, and while it is quite catchy, it could also use more variety.Wrap-UpYou could play this game until the cows come home, and far beyond that.  Unlocking every upgrade will take you hours upon hours, and since the world is randomly generated every time you start new, nothing is ever the same with each play.  Completing a ""perfect"" game will take you weeks, if not much longer.  For the high-score nerds, this game also features integrated leaderboards, so that you can compare your stats with other players as well as your friends.  There are a lot of updates being planned for this game, and it could take several months before it's even remotely complete.  However, what's already available is very much in a playable state.  I haven't really encountered any major bugs.  All in all, this game is pretty fun.  Progression starts out slow, but by slowly farming a few crystals with every playthrough, you'll be able to afford a nice upgrade in no time.  Once you do have a few upgrades under your non-existent belt, things will pick up.  Perhaps a bit of tweaking to make these upgrades more affordable could help, but it's not a huge deal.  Developer Nate Schmold is working very closely with the community to make this game as good as it can possibly be, and he's open to pretty much anything.  Overall, this game is enjoyable even in its current state, and it gets a big thumbs up from me.			"

Early Access Review
								So, i kickstarted this, and therefore i guess im biased (my only kickstarter so far).But u gotta ask yourself why i would kickstart this, and what it really is.I kickstarted upon a flash game demo that was being developed before the kickstarter started, and got convinced that i'ld like to play this game on occasion and taht it will be loved by many players, especially younger generations.So here is whats it about:The game is quite simple, and if i had to compare it to anything it would say its a mixture of Rouge-Lites and Dont Starve, if u dont know what either of that is, let me break the components of the game down for you.You are an astronaut that plants trees on planets while constantly fighting of threats, you try to stock up resources and get as many points as possible.The planets, once you planet enough plants, will restore health to you, so they functioning kinda like health stations that you come back to to fight bigger enemies.So here is the thing, fighting bigger enemies is actually kinda hard, you need to play the game over and over again requirering upgrades (rouge-lite mechanics a'la rouge legacy), to have a better start in the next play through.While that sounds tiereing, the game feels always rewarding, never has ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T""-moments where you are frustrated, if you die, its your fault and you know it. It just offers you a nice time wasting for your money.The upgrades help you greatly in progressing further, fe you get yourself some ""turrets"" that will help you defend yourself against incoming threads, and a stack of them against those bosses that are regualry thrown at you. Defeat your first boss and you'll feel proud :)Further I love the astetic.Character and world are just drawn in a style that appeals the eye and while not being too detailed its just right, its a unique stlye  thats very consistent.So whats bad about the game?There is little any story, the story has to be discovered by explorations and multiple playthrough, so if you are a completionist you are probably fine, if you want deep all-in dialouges you are clearly wrong here. This is not a story focused game, but yet has some nice secrets to be found.In the end... this game is fun, considering how simple most of its mechanics are, but with the simplicity comes the requirement to cleverly manage your resources, establish bases and think about what you are acutally doing in this cute 2D game.Back to kickstarter: The game fulfilled the kickstarter promises already (at least what i wanted out from it), and is a nicely done with a uniqe astetic.A perfect mix of time waster vs. resource management, for (really) all ages.I cant think of someone who wouldnt enjoy this game.As it stands, i recommend it, also i heard there is pets now :3 'nuff said.

								Fighting through space against god only knows what to try to spread seeds across the cosmos.Less alien sex than Mass Effect, more fertility. Cosmochoria tells the tale of Cosmo the Cosmonaut, who must travel the galaxy sans pants to save it. Plant trees, shoot aliens, fly on your jet pack and fight dragons. Cosmochoria is a Roguelike with great space combat. Not the fastest or the flashiest but for sure the pewiest (Is that even a word?)Colorful, Fun and made by an all around cool guy.			"

												I kept passing this game over for ages, as I'd never really seen much about it.  I finally picked it up because I wanted to see the kind of games possible with Construct 2.  I wish I'd bought it AGES ago.This is an awesome game, and a great way to lose yourself in relaxing action for a few hours.  The graphics are lovely and endearing, the soundtrack is fabulous, and the gameplay rocks.  I'm 15 hours in and have unlocked most of the items you can unlock, and still haven't finished a full run yet (made it to 48 planets :) ) .I thoroughly recommend this game.  I'm not sure how well it handles on keyboard and mouse, as I played it on an xbox 360 controller, but it looks like it should handle well that way too.			"

Saving 2500 for the double gem boost - statistically speaking that is one of the first things you need cause cumulatively the sooner you get it the better.Day 7: Killed dragon 2 AND Dragon 3 ... turns out the laser tower helps a bunch. Unfortunately The forth Dragon freezes your butt and I was not prepared for that. However I got ""Double Crystals"" and ""Coin Magnet"" so grinding crystals will be much easier now.Day 8: I got the Sword .... bets weapon ever ... You kill dragons just by Jedi reflacting their projectiles.			"

								Before I even tried this game at PAX East I knew I wanted it. Just look at the graphics. I didn't do so well on the convention floor (the gun aiming was a bit soft) but now that I have it at home, I can't stop playing it (either he fixed the sensitivity or I just do better when not wearing pants). This is a great casual game with cute graphics and a wicked soundtrack. Don't be fooled by apprearances though, it gets kinda tough. It's very satisfying to bring planets back to life but also just whipping off into unkown space with your trusty jetpack. This is a great exploration game as well as a slick little shooter.I had the pleasure of talking to Nate, the creator, at the convention and he was an absolute pleasure. It seems he will continue to make improvements and encourages feedback.LOVE this game and I am happy to show off the matching T-shirt!			"

												Cute, fun, interesting, explorative, lacking pants. Those are the adjectives that I would primarily use to describe Cosmochoria. It's lighthearted and one of those roguelikes that chooses to let you learn to play on your own rather than hold your hand - a sentiment that strikes me as particularly ironic considering that the protagonist starts as a spaceman in his underwear.Very enjoyable, albeit, somewhat short lived and singular in purpose. Worth playing.			"

												I might be a bit biased, seeing as I've watched this game grow from its kickstarter days, but the sheer charm and arcade-esque feel of Cosmochoria is hard not to love. Controls take a bit of getting used to, but before you know it you're rocketing off into parts unknown (or directly into a star, whoops) in hopes of saving the universe!The goal is to revive planets across the galaxy by planting, protecting, and nurturing seeds. In return, the revived planets heal you as you stand on them and pop out a chest of goodies when they are first revived. If you are easily frustrated by having to start over and over from scratch (but stronger each time) this might not be your game. It's a game that is meant to have multiple takes - you can activate powerups that you've found in previous runs to keep you alive longer and get further towards your goal. Enemies are relentless jerks, constantly spawning in to ruin your day. With good fortifications, you can hold off wave after wave, but eventually you have to venture out to another rock in hopes that you can get it alive and protected before your naked little butt gets spanked. In summary: challenging, charming, and not-too-serious. As a side note, this is backed by one of the most dedicated and enthusiastic devs you could possibly ask for. Excellent communication with the backers and community - I mean, you could feel the joy radiating out of every word in the updates - and very quick to address problems and suggestions. Nate, you've done marvelously!			"

												Ever try selling something online only to have a potential buyer haggle over price after meeting to transact so you slam the door in their face and decide you won't settle for a penny less than what you have decided this junked up old cell phone is worth? Don't buy this game on sale, pay full price instead because for once forget about money and other things that cause stress in your life and allow this little hooker to bring you one last true feeling of joy and satisfaction before you lock yourself in your car with a hose redirecting the exhaust into the cabin. Weirdly specific? Don't turn around, but I'm standing right behind you.Cosmochoria (I pronounce it out loud a few different ways every time I read it, koz-moke-reeah, kosmo-koreeah, koss-mok-♥♥♥♥♥eah, koz-mo-fuggiteeah) is a wonderfully delightful little game. Most of the game is unexplained and as you play, you discover the quaint fun of jumping, flying, and silly jokes about assgas that you suddenly realize is alarmingly absent from anything you've played lately. You'll lose a huge chunk of time mercilessly extinguishing the lives of an alien horde who were probably just trying to provide for a family they were pressured into raising by social conditioning they never thought to question until it was too late. There's also fun to be found uncovering or learning how everything works and unlocking items that alter the game mechanics. Go ahead though, don't find out on your own, look all the stuff up; you're an iconoclast or at least consider yourself one and really like the nice feeling you reward yourself with believing that to be true.  Why not set yourself up for dissatisfaction? You do it in many other aspects of your life. Weirdly specific? That's because your own desire is the cause of your suffering, as desire is the root cause of all suffering.After carefully considering exactly how far never really taking the advice of others seriously has gotten you in life, should you decide to ignore caution and engage in the ego-driven, hedonistic pleasures in life as I have, and you purchase and play this game, I have one bit of advice: Don't bother tearing your hair our trying to figure out where to buy upgrades, you'll go bald. You have to first play the game and then die in order to access this screen. I spent five hours on my first play without dying and let me tell you I was practically screeching like a banshee after visiting every planet three times without finding a vendor. The loading screen tip I was given was ""Buy a new weapon right away. Seriously. What are you waiting for?"" My inner monologue became narrated by the Earl of Lemongrab, just a long, high-pitched wail of how unexemplorable (wait, is that it?) this experience was, and it was then that I struggled to recall who it had been narrated by previously. Was it me, I wondered? Why do I talk to myself in my head at all? Weirdly specific? Why do you talk to yourself in your head anyway?If you read this, honestly ask yourself what you actually get from reading reviews subjective to another's experiences? The experience of consciousness, you know the feeling of being in driver's seat of your own little meat bag, the same feeling responsible for the illusion of ""free will"", this experience is entirely subjective. The experience of consciousness seems to universally fool people into thinking they are in charge over the course of events in their lives rather than being  instinctive, highly reactionary creatures, who's decisions are entirely based on that subjective experience; an experience that yields a range of reaction based on cultural programming, brain chemistry, and genetically predisposed personality traits. Maybe it's possible to read a review written by a family member whom you understand very well and can somewhat accurately apply the same context to their phrasing, but a person who has lived a substantially different life from you will apply entirely different context to the same phrasing. In order to effectively transplant an idea from another's mind to yours without erroneously interpreting their true meaning, you must have established a common framework of knowledge and understand without assumption what context they may be applying. But hey, you don't buy any of that... do you? You believe in free will. You believe you can alter your circumstances through rational decision making. Somehow, you are unencumbered by the emotional biases built up in others that accumulate over a lifetime. Somehow, you are not impaired by the impressive array of illogical heuristics that rob others of neutral observance, perceiving without judging, and feeling/thinking without attachment. Okay great, do something that betrays a typically conditioned response.  Do something for someone else completely selflessly without the self-driven motivator of being able to feel good about your altruistic behaviour; buy the game at full price rather than wishlisting it and buying it on sale. Oh, and please, start clicking ""no"" next to ""Did you find this review helpful?"" when the review is absolutely useless without the missing context found only in another's subjective experience. Maybe then we can actually use the reviews to inform our opinions on whether to purchase, rather than using this space for jokes phrased like ♥♥♥♥♥ greentext posts, with the same unoriginal ending, time and time again, ""10/10 would <do slightly quirky thing in game> again"".

												One of the best indie games I've played so far.It isn't too difficult to get started, there's a great story and the gameplay itself is just great!One thing that I really like about the game is that you can configure your game at any time, and just play the game in a different play; adding more challenges or making the game slightly easier.Decent music, interesting art, requires skill... Cool.I've had a blast playing this game. I definately recommend getting it! :)			"

Product received for free
First of all, yes I did receive this product for freeI am a sucker for rogue-lite games, and this game grabbed my attention from the very moment I found it. Cosmochoria is an amazing game for passing the time; the lovely soundtrack and beautiful artstyle work together wonderfully to create an experience that many will enjoy. Though I have not 'finished' the game yet I think that I have experienced enough of it to deliver an educated and informed opinion on the game, and the features of the game.The game, though it can be challenging at times, is a lovely experience and can be relaxing to many. You fly through space landing on, and settling planets with plant life in order to get further in the game. You can build towers and shields on these planets to fend of monsters that attack you whilst you play, and you can discover rare items that unlock items for you to use in other playthroughs of the game. Pros  Engaging artstyle Amazing soundtrack Great way to waste time Enticing gameplay Acheivements Controller support Community friendly dev Cons  Game can sometimes be repetitive (I recommend playing in smaller sessions so not to wear the game out) Bosses can be hard to prepare for Overall, I would give this game a strong 8/10  "

								I believe this is one of the most perfect games created. Though I wish there was more to do after you restore 50 planets, I am hopeful that more will be added till after that (especially since I stopped getting the dimensional stones). I love the hilarious dialogue. Though I wish there was at least some hints as to how to get other costumes! I only have the ninja costume right now and I am desperate to get more! And it is a nice touch that if I were to get bored with the standard gameplay that I could make it more difficult with the right artifacts (right now I am actually challenging myself by using the illumina sword... I miss my shotgun T-T). Overall, an amazing game and one that I would recommend for anyone!			"

								I played this game on Sunday at PAX East 2015, and it was really enjoyable! The base gameplay is like a synthesis of tower defense and a side-scrolling roguelike shooter, and it is complemented nicely by a really compelling setting. And, being a roguelike, the game just begs you to explore it and discover the little mysteries and treasures that are tucked away within it. Because of that, and because of the general depth of the rest of the content, the game feels really fleshed out. When I spoke with the dev, he was also intent on building further upon the existing content, so this game is just going to keep getting better with time. Highly recommend it for all these reasons and more (like the really awesome music)!			"

Early Access Review
								I'm really enjoying the game so far! I love the learn-as-you-go feel. It took me only two short games to figure out the majority of what I needed to do, and then I just had fun with it. The game really drew me in, and I spent over two hours playing it the first time--couldn't stop playing til I'd beaten the first boss and advanced somewhat substantially.Great graphics and sound effects. Also, the game runs well on my laptop from 2009 that's just above the minimum specs for this game. Slow to start (around 20 seconds with nothing happening), but I assume that that's probably my machine and/or that this will get fixed, as it's still in early access. The game ran smoothly, even on my 5+ year old laptop, for over two hours straight. No crashes, lagging, etc. even though it's still in early access.My main critique at the moment is that even though I was playing with my Xbox 360 controller (fully supported, great controls), the commands on the screen kept telling me to push keyboard S...would be helpful to map controls to avoid confusion.I'll update this review with more thoughts once I've played the game a bit more.

Early Access Review
								[Updated Review for new content added]My initial impressions of this game were very positive. My current impressions of this game: still positive! This is a stylized, fun game, with very smooth controls, great artstyle, atmospheric music, ambiguous goals (I mean that in a positive way), and just enough addictive quality to keep you playing. The premise of this game is simple; relaxing, even. But what you'll soon fine is that this game can get quite hectic at times, making you go from ""ahh"" to ""AHH!"".This game is still in development, and with the newest update, you can tell it's further along the lines of ""completion"" than ""development"". There are lots of great components to this game, that at first felt a bit disjointed, but as it's getting updated, everything is blending in together nicely. So I'm confident that the finished product will feel as cohesive as the dev intends.So what is Cosmochoria? At a glance, you're a naked astronaut, terraforming - gliding from planet to planet, planting seeds and buildings and mapping out a very foreign universe. Baddies show up to stop you and you blast them away with your laser. However, as the game progresses, as you unlock more, you'll find that there's more depth to it than that. You're mapping out a universe. Dodging enemies while terraforming. And there's always the sense of an impending boss fight coming up. You have to balance offense and defensive tactics, depending on the situation. Sometimes enemies show up steadily, sometimes not at all, sometimes 4 pop up with no warning. Balancing that with what to build in that moment (plant or structure) keeps things fresh.Overall, the game is fun as is, but coming together nicely!My only minor gripes with the game, as of now, are that some of the power ups, feel a tad underpowered. And that sometimes getting hit will power down your gun.[Sugggestions]The power down aspect: I still think this is too punishing. Especially if it happens in the midst of a boss fight. I would suggest that the power down is timed to like... 30 seconds or so. This way, you're still punished for being hit, but you can also adapt to it. It makes fights more situational, and not as dire. Like, if I accidentally get powered down twice and a boss shows up, I know that I don't have much of a chance. However, if that happens but it's timed... I know I cna just run and hide for a bit or focus on dodging attacks and play more defensively until I'm back to full strength. It could add another layer to combat.Compass/Map: I LOVE this very necessary addition. Although I suspect it was here, pre-update, and I just never thought to click the compass in order to open the map. For familiar design sake, maybe the map can benefit from being in the top right corner - only because that's where it is almost every game, and I'm just used to glancing up/right to get my bearings. But this is a very very loose suggestion because I got used to it almost immediatelyMapping: This is another loose suggestion. The ability to name planets, or mark certain ones, would be beneficial. That way you can look at the map and get your bearings, or if you have to escape from danger you know to go to planet X because you remember putting turrets down there and such. It could really flesh out the universe map mechanic, and help the player feel like they're contributing more to really discovering/fixing this universe.Save feature: sometimes games go on longer than I'd like, but I'm really satisfied with my progress and don't want to suicide. On the other hand... that could be defeating the purpose behind the game concept. So take this suggestion lightly too.			"

								This game is really good.ProsGood artCool gameplay; plant seeds, destroy aliens, revive planets for a bonus by planting enough seeds, then boss fight ever so often, then fly to another planet and start reviving.Consome bosses will feel to easy.I can't really say anything else negative, but that was just there to have something in con. the boss difficulty won't matter too much.I don't really do many proper pro/con reviews. This game is greatI don't really do star ratings either. I'll say loosely 8-10/10 because if I said 10 that might be unfairly high but this game so splendid I have to say it could very well be close to 10.Buy it now probably.			"

												I don't know why people like this game.Is just awful. graphicly it is okay but i don't really like itIs seem to be a tower defense but most the tower seem useless.You will have to take down enemies yourself. Plant enough the planet until it healthy and go another.The control in space is pretty harsh unresponsive andif you run out of gas you can't move and hope a planet attract you or you die outside the system.The boss seem pretty unfair pass toward planet and follow in space restless and the poor control make them hard to dodge.(That review is rated on late experience i may check if anything change.)(maybe i need unlock some nice upgrade)I rather play astroid and missile command Terraria maybe Risk of rain.

								Well... Straight out of the gate Cosmochoria is a giant helping of old school nostalgia.  A great combination of old space shooters like asteroids mixed with some Mario / Donkey Kong style platforming.  Sprinkle in a little ""roguelike"" procedural generation and some persistant upgrades and you've barely begun to scratch the surface of this game.This is one of the most fully featured and playable early access titles I've purchased so far... Just to be clear you are not buying some 25% finished barely playable POS.  At this point you are spending your hard earned money for a fully featured, mostly complete, extremely addictive and enjoyable game that is still growing and expanding. Even though Cosmochoria may seem like an evil Frankenstein of retro game mechanics the pure creativity, original art style and epic soundtrack take mechanics you already know and love and make them feel ""new"" again.  Cosmochoria is a breath of fresh air that shouldn't be missed if you consider yourself a fan of video games.10/10			"

												The permadeath thing might make it seem hard but I actually find it to be relaxing, it's set up in such a way that it's good for short bursts which is great if you're like me and have the world's most pathetic attention span.My only complaint is that exiting the game counts as dying so there is no way to save a world and come back to it later which creates all the usual problems. I can understand losing your save when you die but losing it just from exiting the game is ridiculous and has never really been a good thing. Life interferes with games all the time and losing a map where you manage to find an egg and have a chance of finding its home planet just because your ride came early or your kids broke the lamp again is unacceptable.That hasn't stopped me from playing it though (although I do like to ensure I have the time to put into a potentially long run) and I highly recommend it for people who'd like something zen-like yet involved to play while talking on skype or trying to cure insomnia.

												Addicted to this game. :DThe game looks so cute. <3You start on a planet, on which you have to plant seeds. But there are also animals/enemies attacking you, lots of them. When you planted enough seeds, the planet is filled with love! :D So you go on to the next one. The orange/red thingies that the enemies drop when you kill them, makes it possible to buy updates when starting a new game. You keep previous upgrades and also orange/red thingies. You don't keep the planets and other stuff you found. When you die, you have to search for planets and make planets happy again.I myself was sometime not even trying to plant seeds, because I had the feeling that at that moment, killing enemies was  better at that point, because it would give me more orange/red thingies to buy updates.You could also look on your map, to see where you are. Beware that outside the map, you will die. Also, when you're out of fuel, it's not possible to move anymore (you have to wait some time before it recharges). So it's best to only use fuel to change directions, that means you fly very slow, but, who cares? :)There are also things you find on planets, that you could deliver on another planet. I find this hard, because I was never able to discover all planets in one game. So.. It's hard to get the planet where you get something you have to deliver, and the planet where you have to deliver it, at the same time.. But still liking it.You have to find out yourself how everything works. At the moment, I have 4,4 hours played. But I still don't know what everything is. Especially the messages you see on some planets. But I'm gonna discover more and it will be fun!Also, I defeated one boss, but I'm not able to defeat the second, that would be hard to find out how to do that, too. It's so powerful! Haha, but I'll get there, I hope.I totally recommend this super cute game! <3			"

												Bleh, I got this game for under a buck, wish I had never installed it.  At first glance, it looks cool, with some fun little mechanics, and an interesting idea behind it, but it's very poorly executed... It's not even close to being a complete game, and is a beta version, at best.The entire gameplay mechanic is landing on planets, holding the down key to plant a seed, which takes several seconds (even with upgrades... UGH), while pausing fairly often to shoot completely unchallenging enemies.  Repeat this several times per planet, and you get rewarded with a worthless item that you can carry (only one at a time) that has to be set down to build anything else... there is absolutley no reason you can't do both, it slows the game down even more.  After you plant many seeds, dependent on the planet's size, you ""heal"" it, and a chest pops up with either resources, or thost stupid do nothing items.You can blunder your way around space discovering new worlds, which is awful, because the minimap icon is very difficult to read, so often your course takes you off the map, and into the sun (certain death), and the map doesn't even display planet locations, just your x,y coordinates on a blank map... it's nearly worthless, and is, hands down, the worst map function I've ever seen in a game, which is made worse by the fact that you SORELY need it to navigate featureless open space.  Eventually you'll stumble upon less than a handful of worlds with important characters on them, such as the bearded man, who will tell you what those  awful items you've been lugging around one by one do (most SUCK), and if you're lucky, you'll find some teleporters that will enable you to bounce around between planets you've rescued, although there's literally no reason to ever return to them.The game starts off REALLY slow, since your planting speed is ridiculously slow, your defautl weapon atrocious, and your jetpack fuel limited... one of the least fun things I've ever encountered in a video game is having to blast off into space completely blind, then run out of jetpack fuel, and be left drifting aimlessly until it refills itself ever so slowly.  Oh ,you collect shards or crystals or whatever from killing enemies, and can use them to pay for outrageously priced upgrades between game sessions, none of which even come close to lowering the monotony of gameplay.  I don't care if I could instantly colonize the planets, instantly find worlds, or hell, even had a minimap that served any function at all... this game still wouldn't be fun, even if you removed all the hinderances to gameplay, because there are no fun aspects to be enjoyed... GD, it REALLY is this bad, and it's a shame the cute graphics and nearly free price caused me to squander hours of my life only to be disappointed. Yeah, so this game has some potential, and is cute-looking, but I doubt it will ever be expanded into anything I would ever recommend to a friend... it's just a hair above what a high school student would make in an into to programming class.This is one of the most cruel reviews I've ever written, but I believe it to be fair.  Despite the game being almost free, I wish I had never encountered it, because the few hours I wasted playing it, hoping it would become enjoyable were for naught, and honestly, I'd have much preferred to have cleaned my room instead; at least there would have been a reward for the time wasted.  I'm so turned off by how poorly almost every concept was implemented, it would take a miracle for me to ever look at this game again, even with a massive update.  If this were posted on Newgrounds, you'd play it for 2 minutes, then never, ever try it again.  Frankly, I will never try another game from this team ever again, either.			"

								Best game, ever. Became my life <3The graphics are basic and fun, as an Indie game, guys trust me on this one, it's great and a lot of fun,The gameplay is kinda strategic when it comes to boss fights, when you get nervous, you start jetting away from the things that try to kill you, and then you run out of fuel, guess what? You get sunburnt.			"

												Cosmochoria, although early access, is off to a promising start with a clever concept of terraforming barren worlds as a sole astronaut flying through open space.  The game combines simple arcade action with an effective strategy element that combines to create engrossing gameplay.  On my first session with Cosmochoria I played for 35 minutes, which is quite rare for an arcade title and even rarer when you consider the early access.  The steam overlay and controller are both supported, making this game a good purchase for anyone who enjoys and arcade title with a little extra strategic edge.I nominated this game for the WHOOOOAAA Dude Steam Award.

												The whole game is almost focused on reviving planets by planting on them then fighting this giant boss worm guy, after you die you can upgrade your items. That's the game. You can jet pack between planets but that's not fun at all after you realize it's just annoying to control. You can fight enemies but they're just annoying repeats. You can plant special plants that do different things but they always cost too much to use nor do they feel like they help that much. It just feels like a chore that you do until you die just so you can do it again, except this time you are now cleaing the dishes instead of vacumming the house and you are slightly faster at it.TL;DR - It's disappointing. It's fun for about 3 hours and that's it. It's one of those indie games that are kinda fun but fall short.			"

OVERVIEWCosmochoria is a science-fiction rogue-like game of exploration from indie developer Nate Schmold.In Cosmochoria, you play a pants-less little pink guy in a space helmet, spawning on an unnamed planet in the middle of space. Your task is to plant flags to claim planets and grow plants on them, thus restoring them to vitality. As you claim planets, fight off aggressive aliens, meet NPCs, and find weird items, the game slowly reveals its story and your goals.GraphicsGraphics are simple, but elegant. The game is two-dimensional, played from a side-on view, with colourful pixel graphics used throughout, and a unique stylised look.Your character is a chubby little naked person in a space helmet, and he (?) is almost as big as some planets. Planet appearance is variable, with planets ranging from those that look like the leftovers over some sort of nuclear war to some that bear ancient ruins reminiscent of Mayan civilisation. Even the larger planets are only an order of magnitude larger than the main character.The camera keeps the character in the centre of the screen and, by default, rotates loosely around as you orbit planets (by running around their surface). It works well, although it takes some getting used to as you reorient yourself, especially when jetting off into space.Special effects are simple, but nicely done.There are only very limited graphics options related to window mode and screen resolution.SoundSound effects are good: well-normalised and used appropriately. The jetpack sound has a nice feel to it, and the pea shooter weapon sounds suitably weak.Music is good, only occurring in certain situations, such as when a boss draws near. I haven't worked out what causes little bursts of background music in other situations, but the sporadic nature of them adds to the overall weirdness of the game.There are no voices.GameplayThe game is very easy to play, but hard to master. You have only five controls: move/rotate left and right, jump/jetpack, crouch/pick up/use, and shoot.When on a planet, gravity keeps you on the ground, so your most common actions become running around the planet either clockwise or anticlockwise, shooting enemies, and crouching to plant or build. Once you've restored a planet, you can leap in the air and use your jetpack to escape orbit, then navigate your way to another planet to start all over again.Control in space is fun, with your escape vector governing your path across the galaxy, and only limited fuel in your jetpack to correct it. Planets all have localised gravity fields, though, which helps to bring you back to ground when you find another one.Making your job harder are a horde of nasty aliens of various types, who chase and shoot at you, and a 'boss' enemy that gets activated after every few planets that you restore. These become difficult fast, but keep at it and you'll soon learn some tricks to make defeating them easier.The galaxy is procedurally generated each game, including planet placement and size, and NPC and artefact placement. The game includes three resources: seeds, bricks, and some sort of currency. Seeds are only collected and used in the current game. Bricks and currency are carried over to your next game when you die. Bricks can be collected and used to build towers and other structures on planets. Currency can be used to buy permanent upgrades in the shop before you start a new game. It's a good system. As you play not only do you start to understand and get better at the game, but your character also becomes more powerful and able to do what's required of him.The game also has a strange collection of unique artefacts that can be collected. Deliver these to the correct NPCs and you end up with another artefact that allows you to change the universe in some way. Again, this is activated or deactivated before each game. Some are beneficial, like a NPC and boss detector, whereas others are downright dangerous, such as one that makes enemies more aggressive.Unfortunately, though, Cosmochoria either doesn't like new hardware and software (i7, GTX1070, 32 GB RAM, Windows 10), or it's become more buggy since its early days. I first played it about a year ago, then put it away until it was 'finished'. It's in full release now, and is much more fleshed out, but it also seems less stable. A few times an hour the game will just freeze for about 20 seconds, then resume again as if nothing happened; there's no stuttering or other performance-related issues, it just seems to decide to have a rest. I've also had occasional crashes to desktop, with the game giving no warning and no error, and just dropping back to Windows. This has invariably happened while I've been doing very well, too, so it's immensely frustrating.PROS AND CONSPros:+ Creative universe and plot, with unique interactions and a good sense of humour+ Rogue-like aspects are well thought out+ Addictive and very replayable+ Pleasant pixel graphics used to great effect+ Nice music and sound+ Creative Steam AchievementsCons:- Buggy: in-game freezing and occasional CTDs- No save system (which would be almost forgivable if it weren't for the CTDs)CONCLUSIONCosmochoria is a unique rogue-like game of space exploration. If you can appreciate solid design, good pixel graphics, and a sense of humour, then you should definitely take a look. It's just a shame about the crashing.7/10 (-1 for stability issues)			"

Early Access Review
								Its hard for me to even describe this game, because I haven't come across something with so much originality and charm in a long time. You take the role of a naked astronaut who spreads his seeds throughout the universe, while defending against aliens, asteroids, bosses, etc... Sounds crazy, I highly recommend watching the trailer to understand. The game more or less falls in the arcade/action genre but has a unlock/upgrade system and option to play as a twin stick shooter. It is a blast and I'm surprised that an early access game could already be so much fun and 100% playable. Bravo and major kudos to the one dude who made this game. Cosmochoria is simply awesome and I can't wait to play it again!			"

You play a naked cosmonaut spreading your seed across the galaxy..... wait a minute that sounded a bit rude so let me start again. You play a naked cosmonaut and your job is to unravel mysterys of the universe whilst populating space bodies, rocks and planets. You do this by planting seeds, fending off aliens and allowing nature to turn the planet into a living breathing world. - it's totally awesome!I enjoyed the game so much it even inspired me to write an MP3!

												After putting lots of time into this game it would likely be more enjoyable, but as is it is too slow, and not very entertaining. Second look: I replayed the game after there has been many updates. I mostly stand by what I've said. This is a bit more than a flash game, the developer is definitley DEVELOPING the game. The map is lovely, it's nice to see what places have already been settled. Also I'd say this game certainly has more merit as a casual game. Slowly progressing through the improvement system and going through the story, which admittedly I haven't had the patience to do, is likely a rewarding experience. I'd like to elaborate on the VERY SLOW part. RPG elements, and taking a long time to progress because you need upgrades is fine, I just don't prefer those sort of games. My problem with this game is building. Sitting still and planting for a couple seconds is just frusteratingly slow. If we could drop the seeds and watch them auto grow that would be much better. I recognize that may cause planets to get inhabited too quickly, but you could make the gameplay more interesting by growing plants being vulnerable to bullets. I will keep trying this game as it is updates. I like the how the developer treats his community, and I'd really like to change this reccomendation to a yes. ~Zee			"

												It was a really clever, fun little game about spreading life and defending planets with plenty of upgrades too.But on the 15th of October 2015, the developers thought it'd be a good idea to make minuture PewDiePie enemies. Completely out of fit from the rest of the game, essentially mucking it up, and giving us no way to turn it off.So due to that, I'm going to have to stop recommending this once good game due to the idiocy of adding something which has NOTHING to do with any aspect of the game. It's like adding Ghandi or Hitler as a playable character just because they're also famous the world over. Completely stupid idea.			"

								Pretty OK but limited. You spend a LOT of time doing the same thing. And when you die you go back to square one, which is great, but then it takes a lot of grinding to get back to where you were and the upgrades come very slowly at first. So basically a good 85% of the game is grinding your way back to a point where you can start doing fun stuff... every single play.			"

												Cosmochoria is a fascinating game, between its gameplay and story.Its gameplay is relatively traditional, but in a fashion that is both charming and functional. Its story is complex and spontaneous, which allows for theories and speculation to take place. Consequently, the game can be thought provoking as well as interesting. Going back to the gameplay, its traditional style makes it rather addictive. The combination between the story and addictive gameplay shapes a rather interesting game.Economically, the game is well priced, according to the content, and the graphics match the atmosphere of the game.A fine piece of platformer gaming.

												The game is hilarious, albeit short if you're only going for a single playthrough (7.3 hours for me, but replayability is high) - that said, it's priced very fairly for the gameplay. Love the artstyle, love the humor, the mechanics are very fun, and the devs seem to be active and attentive to player comments.Looking at the preview video, it looks like a lot has been added since I beat the game - might actually fire it up and try again soon.

												This game is a lot of fun. It has a simple game mechanism, is easy to understand and it can be played for a few minutes only.

The gameplay is to jet around find a planet, grow plants and defend yourself against enemies and make the galaxy green again, one planet at a time.My recommendation, buy it, it is worth it :)			"

												This is the most fun game i have in my steam library. I just can't have enough. The game isn't super difficult, but it isn't super easy as well. Lots of replayability all throughout the game. As you progress through this game there are mulrtiple events which reveal a great soryline to the player. Bossed can be challeneging if you haven't built up your character enough. The map is procedurally generated so you never play in the same universe twice. All in all, a fantastic little indie game that I believe everyone should buy a copy of.			"

												I bought this game because I watched PewDiePie play it. When I went to the store, I foud that it was also on sale so I thought, why not? At first it's a little difficult what with the spinning concept (which can be disabled to my delight) and trying to multitask killing enemies and reviving planets. As I played more, I got used to it and caught myself losing track of time. Some may find it boring and difficult but I find it pretty linear and, in some ways, a little relaxing? Maybe it's just me. But I like this game. Yeah.			"

												A pleasant, difficult to categorize, little game. Is it an exploration game? Yes. Is it a shooter game? Yes. Is it a funny game, with a little naked cartoon man? Why, yes, it is.It almost seems like the innovative execution and simple premise of this game would make it a one-time indie game, easily tossed aside when mastered. The trouble is... This game isn't easy to master. At every turn, it is designed to throw a curve ball your way. As of writing this, I've sunk almost five hours into it and not gotten bored at all. There are many things to unlock, many things to explore, and many tasks to complete. I would be willing to bet I could sink another ten hours into it, easily. For a game I spent $3 on during a steam sale? I'll take it. Hell, I'll throw my money at it.I'll summarize with this: is Cosmochoria going to win the 'OMG BEST GAME EVER!!! STOP MAKING VIDEO GAMES, THIS IS IT, WE'RE DONE"" award? No, probably not. But are you going to have a ton of fun while playing it? Yes. Easily. And, honestly, that's all that matters here.			"

Posted: October 19, 2015
												[Edit: Added a little more below about the weapons]This is a good game, a very good game.  It's also hard to describe exactly what *type* of game Cosmochoria is.  I hesitate to call it a platformer or a shooter, though both of those are well represented in its design.  I suppose the best thing to do is watch some gameplay videos and see if it's to your liking.  Personally, I've found it strangely addictive.  It has a very charming and very colorful art style, and the background music is quite nice, as well.The author means it when he says that it is a game of exploration because that includes many of the mechanics as well.  There are ample hints dropped in-game, like what to do with the strange objects you sometimes find, so do pay attention.  One object in the game, the Moai statue, took me until just recently to learn just what it does, and that is only because the game now hints/tells you.  I bought Cosmochoria some time ago on Humble Bundle and the earlier builds gave no clue (that I could find) as to its purpose.  Now that I know what it does, it is *very* useful.One adjective that goes a long way towards explaining this game is ""strange"".  The concept, the enemies, the dialogue... all very strange.  But in a good way.  Apparently, there was some drama recently concerning the introduction of a Pewdiepie enemy sprite into the game.  I guess some people felt it didn't belong or it broke the immersion.  Really?  There are plenty of bizarre enemies and nods to other games (Purple Tentacle, anyone?), and *that* is what some people choose to complain about?The game's difficulty progression is, on the whole, fairly balanced.  The action certainly gets more hectic as you progress, and larger planets have more room which generally means more enemies, too.  Fighting a boss on a large planet can make the battle a lot harder than it might otherwise be as your attention will be divided amongst numerous enemies.The artifacts that you can unlock during gameplay are pretty neat, as well, because they aren't all good.  Some will give you advantages to make the game easier while others won't.  This is a good mechanic since it means that, later on, you have the option of increasing the difficulty of the game (in some cases, significantly) if you like.The only major fault I have with the game is actually the weapons.  You start with a wimpy pea shooter, so upgrading your gun ASAP is all but required.  In my game, all of the guns, except for the final two which are still locked, cost 1500.  Now, so far, each gun *has* been very different from the others.  The problem is that, with the exception of the second gun, the blaster, the remaining weapons make the game much more difficult.  They might not be automatic, which means *lots* of clicking, or they might be amazingly weak until leveled up a few times.  So far, each time I buy a new weapon, I always end up switching back to the blaster rather quickly.Edit (Oct. 19): I've now tried all of guns except for the two that are locked, and I think I can lessen my criticism a little.  The shotgun is actually usable.  It doesn't fire nearly as rapidly as the blaster, but it has a very wide spread and decent power.  I also forgot to mention the sniper gun.  I'm not sure how long I could remain alive while using it, but it is extremely powerful.  The downside, however, is a very slow refire rate and no spread.  Bullet spread is actually rather important because the surface of planets curves, in general, away from your player meaning that hitting enemies on the surface can often be difficult.  One solution is to jump up to give yourself a better line of sight, but if you're using a gun with slow reload, you'd better have a good aim.  For guns that spray out lots of bullets, like the blaster, hitting surface enemies is a lot easier.One other issue could be, I suppose, the difficulty of the boss enemies.  The first few dragon-like bosses come across as extremely difficult, especially as you encounter them at the beginning of the game.  Expect to die... probably a few times.  That said, it's not *that* bad.  You're going to die plenty of times anyway, and each time you can spend your accumulated crystals for better stats and weapons.Anyhow, get this game.  It's a lot of fun and I think you'll find yourself spending a lot more time playing it than you might plan on.			"

												A mix of rogue-lite platform, exploration, collecting, and a bit of tower defense set in a very charming visual style.  The game starts fairly slow.  You explore and it shifts into more of a platformer.   while you claim more planets you are forced to a tower-defense genre of play style as your enemies become exponentialy more aggresive.  Even with the frustration of UI latency and chaotic progression, i definitely recommend this game.  with lots of replay value, difficulty progression and playstyle otions, this game is worth the money.

All the while, aliens and dragons spawn and try to ruin your day. Go along and plant tree all over the place restoring the natural order only armed with a single gun.But don't let the gun throw you off, its far from an action game. This is probably more along the lines of casual with mild pressure.  I think it is meant to be challenge and impossible to do on your first time playing. You will have to sink a few hours into it before you make it really far, but believe me, you won't regret it.It's got subtle jokes to lighten the mood and the art is cartoony and playful. The achievements are written in lymerick which is another bonus that has a sinister taste of challenging the riddle solving for the regular achievement hunter. But don't worry, they are TOO hard if you are looking for them. The physics for the planets and space are nice and subtle but make a lot of sense; you have to escape the gravity of the planet and using the jetpack causes exponential accerlation. (I don't know why but I really like that part... it's cool)Oo! and the best part is the upgrades! the more and more you play and longer you survive, the more upgrades you can afford and rewards you can collect. Buy new guns, upgrade your suit and add perks to your character all with a currency you collect from beating the ever-loving crap out of your enemies. Line you score up against fellow players and discover the mysterious bearded owner of the 8-ball in Cosmochoria. I can't wait to see this game grow!			"

												A pleasant, difficult to categorize, little game. Is it an exploration game? Yes. Is it a shooter game? Yes. Is it a funny game, with a little naked cartoon man? Why, yes, it is.It almost seems like the innovative execution and simple premise of this game would make it a one-time indie game, easily tossed aside when mastered. The trouble is... This game isn't easy to master. At every turn, it is designed to throw a curve ball your way. As of writing this, I've sunk almost five hours into it and not gotten bored at all. There are many things to unlock, many things to explore, and many tasks to complete. I would be willing to bet I could sink another ten hours into it, easily. For a game I spent $3 on during a steam sale? I'll take it. Hell, I'll throw my money at it.I'll summarize with this: is Cosmochoria going to win the 'OMG BEST GAME EVER!!! STOP MAKING VIDEO GAMES, THIS IS IT, WE'RE DONE"" award? No, probably not. But are you going to have a ton of fun while playing it? Yes. Easily. And, honestly, that's all that matters here.			"

												Game is very difficult the more planets you add, but you have help in the form of towers and bases. Planets and plants are all very colorful. Developer is very responsive and friendlyProvides hours of fun but you can't exactly save your progress. Defeat bosses every few levels gets you a new checkpoint for the number of fully developed planets (though they will be full of monsters and without any towers or bases) "

												This game is so much fun!Definitely gonna be my favourite game of the year!It's a different, charming gaming experience each time you play (and I've put in a few hours already!) The bosses are devilishly hard but I keep coming back for more. It's a really immersive experience when you are in the midst of planting these weird and beautiful plants while frenetically warding off nasty critters and UFOs as the incredible atmospheric synth soundtrack washes over you. The storyline is suitably funny and mysterious, what is the cataclysm and who is the bearded one and what is the function of those crazy portal things? I guess I'll be staying up past my bedtime again tonight to find out.			"

Early Access Review
								Great simplistic game that offers more depth than I thought it would have and its still in alpha. It also has light goofy humor which is appreciated. Heres a short breakdown:- ""Asteroids"" like controls- Main goal atm is to plant seeds on planets to convert them and collect objects for NPCs-Each planet you convert you get a chest that randomly has money, seeds, and ther useful items-Also when you convert a planet it can heal you a certain amount depending on its size-Boss enemys appear every now and then and get sstronger- Universe scales with planting progression so harder enemies and enemy frequency increases with every planet you convert.-You obtain money from killing enemies and structures to spend outside the game and upgrade your character.-It would be cool to upgrade in the pause screen not when you eventually die, but thats not needed.-Once you die you start off with a new universe so every playthrough offers a different atmosphere.I cant wait for more content and what this dev has up thier sleeve. Great job so far. "

												This game is deceptively simple.  It seems almost relaxing at first and quickly scales up to a frantic, mad dash, fire fight, which you will be properly proud of yourself for surviving.  The difficulty is perfectly balanced so that you don't get too frustrated yet you never feel the game handed you anything.  I've enjoyed my time with it and plan on playing much more.			"

												[Edit: Added a little more below about the weapons]This is a good game, a very good game.  It's also hard to describe exactly what *type* of game Cosmochoria is.  I hesitate to call it a platformer or a shooter, though both of those are well represented in its design.  I suppose the best thing to do is watch some gameplay videos and see if it's to your liking.  Personally, I've found it strangely addictive.  It has a very charming and very colorful art style, and the background music is quite nice, as well.The author means it when he says that it is a game of exploration because that includes many of the mechanics as well.  There are ample hints dropped in-game, like what to do with the strange objects you sometimes find, so do pay attention.  One object in the game, the Moai statue, took me until just recently to learn just what it does, and that is only because the game now hints/tells you.  I bought Cosmochoria some time ago on Humble Bundle and the earlier builds gave no clue (that I could find) as to its purpose.  Now that I know what it does, it is *very* useful.One adjective that goes a long way towards explaining this game is ""strange"".  The concept, the enemies, the dialogue... all very strange.  But in a good way.  Apparently, there was some drama recently concerning the introduction of a Pewdiepie enemy sprite into the game.  I guess some people felt it didn't belong or it broke the immersion.  Really?  There are plenty of bizarre enemies and nods to other games (Purple Tentacle, anyone?), and *that* is what some people choose to complain about?The game's difficulty progression is, on the whole, fairly balanced.  The action certainly gets more hectic as you progress, and larger planets have more room which generally means more enemies, too.  Fighting a boss on a large planet can make the battle a lot harder than it might otherwise be as your attention will be divided amongst numerous enemies.The artifacts that you can unlock during gameplay are pretty neat, as well, because they aren't all good.  Some will give you advantages to make the game easier while others won't.  This is a good mechanic since it means that, later on, you have the option of increasing the difficulty of the game (in some cases, significantly) if you like.The only major fault I have with the game is actually the weapons.  You start with a wimpy pea shooter, so upgrading your gun ASAP is all but required.  In my game, all of the guns, except for the final two which are still locked, cost 1500.  Now, so far, each gun *has* been very different from the others.  The problem is that, with the exception of the second gun, the blaster, the remaining weapons make the game much more difficult.  They might not be automatic, which means *lots* of clicking, or they might be amazingly weak until leveled up a few times.  So far, each time I buy a new weapon, I always end up switching back to the blaster rather quickly.Edit (Oct. 19): I've now tried all of guns except for the two that are locked, and I think I can lessen my criticism a little.  The shotgun is actually usable.  It doesn't fire nearly as rapidly as the blaster, but it has a very wide spread and decent power.  I also forgot to mention the sniper gun.  I'm not sure how long I could remain alive while using it, but it is extremely powerful.  The downside, however, is a very slow refire rate and no spread.  Bullet spread is actually rather important because the surface of planets curves, in general, away from your player meaning that hitting enemies on the surface can often be difficult.  One solution is to jump up to give yourself a better line of sight, but if you're using a gun with slow reload, you'd better have a good aim.  For guns that spray out lots of bullets, like the blaster, hitting surface enemies is a lot easier.One other issue could be, I suppose, the difficulty of the boss enemies.  The first few dragon-like bosses come across as extremely difficult, especially as you encounter them at the beginning of the game.  Expect to die... probably a few times.  That said, it's not *that* bad.  You're going to die plenty of times anyway, and each time you can spend your accumulated crystals for better stats and weapons.Anyhow, get this game.  It's a lot of fun and I think you'll find yourself spending a lot more time playing it than you might plan on.			"

								This is a delightful game, that does quite a bit right, for an early access title it is incredibly polished. The gameplay and mechanics on show all work, and in its current state it could be a full game in itself, and shows great promise of what is to come.This is the state I wish more EA games were in when they hit.First of all, and the thing that made me purchase this, is the art style, which is downright lovely. Its bright, poppy, full of character and consistent aross the entire game. A lot of hard work has gone into this presentation, from the menus through to the variety of plants and alien critters. It really looks great, very charming. I really love the way the planets change colours as you rejuvenate them, as if theyve been terraformed.The controls are simple(WASD and two buttons, fire/jump), but hard to master, and for a while you will be reeling round in zero-g with the jetpack. That said, there is a real nice weight, and the controls are very tight.The AI is likewise simple, but diverse in type. You will often be juggling several enemy types, whilst trying to reform a planet, it can get hectic.Then you have tower defense thrown in there, to start with I hardly ever built towers, then the game opened up and started to make sense, and you realise they are really necessary as you progress.The planets are basically your health packs/defense/offense. You cant take on the later enemies without flitting around using planets youve set up.This all comes together very naturally as you progress, with a lot of 'ahhh!' moments. Nothing needs to be blatantly pointed out, because the design has been well thought out. Buy this game. Do it now!			"

												The game has a steep learning curve.  Once you figure out how to play and what you are doing, things get easier.  It is still very repetitive.  Having said all of that, it is still enjoyable.  My advice to new players:-- You will die a lot.  Buy your upgrades at the start screen between deaths.-- As soon as you can, buy the map.  It is invaluable since this game does not have and auto-mapping feature.-- Once you have the map, use it to aim when travelling between planets.  That way you are not floating aimlessly between planets.  It will cut down on your travel time and give you more time for collecting resources.-- Use the Easter Island monoliths.  After you build up 20+ seeds, build one on each planet as you start to tarraform it.  It helps a lot with the creeps that constantly spawn.-- When you find the portals, use them in boss fights.  They are especially usefull against the space dragons.  It will let you instantly get way from them.  When they find you again, shoot them as much as you can, then portal away again.-- While you are using the portals, build pyramids on your portal planets to reinforce them.			"

												This game is amazing.  The graphics are fantastic and I love the gameplay.  Progressing in the game feels super satisfying, too.  The one downside that I've found is there is no real way to save your game to come back to it later(you have to finish in one big run.)  Besides that the game is worth it.			"

												A mix of rogue-lite platform, exploration, collecting, and a bit of tower defense set in a very charming visual style.  The game starts fairly slow.  You explore and it shifts into more of a platformer.   while you claim more planets you are forced to a tower-defense genre of play style as your enemies become exponentialy more aggresive.  Even with the frustration of UI latency and chaotic progression, i definitely recommend this game.  with lots of replay value, difficulty progression and playstyle otions, this game is worth the money.

												It's so exciting to see this game finally out after backing it a year ago on Kickstarter. The work and passion that went into this gem is clearly apparent from even the first minutes of gameplay. The art, the music, the atmosphere, they all work together to create a truly special experience. :)			"

												This game is a lot of fun.  I am currently at 15 hours and have completed it sorta...i won't spoil why i say sorta.  There is easily another 20+ hours of trying to collect all the different unlockables.  The game is great fun.  The graphics are simple and yet very appealing and cohesive.  The object of the game.  You start out in a universe of 50 planets.  You start on one planet and your object is to bring the planey back to life by planting and growing plants.  You have a jet pack, so you can jet around and even leave the current planet and go to another planet.  You are free to go where you want in the universe.  If you try and leave the universe you will burn up.  Also, you only have so much jetpack juice so try and conserve it while out in space and not on a planet or you could be heading towards the areas where you burn up with no way out.  There are also monsters to avoid.  while you are planting and roaming the universe, there are bad guys trying to hurt you.  You need to kill them first. They will come when you are planting or building.  Yes building, there are buildings that do specific things.  Kinda like a tower defense on different planets.  You have to collect relics in order to build so you can't just go and build everything or you won't have anything left to build.  Also you can only fit so much on a given planet (planets come in different sizes) so build wisely.  Once you have planted enough trees the planet will be renewed and form an atmosphere.  There are also bosses.  The bosses are not too varied.  I think the first three bosses are basically the same thing but they shoot different types of bullets.  Still fun and challenging.  There are lots of upgrades you can purchase.  More recently with the upgrades, the game is pretty easy for the most part.  That is ok because the final boss is very difficult.  Overall the game is a lot of fun and very addicting.  I highly recommend playing it.			"

												This game is fantastic so far. I am only about half way through (I think) and I absolutely love it.  The concept is great, the mechanics are great, the music is BANGING, everything about this game is just wonderful.  I haven't been interested in games lately but this one has brough me back to remember what I love about video games.  The discovery, the mystery, and god damn that music is intense.			"

												This game is adorable, fun, interesting, and i'm sure it will prove addicting! However developers, _please_ make the keyboard configurable. As it is, the game is only truly accessible (playable) by mainly right-handed players, or left-handers with some difficulty. Either way, it requires that one have full hand and finger mobility, and since i have a disabilty of my hands it will be impossible to play beyond the easiest tasks. A game of this type can be easily made playable by more (most) people if the keys can be self-configured - all i need for instance is to change the 'S action' button to right-ctrl or even numpad 0, and jump to right-shift, or perhaps /. i will anxiously and hopefully await an upgrade to allow key configurations, and after that it just may be one of my favorite games! Until then, i can't fully play or recommend it.Thank you! Keep up the great work!!			"

 First thoughts Starting off its a fun rogue-like game, that takes place in space where you try to revive dead planets by planting and growing seeds. As you try to revive these planets aliens will attack and shoot at you, and the each time you kill a boss you will get new harder enemies. Each time you kill an enemy you get currency called cyrstals, you can buy permanent upgrades after each game with cystals to help you to progress further.  Pros FunNice upgrading systemEasy to learnYou can play for hoursRewardingNice conceptLooks nice Cons You get items and it gives you no description at allCan be very repetitive Final Thoughts All in all this is a very fun and addicting game with a unique health system and an interesting twist to rogue-like games. 10/10 its definitely worth the money.

												I love this game. The style is cute (not in a girly way), the controls are simple and easy to use, and there are many different strategies to try. The difficulty is easy to adjust through activating various handicaps, or hindrances, that you collect throughout the game while others can be purchased with game currency in the start menu. Better handicaps can only be found with a higher difficulty activated giving the game great replay value (especially if you are a completest). I've beaten the game 12 times so far and still have yet to find all the items.I really hope there are plans for a sequel. I would get it in a heartbeat. "

												Great game! So cute and simple to start, but ramps up steadily until you fail. Then you start over with a few more perks from your past attempt. Music, graphics, and physics are so great that each attempt is a joy. Clever little objectives and collectibles throughout too. This is a game you pick up to play for a few minutes and have to pull yourself away from hours later. :)			"

												This game is a lot of fun. It seems more like a mobile game, and I bought mine on sale, and I don't think you should buy it full price. It would make a fun little gift (if it's on sale), or if you just happen to like calming games, with nice music.			"
