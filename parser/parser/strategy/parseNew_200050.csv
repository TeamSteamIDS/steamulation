												Can't recommend, because: - does not provide more than the Harpoon II from 1998- tons of bugs: A) Game can go out of memory on 8GB ramB) Game can slow down on 8GB ram, quad core i5, GTX970 on latest driversC) Huge amount of game mechanic bugs: 1) Submarines can fire missiles from deep dive (400meters and lower) 2) These missiles can travel up to 4-6 times of their real range, and successfully destroy a 5th generation fighter which is manouvering4) Air to Air missiles ignore range, engagement zones, air drag, stealth... I have seen AIM120D hitting a Su35 after flying 1000+km with the speed of 4M on 100m height.5) Neither torpedos nor ASM (Air to Surface Missile) can hit surfaced subs6) Passive sonar mechanics utterly broken: it seems just a random dice roll if it detects a sub or nor. 7) Damage mechanics are broken too: nope, most frigates cannot survive a hit from a Harpoon II missile. Nope, it can really happen that an aircraft survives a missile hit. 8) Aircraft rearm/refuel timers are mad. Landed aircraft can be checked, reloaded, refueled in 30 minutes (no matter how  big the fire is on the base), while fueled aircraft rearming always 1 hour. 9) You cannot outmanouver anything. It will hit or not hit and seemingly it was decided at launch time. 10) Aircraft fuel range is madness as well... F22 and F35s sometimes can fly from Canada to the UK with afterburner. Air refueling sometimes garbled, aircraft get seemingly too much fuel. ( 11) Comparing Harpoon II. In Harpoon II you could read about the missiles, ordanances - these are also crap in this game ofc - ships, aircraft. Read the story, the capabilties etc... Nothing similar could I found in Naval War: Artic Circle...)So overall, the game is a bait and a big personal disappointment.			"

												This game is not for everyone, but for those who have a serious interest in military equipment, tactics, and strategy (especially sea and air based), this is more than worth the £15, and unlike its competitors, it has multiplayer.Notice that most of the """"helpful"""" negative reviews were from people with less than 4 hours gameplay. They are gamers, not simmers, who picked the sim up for novelty, not love of military simulation.(The ones from people with more gameplay is usually due to PC issues)NOTE: This game requires a powerful CPU! There is a lot of simulation going on, and if your PC is weak, you will experience freezes. The system requirements listed above are way too low.What I Like> Intuitive, easy to use interface> Great solid simulation of ships, submarines, aircraft, missiles, and weapons> Scenario editor and workshop integration> Potential for modding (I'm working on one)> Smooth realtime, not interval based like competitors> Functional multiplayer> Most, if not all, bugs were fixed in patchesWhat I Don't Like> Limited range of units> The map is only Northern Europe, Greenland, and Eastern Canada. Nothing south of Belgium> In some places, realism is sacrificed for balance> Limited default scenarios (but there are lots on Steam workshop)What I Don't Mind, But Other People Might not Like> Rare freezing (temporary, usually 15 seconds or so) when lots of units being simulated> There is no savegame function (GET OVER IT PEOPLE. JUST GET OVER IT!)> 3D graphics are simplistic (it's a £15 SIM, not a flashy £50 game!)Conclusion: DO NOT BUY unless you love modern miltiary strategy/tactics. It's niche as niche can be, NOT for everyone, but if you're an armchair admiral, you'll love NWAC.			"

												I really thought the game was actually pretty good. Unfortunately that was on the rare occasion that I could finish an hour of play without it freezing, stuttering or crashing to the desktop... and I have a high end machine. I wouldn't mind having the no ""in game save feature"" as strategy games feel more challenging without that.... but then again... it would be nice if I could pick up where I left off after the game crashed over and over. It has potential, but I can't recommend it until they fix these issues.			"

												Would be a good naval sim simliar to harpoon, except for the small fact there is a crash bug in the game code. Basically, even if you are running one of the most powerful rigs in the northern hemisphere, i seriously doubt you can play later missions without frequent crashes. Couple that with NO save feature, wasted potential is all I can say Naval War Arctic Circle is.			"

												Reminiscent of the Harpoon naval simulation games of old, this is a top product in that vein, being able to control any number of units available in NATO and Russian arsenals in several different Third World War scenarios, with accurate representation of weapon range, ship and aircraft range, and performance.

												Pretty awful. As a naval officer who likes to dabble in naval sims like JFC and Dangerous Waters, I thought this looked like a promising entry in the genre, but was sorely disappointed. Lacks depth, providing a very shallow depiction of certain capabilities and warfare areas, and it's buggy and slow as hell. After its failed release, Paradox tried a few fixes, then just gave up on it despite unresolved problems documented by frustrated customers. Concordantly, I think this game is not worth the $20 price currently listed here on Steam.			"

												I would call NWAC a good game. That's a good choice, when you're  looking for the way to get to know basics of naval warfare. The main rival, Command Modern Air naval Operations (CMANO), is a truly hardcore game and Jane's Fleet Command (JFC) may look annoyingly outdated. The interface is clear and player-friendly. The missions are interesting. The graphic is good for a wargame: ship models are nice, but transient conditions (missile starts, hits, aircraft launches etc.) are made roughly. So I highly recommend it for beginners.The drawback is that after having played it for some time, or looking through the literature, you'll find out how unrealistic it is. Mostly it's connected with simplified radio-electronic warfare & aspects issues. You'll literally feel you're bound to these limitations. That's why I prefer CMANO now.The game has some performance issues, though I had not experienced any bugs during the gameplay, that are worth to be mentioned. The fact is that when lots of aircraft, anti-ships and anti-air missiles are in the air (I'm talking about 100-200+ object), the time compression lost it's effect, and the game tends to slow down and run close to the real-time. However, there's a video-guide on performance optimization (haven't used it) and you may meet similar  difficulties in CMANO too.			"

												Great idea, poorly developed. Way too short. Now, shortness is okay, but only if the game is of good enough quality to trick you into thinking it's longer. This game does not have that degree of quality. I'm lucky if I can run the last mission without the time compression randomly spazzing out and leaving me permanently locked at 1:60 time compression no matter what I click.			"

												Great game.  Do not listen to the haters who played this in the past.  It has now been fixed. Pros:  I have played the tutorials which make the game very easy to play.  I have not found any bugs so far.  This game is very like Jane's Fleet Command, but a little more modern.  I am now playing one of the campaigns and have also played one of the single missions.  There are loads of missions/campaigns on Steam and elsewhere.  The AI is very good and the game can be quite tense, though a bit slow for any younger gamers who love lots of action and shooting, etc.  This is a sedate game for older players like me who are middle-aged and no longer have the reactions of the younger generation (no problem, as most Admirals are middle aged!?).  The Steam version has obviously been heavily patched and seems to work a dream.  I have no problem with gameplay/framerates, but I must admit I have a fairly high-end machine and can run it on full graphics without any problem so far.  Far from being quirky, the interface is a doddle to use, despite reports from other reviewers.Cons: The graphics are rubbish!  They are better than Fleet Command (which I own, so they should be now after all these years) and a bit better than Dangerous Waters (which I also own).  However, unlike Dangerous Waters, though the models look much better, the ships do not even have wakes behind them!?  The use of towed array sonar and dipping sonar is not animated!!!  I have yet to see a ship moving up and down with the waves.  The music is mind-bendingly monotonous as well as being completely inappropriate - it is gentle guitar music during a battle which involves Billions of Dollars/Pounds and countless lives!!!!!Conclusion:  I bought the game for less than £4.00/$7.00.  Well worth it during the 'Lunar' sale.  It is now £15.00/$19.00.  Worth it, probably not.  However, for Naval Strategy fans, this is still a gem and a bit more updated than Dangerous Waters/Fleet Command whose graphics are atrocious.  I will definetely be buying the DLC and downloading the many workshop missions/campaigns			"

												Attempt at doing a revised Harpoon suffers from implementation problems, no longer supported by devs- No save/load system in the middle of battles- When there are more than a few combat units and missile swarms, the game slows like molasses (even with an fairly advanced gaming rig)- Unrealistic bits that go beyond simplification. For example, altitude has no effect on top speed/fuel consumption, so F35's can fly mach 2 at wavetop level across the Atlantic...on afterburners.The source code was released a few years ago, so there's some hope that the modders might tweak this. There is a big niche to fill for something between an arcade game and a mega-simulation like Command: Northern Inferno. But this game is not it.			"

												Its a modern naval strategy war game. Its a quite good game - you get to control subs, ships, helicopters and a variety of planes in modern day scenarios via a tactical interface but you can see whats going on via a sort of tv picture which does get you in on the action. The game is fairly complex its got fairly deep gameplay with a few differnet systems to learn, but its still fun for light gamers like myself.The downsides are the lack of a save facility during the missions themselves, which can been quite long at times, and because of the complexity of the calcs this game runs slowly if a lot is going on which restricts the engagements to small skirmishes (also required due to the lack of a save facility). If it wasnt for the above I am sure this game would have been expanded by various moders dramatically into an all out war game with massive campaigns made available.This game is a strategy game where you launch various assets to react to threats, you see them pop up on the radar and most of the game is played on a map. Graphics are fairly spartan and it is surprising that it slows down so much but I guess its lack of programming efficiency more than anything because this game is by a small dev.Overall its enjoyable playing out the skirmishes, there arent that many modern naval games around like this - really just this and Dangerous Waters and this game is more immediate and better looking (just) than DW but not as deep. However its also not going to develop any more, the devs have forgotten about it, and the lack of graphics, saving and speed makes it of limited commodity so bear that in mind.Other possibilities are Dangerous Waters, 688i, Silent Hunter 3, Atlantic Fleet, Cold Waters.

												I don't know. This is my first naval combat strategy game, so I really don't know what it's like compared to others. But as what many others have said, this game feels like wasted potential; the devs stopped supporting this game months after release. If they only worked on this game a little more, it could have been a great game. First of all, the unfitting and repetitive music. Also, the graphics could be better, given that this a 2012 game. And there's no voice acting. Seriously? That would have really brought immersion to the game. And the biggest gripe of all, no in-game save feature. I know of no other strategy game out there that doesn't have it.But it is a bad game? No, I never said that. It's just wasted potential. Try the demo and see if you'll like it. I'd recommend this game when it's on sale.			"

												This game has plenty of things wrong with it that make it frustratingly unplayable. First off, no save game. You heard that right, no saving. You give general orders to your units, but the AI is to dumb to handle tactics properly. You can have a group of planes attack another group of planes, but they will only fire missiles once. If those missiles don't destroy the enemy, the planes won't attack again. If you give orders to a group of aircraft to attack all enemy targets, it will only attack the first one it sees. If you have two groups of enemy aircraft coming at you, it won't fire on the second group. There are many items like this. There are also bugs. I had the game tracking/observing a friendly aircraft. That aircraft was shot down and I saw that in the 3D window, but the plane remained on the 2D map and was even selected/highlighted when I clicked on another unit.I purchased this game on sale even after having read a few reviews that complained of some problems. I figured that they could be tollerated and played through. I was wrong. This game is broken in its present form (the source code has been released, so there is some hope) and not worth purchasing at any cost.			"

												I wanted this to be a great game, small developer with the freedom to get this right, I wanted it to be as good as Harpoon was over a quarter century ago. It was nothing like it. I simply can not recommend this - buggy, not engaging and at times you really wonder what the hell the developers were trying to achieve (sorry if you read this).			"

												Consider this an attempt at my first naval wargame..it will introduce you to concepts such as Emcon,detection ranges and other basic concepts..but thats it..it doesn`t use them well ,it has no concept of ESM the nearest the game gets is you have been detected by an active sensor..without showing you the direction that sensor is,the weapons simulation is almost hilariously bad..Amraams and Adder missiles both magically becoming fire and forget and capable of their max range no matter what altitude or speed they are launched,Missiles spawning in mid air magically being missed by 6 jets with active sensors and IRST sensors active.As a simplistic intro or arcade sim its fine as a proper naval sim..its a joke for something more accurate go look up the older janes fleet command,Harpoon or CMANO			"

												I have to admit having played pretty much every Sea Wargame under the sun from the paper version of Harpoon through to Command : Modern Air and Naval I have a bit of a soft spot for this. It is not the prettiest under the sun but its good enough. The interface is a little sluggish and aircraft have the tendency not to do what they are meant to but it seems to balance out well the desire for an accurate simulation and the desire for fun. If I want an all singing all dancing simulation where I can set up any scenario under the sun and run it to see what happens then C:MAN is the clear winner but you don't get the feel from that of blazing ships and harpoons slamming into tankers. For a quick fix then NW:AC meets that.No one has yet come up with the perfect game. C:MAN would come close if it had more 3D models and had an AI capable of handling itself from a cold start with just named resources. The best for years was Harpoon Classic with Jutland being the state of the art for 3D but some of the other games by people like NWS showed what could be done with minimal graphics. What is needed is someone to join everything up.Anyway, I digress. As a naval warfare nut I like this as a gentle way to spend the odd few hours.			"

												If you are lloking for a sim... this is not the game for you.It does not simulate things as ""radar horizon"", the missile defense systems work on whim and I am not sure it has an ASW module or it works like just radar with shorter ranges...And you cannot save the game.Played hundreds of hours of all Harpoons, was hoping for something lighter but its simply dumber.A big dissapointment.

												Harpoon is the father of this genre and Naval war is following its fathers steps. It is a well known fact that there is a serious gap in the market regarding this genre. Naval war tries to fill this gap but it is just a fine example of poor implementation.			"
