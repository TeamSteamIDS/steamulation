												TL;DR? You want to avoid DRM? Buy it elsewhere. You just want to play? Buy SoaSE: Rebellion. Don't buy this.I have owned Sins of a Solar Empire in one form or another since it started. I have played epic offline games on and off for a while. I love this game. I hate jumping through hoops.You need a Stardock Account to activate the product. Even if you've owned it for years. If I had one, it was years ago and bleeped if I can remember any of that information. I've got a perfectly good product key that I won't use because I refuse to spread my email like candy on Halloween.If you don't care about DRM, don't buy Trinity. Buy Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion. It has all Trinity content and more. If you do care about DRM, buy it using a service that is explicitly DRM-free. Don't buy it here.			"

												I'll break down Trinity like this.Sins (original) is an incredible game worth 60 dollars easily.The ""Entrenchment"" expansion adds starbases which are cool and pretty big game changers as well as mines. Probably worth no more than 10 dollars.The ""Diplomacy"" DLC adds envoy and envoy bonuses which are very nice to have but difficult to obtain and pointless except in big matches. I would say that's worth no more than 5.  If you're here because of a steam sale. I'd say grab Trinity so you can enjoy the full content (Or even better Sins of the Solar Empire :Rebellion) but if you're really tight for cash and the DLC are looking pricy. Just grab the original.			"

												This is a fantastic game, but you should buy Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion instead. It's more expensive but includes a ton more content and updated graphics throughout.For clarity, Trinity is the base game and two major expansions, Entrenchment and Diplomacy. Rebellion is all of that, updated graphics and multiplayer, plus a ton more content.If you're feeling cheap, this is still a solid game, but you won't be disappointed with Rebellion.			"

												""Lets waste six hours of our life""That's the line we usually say between myself and my friends before we start up any Co-Op matches that involve more than 4 people or AI. Even on fastest speed, this game is elegant. It's slow, sweeping and magnificent in it's design and application of it's game systems. Do you enjoy the cinematic quality of two massive battleships going full broadside on one-another while fighters zip around and frigates queue up into firing lines? To zoom in and watch individual firing ports off your prized seige ship pound that enemy planet into submission? This game has it.Do you prefer to see things as if on a tactical map, removed and distant, like a commander moving his pieces against his foe in a war room? Do you like the challege of managing your territories and loyalties, sending hundreds of ships against your foe from multiple fronts? This game has it.Macro-managing is a must. In smaller doses, in smaller matches this game can be plaid in a very micro-intensive fashion, as you'll typically only ever fight one fleet at a time. Though the real gorgeous splendor of this game is when you find yourself beset from multiple sides, having to give up territory cause your fleet is elsewhere on the defense, and counter-attacking to send foes scurrying back to their precious resources. This game is very unforgiving in larger matches, and on higher difficulties. AI opponents, according to their presets and difficulty ratings, will use different tactics and strategies to win.The graphics of this game are gorgeous for it's time and scale. You can zoom out to a galaxy level and see small icons representing fleets and planets, or you can zoom in to watch ships phase-jump towards disant worlds. It even has cinematic modes for those of you who like to make films! I recommend this game, though only to those who are infatuated with real time strategy games.			"

												The sort-of rts that really does a good job at the meta but is a bit disappointing at the micro. It's tons of fun warping ships from planet to planet, conquering as you go. Setting up trade routes, upgrading ships and planets and battling off other empires is where the meat of this game really is. Yet, the actual battles feel a bit stale to me; it's all simply based on lining up a bunch of ships and watching them slowly laser each other to death. The combat's certainly not awful, but I'd have to say that there are other games-- such as Homeworld-- that do it much better. Still, though, it's great fun.			"

												In my opinion this is the best version of this game.I say this because each ""new game"" is just a tiny expansion of the original product. in simple terms, they have been charging 60 bucks for the the same old game over and over and over.I don't support rebellion for this exact reason.the only reason you shold buy ANY of these games is if you plan on using one of the many mods available.as this is an older version, mods for this title will be more likely to be finished and less likely to be broken by random updates.other notes about this gamethe AI is predictable to a fault and prone to spam building odd single ship type fleets.increased difficulty simply lets the AI cheat more openly.because of a fault in the AI's detection, ""standoff"" situations will quickly develop for turtle players.all 3 factions are painfuly balanced. ( so much so, that it begs the question "" why bother with tech trees and multiple ship types?"")did I mention theres only 3 factions? (keep in mind this is the technically the 3rd installment at this point )diplomancy is kinda pointless as AI's will perma team with eathother in seemingly random ways.VERY PRONE TO MEMORY BASED CRASHES. anything larger than a medium map with 6 players is asking for trouble.sum of things.decent, but lazy.buy if on sale and have nothing better to waste your money on.moddb is a decent place to find mods of this game.as a final note. note that rebellion is the newer title, but for many reasons I refuse to give it any postive comments.in a nut shell, rebellion is trinity with a smattering of mod insipred patches. charging $60 at launch was an insult to the fans and the modders who made the game great.

												I got this game for $1.00 on the recent Humble Bundle sale and even then this game was just an added bonus to why i really donated a dollar which was for the game Space Hulk: Acension. So really I am not too much at a loss for the experience I have had with this DRM ridden trash heap.I am sure the game is good and I wish I could actually review it. But sadly I cannot because you need to register your game with some sort of Stardock account. Apparently my email has already been used for this service even though I have never even heard of this company until I got this game.So if you can make an account and register it then great you can play! However I have heard from others even if you can make an account the DRM still wont registrate your valid key so congratulations you just spent $29.99 on essentially just 24 lines and 4 dashes!!It's companies that do ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t DRM practices like this that promotes piracy.

												A wonderfully addictive and generally underrated RTS. One of the best timesink-type RTSes I have played - In college I used to set aside weekends to play this thing in 16-hour marathon games (before I owned it on steam; I've probably hit 300 hours overall). One of those games where you can be out-of-your-mind busy, constantly clicking things and changing mental tracks, for hours on end, and if you ever have a moment to breathe, something is probably going very wrong.I like this version of the game better than the newer Rebellion version - Capital ships are more powerful and important here, and the balance feels better.

For Starters...Let me preface by saying that I purchased this game back in 2012 during a steam sale. I installed it along with a few other titles, played for a few hours and uninstalled it within a few days. A couple years later I decided to give it another shot and removed it within hours of installing it. In fact, actually googled online to see if there was a way to delete the game from my steam library because I swore the damn game would never fool me into installing it again. It was extremely frustrating trying to learn all of the complex technical nuances to managing and controlling your space fleet, especially when I just downloaded a bunch of other titles and this one has a learning curve, and expects you to actually play through all four of the dense tutorials to gain the minimum level of proficiency to play the game. And of course, I clicked through them without retaining anything, immediately started a skirmish, couldn't control my empire, was confused about what was going on, got obliterated, cursed the game and uninstalled...Out of profound bordom and a sudden inexplicable itch for large scale depthy 4x, seeing I had this game in my library and admitting I never gave it a fair shake, I installed this game again. I read the other reviews of it and actually watched some Lets-Plays first and rightly concluded that I should give this game an earnest attempt, and I\'m very glad I did.ExperienceGameplayIf my preface wasn't verbose enough, let me spell it out now: This game is complex. There are a lot of moving parts and this an RTS so you will have to manage your resource production, fleet building and war tactics at the same time, but because it is a near seamlessly integrated 4x, you will also need to consider commerce, political allegiance, alliances, colonization and world building simultaneously. Don't get me wrong, it's not unbearable and that is a testament to the game design, but it can easily be overwhelming if you aren't trying to learn the game. Also, because there are so many moving parts, the pace of the game is therefore turned downnnn to make it manageable. There are controls to turn it up to 2, 4, 6 and 8 times the normal speed when you're playing AI, thankfully, as sometimes you really have nothing to do except wait for taxes to roll in or for your fleet to be built.I've played games from S.M. Civ and Total War, two turn based games that integrate a lot of elements. Civ has no RTS and total war seems to break the game up into separate modes of play. Sins-Trinity manages to take all (or most of) the elements from these games and blend them in real time, so that you're building fleets and managing diplomatic relations without waiting on other players. This means that you have to multi-task and keep track of your separate enterprises simultaneously, and without the convenience of your enemies waiting on you. Compared to a straight RTS it is much slower, however. Each planet or asteroid you take on is like a micro-base that needs to be built up and more microbases lead to greater technology advancement as well as board control.A 1v1 AI skirmish can last anywhere from 45mins to a couple hours. A2v2v2v2 skirmish can last several hours. This could be a plus or minus depending on how you like to play. It was a plus for me. I thoroughly enjoy developing enemies and maybe a nemisis throughout the game and slowly but violently encrouching/sabatouring/assaulting my way through them over the course of hours.There is no campain mode. Didn't bother me at all as I think most RTS campains are just skirmishes with limited supplies/tech trees and blurbs of dialogue. Jes gimme da skirmishTech trees are interesting, and even though there are only 3 factions to play as, there are some very interesting playstyles and tactics. I won\'t talk too much about this as I feel like I'm only scratching the surface, but suffice to say I am approaching the triple digit hours mark and I feel like I'm only scratching the surface.It is also worth noting that there is an active modding community for this game. I haven\'t gotten into it yet.Graphics, Music and SoundLets be real, this game is kind of old. It has aged well but the models aren't exactly awe inspiring. It is actually sometimes tricky to even zoom in correctly to get a magnifying glass on your ships, so most of the times your fleet and structures will be a 2d blip on your screen. The particle effects aren't spectacular, but at least they don't bog down your machine. Where this game makes its money is in the solar system maps. You might have to use your imagination a bit, which I actually kind of like. The planets, bustling with life and activity and the constructs you place in its orbit, the amorphous gaseous nebulas (which actualre are gorgeous), stars and planets in the distant backgrounds... there is something sweetly satisfying and oddly profound about the execution here, about the sense of space and scale. You feel power in the worlds you conquer, colonize and build up. There is an extraordinarily seemless and fluid zoom function in the game as well, from full on solarsystem right down to your tiniest trade ships, and you will use it a lot as you manage your empire. If you can immerse yourself in it, I think its fantastic. If you need more powerful graphics than I don't think this is your ticket. I would invite anyone to look at the screenshots I've personally posted or anyone else, and I'd like to remind you when you do that building a fleet can be difficult. So while these pics may not have a lot of context for you and maybe just look like a patterned collection of polygonal shapes, to the people who built them they are a statement of our economic and technological success.Music feels kind of lackluster. I actually mute it and play radiohead or the Stellaris OST in the back. It's not crap but not memorable at all either.Voice overs are fine at first and then get repetitive. Its funny because when you\'re mass producing one unit type and you have your game speed turned up, you will hear the same sound byte over and over again. The diplomacy voice overs are downright irritating, tho. Every time they offer a mission or you succeed or don\'t it is the same voice message, and over a game that takes several hours it can be exhaustingFun FactorThe last thing I'll include is a word about how much fun it is. This game is the sort that's not particularly easy to learn and much more difficult to master. If you enjoy games that demand attention, observant learning and epic imaginations than I think you might enjoy this game as I do. The combat takes place on epic scales, it can be incredibly nuanced and technical depending on how in depth you want to get, and I think that it speaks volumes to it's balance and staying power that the SoSE subreddit is still very active after several years of its release, as is the modding community. All in all, if you can swallow some of the detractors than I think this game is loaded with hours and hours and hours of rich entertainment, wins, failures and memorable conflicts.VerdictIf this is on sale - Buy it, I love it but I wish I had gotten RebellionIf you\'re into the space empire building genre, I say get it or perhapse wait until SoSE: Rebellion goes on saleIf you\'re not particularly into the genre - this is an interesting blend between RTS and 4x, so it will be paced somewhere in between. It is older, and though it is unique enough to warrant its own playthrough for its own consideration, there is a plethora of games that could fall into that category. The graphics and presentation in general is dated. If you can deal with these things than this is a wonderfully entertaining release.			"

												Even though the game is purchased with a key to activate it on Steam, you ALSO need to create a Stardock account to even run the game the first time.  If the Stardock was required to use the multi-player aspect through their systems, that would be acceptable, but we can't even launch the game for the first time without this extra account!  DRM upon DRM is VERY lame, and I won't tolerate it.			"

												This is space based RTS on an interplanetary scale. No two games are alike and I get my butt kicked as often as I win. Maybe that makes me a noob but I love it. I played Sins on my friends computer for years and finally got it on steam when the full game with xpacs went on sale. I am a real fan of the build and combat systems. The AI is pretty challenging, and I like that I can interact with it as if it were a player as far as trading, and offering missions and stuff like that. It's certainly not the greatest game I've ever played, or even the best RTS, but it does have good replay value, and that's important.			"

												New Review 12/24/2015Okay so I decided to give it another go. Discovered game is just bugged. Sometimes the AI doesn't build or is very delayed no matter what difficulty you give the AI. This is what was causing my previous difficulty issues, so it's just a bug. Nah didn't report it in forums since I don't know hw to replicate it. But if you make a game with you and AI's versus AI's, look at yours 5 minutes after you start and you'll sometimes notice one that hasn't built anything but a coloy ship that is sitting in front of the frigate factory. Sometimes you can save and restart the game and it'll work again, sometimes they never come to life. This bug has been frustrating obviously as the old review will explain.I have read how there's a new patch is coming from Stardock I believe and that's pretty cool that they continue to support Sins of a Solar Empire and, I hear, working on a 2.0.In light of these things review will be switching to thumbs up. Also, if you haven't zoomed in to your shops and planets, which I hadn't done for months (treated this more like Master of Orion 1 and 2 than what it is), please make sure you do, you'll see something remakrable and realize the videos were shot in game. Considering how that'll be in the next version is something to look forward to.I still don't like buying anything from Steam but not due to this game, and instead, due to them continuing to sell defunct and no longer developed games, games that it is documented were ruined by their developer (i.e. search ""Starforge""). To me that's a bit of a scam, which is pretty funny in light of the ideological claims of a company bragging about having no boss (http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/people.html).---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Old Review below:Uninstalled.  Again, comp ""normal"" means ""comp vicious"" instead, menu interface not indexed to the right value.  Game used to play fair, indexing working fine, maybe Rebellion's install of Micrsoft C (and some libary for Ironclad) is corrupted and corrupted the whole series now.  But, as the company doesn't care about it, the game is unplayable for me and anyone else who likes to just play single player games with comp allies and enemies, a casual player.  As noted on my unofficial support forum posts for Rebellion, this bug disappears when playing over the network, but the cheating/unfair/vicious comps showing up in your game because some coder was sloppy and a company doesn't care about game quality in single player mode, that persists in single player with Trinity as well.  If you think SSE is like an updated Master of Orion, the game we all wanted in MOO 2, MOO 3, etc, avoid it, it isn't such a game.  Do not buy this unless you only play to play online, it will not give you a fun single player experience, only entirely unpredictable results because of this bug.			"

												Sins of a Solar Empire was an amazing game when it originally came out. A pseudo 4X real-time strategy game set in space with a smooth detailed zoom sounds just like something I would enjoy, and it certainly was. However I burned myself out on the game, and it's starting to show its age. The original game was released in 2008, and the interface really needs to be overhauled along with some more interesting gameplay modes.7½ / 10			"

												This is an addicting, but incredibly rewarding space stategy game. It's a RTS, but the pace gives you time to react and plan. Faster paced than the turn-based classic MOO2, but less hectic than a StarCraft. I also enjoy the capital ships earning experience and leveling up. The star bases are also a great additon. Highly recommended.			"

												It's a low-price, high-depth real-time-strategy game with economic and diplomatic management aspects. While Sins of a Solar Empire primarily focuses on military building and assault (against heavily-fortified planetary defenses), it's in all of the myriad subsystems that the game truly shines; this game is best played with a large group and unlocked teams, causing everyone involved to jockey for position and alliances to rise and fall as people try to find the best way to survive the chaos. Unlike turn-based strategy games with similar diplomatic systems, Sins' realtime nature keeps the action moving at the same steady pace regardless of how many players are involved.That, combined with Sins allowing an unlimited number of players to engage in local-area network play on a single purchased copy, makes the perfect recipe for massive LAN party insanity with Who's the Werewolf style intrigue. Definitely recommended, though personally I found that the depth of the game ran thin after just a few matches.			"

												An epic RTS game that utilises fast expansion mechanics that could give you a tactical weakness, unlike more simply games such as the command and conquer fanchise. There are multiple different types of ships to choose from, which nearly all of them have a direct opposite that they are designed to destroy, meaning you need to learn quickly or be destroyed. However, saying that, the auto AI on targetting is second to none, as it'll target its counterpart and work together with fleets of other ships to burn down individual targets also, without the player micromanaging it. This is important as you probably won't be having a linear fight in 1 planetary orbit, as you could be defending numerous worlds at the same time! This game has the finest parts from titles like haegemonia: legions of iron, in regards to upgrades and planetary combat and then star trek armarda style fights where fleet size means nothing against fleet composition.An example of such epic gameplay is I entered a 1v1 with the AI on normal. The AI discovered pirates, bribed them with a bounty on my head and the pirates sent a massive fleet that took me right back to my capital world for a last  ditch defence. I'd made a capital ship (massive, well armoured and armed!) and a handful of frigates and managed to beat the fleet back. That then resulted in rapid expansion, putting me in a better position than I started with. Its situations like that which you won't find with other games. Highly recommend buying this!			"

												I bought this on Stardock's dead Impulse client and they were kind enough to send me steam keys for this and my other games. Unfortunately I can find zero human players online at this point. It's pretty hard to suggest this for offline play. It seems that the new standalone sequel Rebellion is infinitely more popular, and I've read that it includes all the content found within this game and it's two expansions (Making up Trinity). You're better off just spending double for that game.			"

												It's like Ironclad and Stardock sat down and said: ""Lets make a game Daichin will like a lot"". A nicely balanced RTS is kind of reminiscent of SupCom, but with planets and space ships. Then, it throws in some 4x elements, giving lots of replayability and a bunch of different ways to win. And of course, a single game takes hours. What more could you want? Such a shame Stardock still insist on flogging off the Rebellion standalone for three times what I paid for Trinity YEARS ago.			"

I've thoroughly enjoyed this game! The Lords and me have a multiplay Let's Play with gameplay footage on our Youtube channel, in case you're curious! Rebellion has everything Trinity has, but more. So I recommend getting Rebellion if you're only into multiplayer games or skirmish battles.			"

												5/5 ***** Probably one of my all time favorite games. This is arguable one of the best 4X strategy games ever made. It is a real time game with turn based elements. The pace is very slow and methodical, getting rushed can be easily dealt with or avoided altogether, lol its just not really that viable to rush. If you like space games, and you love the idea of commanding literally hundreds of ships in massive interstellar battles, then this is the game for you. Just a warning though, you will want a high end PC for this. The settings allow it to be toned down for better performance on mid level machines, but it runs and looks its best on a high end rig.

												What a superb game! It's damn hard to quit once you get going.It's much like Master of Orion 2 (which i looove) and any other game in the genre, but it does it well enough to stand out. You have 3 distinct faction, you have your research trees all a little different  for each faction, diplomacy, pirate raids, planets to colonize and ore and crystal to mine.The AI is quite good, both for combat and general faction to faction interaction. Watching your fleet grow in power (gain xp pr captil ship and upgrade them!) and numbers and winning battles is awesome fun.I would of course have more faction then the 3 here. I would also love bigger research trees and have them even more distinct to each faction. But that is just because i love the game and want more, not because it's a bad as it is.I do recommend the game, and that when you play it you rappidly try out bigger solar systems (more planets) as well as push the difficulty up on a few NPC factions. Do also try the Team options!			"

												A great space RTS with lots of different units and factions. It also has multiple big mods that really add on it (Halo mod: Sins of the prophets and a Star wars mod). Multiplayer is great especially if the game drags on for 2 hours (multiplayer games are often short: you either get rushed or you lose all your planets with doomsday weapons). There are lots of tense fights that keep going for 10 minutes with a lot of micro management.The AI is good, there are different AI types (economic/aggresive/defensive/...) that offer a big variety of play styles, put it on random to get the most fun out of it. Increasing difficulty only changes the income variable of the AI (Very hard is like 8 times more resources out of a planet than you would normally get). Having a good chokepoint is the key to victory when playing against harder Ai's.The game gets a bit laggy when you are with 10 players and everyone has 1000+ units but other than that you can run this game on a laptop with a decent cpu.

												I've been with this franchise basically since it came out in 2008. I did the good old ""THIS CASE LOOKS COOL!"" read the back of a PHYSICAL copy  (remember those?) and grabbed it. Then I was convinced to re-buy the trinity. I expected the next Homeworld, or something close.It never arrived.Slow to start, way too big in scope and scale for the Real Time system, and seemingly steep difficulty even on the easier levels, this game did not do it for me, but it might for you, I don't know. On the note of homeworld though, I'd wait on the HD remakes thereof which are all but guaranteed to show up on the steam store, and supposedly due out in april.Modding community does some beautiful stuff though, so if this is at a deep discount and one such mod you encounter tickles your fancy, by all means disregard this assessment and grab it!

												I realize most people love this game. I don't like it at all. I'll preface my review by saying had I known what kind of game this was, I wouldn't have bought it. I was looking for a turn based game that was more complex than the game ""Deadlock"" and less complex than ""Space Empires"". Google told me to try this game. Here are my problems with the game.Everything costs too much money/resources. It seems you just spend hours and hours saving to be able to afford the most basic research. Almost every building requires research and once you finally get that research you'll find that you have no room for the building you need to build because every zone you conquer has a VERY small limit to how many buildings can be built in it. As well the bonuses the techs in the tech tree give are stupidly small for how much they cost. The tech tree is large but I how long I will have to for the resources to spend on research before I can get a ship that isn't complete garbage, apparently it's longer than 4 hours so I am not interested.This game seems like it took the worst parts of Shogun 2, Age of Empires and Starcraft and threw them into a gigantic, boring, confusing game.

												The game is good, but Stardock now have extra registration rules, and they keep launching updates (that basically is the same game with a couple extra ships and tweaks) for FULL PRICE with NO DISCOUNT for owners of previews versions. So do the math, this is the 4th game, each game costs FULL ~$30 bucks, so if you were a fan at the first game and wanted to update, you would have bought 5 full games at ~$150, except each is nothing more than a DLC.And while the game is good, it is cursed with a terrible A.I., so after you ""get it"", you will beat it on the hardest setting and start handcaping yourself just to taste some fun. Multiplayer is not really that good because unless you play on fast-speed and small maps, a game would take hours.I play it from time to time, but I don't think I will be paying up full price to get an extra unit (which will probably be as dumb as the others if A.I. controlled) anytime soon.

												The gameplay and graphics are decent. But there is no story, none at all. Every game you play is a skirmish... I play this on my laptop, semiafk, while playing other games.Tends to get really boring after a while... Buy this when on sale or not at all			"

												What can I say about this game? It could be good, maybe.... The problem here is that the AI in this game gets a massive boost to income from word go, so they have plenty to spend on beefing up their fleet. That fleet you just killed with two flagships in it? There are about three more behind it.There is only one way to play this game: Be Aggressive. Don't like playing that way? Like to take it slow and enjoy yourself? To bad! This game is very quick to beat you into line. There is only one play style.Don't bother going to the community for help either. I think I've run into more people telling me to ""Get Better"" or ""Be More Aggressive"" or, and this takes that cake, ""Stop playing because you suck and this game isn't for you""In summary: Looks nice, has potential. But a steep difficulty curve, unfair AI advantages, and a bad community spoil it.I want to like this game, I really do. The problem is it just doesn't like me. I'll keep playing, trying to find a way to beat the AI when I'm kneecapped from the beginning.			"

												Without a campaign mode this game falls well short of its potential IMO. Without any form of story mode it just becomes a shoot-em-up, which is only interesting until you learn all the ins and outs. Haven't tried out much of the PvP, but since I never have been a fan of that unless co-op... *shrugs*			"

You always know when your allies are being attacked, but by the time it tells you your under attack, you've already lost 2 worlds.

												If you have ever wanted to have a massive Empire that spans a solar system and more atyour finger tips. This game is it. Not only is the build of an empire fun, The massive space battles have never gotten boring with 100's of ships on either side exchanging lazers with fighters and bombers flying back and forth. The expansions Entrentchment and Diplomacy add even more to the game with Starbases and more defensive structures and the ability to offer other factions missions and make pacts to boost an alliance. This game is a must buy for all Strategy lovers.			"

												It felt really good coming back to this game after years of not playing it. This is the kind of game that can get really intense. A typical match will be several hours long. Building a fleet takes a lot of time, and the actual battles and maneuvering takes a lot of time as well. The longer you wait the bigger armies will get, and it isn't that uncommon to have times when another team is of equal power to yourself. The AI are smart, the controls are excellent, and the options menus are nice. I recommend using the map editor program, Galaxy Forge. It is very easy to use and will give you the variety and control over the maps you want. Great game. Any avid strategist should play it.			"

												Live action stratogy Starcraft meets turn based Civilization. While the game lacks a tutorial, it is very easy to get into provided you start on an easy setting and read things prior to clicking on them. The games have the possibility to be endless with countless solar systems and worm holes. You can save and resume at any time. You have many different ways to play and succeed with each race. A very good game that I only wish I had the time to dedicate to a full game with friends. Sadly, I don't have a group to do this yet. 9/10			"

												On a personal note, I wanted to like Trinity, I really did, but I just cant find anything about it that I love enough to continue playing the game. However there was nothing that I can say is inherent bad about the game.Over all the game is solid, graphics are legible and detailed even by todays standards. The strategy is good and simple, build lots of ships, fight your enemy, pay off pirates to not attack you, or pay them to attack someone else. The only problem that I had was that even today, this game, which was released in like 2009, still throttled my 2011 Toshiba Qosmio to the point where the over heating failsafes kicked in and shut my laptop down. I had to elevate my laptop using a couple of small boxes and use a fan to blow air at the underside of it.While I do recommend this game I do so out of the fact that it is a good game, just not one that I found enjoyable enough to want to ever play again.

												Even though I had bough the previous expansions to the original Sins before purchasing this, I couldn't pass it up when I saw Trinity on Sale. Mainly because I wanted a second mobile copy for my laptop. This game is just one that any 4x fan needs to add to their library and will not regret paying full price. This game provides hours of entertainament with just a few simple mouse clicks. Every game is different and no matter how you play, the AI always seems to challenge you. This game will make the hours fly by quickly.			"

												Really great RTS. It's slow, so you don't need to panic, yet it also has enough happening so that you're always doing something and making decisions. It's designed so that you can place orders way into the future.A small game will take four hours.			"

												The best RTS game in the history of the genre so far. Period. Sins easily dwarfs the scale of even Supreme Commander 2, and the alliance system, improved upon in Diplomacy, is the best system I've ever seen in an RTS. I highly recomend this game to any and all lovers of the RTS genre and massive scale, though I suggest having a powerful computer for playing on the larger maps.			"

												It is a great, great day that Stardock has started releasing their games on Steam. I already own the game through Impulse but gladly added it again to my Steam library because the developers deserve every penny. I am by no means gifted at the fine art of RTS or 4X, but I love this game to pieces. The visuals, the combat, and even the lengthy game times keep me coming back to play more. If the game had a campaign mode, I think it would be perfect. Hopefully they'll have that in Rebellion.			"

From 1 on 1s fighting over 1 star system with a limited amount of planets and tactics available to interstellar fights with 5 other superpowers over multiple star systems with a giant fleets, multiple fronts and many diplomacy tools to really make ever game unpredictable, detailed and dynamic.  Making custom star systems is where the real replayability is. If you liked C&C but wanted more, this is for you.			"

												A fun and immersive, yet challenging game. The main purpose of gameplay is to expand and conquer, though there are smaller areas in which you can invest in order to aid in your campaign, such as diplomacy and trade. There is also a research tree, where you can upgrade many aspects of your empires assets, though the choice is yours whether to become either a military or economic powerhouse. Highly recommend. :)			"

Games like Star Wars T.O.R and Battlefront 2 are definetly high up there but theres something amazing and underappreciated about this game.By far the best sci-fi strategy game of all time and at least one of the best RTS games ever. The controls are surprisingly simple, the factions are all unique and the graphics and gameplay are just amazing.For the best experience on this game i seriously recommend you install the mod ""Maelstrom"" which adds many things including three new factions :D			"

												It felt really good coming back to this game after years of not playing it. This is the kind of game that can get really intense. A typical match will be several hours long. Building a fleet takes a lot of time, and the actual battles and maneuvering takes a lot of time as well. The longer you wait the bigger armies will get, and it isn't that uncommon to have times when another team is of equal power to yourself. The AI are smart, the controls are excellent, and the options menus are nice. I recommend using the map editor program, Galaxy Forge. It is very easy to use and will give you the variety and control over the maps you want. Great game. Any avid strategist should play it.			"

												Sins of a Solar Empire is an RTS that operates on a massive scale.  Games like Age of Empires always had silly population caps that were quite low in my opinion, and even though there is a production cap in Sins, it is much, much higher.  This is one feature I applaud about this game, not to mention the diversity of units.  Strategy plays an imporant role too.  You can't just build an large army and throw it at your opponents and hope it works.  I like to use miltiple armies; a main attacking force, a decoy force, and a force for defense.  One would be remiss to leave planets defended with only structures and no units.  Map size range from tiny (barely big enough for 1v1, making initial colonization crucial) to absoluetly huge - 120+ planets.  This is great for giant games with lots of players.  I don't play online, but I have played with friend on local networks, and having the AI control all the other players is great fun too.			"

												Sins of a Solar Empire: Trinity is a very good and high quality RTS game. Its scale is unmatched at the current time. Very similar to Civilization but on a larger and deeper scale. You can play on small systems consisting of 1 star and maybe 15 planets all the way up to 9 star systems with over 100 planets. Only downsides I can think of  are the lack of any kind of Campaign/Story (its a skirmish type game) and the slow starts of matches due to lack of resources and research. The AI in single player skirmishes is no pushover and can easily give you a run for your money if desired.Overall this is a fantastic real time strategy game with a unmatched scale. Easily worth the $20 since it comes with the base game as well as two content expansions.			"

I only have one problem and that is that steam doesn't support the moding comunity on this game. So if you are going to mod it I would suggest going to the stardock website. The sound track is pretty good and it makes you feel like you are controling a space empire in real life. Just letting you know now there is no ground combat its all space ships. So have fun and enjoy conquering the solar system, galaxy, and universe.			"

												The Best Space RTS on the market. It is outstanding how you can go from inches away from your battleship to thousands of lightyears away. It however is best when you get this Trinity so it has all of the improvements and add-ons that make this game more than worthwhile. Prepare to burn a few hours....8.0			"

												HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ SPAAAAAAAAAAAACE!This game rocks my socks. I would call it ""daddy"" anyday in bed.Anyway, this game features lots of pretty visuals especially when you turn on cinematic mode and zoom in. Playing fully zoomed out isn't the prettiest though so the two extremes are kind of strange.Gameplay-wise this is a strange melding of CIV and standard RTS play .You research your tech, manage diplomacy, and upgrade your planets in a way similar to CIV but the combat, construction, and strategies all come from your average RTS. I like this melding and the experience it provides the gamer.Also, games take an average of 2 hours, much shorter than I expected. That is if you play using the recommended maps for small groups of FFA's, 2v2, or 3v3. I can see if you are using one of the massive maps how it could take much longer, but that it something I have yet to experience.Also tutorials are for lamers and casuals. Jump right in and click everything to figure it out.			"

												This game is one of the greatest RTS games I've ever played! But I must warn you It does take a while to get used to and to figure out how to actully play with a good stratagy. I only have one problem and that is that steam doesn't support the moding comunity on this game. So if you are going to mod it I would suggest going to the stardock website. The sound track is pretty good and it makes you feel like you are controling a space empire in real life. Just letting you know now there is no ground combat its all space ships. So have fun and enjoy conquering the solar system, galaxy, and universe.			"

												An excellent space RTS. Matches can last for well over 6 hours on large maps. It does require a certain amount of strategic thought and thinking to play and win, which is exactly what the genre should provoke. Because of its large scale, graphics are not extreme however they still do look decent regardless for those times you take close ups into the battle. Don't expect any single player storylines, there are none; it's pure singleplayer skirmishes and multiplayer. It is well worth buying to play.			"

This game provides hours of entertainament with just a few simple mouse clicks. Every game is different and no matter how you play, the AI always seems to challenge you.

The main purpose of gameplay is to expand and conquer, though there are smaller areas in which you can invest in order to aid in your campaign, such as diplomacy and trade. There is also a research tree, where you can upgrade many aspects of your empires assets, though the choice is yours whether to become either a military or economic powerhouse. Highly recommend. :)			"

												Cannot seem to get this to launch through Steam. Yep, that's about the only niggle I can think of. The lack of single player story driven campaign doesn't bother me too much. If you've ever wanted a game where you could conquer entire solar systems, if not the universe (need a powerful machine for that though!), and revel in delight as you pummel and bombard; intergalactic fleets, asteroid bases and planetary habitations into oblivion, then this is the game for you. It's Galactic Civ in real-time with very intuitive interfaces and fantastic AI. It might not be as fast paced as 'World in Conflict' or 'Command and Conquer', but for a game based in regions spanning entire Solar Systems that's probably a good thing. Don't make the mistake of thinking it's slow paced either.			"

												If you want a rather involved RTS, this is it.  It's very time-consuming to play and it takes a massive amount of system resources, but it's also very rewarding.  The game is fairly balanced and gives the smart strategist many different ways to win.As with any RTS, you have to eviscerate your opponents to win.  But, war is won by opportunity and having an upper hand.  And this game places the ""stragegy"" into the RTS realm more so than any other game I've played.  You can gain an upper hand through vigorous research, bettering your opponents by having better technology.  Or, you can build up an economic empire and become an unrelenting war machine backed by all the money in the universe.  Or, you can cleverly use diplomacy to team up and stomp on your foes.  But beware, because your enemies can do the same.Almost any strategy you can think of to win will work if you put in the time to play up the strengths and cover your rear for the weaknesses.  The galaxy is yours to conquer.			"
